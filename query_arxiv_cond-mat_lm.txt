Title: Entropy of small subsystems in thermalizing systems
Authors: Yichen Huang
Abstract: We study the entropy of small subsystems in thermalizing quantum many-body systems governed by local Hamiltonians. Assuming the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, we derive an analytical formula for the von Neumann entropy of equilibrated subsystems. This formula reveals how subsystem entropy depends on the microscopic parameters of the Hamiltonian and the macroscopic properties of the initial state. Furthermore, our results provide a theoretical explanation for recent numerical findings by Maceira and Läuchli, obtained via exact diagonalization.

Title: Active particles in moving traps: minimum work protocols and information efficiency of work extraction
Authors: Janik Schüttler, Rosalba Garcia-Millan, Michael E. Cates, Sarah A. M. Loos
Abstract: We revisit the fundamental problem of moving a particle in a harmonic trap in finite time with minimal work cost, and extend it to the case of an active particle. By comparing the Gaussian case of an Active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particle and the non-Gaussian run-and-tumble particle, we establish general principles for thermodynamically optimal control of active matter beyond specific models. We show that the open-loop optimal protocols, which do not incorporate system-state information, are identical to those of passive particles but result in larger work fluctuations due to activity. In contrast, closed-loop (or feedback) control with a single (initial) measurement changes the optimal protocol and reduces the average work relative to the open-loop control for small enough measurement errors. Minimum work is achieved by particles with finite persistence time. As an application, we propose an active information engine which extracts work from self-propulsion. This periodic engine achieves higher information efficiency with run-and-tumble particles than with active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles. Complementing a companion paper that gives only the main results [arXiv:2407.18542], here we provide a full account of our theoretical calculations and simulation results. We include derivations of optimal protocols, work variance, impact of measurement uncertainty, and information-acquisition costs.

Title: Probability Distributions of the order parameter of the Ising Model at two loops
Authors: Sankarshan Sahu
Abstract: There exists an entire family of universal PDFs of the magnetization mode of the three dimensional Ising model parameterized by $\zeta = \lim_{L,\xi_{\infty}}L/\xi_{\infty}$ which is the ratio of the system size $L$ to the bulk correlation length $\xi_{\infty}$ with both the thermodynamic limit and the critical limit being taken simultaneously at fixed $\zeta$. Recently, the probability distribution functions (PDFs) of the magnetization mode of the three-dimensional Ising model has been computed at one-loop in the $\epsilon=4-d$ expansion [arXiv preprint arXiv:2407.12603 (2024)]. We show how these PDFs or, equivalently, the rate functions which are their logarithm, can be systematically computed at second order of the perturbative expansion. We compute the whole family of universal rate-functions and show that their agreement with the Monte Carlo data improves significantly at this order when compared to their one-loop counterpart.

Abstract: We present recommendations for how to improve reproducibility in the field of condensed matter physics. This area of physics has consistently produced both fundamental insights into the functioning of matter as well as transformative inventions. Our recommendations result from a collaboration that includes researchers in academia and government laboratories, scientific journalists, legal professionals, representatives of publishers, professional societies, and other experts. The group met in person in May 2024 at a conference at the University of Pittsburgh to discuss the growing challenges related to research reproducibility in condensed matter physics. We discuss best practices and policies at all stages of the scientific process to safeguard the value condensed matter research brings to society. We look forward to comments and suggestions, especially regarding subfield-specific recommendations, and will incorporate them into the next version of the report.

Title: From non-equilibrium Green functions to Lattice Wigner: A toy model for quantum nanofluidics simulations
Authors: S. Succi, M. Lauricella, A. Tiribocchi
Abstract: Recent experiments of fluid transport in nano-channels have shown evidence of a dramatic reduction of friction due to the coupling between charge-fluctuations in polar fluids and electronic excitations in graphene solids, a phenomenon dubbed "negative quantum friction". In this paper, we present a semi-classical mesoscale Boltzmann-Wigner lattice kinetic model of quantum-nanoscale transport and perform a numerical study of the effects of the quantum interactions on the evolution of a one-dimensional nano-fluid subject to a periodic external potential. It is shown that the effects of quantum fluctuations become visible once the quantum length scale (Fermi wavelength) of the quasiparticles becomes comparable to the wavelength of the external potential. Under such conditions, quantum fluctuations are mostly felt on the odd kinetic moments, while the even ones remain nearly unaffected because they are "protected" by thermal fluctuations. It is hoped that the present Boltzmann-Wigner lattice model and extensions thereof may offer a useful tool for the computer simulation of quantum-nanofluidic transport phenomena.

Title: Classical Information Exchange Between Particles
Authors: Miles Miller-Dickson, Christopher Rose
Abstract: The flow of information within many-body systems is a fundamental feature of physical interaction. Given an underlying classical physics model for the interaction between a particle and its environment, we give meaning to and quantify the information passed between them over time. We show that the maximum information exchange rate is proportional to the ratio of inter-particle energy flow and initial particle energy -- a sort of signal-to-noise ratio. In addition, a single time-point (as opposed to trajectory) observability relation emerges.

Title: Exploring the accuracy of the equation-of-motion coupled-cluster band gap of solids
Authors: Evgeny Moerman, Henrique Miranda, Alejandro Gallo, Andreas Irmler, Tobias Schäfer, Felix Hummel, Manuel Engel, Georg Kresse, Matthias Scheffler, Andreas Grüneis
Abstract: While the periodic equation-of-motion coupled-cluster (EOM-CC) method promises systematic improvement of electronic band gap calculations in solids, its practical application at the singles and doubles level (EOM-CCSD) is hindered by severe finite-size errors in feasible simulation cells. We present a hybrid approach combining EOM-CCSD with the computationally efficient $GW$ approximation to estimate thermodynamic limit band gaps for several insulators and semiconductors. Our method substantially reduces required cell sizes while maintaining accuracy. Comparisons with experimental gaps and self-consistent $GW$ calculations reveal that deviations in EOM-CCSD predictions correlate with reduced single excitation character of the excited many-electron states. Our work not only provides a computationally tractable approach to EOM-CC calculations in solids but also reveals fundamental insights into the role of single excitations in electronic-structure theory.

Title: Quantum Phase Transitions between Symmetry-Enriched Fracton Phases
Authors: Julian Boesl, Yu-Jie Liu, Wen-Tao Xu, Frank Pollmann, Michael Knap
Abstract: Phases with topological order exhibit further complexity in the presence of global symmetries: States with the same topological order are distinguished by how their anyonic excitations transform under these symmetries, leading to a classification in terms of symmetry-enriched topological phases. In this work, we develop a generic scheme to study an analogous situation for three-dimensional fracton phases by means of isometric tensor network states (isoTNS) with finite bond dimension, which allow us to tune between wavefunctions of different symmetry fractionalization. We focus on the X-Cube model, a paradigmatic fracton model hosting two types of excitations: lineons, which are mobile in a single direction only, and fractons that are completely immobile as individual particles. By deforming the local tensors that describe the ground state of the fixed point model, we find a family of exact wavefunctions for which the symmetry fractionalization under an anti-unitary symmetry on both types of excitations is directly visible. These wavefunctions have non-vanishing correlation lengths and are non-stabilizer states. At the critical points between the phases, power-law correlations are supported in certain spatial directions. Furthermore, based on the isoTNS description of the wavefunction, we determine a linear-depth quantum circuit to sequentially realize these states on a quantum processor, including a holographic scheme for which a pair of two-dimensional qubit arrays suffices to encode the three-dimensional state using measurements. Our approach provides a construction to enrich phases with exotic topological or fracton order based on the language of tensor networks and offers a tractable route to implement and characterize fracton order with quantum processors.

Title: Unconventional high-temperature excitonic insulators in two-dimensional topological materials
Authors: L. Maisel Licerán, H. T. C. Stoof
Abstract: Bound electron-hole pairs in semiconductors known as excitons can form a coherent state at low temperatures akin to a BCS condensate. The resulting phase is known as the excitonic insulator and has superfluid properties. Here we theoretically study the excitonic insulator in a pair of recently proposed two-dimensional candidate materials with nontrivial band topology. Contrary to previous works, we include interaction channels that violate the individual electron and hole number conservations. These are on equal footing with the number-conserving processes due to the substantial overlap of Wannier orbitals of different bands, which cannot be exponentially localized due to the nontrivial Chern numbers of the latter. Their inclusion is crucial to determine the symmetry of the electron-hole pairing, and by performing mean-field calculations at nonzero temperatures we find that the order parameter is a chiral $d$-wave. We discuss the nontrivial topology of this unconventional state and analyze its superfluid properties. In particular, we estimate BKT temperatures between 75 K and 100 K on realistic substrates, over an order of magnitude larger than in the number-conserving approximation where $s$-wave pairing is favored. Our results highlight the interplay between topology at the single-particle level and long-range interactions, motivating further research in systems where both phenomena coexist.

Title: Pressure induced enhancement of polar distortions in a metal, and implications on the Rashba spin-splitting
Authors: Evie Ladbrook, Urmimala Dey, Nicholas C. Bristowe, Robin S. Perry, Dominik Daisenberger, Mark R. Warren, Mark S. Senn
Abstract: Polar metals are an intriguing class of materials in which electric polarisation and metallicity can coexist within a single phase. The unique properties of polar metals challenge expectations, making way for the exploration of exotic phenomena such as unconventional magnetism, hyperferroelectric multiferroicity and developing multifunctional devices that can leverage both the materials electric polarization and its asymmetry in the spin conductivity, that arises due to the Rashba effect. Here, via a high pressure single crystal diffraction study, we report the pressure-induced enhancement of polar distortions in such a metal, Ca$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$. Our DFT calculations highlight that naive assumptions about the linear dependency between polar distortion amplitudes and the magnitude of the Rashba spin splitting may not be generally valid.

Title: Mitigation of Delamination of Epitaxial Large-Area Boron Nitride for Semiconductor Processing
Authors: Jakub Rogoza, Jakub Iwanski, Katarzyna Ludwiczak, Bartosz Furtak, Aleksandra Krystyna Dabrowska, Mateusz Tokarczyk, Johannes Binder, Andrzej Wysmolek
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is a promising material for next-generation semiconductor and optoelectronic devices due to its wide bandgap and remarkable optical properties. To apply this material in the semiconductor industry, it is necessary to grow large-area layers on the wafer-scale. For this purpose, chemical vapor deposition methods are highly preferable. However, in the case of epitaxial BN, its fragility and susceptibility to delamination and fold formation during wet processing, such as lithography, present significant challenges to its integration into device fabrication. In this work, we introduce a controlled delamination and redeposition method that effectively prevents the layer from degradation, allowing for multi-step lithographic processes. This approach is applicable to BN layers across a broad thickness range, from tens to hundreds of nanometers, and ensures compatibility with standard photolithographic techniques without compromising the material's intrinsic properties. By addressing key processing challenges, this method paves the way for integrating epitaxial BN into advanced semiconductor and optoelectronic technologies.

Title: Subharmonic spin correlations and spectral pairing in Floquet time crystals
Authors: Alexander-Georg Penner, Harald Schmid, Leonid I. Glazman, Felix von Oppen
Abstract: Floquet time crystals are characterized by subharmonic behavior of temporal correlation functions. Studying the paradigmatic time crystal based on the disordered Floquet quantum Ising model, we show that its temporal spin correlations are directly related to spectral characteristics and that this relation provides analytical expressions for the correlation function of finite chains, which compare favorably with numerical simulations. Specifically, we show that the disorder-averaged temporal spin correlations are proportional to the Fourier transform of the splitting distribution of the pairs of eigenvalues of the Floquet operator, which differ by $\pi$ to exponential accuracy in the chain length. We find that the splittings are well described by a log-normal distribution, implying that the temporal spin correlations are characterized by two parameters. We discuss possible implications for the phase diagram of the Floquet time crystals.

Title: Physics-informed Neural Model Predictive Control of Interacting Active Brownian Particles
Authors: Titus Quah, Sho C. Takatori, James B. Rawlings
Abstract: Active matter systems, composed of self-propelled agents that convert energy into directed motion, exhibit a wide range of emergent behaviors, such as motility-induced phase separation, flocking, and swarming. These phenomena, observed across natural and engineered systems, hold immense potential for applications in programmable materials, directed assembly, and micro-robotics. However, precisely controlling their macroscopic continuum fields, e.g., density or flux, remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of multibody interactions and correlated particle dynamics. To address this challenge, we present a framework that combines physics-informed machine learning with Model Predictive Control. Our approach learns a closure model for complex particle interactions while incorporating known physical principles, resulting in an accurate predictive model suitable for real-time control. By integrating this model into a Model Predictive Control framework, we enable systematic optimization of control actions that can guide the system toward desired macroscopic behaviors. Through two illustrative examples, we showcase the versatility of the framework. First, we control the spatial distribution of particles by splitting them into two groups and dynamically juggling their densities. Second, we simultaneously control both the number density and the mean flux, guiding the latter to follow a prescribed sinusoidal profile. These results highlight the framework's potential to systematically control complex dynamics in active matter systems and provide a foundation for broader applications in programmable and adaptive materials.

Title: BARCODE: Biomaterial Activity Readouts to Categorize, Optimize, Design and Engineer for high throughput screening and characterization of dynamically restructuring soft materials
Authors: Qiaopeng Chen, Aditya Sriram, Ayan Das, Katarina Matic, Maya Hendija, Keegan Tonry, Jennifer L. Ross, Moumita Das, Ryan J. McGorty, Rae M. Robertson-Anderson, Megan T. Valentine
Abstract: Active, responsive, nonequilibrium materials, at the forefront of materials engineering, offer dynamical restructuring, mobility and other complex life-like properties. Yet, this enhanced functionality comes with significant amplification of the size and complexity of the datasets needed to characterize their properties, thereby challenging conventional approaches to analysis. To meet this need, we present BARCODE (Biomaterial Activity Readouts to Categorize, Optimize, Design and Engineer), an open-access software that automates high throughput screening of microscopy video data to enable nonequilibrium material optimization and discovery. BARCODE produces a unique fingerprint or barcode of performance metrics that visually and quantitatively encodes dynamic material properties with minimal file size. Using three complementary material agnostic analysis branches, BARCODE significantly reduces data dimensionality and size, while providing rich, multiparametric outputs and rapid tractable characterization of activity and structure. We analyze a series of datasets of cytoskeleton networks and cell monolayers to demonstrate the ability of BARCODE to accelerate and streamline screening and analysis, reveal unexpected correlations and emergence, and enable broad non-expert data access, comparison, and sharing.

Title: Topological Transitions, Pinning and Ratchets for Driven Magnetic Hopfions in Nanostructures
Authors: J. C. Bellizotti Souza, C. J. O. Reichhardt, C. Reichhardt, A. Saxena, N. P. Vizarim, P. A. Venegas
Abstract: Using atomistic simulations, we examine the dynamics of three-dimensional magnetic hopfions interacting with an array of line defects or posts as a function of defect spacing, defect strength, and current. We find a pinned phase, a sliding phase where a hopfion can move through the posts or hurdles by distorting, and a regime where the hopfion becomes compressed and transforms into a toron that is half the size of the hopfion and moves at a lower velocity. The toron states occur when the defects are strong; however, in the toron regime, it is possible to stabilize sliding hopfions by increasing the applied current. Hopfions move without a Hall angle, while the toron moves with a finite Hall angle. We also show that when a hopfion interacts with an asymmetric array of planar defects, a ratchet effect consisting of a net dc motion can be realized under purely ac driving.

Title: Universal Efimov Scaling in the Rabi-Coupled Few-Body Spectrum
Authors: Anthony N. Zulli, Brendan C. Mulkerin, Meera M. Parish, Jesper Levinsen
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of the Efimov effect -- a universal quantum few-body phenomenon -- in the presence of an external driving field. Specifically, we consider up to three bosonic atoms, such as $^{133}$Cs, interacting with a light atom, such as $^{6}$Li, where the latter has two internal spin states $\{\uparrow, \downarrow\}$ that are Rabi coupled. Assuming that only the spin-$\uparrow$ light atom interacts with the bosons, we find that the Rabi drive transposes the entire Efimov spectrum such that the Efimov trimers and tetramers are centered around the Rabi-shifted two-body scattering resonance. Crucially, we show that the Rabi drive preserves the trimers' discrete scaling symmetry, while universally shifting the Efimov three-body parameter, leading to a log-periodic modulation in the spectrum as the Rabi drive is varied. Our results suggest that Efimov physics can be conveniently explored using an applied driving field, opening up the prospect of an externally tunable three-body parameter.

Title: Programmable Synthetic Magnetism and Chiral Edge States in Nano-Optomechanical Quantum Hall Networks
Authors: Jesse J. Slim, Javier del Pino, Ewold Verhagen
Abstract: Artificial magnetic fields break time-reversal symmetry in engineered materials--also known as metamaterials, enabling robust, topological transport of neutral excitations, much like electronic conduction edge channels in the integer quantum Hall effect. We experimentally demonstrate the emergence of quantum-Hall-like chiral edge states in optomechanical resonator networks. Synthetic magnetic fields for phononic excitations are induced through laser drives, while cavity optomechanical control allows full reconfigurability of the effective metamaterial response of the networks, including programming of magnetic fluxes in multiple resonator plaquettes. By tuning the interplay between network connectivity and magnetic fields, we demonstrate both flux-sensitive and flux-insensitive localized mechanical states. Scaling up the system creates spectral features that are precursors to Hofstadter butterfly spectra. Site-resolved spectroscopy reveals edge-bulk separation, with stationary phononic distributions signaling chiral edge modes. We directly probe those edge modes in transport measurements to demonstrate a unidirectional acoustic channel. This work unlocks new ways of controlling topological phononic phases at the nanoscale with applications in noise management and information processing.

Title: Direct Visualization of an Incommensurate Unidirectional Charge Density Wave in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$
Authors: Mingzhe Li, Jiashuo Gong, Yinghao Zhu, Ziyuan Chen, Jiakang Zhang, Enkang Zhang, Yuanji Li, Ruotong Yin, Shiyuan Wang, Jun Zhao, Dong-Lai Feng, Zengyi Du, Ya-Jun Yan
Abstract: Superconductivity emerges in both La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ under high pressure by suppressing their density-wave transitions, but critical temperature (Tc) differs significantly between these two compounds. To gain deeper insights into the distinct superconducting states, it is essential to unravel the nature of the density-wave states at ambient pressure, a topic that remains largely unexplored. Here, using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS), we report the direct visualization of an incommensurate unidirectional charge density wave (CDW) in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ in real space. The density of states (DOS) is strongly depleted near $E_F$, indicating the opening of a CDW gap of $2{\Delta} \approx 71$ meV, which is unfavorable for the formation of superconductivity at ambient pressure. We propose that the CDW arises from Fermi surface nesting, and is likely a subsidiary phase of a spin density wave. Compared to La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, the weaker electronic correlation in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ is likely one reason for the lower $T_c$.

Title: Effects of GaAs Buffer Layer on Structural, Magnetic, and Transport Properties of Magnetic Topological Insulators Cr$_y$(Bi$_x$Sb$_{1-x}$)$_{2-y}$Te$_3$ and V$_y$(Bi$_x$Sb$_{1-x}$)$_{2-y}$Te$_3$ Films
Authors: Yusuke Nakazawa, Takafumi Akiho, Kiyoshi Kanisawa, Hiroshi Irie, Norio Kumada, Koji Muraki
Abstract: Here, we study the effects of a GaAs buffer layer on the structural, magnetic, and transport properties of Cr$_y$(Bi$_x$Sb$_{1-x}$)$_{2-y}$Te$_3$ magnetic topological insulator thin films and compare them with those of V$_y$(Bi$_x$Sb$_{1-x}$)$_{2-y}$Te$_3$, which we recently reported. Similar to the case of V$_y$(Bi$_x$Sb$_{1-x}$)$_{2-y}$Te$_3$, growth on a GaAs buffer layer leads to some distinctly different properties than direct growth on InP substrates. These include improved interface quality confirmed by transmission electron microscopy, enhanced magnetic coercive fields, and smaller resistivity peaks at the magnetization reversals. Furthermore, the Bi-ratio dependence of the carrier density reveals that the interface property also affects the Fermi level. These results demonstrate the importance of the buffer layer in controlling the electronic properties of the magnetic topological insulator films.

Title: Electrical conductivity of conductive films based on random metallic nanowire networks
Authors: Yuri Yu. Tarasevich, Andrei V. Eserkepov, Irina V. Vodolazskaya
Abstract: Using computer simulation, we investigated the dependence of the electrical conductivity of random two-dimensional systems of straight nanowires on the main parameters. Both the resistance of the conductors and the resistance of the contacts between them were taken into account. The dependence of the resistance, $R$, between network nodes on the distance between nodes, $r$, is $R(r) = R_\Box/\pi \ln r + \mathrm{const}$, where $R_\Box$ is the sheet resistance.

Title: Synthesis of spherical mesoporous silica beads with tunable size, stiffness and porosity
Authors: M. Milani, K. Ahmad, E. Cavalletti, C. Ligoure, L. Cipelletti, M. Kongkaew, P. Trens, L. Ramos
Abstract: We present an innovative template-free water-based sol-gel method to produce uniform mesoporous silica beads of millimeter size, which have tunable size, stiffness and porosity, and could be used for adsorption applications. Our protocol exploits an in-situ enzymatic reaction to produce spherical beads of hydrogel from a charge-stabilized suspension of silica nanoparticles confined in a millimetric drop suspended in a non-miscible oil. Once the gelation step is complete, the spherical bead of gel is cleaned from oil and deposited onto a hydrophobic surface and let dry. Separating the gelation to the drying steps ensures a spatially uniform gel and allows us to perform a solvent exchange before drying. For all beads, we observe a crack-free drying process leading to the formation of stiff quasi-spherical beads with diameter in the range 1 to 5 mm and Young modulus in the range $(0.1-2)$ GPa and narrow pore size distribution, centered around $10$ to $25$ nm depending on the experimental conditions. Finally, to demonstrate the potentiality of these materials, we graft on the bead surface aminosilane molecules, and quantify their CO$_2$ adsorption efficiency. Overall, the production method we have developed is simple, readily adaptable, and offers promising materials for adsorption, storage, catalysis and chromatography.

Title: Magnetizing weak links by time-dependent spin-orbit interactions: momentum conserving and non-conserving processes
Authors: Debashree Chowdhury, O. Entin-Wohlman, A. Aharony, R. I. Shekhter, M. Jonson
Abstract: Rashba spin-orbit interactions generated by time-dependent electric fields acting on weak links (that couple together non-magnetic macroscopic leads) can magnetize the junction. The Rashba spin-orbit interaction that affects the spins of electrons tunneling through the weak links changes their momentum concomitantly. We establish the connection between the magnetization flux induced by processes that conserve the momentum and the magnetization created by tunneling events that do not. Control of the induced magnetization can be achieved by tuning the polarization of the AC electric field responsible for the spin-orbit Rashba interaction (e.g., from being circular to linear), by changing the applied bias voltage, and by varying the degree of a gate voltage-induced asymmetry of the device.

Title: Electrically Tunable Picosecond-scale Octupole Fluctuations in Chiral Antiferromagnets
Authors: Shiva T. Konakanchi, Sagnik Banerjee, Mohammad M. Rahman, Yuta Yamane, Shun Kanai, Shunsuke Fukami, Pramey Upadhyaya
Abstract: We present a theory for the relaxation time of the octupole order parameter in nanoscale chiral antiferromagnets (AFMs) coupled to thermal baths and spin injection sources. Using stochastic spin dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that the octupole moment relaxes through two distinct mechanisms$-$escape over a barrier and precessional dephasing$-$as the barrier for octupole fluctuations is lowered relative to the thermal energy. Notably, the octupole moment relaxes orders of magnitude faster than the typical dipolar order parameters, reaching picosecond timescales. By combining Langer's theory with an effective low-energy description of octupole dynamics in chiral AFMs, we derive analytical expressions for the relaxation times. We find that relaxation in chiral AFMs parallels dipole relaxation in XY magnets, with exchange fields serving the role of the dipole fields. Further, by drawing on the analogy between order parameter dynamics in XY magnets under spin injection and current-biased Josephson junctions, we propose a new scheme for electrically tuning the octupole relaxation times. Our work offers fundamental insights for the development of next-generation spintronic devices that harness octupole order parameters for information encoding, especially in octupole-based probabilistic computing.

Title: Emergence of Topological Non-Fermi Liquid Phases in a Modified Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Chain with Long-Range Interactions
Authors: Sepide Mohamadi, Jahanfar Abouie
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the emergence of a topological non-Fermi liquid (NFL) phase in a modified Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain model subjected to long-range interactions characterized by the Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) model. While Fermi liquid theory has been instrumental in understanding low temperature properties of metals, it fails to account for the complex behaviors exhibited by strongly correlated systems, where interactions lead to emergent phenomena such as non-Fermi liquid behavior. Our analysis reveals that the SSH-HK model supports a rich ground state phase diagram, exhibiting distinct NFL phases marked by many body Zak phases of $2\pi$ and $0$, corresponding to topological and trivial NFL states, respectively. We demonstrate that the topological NFL state manifests unique electronic polarization characteristics akin to those in the non-interacting SSH model. Through exact diagonalization of the interacting SSH-HK Hamiltonian, we explore the spectral functions and density of states, revealing significant departures from traditional quasiparticle behavior in various particle number sectors. Our findings extend the understanding of topological non-Fermi liquids and their potential implications for high-temperature superconductivity and other correlated electron systems, highlighting the intricate interplay between topology and strong electron correlations.

Title: Impact of Nanoscopic Impurity Aggregates on Cavitation in Water
Authors: Marin Šako, Roland R. Netz, Matej Kanduč
Abstract: The stability of water against cavitation under negative pressures is a phenomenon known for considerable discrepancies between theoretical predictions and experimental observations. Using a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and classical nucleation theory, we explore how nanoscopic hydrocarbon droplets influence cavitation in water. Our findings reveal that while a macroscopic volume of absolutely pure water withstands up to -120 MPa of tension, introducing a single nanoscopic oil droplet, merely a few nanometers in radius, brings this cavitation threshold to around -30 MPa, closely matching the values typically observed in highly controlled experiments. The unavoidable presence of nanoscopic hydrophobic impurities, even in highly purified water used in experiments, imposes a practical limit on achieving the theoretical tensile strength in realistic settings. More broadly, our study highlights the profound impact of nonpolar residues on nucleation phenomena and enhances our understanding of metastability in real-world systems.

Title: Quantum effects in surface diffusion: application to diffusion of nitrogen adatoms over GaN(0001) surface
Authors: Paweł Strak, Cyprian Sobczak, Stanislaw Krukowski
Abstract: It is shown that quantum effects play determining role in nitrogen adatom diffusion due to several different factors. This could be related to the change of the energy of the quantum states and also due to the redistribution of electrons between the quantum states, both full and resonant, via quantum statistics partially governed by the Fermi energy level. These effects were studied in the case of nitrogen diffusion over clean and gallium covered Ga-terminated GaN(0001) surface. For the fractional coverage the density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that at the saddle point configuration the redistribution of electrons between different quantum states may affect the surface diffusion barrier significantly. The other quantum influence occurs via the change of the minimal energy configuration. Under fractional Ga coverage of GaN(0001) surface the nitrogen diffusion energy barrier proceeds from the resonant states governed energy minimal H3 site across the saddle point in the bridge configuration. At this path the barrier is affected the electron redistribution between surface quantum states both in the initial and the saddle point. In the case of the full GaN coverage the diffusion path is from on-top N adatom configuration via H3 site that corresponds to maximal energy. Therefore the diffusion barrier is Ebar= 1.18 eV for clean and Ebar= 0.92 eV for (1/6) ML to finally Ebar= 1.23 eV for full Ga coverage. Thus the overall barrier is reduced to Ebar= 0.92 eV due to quantum statistics effects. The identified stable N on-top configuration for the full coverage is essential for atomic mechanism of GaN growth in Ga-rich regime.

Title: Learning the Hamiltonian Matrix of Large Atomic Systems
Authors: Chen Hao Xia, Manasa Kaniselvan, Alexandros Nikolaos Ziogas, Marko Mladenović, Rayen Mahjoub, Alexander Maeder, Mathieu Luisier
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promise in learning the ground-state electronic properties of materials, subverting ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations when the underlying lattices can be represented as small and/or repeatable unit cells (i.e., molecules and periodic crystals). Realistic systems are, however, non-ideal and generally characterized by higher structural complexity. As such, they require large (10+ Angstroms) unit cells and thousands of atoms to be accurately described. At these scales, DFT becomes computationally prohibitive, making GNNs especially attractive. In this work, we present a strictly local equivariant GNN capable of learning the electronic Hamiltonian (H) of realistically extended materials. It incorporates an augmented partitioning approach that enables training on arbitrarily large structures while preserving local atomic environments beyond boundaries. We demonstrate its capabilities by predicting the electronic Hamiltonian of various systems with up to 3,000 nodes (atoms), 500,000+ edges, ~28 million orbital interactions (nonzero entries of H), and $\leq$0.55% error in the eigenvalue spectra. Our work expands the applicability of current electronic property prediction methods to some of the most challenging cases encountered in computational materials science, namely systems with disorder, interfaces, and defects.

Title: Towards numerically exact computation of conductivity in the thermodynamic limit of interacting lattice models

Abstract: Computing dynamical response functions in interacting lattice models is a long standing challenge in condensed matter physics. In view of recent results, the dc resistivity $\rho_\mathrm{dc}$ in the weak coupling regime of the Hubbard model is of great interest, yet it is not fully understood. The challenge lies in having to work with large lattices while avoiding analytical continuation. The weak-coupling $\rho_\mathrm{dc}$ results were so far computed at the level of the Boltzmann theory and at the level of the Kubo bubble approximation, which neglects vertex corrections. Neither theory was so far rigorously proven to give exact results even at infinitesimal coupling, and the respective dc resistivity results differ greatly. In this work we develop, cross-check and apply two state-of-the-art methods for obtaining dynamical response functions. We compute the optical conductivity at weak coupling in the Hubbard model in a fully controlled way, in the thermodynamic limit and without analytical continuation. We show that vertex corrections persist to infinitesimal coupling, with a constant ratio to the Kubo bubble. We connect our methods with the Boltzmann theory, and show that the latter applies additional approximations, which lead to quantitatively incorrect scaling of $\rho_\mathrm{dc}$ with respect to the coupling constant.

Title: Optimal constrained control for generally damped Brownian heat engines
Authors: Monojit Chatterjee, Viktor Holubec, Rahul Marathe
Abstract: We investigate maximum power and efficiency protocols for cyclic heat engines based on a generally damped Brownian particle confined in a harmonic potential, subject to experimentally motivated constraints on the potential stiffness and bath temperature. These constraints render traditional geometric and mass transport methods inapplicable, as they rely on fixed control or response parameters at specific points in the cycle. Instead, we develop an iterative algorithm grounded in optimal control theory, enabling simultaneous optimization of cycle time and the time-dependent variations of stiffness and temperature. We validate the algorithm against analytical results in the deeply overdamped regime and extend its application to systems with general damping rates. As the damping rate decreases from a deeply overdamped to a deeply underdamped regime, the maximum power diminishes to zero, and the corresponding cycle time diverges. For a fixed cycle time, the maximum efficiency exhibits a comparable trend. In the generally damped regime, the stiffness and temperature protocols display intricate, non-monotonic features, in stark contrast to the simpler patterns observed in extreme damping limits. Furthermore, optimizing the temperature profile significantly enhances efficiency, particularly in intermediate damping regimes. Our findings demonstrate how experimental constraints fundamentally influence optimal control protocols.

Title: Fractons from covariant higher-rank 3D BF theory
Authors: Erica Bertolini, Alberto Blasi, Matteo Carrega, Nicola Maggiore, Daniel Sacco Shaikh
Abstract: In this paper we study the 3D gauge theory of two tensor gauge fields: $a_{\mu\nu}(x)$, which we take symmetric, and $B_{\mu\nu}(x)$, with no symmetry on its indices. The corresponding invariant action is a higher-rank BF-like model, which is first considered from a purely field theoretical point of view, and the propagators with their poles and the degrees of freedom are studied. Once matter is introduced, a fracton behaviour naturally emerges. We show that our theory can be mapped to the low-energy effective field theory describing the Rank-2 Toric Code (R2TC). This relation between our covariant BF-like theory and the R2TC is a higher-rank generalization of the equivalence between the ordinary 3D BF theory and the Kitaev's Toric Code. In the last part of the paper we analyze the case in which the field $B_{\mu\nu}(x)$ is a symmetric tensor. It turns out that the obtained BF-like action can be cast into the sum of two rank-2 Chern-Simons actions, thus generalizing the ordinary abelian case. Therefore, this represents a higher-rank generalization of the ordinary 3D BF theory, which well describes the low-energy physics of quantum spin Hall insulators in two spatial dimensions.

Title: In-operando test of tunable Heusler alloys for thermomagnetic harvesting of low-grade waste heat
Authors: F. Cugini, L. Gallo, G. Garulli, D. Olivieri, G. Trevisi, S. Fabbrici, F. Albertini, M. Solzi
Abstract: Thermomagnetic generation stands out as a promising technology for harvesting and converting low-grade waste heat below 100 °C. Despite the exponential growth in research on thermomagnetic materials and prototypes over the last decade, there remains, to unlock the full potential of this technology, a critical gap between fundamental research on materials and the design of advanced devices. In this study, we present the in-operando assessment of thermomagnetic performance of three representative Ni,Mn-based Heusler alloys optimized for harvesting low-grade waste heat below 373 K. These materials were tested under operational conditions using a specially designed laboratory-scale prototype of a thermomagnetic motor. The mechanical power output of the motor, operated with NiMnIn, NiMnSn and NiMnCuGa alloys, was correlated with the magnetic properties of the materials, highlighting the critical role of the magnetic transition temperature and saturation magnetization in determining the efficiency of thermomagnetic energy conversion. Austenitic Heusler alloys were confirmed to be promising thermomagnetic materials due to their highly tunable Curie temperature and significant magnetization changes in the 300-360 K temperature range. Among the tested materials, the Ni48Mn36In16 alloy demonstrated the highest thermomagnetic performance, surpassing the benchmark material Gd in the 320-340 K range. From an experimental perspective, the developed prototype of thermomagnetic motor serves as a flexible test-bench for evaluating and comparing the thermomagnetic performance of small amounts (less than 0.3 g) of new materials under variable conditions. Additionally, its modular design facilitates testing and optimization of its various components, thereby contributing to the advancement of thermomagnetic motor technology.

Title: Signatures of Non-Abelian Kitaev quantum spin liquids in noise magnetormetry
Authors: Xiao Xiao, Masahiro O. Takahashi, Paul Stevenson, Satoshi Fujimoto, Arun Bansil
Abstract: Identification of isolated Majorana zero modes (MZMs) is a key step towards the realization of fault-tolerant topological quantum computation. Here we show how the $T_1$-based noise magnetormetry of a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center qubit can reveal the unique signatures of Majorana fermions attached to vacancies in a non-Abelian Kitaev quantum spin liquid (KQSL). The $1/T_1$ of the NV center is found to be increased significantly when the working frequency of the NV center matches the energy difference between a MZM and a low-energy hybridized mode involving dangling Majorana fermions adjacent to vacancies. In experiments, this energy difference can be tuned by an external Zeeman field. Because of the large excitation gap of flipping a local $Z_2$ gauge field, the $1/T_1$ spectrum is robust against other fluctuations in KQSLs. Our study presents a promising pathway for identifying the non-Abelian phase in Kitaev materials.

Abstract: The resistance of a heavy metal can be modulated by an adjacent magnetic material through the combined effects of the spin Hall effect, inverse spin Hall effect, and dissipation of the spin accumulation at the interface. This phenomenon is known as spin Hall magnetoresistance. The dissipation of the spin accumulation can occur via various mechanisms, with spin-transfer torque being the most extensively studied. In this work, we report the observation of spin Hall magnetoresistance at the interface between platinum and an insulating altermagnetic candidate, Ba$_2$CoGe$_2$O$_7$. Our findings reveal that this heterostructure exhibits a relatively large spin Hall magnetoresistance signal, which is anisotropic with respect to the crystal orientation of the current channel. We explore and rule out several potential explanations for this anisotropy and propose that our results may be understood in the context of the anisotropic altermagnetic ordering of Ba$_2$CoGe$_2$O$_7$.

Title: Correlations drive the attosecond response of strongly-correlated insulators
Authors: Romain Cazali, Amina Alic, Matthieu Guer, Christopher J. Kaplan, Fabien Lepetit, Olivier Tcherbakoff, Stéphane Guizard, Angel Rubio, Nicolas Tancogne-Dejean, Gheorghe S. Chiuzbăian, Romain Géneaux
Abstract: Attosecond spectroscopy of materials has provided invaluable insight into light-driven coherent electron dynamics. However, attosecond spectroscopies have so far been focused on weakly-correlated materials. As a result, the behavior of strongly-correlated systems is largely unknown at sub- to few-femtosecond timescales, even though it is typically the realm at which electron-electron interactions operate. Here we conduct attosecond-resolved experiments on the correlated insulator nickel oxide, and compare its response to a common band insulator, revealing fundamentally different behaviors. The results, together with state-of-the art time-dependent $\textit{ab initio}$ calculations, show that the correlated system response is governed by a laser-driven quench of electron correlations. The evolution of the on-site electronic interaction is measured here at its natural timescale, marking the first direct measurement of Hubbard $U$ renormalization in NiO. It is found to take place within a few femtoseconds, after which structural changes slowly start to take place. The resulting picture sheds light on the entire light-induced response of a strongly-correlated system, from attosecond to long-lived effects.

Title: Hydrodynamic attractor in periodically driven ultracold quantum gases
Authors: Aleksas Mazeliauskas, Tilman Enss
Abstract: Hydrodynamic attractors are a universal phenomenon of strongly interacting systems that describe the hydrodynamic-like evolution far from local equilibrium. In particular, the rapid hydrodynamization of the Quark-Gluon Plasma is behind the remarkable success of hydrodynamic models of high-energy nuclear collisions. So far, hydrodynamic attractors have been explored only in systems undergoing monotonic expansion, such as Bjorken flow. We demonstrate that a system with an oscillating isotropic expansion exhibits a novel cyclic attractor behavior. This phenomenon can be investigated in ultracold quantum gases with externally modulated scattering length, offering a new avenue for experimentally discovering hydrodynamic attractors.

Preston
Abstract: We report on results from an experiment at the European XFEL where we measured the x-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) spectrum of single crystal silicon with ultrahigh resolution. Compared to similar previous experiments, we consider a more complex scattering setup, in which the scattering vector changes orientation through the crystal lattice. In doing so, we are able to observe strong geometric dependencies in the inelastic scattering spectrum of silicon at low scattering angles. Furthermore, the high quality of the experimental data allows us to benchmark state-of-the-art TDDFT calculations, and demonstrate TDDFT's ability to accurately predict these geometric dependencies. Finally, we note that this experimental data was collected at a much faster rate than another recently reported dataset using the same setup, demonstrating that ultrahigh resolution XRTS data can be collected in more general experimental scenarios.

Title: Top eigenvalue statistics of diluted Wishart matrices
Authors: Barak Budnick, Preben Forer, Pierpaolo Vivo, Sabrina Aufiero, Silvia Bartolucci, Fabio Caccioli
Abstract: Using the replica method, we compute analytically the average largest eigenvalue of diluted covariance matrices of the form $\mathbf{J} = \mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{X}$, where $\mathbf{X}$ is a $N\times M$ sparse data matrix, in the limit of large $N,M$ with fixed ratio. We allow for random non-zero weights, provided they lead to an isolated largest eigenvalue. By formulating the problem as the optimisation of a quadratic Hamiltonian constrained to the $N$-sphere at low temperatures, we derive a set of recursive distributional equations for auxiliary probability density functions, which can be efficiently solved using a population dynamics algorithm. The average largest eigenvalue is identified with a Lagrange parameter that governs the convergence of the algorithm. We find excellent agreement between our analytical results and numerical results obtained from direct diagonalisation.

Title: Statistical Physics of Deep Neural Networks: Generalization Capability, Beyond the Infinite Width, and Feature Learning
Authors: Sebastiano Ariosto
Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) excel at many tasks, often rivaling or surpassing human performance. Yet their internal processes remain elusive, frequently described as "black boxes." While performance can be refined experimentally, achieving a fundamental grasp of their inner workings is still a challenge. Statistical Mechanics has long tackled computational problems, and this thesis applies physics-based insights to understand DNNs via three complementary approaches. First, by averaging over data, we derive an asymptotic bound on generalization that depends solely on the size of the last layer, rather than on the total number of parameters -- revealing how deep architectures process information differently across layers. Second, adopting a data-dependent viewpoint, we explore a finite-width thermodynamic limit beyond the infinite-width regime. This leads to: (i) a closed-form expression for the generalization error in a finite-width one-hidden-layer network (regression task); (ii) an approximate partition function for deeper architectures; and (iii) a link between deep networks in this thermodynamic limit and Student's t-processes. Finally, from a task-explicit perspective, we present a preliminary analysis of how DNNs interact with a controlled dataset, investigating whether they truly internalize its structure -- collapsing to the teacher -- or merely memorize it. By understanding when a network must learn data structure rather than just memorize, it sheds light on fostering meaningful internal representations. In essence, this thesis leverages the synergy between Statistical Physics and Machine Learning to illuminate the inner behavior of DNNs.

Title: A Metal-Insulator Transition of the Buried MnO2 Monolayer in Complex Oxide Heterostructure

Abstract: Functionalities in crystalline materials are determined by 3-dimensional collective interactions of atoms. The confinement of dimensionality in condensed matter provides an exotic research direction to understand the interaction of atoms, thus can be used to tailor or create new functionalities in material systems. In this study, a 2-dimensional transition metal oxide monolayer is constructed inside complex oxide heterostructures based on the theoretical predictions. The electrostatic boundary conditions of oxide monolayer in the heterostructure is carefully designed to tune the chemical, electronic, and magnetic states of oxide monolayer. The challenge of characterizing such an oxide monolayer is overcome by a combination of transmission electron microscopy, x-ray absorption spectroscopy, cross-sectional scanning tunneling microscopy, and electrical transport measurements. An intriguing metal-insulator transition associated with a magnetic transition is discovered in the MnO2 monolayer. This study paves a new route to understand the confinement of dimensionality and explore new intriguing phenomena in condensed matters.

Title: Solid-state Synapse Based on Magnetoelectrically Coupled Memristor
Authors: Weichuan Huang, Yue-Wen Fang, Yuewei Yin, Bobo Tian, Wenbo Zhao, Chuangming Hou, Chao Ma, Qi Li, Evgeny Y. Tsymbal, Chun-Gang Duan, Xiaoguang Li
Abstract: Brain-inspired computing architectures attempt to emulate the computations performed in the neurons and the synapses in human brain. Memristors with continuously tunable resistances are ideal building blocks for artificial synapses. Through investigating the memristor behaviors in a La0.7Sr0.3MnO3/BaTiO3/La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 multiferroic tunnel junction, it was found that the ferroelectric domain dynamics characteristics are influenced by the relative magnetization alignment of the electrodes, and the interfacial spin polarization is manipulated continuously by ferroelectric domain reversal, enriching our understanding of the magnetoelectric coupling fundamentally. This creates a functionality that not only the resistance of the memristor but also the synaptic plasticity form can be further manipulated, as demonstrated by the spike-timing-dependent plasticity investigations. Density functional theory calculations are carried out to describe the obtained magnetoelectric coupling, which is probably related to the Mn-Ti intermixing at the interfaces. The multiple and controllable plasticity characteristic in a single artificial synapse, to resemble the synaptic morphological alteration property in a biological synapse, will be conducive to the development of artificial intelligence.

Title: Reactive Fluid Ferroelectrics: A Gateway to the Next Generation of Ferroelectric Liquid Crystalline Polymer Networks
Authors: Stuart R Berrow, Jordan Hobbs, Calum J Gibb
Abstract: Herein we report the first examples of reactive mesogenic materials (RMs) which exhibit fluid ferroelectric order based on the recently discovered ferroelectric nematic (NF) phase. We term these materials NF RMs and they provide the first steps towards the next generation of ferroelectric liquid crystalline polymer networks. We report the chemical synthesis and characterisation of the liquid crystalline properties of these materials, demonstrating that they have the lowest longitudinal molecular dipole moments of any reported NF material of 7.39 D. We go on to demonstrate a potential use case of this new class of reactive material through the polymer stabilisation of a matrix which exhibits the NF phase, increasing the phase range of the ferroelectric phase from 75 °C to 120 °C. The NF RMs reported herein are an exciting step forward in ferroelectric liquid crystal research, demonstrating that reactive NF materials are achievable, allowing for the future development of liquid crystalline ferroelectric networks, elastomers and polymers.

Title: Molecular details and free energy barriers of ion de-coordination at elevated salinity and pressure
Authors: Nathanael S. Schwindt, Razi Epsztein, Anthony P. Straub, Michael R. Shirts
Abstract: Ion dehydration has been shown to strongly influence separation performance in membrane systems and ion transport in nanoscale channels. It is especially important for membrane-based brine treatment, which is limited by high pressures and concentrations. However, the molecular details and drivers of ion dehydration in membranes are not well understood, in particular under relevant conditions for membrane operation. In this study, we estimated the dehydration free energies for a range of different ions at high pressure and salinity relevant to brine treatment using molecular simulation. In order to more clearly interpret these results, we developed a procedure to unambiguously estimate these free energies as a function of discrete-valued coordination number. We also proposed alternatives to the coordination number as geometrical constraints for traversing nanoscale constrictions, such as the maximum cross-sectional area of the complexed ion, and calculated the free energy of dehydration as a function of these constraints. We show that high operating pressures do not significantly change cation hydration shell stability nor the shell size, while high ionic concentrations lower the free energy barrier to reduce the cation coordination number. High concentration introduces many ion pairing events, which contribute to the lower barrier. We find that anion dehydration free energies are largely unaffected by these conditions, only showing a small increase in free energy at high pressure. We propose strategies to improve ion-ion selectivity by leveraging the effects of elevated pressure and salinity on ion dehydration.

Title: Mechanical Properties of the Meninges: Large Language Model Assisted Systematic Review of over 25,000 Studies
Authors: Brandon P. Chelstrom, Maciej P. Polak, Dane Morgan, Corinne R. Henak
Abstract: Accurate constitutive models and corresponding mechanical property values for the meninges are important for predicting mechanical damage to brain tissue due to traumatic brain injury. The meninges are often oversimplified in current finite element (FE) head models due to their complex anatomy and spatially-variant mechanical behavior. This study performed a systematic review (SR) on the mechanical properties of each individual layer of the meninges to obtain benchmark data for FE modeling and to identify gaps in the current literature. Relevant studies were filtered through three stages: a broad initial search filter, a large language model classifier, and manual verification by a human reviewer. Out of over 25,000 studies initially considered, this review ultimately included 47 studies on the dura mater, 8 on the arachnoid mater, and 7 on the pia mater, representing the largest and most comprehensive SR on the mechanical properties of the meninges. Each layer was found to exhibit nonlinear rate dependence that varies with species, age, location, and orientation. This study revealed that the elastic modulus of pia mater most often used in simplified linear elastic FE models is likely underestimated by an order of magnitude and fails to consider directional dependence. Future studies investigating the mechanical properties of the meninges should focus on a wider range of loading rates as well as age effects for the arachnoid mater and pia mater, as these features are relatively understudied and expected to affect the fidelity of FE predictions.

Title: Turbulence: A Nonequilibrium Field Theory
Authors: Mahendra Verma
Abstract: Tools of quantum and statistical field theories have ben successfully ported to turbulence. Here, we review the key results of turbulence field theory. Thermalized spectrally-truncated Euler equation is described by \textit{equilibrium field theory}, in which the equipartitioned Fourier modes generate zero energy flux. In contrast, modelling of hydrodynamic turbulence (HDT), which has small viscosity, requires \textit{nonequilibrium field theory}. In HDT, the viscosity is renormalized using field theory that leads to wavenumber-dependent viscosity and energy spectrum. Field theory calculations also yields nonzero energy flux for HDT. These field theory computations have been generalized to other systems, e.g., passive scalar and magnetohydrodynamics. In this review, we cover these aspects, along with a brief coverage of weak turbulence and intermittency.

Title: Two-site Kitaev sweet spots evolving into topological islands
Authors: Rodrigo A. Dourado, J. Carlos Egues, Poliana H. Penteado
Abstract: Artificial Kitaev chains based on arrays of quantum dots are promising platforms for realizing Majorana Bound States (MBSs). In a two-site Kitaev chain, it is possible to find these non-Abelian zero-energy excitations at certain points in parameter space (sweet spots). These states, commonly referred to as Poor man's Majorana bound states (PMMs), are challenging to find and stabilize experimentally. In this work, we investigate the evolution of the sweet spots as we increase the number of sites of the Kitaev chain. To this end, we use the Bogoliubov-de Gennes representation to study the excitations of the system, and the scattering matrix and Green functions formalisms to calculate the zero-bias conductance. Our results show that the sweet spots evolve into a region that grows bigger and becomes gradually more protected as the number of sites $N$ increases. Due to the protection of the MBSs, we refer to this region as a topological island. We obtain similar results by considering a realistic spinful model with finite magnetic fields in a chain of normal-superconducting quantum dots. For long chains, $N \geq 20$, we show the emergence of strictly zero-energy plateaus robust against disorder. Finally, we demonstrate that the topological islands can be observed by performing conductance measurements via a quantum dot side-coupled to the Kitaev chain. Our work shows that the fine-tuning required to create and detect PMMs in a 2-site Kitaev chain is significantly relaxed as the length of the chain increases and details how PMMs evolve into MBSs. Our results are consistent with experimental reports for 2 and 3-site chains.

Abstract: This study presents a machine-learning-based procedure to automate the charge tuning of semiconductor spin qubits with minimal human intervention, addressing one of the significant challenges in scaling up quantum dot technologies. This method exploits artificial neural networks to identify noisy transition lines in stability diagrams, guiding a robust exploration strategy leveraging neural networks' uncertainty estimations. Tested across three distinct offline experimental datasets representing different single quantum dot technologies, the approach achieves over 99% tuning success rate in optimal cases, where more than 10% of the success is directly attributable to uncertainty exploitation. The challenging constraints of small training sets containing high diagram-to-diagram variability allowed us to evaluate the capabilities and limits of the proposed procedure.

Title: Machine learning of microstructure--property relationships in materials with robust features from foundational vision transformers
Authors: Sheila E. Whitman, Marat I. Latypov
Abstract: Machine learning of microstructure--property relationships from data is an emerging approach in computational materials science. Most existing machine learning efforts focus on the development of task-specific models for each microstructure--property relationship. We propose utilizing pre-trained foundational vision transformers for the extraction of task-agnostic microstructure features and subsequent light-weight machine learning of a microstructure-dependent property. We demonstrate our approach with pre-trained state-of-the-art vision transformers (CLIP, DINOV2, SAM) in two case studies on machine-learning: (i) elastic modulus of two-phase microstructures based on simulations data; and (ii) Vicker's hardness of Ni-base and Co-base superalloys based on experimental data published in literature. Our results show the potential of foundational vision transformers for robust microstructure representation and efficient machine learning of microstructure--property relationships without the need for expensive task-specific training or fine-tuning of bespoke deep learning models.

Title: Hydrated Cable Bacteria Exhibit Protonic Conductivity Over Long Distances
Authors: Bradley G. Lusk, Sheba Morgan, Shawn P. Mulvaney, Brandon Blue, Samuel W. LaGasse, Cory D. Cress, Jesper T. Bjerg, Woo K. Lee, Brian J. Eddie, Jeremy T. Robinson
Abstract: This study presents the direct measurement of proton transport along filamentous Desulfobulbaceae, or cable bacteria. Cable bacteria are filamentous multicellular microorganisms that have garnered much interest due to their ability to serve as electrical conduits, transferring electrons over several millimeters. Our results indicate that cable bacteria can also function as protonic conduits because they contain proton wires that transport protons at distances greater than 100 um. We find that protonic conductivity ({\sigma}P) along cable bacteria varies between samples and is measured as high as 114 +/- 28 uS cm^-1 at 25-degrees C and 70-percent relative humidity (RH). For cable bacteria, the protonic conductance (GP) and {\sigma}P are dependent upon the RH, increasing by as much as 26-fold between 60-percent and 80-percent RH. This observation implies that proton transport occurs via the Grotthuss mechanism along water associated with cable bacteria, forming proton wires. In order to determine {\sigma}P and GP along cable bacteria, we implemented a protocol using a modified transfer-printing technique to deposit either palladium interdigitated protodes (IDP), palladium transfer length method (TLM) protodes, or gold interdigitated electrodes(IDE) on top of cable bacteria. Due to the relatively mild nature of the transfer-printing technique, this method should be applicable to a broad array of biological samples and curved materials. The observation of protonic conductivity in cable bacteria presents possibilities for investigating the importance of long-distance proton transport in microbial ecosystems and to potentially build biotic or biomimetic scaffolds to interface with materials via proton-mediated gateways or channels.

Title: The tricritical Ising CFT and conformal bootstrap
Authors: Johan Henriksson
Abstract: The tricritical Ising CFT is the IR fixed-point of $\lambda\phi^6$ theory. It can be seen as a one-parameter family of CFTs connecting between an $\varepsilon$-expansion near the upper critical dimension 3 and the exactly solved minimal model in $d=2$. We review what is known about the tricritical Ising CFT, and study it with the numerical conformal bootstrap for various dimensions. Using a mixed system with three external operators $\{\phi\sim\sigma,\phi^2\sim \epsilon,\phi^3\sim\sigma'\}$, we find three-dimensional "bootstrap islands" in $d=2.75$ and $d=2.5$ dimensions consistent with interpolations between the perturbative estimates and the 2d exact values. In $d=2$ and $d=2.25$ the setup is not strong enough to isolate the theory. This paper also contains a survey of the perturbative spectrum and a review of results from the literature.

Title: Single-defect mode lasing in a non-Hermitian 1D trivial SSH lattice
Authors: Abouzar Gharajeh, Kiyanoush Goudarzi, Fargol Seifollahi, Qing Gu
Abstract: We demonstrate robust single-mode lasing in a non-Hermitian 1D trivial Su-Schrieffer-Heeger defective lattice. This structure exhibits a significantly lower threshold power compared to the non-defective lattice, with single-mode lasing sustained across a wide range of pump powers. Notably, our proposed device requires pumping of only the defect ring, leading to minimal required pump power. Moreover, lasing is not confined to the edges but can occur at any point within the lattice.

Title: Three-dimensional chiral active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model for helical motion of microorganisms
Authors: Leon Lettermann, Falko Ziebert, Mirko Singer, Friedrich Frischknecht, Ulrich S. Schwarz (Heidelberg University)
Abstract: Active movement is essential for the survival of microorganisms like bacteria, algae and unicellular parasites, for example the ones causing the disease malaria. In three dimensions, both swimming and gliding microorganisms often exhibit helical trajectories. Here we introduce a stochastic dynamics model for chiral self-propelled particles, for which both propulsion force and torque are internally generated, the latter stochastically by an Ornstein Uhlenbeck process. We demonstrate that a truncated version of the full model can be solved analytically, in very good agreement with computer simulations for the full model. Our main result is that this model allows for larger long-time mean squared displacements for helical compared to straight 3D movement at the same speed, suggesting an evolutionary benefit of the often observed helical movements of microorganisms, and opposite to the reduction of diffusion caused by chirality in 2D. We then provide an experimental example by analyzing imaging data for malaria parasites that glide through hydrogels on helical trajectories.

Title: Auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo method with seniority-zero trial wave function
Authors: Yuichiro Yoshida, Luca Erhart, Takuma Murokoshi, Rika Nakagawa, Chihiro Mori, Hanae Tagami, Wataru Mizukami
Abstract: We present an approach that uses the doubly occupied configuration interaction (DOCI) wave function as the trial wave functions in phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (ph-AFQMC). DOCI is a seniority-zero method focused on electron pairs. Although DOCI considers much fewer electron configurations than the complete active space (CAS) configuration interaction method, it efficiently captures the static correlation, while the consequent ph-AFQMC recovers the dynamical correlation across all orbitals. We also explore an orbital-optimized version (OO-DOCI) to further improve accuracy. We test this approach on several chemical systems, including single O-H bond breaking in water and polymer additives. In these cases, OO-DOCI-AFQMC closely matches CAS-based ph-AFQMC and even outperforms coupled-cluster singles, doubles, and perturbative triples. However, for strongly correlated systems, such as the carbon dimer and multi-bond dissociation in hydrogen systems and water, the method's accuracy drops. This suggests that seniority-zero space models may be insufficient as trial wave functions in ph-AFQMC for strongly correlated systems, suggesting the need for trial wave functions in an extended space. Despite such a limitation, our study demonstrates that DOCI- and OO-DOCI-based ph-AFQMC can reduce the steep cost of CAS approaches, offering a path to accurate multi-reference calculations for larger, more complex systems.

Title: Coupling Dichroism in Strong-Coupled Chiral Molecule-Plasmon Nanoparticle System
Authors: Nan Gao, Haoran Liu, Yurui Fang
Abstract: The interaction between intense light-matter not only promotes emerging applications in quantum and nonlinear optics but also facilitates changes in material properties. Plasmons can significantly enhance not only molecular chirality but also the coupling strength. In this study, we investigate the coupling dichroism in a strongly coupled chiral molecule-plasmonic nanoparticle system using RT-TDDFT. By simulating the interaction between L/D- Phenylglycinol molecules and chiral aluminum clusters (Na-doped Al197Na4), we examine the effects of molecular chirality, cluster chirality, and the coupled effect in the system. Our results demonstrate that the achiral/chiral clusters induce significant spectral shifts and enhance molecular CD signals due to strong plasmon-molecule coupling. The electric-field distribution and transition contribution maps (TCMs) reveal the formation of bonding and antibonding polaritonic modes, modulated by molecular proximity to the cluster. Both of the coupling factor and decay rate of the coupled system will be modulated by the chirality of the molecules and the cluster. Furthermore, we find that increasing the number of coupled molecules leads to a substantial increase in the intensity of lower polaritonic modes, highlighting the collective behavior in multi-molecule systems due to the modal crosstalk or resonance between cluster chirality and molecular chirality. These findings provide valuable insights into the fundamental mechanisms governing plasmon-enhanced chirality at the atomic scale, which have implications for the design of highly sensitive chiral sensors and optoelectronic devices.

Title: Proportional asymptotics of piecewise exponential proportional hazards models
Authors: Emanuele Massa
Abstract: We study the flexible piecewise exponential model in a high dimensional setting where the number of covariates $p$ grows proportionally to the number of observations $n$ and under the hypothesis of random uncorrelated Gaussian designs. We prove rigorously that the optimal ridge penalized log-likelihood of the model converges in probability to the saddle point of a surrogate objective function. The technique of proof is the Convex Gaussian Min-Max theorem of Thrampoulidis, Oymak and Hassibi. An important consequence of this result, is that we can study the impact of the ridge regularization on the estimates of the parameter of the model and the prediction error as a function of the ratio $p/n > 0$. Furthermore, these results represent a first step toward rigorously proving the (conjectured) correctness of several results obtained with the heuristic replica method for the Cox semi-parametric model.

Title: Aggregation of dipolar molecules in SiO$_2$ hybrid organic inorganic films: use of silver nanoparticles as inhibitors of molecular aggregation
Authors: Alfredo Franco, Jorge García-Macedo, Giovanna Brusatin, Massimo Guglielmi
Abstract: The technological implementation of hybrid organic-inorganic materials in second order nonlinear optical photonic devices depends strongly on the ability of the host matrixes to contain high loads of dipolar molecules without aggregation. Some organic molecules are often used to diminish the attracting interactions between dipolar molecules in such kind of materials, but their efficiency as inhibitors of molecular aggregation is limited by their polarizability. In this work, we report the use of silver nanoparticles as inhibitors of molecular aggregation in hybrid organic-inorganic films doped with dipolar molecules. The large polarizability of the silver nanoparticles makes them ideal moieties for the inhibition of the electrostatic interactions between dipolar nonlinear optical molecules. The average size of the silver nanoparticles in this work was 70.5 nm in diameter, they were synthesized using silver nitrate (AgNO$_3$) as precursor and aminoethylaminopropyltrimethoxysilane as reducing agent. These nanoparticles were immersed in SiO$_2$ hybrid organic-inorganic sol-gel films doped with dipolar chromophores to study their effect as inhibitors of dipolar chromophores aggregation. The presence of the silver nanoparticles in the solid films was confirmed by transmission electronic microscopy and UV-Visible spectroscopy. UV-Visible spectroscopy was also used to monitor the dipolar chromophores aggregation in the SiO$_2$ films. We found that, at room temperature, silver nanoparticles are good inhibiting chromophores aggregation in comparison with the performance of organic inhibitors.

Title: The Influence of V-Defects, Leakage, and Random Alloy Fluctuations on the Carrier Transport in Red InGaN MQW LEDs
Authors: Huai-Chin Huang, Shih-Min Chen, Claude Weisbuch, James S. Speck, Yuh-Renn Wu
Abstract: Red InGaN-based light-emitting diodes (LEDs) exhibit lower internal quantum efficiencies (IQEs) than violet, blue, and green InGaN LEDs due to a reduction in radiative recombination rates relative to non-radiative recombination rates as the indium composition increases. Additionally, the larger polarization and band offset barriers between high indium content InGaN quantum wells and GaN quantum barriers increase the forward voltage. In blue and green LEDs, random alloy fluctuations and V-defects play a key role in reducing the forward voltage. When V-defects are present, either naturally or intentionally introduced, they create an alternative path for carrier injection into the MQWs through the V-defect sidewalls. This injection mechanism explains the turn-on voltages of green LEDs. However, in InGaN red LEDs, these two phenomena do not reduce the forward voltage as effectively as in blue and green LEDs, and consequently, the computed forward voltage remains significantly higher than the measured one. Furthermore, currents are observed at low voltages before the turn-on voltage (\(V < \hbar\omega/e = 2.0 \, \text{V}\)) of red LEDs. To address this, we introduce dislocation-induced tail states in the modeling, suggesting that leakage current through these states may play a significant role both below and at turn-on voltages. The simulation also indicates that leakage carriers below turn-on accumulate, partially diffuse in the QWs, screen the polarization-induced barrier in the low injection regime, and further reduce the forward voltage. Despite these beneficial effects, a drawback of dislocation-induced tail states is the enhanced nonradiative recombination in the dislocation line region. This study provides a detailed analysis of device injection physics in InGaN QW red LEDs and outlines potential optimization strategies.

Title: The Physicist's Guide to the HMC
Authors: Johann Ostmeyer
Abstract: The hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm is arguably the most efficient sampling method for general probability distributions of continuous variables. Together with exact Fourier acceleration (EFA) the HMC becomes equivalent to direct sampling for quadratic actions $S(x)=\frac12 x^\mathsf{T} M x$ (i.e. normal distributions $x\sim \mathrm{e}^{-S(x)}$), only perturbatively worse for perturbative deviations of the action from the quadratic case, and it remains viable for arbitrary actions. In this work the most recent improvements of the HMC including EFA and radial updates are collected into a numerical recipe.

Title: Membrane phononic crystals for high-Qm mechanical defect modes in piezoelectric aluminum nitride
Authors: Anastasiia Ciers, Laurentius Radit Nindito, Alexander Jung, Hannes Pfeifer, Armin Dadgar, Andre Strittmatter, Witlef Wieczorek
Abstract: Nanomechanical resonators with exceptionally low dissipation are advancing mechanics-based sensors and quantum technologies. The key for these advances is the engineering of localized phononic modes that are well-isolated from the environment, i.e., that exhibit a high mechanical quality factor, Qm. Membrane phononic crystals fabricated from strained thin films can realize high-Qm single or multiple localized phononic defect modes. These defect modes can be efficiently interfaced with out-of-plane light or capacitively coupled to a microwave quantum circuit, enabling readout and control of their motion. When membrane phononic crystals are fabricated from a crystalline film, they could offer built-in functionality. We demonstrate a membrane phononic crystal realized in a strained 90 nm-thin film of aluminum nitride (AlN), which is a crystalline piezoelectric material. We engineer a high-Qm localized phononic defect mode at 1.8 MHz with a Qxf-product of 1.5 10^13 Hz at room temperature. In future devices, the built-in piezoelectricity of AlN can be utilized for in-situ tuning of mechanical mode frequencies, defect mode couplings, or acoustic bandgaps, which can be used as building blocks of tunable phononic circuits.

Title: A theoretical framework for overfitting in energy-based modeling
Authors: Giovanni Catania, Aurélien Decelle, Cyril Furtlehner, Beatriz Seoane
Abstract: We investigate the impact of limited data on training pairwise energy-based models for inverse problems aimed at identifying interaction networks. Utilizing the Gaussian model as testbed, we dissect training trajectories across the eigenbasis of the coupling matrix, exploiting the independent evolution of eigenmodes and revealing that the learning timescales are tied to the spectral decomposition of the empirical covariance matrix. We see that optimal points for early stopping arise from the interplay between these timescales and the initial conditions of training. Moreover, we show that finite data corrections can be accurately modeled through asymptotic random matrix theory calculations and provide the counterpart of generalized cross-validation in the energy based model context. Our analytical framework extends to binary-variable maximum-entropy pairwise models with minimal variations. These findings offer strategies to control overfitting in discrete-variable models through empirical shrinkage corrections, improving the management of overfitting in energy-based generative models.

Title: Grassmann tensor approach for two-dimensional QCD in the strong-coupling expansion
Authors: Thomas Samberger, Jacques C.R. Bloch, Robert Lohmayer
Abstract: We present a tensor-network approach for the strong-coupling expansion of two-dimensional QCD with staggered quarks at non-zero chemical potential. After expanding the Boltzmann factor in the gauge and fermion actions, all gauge fields can be integrated out exactly and the partition function can be evaluated using the Grassmann higher-order tensor renormalization group approach. The method is modified to compute the $\mu$ dependence of the quark number density and the chiral condensate up to order $\beta^3$ with complete absence of higher-order terms infiltrating the result. Although the expansion itself is only a good approximation to the full theory at small $\beta<0.1$, the range can be extended, by using judiciously chosen fits. Moreover, these fits also yield a valuable expansion in $\beta$ for the critical chemical potential.

Title: Aging Dynamics and Velocity Field Correlations in Three-Dimensional Uniformly Heated Granular Gases: A Molecular Dynamics Study
Authors: Rameez Farooq Shah, Shikha Kumari, Syed Rashid Ahmad
Abstract: We conduct a molecular dynamics simulation of an inelastic gas system utilizing an event-driven algorithm combined with a thermostat mechanism. Initially, the kinetic energy of the system experiences a decay before settling into a non-equilibrium steady state. To explore the aging characteristics, we analyze the velocity autocorrelation function, denoted as \( C(t_w, t) \). Our findings indicate that \( C(t_w, t) \) exhibits a dependence on both waiting time \( t_w \) and correlation time \( t \) in an independent manner. At the outset, \( C(t_w, t) \) demonstrates an exponential decay pattern. With increasing \( t_w \), a slower decay is observed, which can be attributed to the development of correlations in the velocity field. The explicit relationship of \( C(t_w, t) \) with respect to \( t_w \) serves as compelling evidence of the aging properties present in the system. These results deepen our comprehension of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and the dynamics of dissipative systems. Our research has significant implications for a range of applications involving inelastic collisions, extending from granular materials to phenomena observed in astrophysics. The simulation methodology and the insights gained contribute to the wider field of complex systems, shedding light on the behavior of systems that are far from equilibrium, particularly those characterized by energy dissipation due to inelastic interactions.

Title: Reactive path ensembles within nonequilibrium steady-states
Authors: Aditya N. Singh, David T. Limmer
Abstract: The modern theory of rare events is grounded in near equilibrium ideas, however many systems of modern interest are sufficiently far from equilibrium that traditional approaches do not apply. Using the recently developed variational path sampling methodology, we study systems evolving within nonequilibrium steady states to elucidate how reactive processes are altered away from equilibrium. Variational path sampling provides access to ensembles of reactive events, and a means of quantifying the relative importance of each dynamical degree of freedom in such processes. With it, we have studied the conformational change of a solute in an active bath. We illustrate how energy injection generically enhances the rates of rare events, even when energy is not directed into specific reactive modes. By studying the folding and unfolding transitions of a grafted polymer under shear, we illustrate how nonequilibrium reactive processes do not follow gradient paths due to the emergence of persistent currents. The breaking of detailed balance allows for the mechanisms of forward and backward reactions to be distinct, enabling novel pathways to be explored and designed, and states unstable in equilibrium to become stabilized kinetically away from it. The analysis presented in this work establishes some basic principles for nonequilibrium reactive events, and is made possible by the use of a numerical method that does not invoke proximity to equilibrium or requires strong prior assumptions about the mechanism of reaction.

Title: How Random Are Ergodic Eigenstates of the Ultrametric Random Matrices and the Quantum Sun Model?
Authors: Tanay Pathak
Abstract: We numerically study the extreme-value statistics of the Schmidt eigenvalues of reduced density matrices obtained from the ergodic eigenstates. We start by exploring the extreme value statistics of the ultrametric random matrices and then the related Quantum Sun Model, which is also a toy model of avalanche theory. It is expected that these ergodic eigenstates are purely random and thus possess random matrix theory-like features, and the corresponding eigenvalue density should follow the universal Marchenko-Pastur law. Nonetheless, we find deviations, specifically near the tail in both cases. Similarly, the distribution of maximum eigenvalue, after appropriate centering and scaling, should follow the Tracy-Widom distribution. However, our results show that, for both the ultrametric random matrix and the Quantum Sun model, it can be better described using the extreme value distribution. As the extreme value distribution is associated with uncorrelated or weakly correlated random variables, the results hence indicate that the Schmidt eigenvalues exhibit much weaker correlations compared to the strong correlations typically observed in Wishart matrices. Similar deviations are observed for the case of minimum Schmidt eigenvalues as well . Despite the spectral statistics, such as nearest neighbor spacing ratios, aligning with the random matrix theory predictions, our findings reveal that randomness is still not fully achieved. This suggests that deviations in extreme-value statistics offer a stringent test to probe the randomness of ergodic eigenstates and can provide deeper insights into the underlying structure and correlations in ergodic systems.

Title: Financial instability transition under heterogeneous investments and portfolio diversification
Authors: Preben Forer, Barak Budnick, Pierpaolo Vivo, Sabrina Aufiero, Silvia Bartolucci, Fabio Caccioli
Abstract: We analyze the stability of financial investment networks, where financial institutions hold overlapping portfolios of assets. We consider the effect of portfolio diversification and heterogeneous investments using a random matrix dynamical model driven by portfolio rebalancing. While heterogeneity generally correlates with heightened volatility, increasing diversification may have a stabilizing or destabilizing effect depending on the connectivity level of the network. The stability/instability transition is dictated by the largest eigenvalue of the random matrix governing the time evolution of the endogenous components of the returns, for which different approximation schemes are proposed and tested against numerical diagonalization.

Title: Modular covariant torus partition functions of dense $A_1^{(1)}$ and dilute $A_2^{(2)}$ loop models
Authors: Alexi Morin-Duchesne, Andreas Klümper, Paul A. Pearce
Abstract: Yang-Baxter integrable dense $A_1^{(1)}$ and dilute $A_2^{(2)}$ loop models are considered on the torus in their simplest physical regimes. A combination of boundary conditions $(h,v)$ is applied in the horizontal and vertical directions with $h,v=0$ and $1$ for periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions respectively. The fugacities of non-contractible and contractible loops are denoted by $\alpha$ and $\beta$ respectively where $\beta$ is simply related to the crossing parameter $\lambda$. At roots of unity, when $\lambda/\pi\in\mathbb Q$, these models are the dense ${\cal LM}(p,p')$ and dilute ${\cal DLM}(p,p')$ logarithmic minimal models with $p,p'$ coprime integers. We conjecture the scaling limits of the transfer matrix traces in the standard modules with $d$ defects and deduce the conformal partition functions ${\cal Z}_{\textrm{dense}}^{(h,v)}(\alpha)$ and ${\cal Z}_{\textrm{dilute}}^{(h,v)}(\alpha)$ using Markov traces. These are expressed in terms of functions ${\cal Z}_{m,m'}(g)$ known from the Coulomb gas arguments of Di Francesco, Saleur and Zuber and subsequently as sesquilinear forms in Verma characters. Crucially, we find that the partition functions are identical for the dense and dilute models. The coincidence of these conformal partition functions provides compelling evidence that, for given $(p,p')$, these dense and dilute theories lie in the same universality class. In root of unity cases with $\alpha=2$, the $(h,v)$ modular covariant partition functions are also expressed as sesquilinear forms in affine $u(1)$ characters involving generalized Bezout conjugates. These also give the modular covariant partition functions for the 6-vertex and Izergin-Korepin 19-vertex models in the corresponding regimes.

Title: Addressing the correlation of Stokes-shifted photons emitted from two quantum emitters
Authors: Adrián Juan-Delgado, Jean-Baptiste Trebbia, Ruben Esteban, Quentin Deplano, Philippe Tamarat, Rémi Avriller, Brahim Lounis, Javier Aizpurua
Abstract: In resonance fluorescence excitation experiments, light emitted from solid-state quantum emitters is typically filtered to eliminate the laser photons, ensuring that only red-shifted Stokes photons are detected. Theoretical analyses of the fluorescence intensity correlation often model emitters as two-level systems, focusing on light emitted exclusively from the purely electronic transition (the Zero-Phonon Line), or rely on statistical approaches based on conditional probabilities that do not account for quantum coherences. Here, we propose a general model to characterize the correlation of either Zero-Phonon Line photons or Stokes-shifted photons. This model successfully reproduces the experimental correlation of Stokes-shifted photons emitted from two interacting molecules and predicts that this correlation is affected by quantum coherence. Besides, we analyze the role of quantum coherence in light emission from two uncorrelated emitters, which helps to clarify the discrepancy between theory and experiments regarding the value of the correlation of photons emitted from this system at zero delay time.

Title: A topological theory for qLDPC: non-Clifford gates and magic state fountain on homological product codes with constant rate and beyond the $N^{1/3}$ distance barrier
Authors: Guanyu Zhu
Abstract: We develop a unified theory for fault-tolerant quantum computation in quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) and topological codes. We show that there exist hidden simplicial complex structures encoding the topological data for all qLDPC and CSS codes obtained from product construction by generalizing the Freedman-Hastings code-to-manifold mapping. This is achieved by building manifolds corresponding to high-dimensional topological expanders from the Tanner graphs of the skeleton classical or quantum codes, which further form a product manifold and an associated thickened product code defined on its triangulation with only a constant qubit overhead. This suggests that qLDPC or more generally CSS codes obtained from product constructions are topological, and hence can admit cohomology operations such as cup products, physically corresponding to higher symmetries in the underlying topological quantum field theory. When applying this mapping to a 3D hypergraph product code obtained from the product of 3 copies of good classical expander codes, we obtain the first non-Clifford logical CCZ gates via constant depth circuits on a code with constant stabilizer weight $w=O(1)$, constant rate $K=\Theta(N)$, and polynomial distance $D=\Omega(N^{1/3})$. When applied to 3D homological product codes consisting of the product of a pair of good quantum and classical LDPC codes, we can further improve the distance to $D=\Omega(\sqrt{N})$ exceeding the $N^{1/3}$ distance barrier implied by the Bravyi-König bound for conventional topological codes. Our work suggests that it is feasible to apply native logical non-Clifford gates on qLDPC codes or directly inject high-fidelity magic states as resources (`magic state fountain') without the distillation process. For the homological product construction, the fountain can inject $\Theta(\sqrt{N})$ magic states in parallel in a single round.

Title: Charge fluctuations, hydrodynamics and transport in the square-lattice Hubbard model
Authors: J. Vucicevic, S. Predin, M. Ferrero
Abstract: Recent experimental results suggest that a particular hydrodynamic theory describes charge fluctuations at long wavelengths in the square-lattice Hubbard model. Due to the continuity equation, the correlation functions for the charge and the current are directly connected: the parameters of the effective hydrodynamic model thus determine the optical conductivity. Here we investigate the validity of the proposed hydrodynamic theory in the full range of parameters of the Hubbard model. In the non-interacting case, there is no effective hydrodynamics, and the charge fluctuations present a rich variety of non-universal behaviors. At weak coupling, the optical conductivity is consistent with the hydrodynamic theory: at low frequency one observes a Lorentzian-shaped Drude peak, but the high-frequency asymptotics is necessarily different; the high-temperature limit for the product of the two hydrodynamic model parameters is also in agreement with numerical data. At strong coupling, we find that a generalization of the proposed hydrodynamic law is consistent with our quantum Monte Carlo, as well as the finite-temperature Lanczos results from literature. Most importantly, the temperature dependence of the hydrodynamic parameters as well as the dc resistivity are found to be very similar in the weak and the strong-coupling regimes.

Title: Topological Linking Determines Elasticity in Limited Valence Networks
Authors: Giorgia Palombo, Simon Weir, Davide Michieletto, Yair Augusto Gutierrez Fosado
Abstract: Understanding the relationship between the microscopic structure and topology of a material and its macroscopic properties is a fundamental challenge across a wide range of systems. Here, we investigate the viscoelasticity of DNA nanostar hydrogels - a model system for physical networks with limited valence - by coupling rheology measurements, confocal imaging and molecular dynamics simulations. We discover that these networks display a large degree of interpenetration and that loops within the network are topologically linked, forming a percolating network-within-network structure. Below overlapping concentration, the fraction of branching points and the pore size determine the high-frequency elasticity of these physical gels. At higher concentrations, we discover that this elastic response is dictated by the abundance of topological links between looped motifs in the gel. Our findings highlight the emergence of "topological elasticity" as a previously overlooked mechanism in generic network-forming liquids and gels and inform the design of topologically-controllable material behaviours.

Title: Random features and polynomial rules
Authors: Fabián Aguirre-López, Silvio Franz, Mauro Pastore
Abstract: Random features models play a distinguished role in the theory of deep learning, describing the behavior of neural networks close to their infinite-width limit. In this work, we present a thorough analysis of the generalization performance of random features models for generic supervised learning problems with Gaussian data. Our approach, built with tools from the statistical mechanics of disordered systems, maps the random features model to an equivalent polynomial model, and allows us to plot average generalization curves as functions of the two main control parameters of the problem: the number of random features $N$ and the size $P$ of the training set, both assumed to scale as powers in the input dimension $D$. Our results extend the case of proportional scaling between $N$, $P$ and $D$. They are in accordance with rigorous bounds known for certain particular learning tasks and are in quantitative agreement with numerical experiments performed over many order of magnitudes of $N$ and $P$. We find good agreement also far from the asymptotic limits where $D\to \infty$ and at least one between $P/D^K$, $N/D^L$ remains finite.

Title: On the optimal relaxation rate for the Metropolis algorithm in one dimension
Authors: A. Patrón, A. D. Chepelianskii, A. Prados, E. Trizac
Abstract: We study the relaxation of the Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm corresponding to a single particle trapped in a one-dimensional confining potential, with even jump distributions that ensure that the dynamics verifies detailed balance. Previous work suggested that, for smooth jump distributions, the fastest relaxation rate is obtained as a result of the competition between diffusive and rejection-dominated dynamics. In this work, we show that a new regime comes into play for two-peaked jump distributions, where the relaxation dynamics is neither dominated by diffusion nor rejection: the eigenmodes adopt an oscillatory form, reminiscent of charge density waves (CDW) -- thus we term this new regime the CDW regime. Using a combination of numerical and analytical techniques, the parameter regions corresponding to diffusion, rejection, and CDW are characterised, as well as the transition lines between them -- i.e. a phase diagram is built. The optimal relaxation rate is located at the triple point of phase coexistence, where the transition lines (diffusive-rejection, diffusive-CDW, and CDW-rejection) intersect. Our theoretical framework is checked versus the numerical diagonalisation of the master equation. We also briefly discuss more sophisticated attempts at optimising the relaxation rate to equilibrium.

Title: Restoring balance: principled under/oversampling of data for optimal classification
Authors: Emanuele Loffredo, Mauro Pastore, Simona Cocco, Rémi Monasson
Abstract: Class imbalance in real-world data poses a common bottleneck for machine learning tasks, since achieving good generalization on under-represented examples is often challenging. Mitigation strategies, such as under or oversampling the data depending on their abundances, are routinely proposed and tested empirically, but how they should adapt to the data statistics remains poorly understood. In this work, we determine exact analytical expressions of the generalization curves in the high-dimensional regime for linear classifiers (Support Vector Machines). We also provide a sharp prediction of the effects of under/oversampling strategies depending on class imbalance, first and second moments of the data, and the metrics of performance considered. We show that mixed strategies involving under and oversampling of data lead to performance improvement. Through numerical experiments, we show the relevance of our theoretical predictions on real datasets, on deeper architectures and with sampling strategies based on unsupervised probabilistic models.

Title: Hidden zero modes and topology of multiband non-Hermitian systems
Authors: K. Monkman, J. Sirker
Abstract: In a finite one-dimensional non-Hermitian system, the number of zero modes does not necessarily reflect the topology of the system. This is known as the breakdown of the bulk-boundary correspondence and has led to misconceptions about the topological protection of edge modes in such systems. Here we show why this breakdown does occur and that it typically results in hidden zero modes, extremely long-lived zero energy excitations, which are only revealed when considering the singular value instead of the eigenvalue spectrum. We point out, furthermore, that in a finite multiband non-Hermitian system with Hamiltonian $H$, one needs to consider also the reflected Hamiltonian $\tilde H$, which is in general distinct from the adjoint $H^\dagger$, to properly relate the number of protected zeroes to the winding number of $H$.

Title: Collective modes in Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov superconductors: The role of long-range Coulomb interaction and signatures in density response
Authors: Ryoga Miwa, Ryoi Ohashi, Satoshi Fujimoto, Takeshi Mizushima
Abstract: We theoretically investigate collective excitations in the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) states of Pauli-limited superconducting films. When the long-range Coulomb interaction is absent, excitation spectra consist of two gapless and three gapped modes. The gapless modes are the Nambu-Goldstone modes associated with the spontaneous breaking of the ${\rm U}(1)$ symmetry and the translational symmetry. The gapped modes include the Higgs mode and the twofold degenerate modes that cause the oscillation of the domain width and grayness of FFLO nodal planes. We find that the long-range Coulomb interaction only gaps out the gapless phase mode through the Anderson-Higgs mechanism, while the other modes remain unaffected. Furthermore, the field evolution of the dispersion of the gapless elastic mode, the Nambu-Goldstone mode associated with the translational symmetry breaking, is associated with that of the bandwidth of the mid-gap Andreev bound states. We demonstrate that the signature of the elastic mode can be detected by measuring the density-density response function.

Title: Tunable Fractional Chern Insulators in Rhombohedral Graphene Superlattices
Authors: Jian Xie, Zihao Huo, Xin Lu, Zuo Feng, Zaizhe Zhang, Wenxuan Wang, Qiu Yang, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Kaihui Liu, Zhida Song, X.C. Xie, Jianpeng Liu, Xiaobo Lu
Abstract: Fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) showing a transport effect with fractionally quantized Hall plateaus emerging under zero magnetic field, provide a radically new opportunity to engineer topological quantum electronics. By construction of topological flat band with moire engineering, intrinsic FCIs have been observed in twisted MoTe2 system and rhombohedral pentalayer graphene/hBN moire superlattices with anomalous Hall resistivity quantization number C <= 2/3 including the gapless composite Fermi-liquid state with C = 1/2. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a new system of rhombohedral hexalayer graphene (RHG)/hBN moire superlattices, which exhibit both integer and fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects with rich tunability including electric displacement field, perpendicular magnetic field and in-plane magnetic field. By tuning the electrical and magnetic fields at 0 < v < 1, we have observed a quantum phase transition showing a sign reversal of the Hall resistivity at finite magnetic fields. Surprisingly, the FCI state at v = 2/3 survives in the phase transitions, exhibiting a robust quantized Hall resistivity across both phases. Finally we have further demonstrated the indispensable role moire potential plays in the formation of the flat Chern band from a theoretical perspective. Our work has established RHG/hBN moire superlattices as a promising platform for exploring quasi-particles with fractional charge and non-Abelian anyons at zero magnetic field.

Title: Direct observation of the vanishing EELS cross section in graphene
Authors: Alberto Guandalini, Ryosuke Senga, Yung-Chang Lin, Kazu Suenaga, Paolo Barone, Francesco Mauri, Thomas Pichler, Christian Kramberger
Abstract: In transmission electron energy-loss spectroscopy, the cross section in 2D is quenched by kinematic effects once the momentum transfer becomes smaller than a critical value set by $q_z$, the momentum loss parallel to the beam. Our highly momentum ($\Delta q = 0.02$~Å$^{-1}$) and energy ($\Delta E = 45$~meV) resolved setup is instrumental on delivering the unprecedented experimental verification of quenched 2D EEL spectra on freestanding graphene at momentum transfers $q$ below $0.06$Å$^{-1}$. We retrieve the intrinsic uniform dielectric response of graphene from measured spectra by quantifying the kinematic suppression.

Title: Spectroscopy of two-dimensional interacting lattice electrons using symmetry-aware neural backflow transformations
Authors: Imelda Romero, Jannes Nys, Giuseppe Carleo
Abstract: Neural networks have shown to be a powerful tool to represent the ground state of quantum many-body systems, including fermionic systems. However, efficiently integrating lattice symmetries into neural representations remains a significant challenge. In this work, we introduce a framework for embedding lattice symmetries in fermionic wavefunctions and demonstrate its ability to target both ground states and low-lying excitations. Using group-equivariant neural backflow transformations, we study the t-V model on a square lattice away from half-filling. Our symmetry-aware backflow significantly improves ground-state energies and yields accurate low-energy excitations for lattices up to 10 x 10. We also compute accurate two-point density-correlation functions and the structure factor to identify phase transitions and critical points. These findings introduce a symmetry-aware framework important for studying quantum materials and phase transitions.

Abstract: We present the results of muon-spin relaxation ($\mu^{+}$SR) measurements of the van der Waals magnet NiI$_2$, which probe magnetic phase transitions at $T_{\mathrm{N1}}=73$~K and $T_{\mathrm{N2}}=60$~K. Supporting density functional theory (DFT) calculations allow the determination of a single muon stopping site whose magnetic environment is consistent with the proposed ground-state magnetic structure. $\mu^{+}$SR measurements of the dynamics reveal behavior consistent with spin-wave excitations below $T_{\mathrm{N2}}$. In the region $T_{\mathrm{N2}}<T<T_{\mathrm{N1}}$ the character of the dynamics changes qualitatively, resulting in an unusual region of temperature-independent fluctuations.

Title: Drude weight of an interacting flat-band metal
Authors: Ohad Antebi, Johannes Mitscherling, Tobias Holder
Abstract: Flatband systems form a new class of materials that challenge the conventional wisdom of transport. The intrinsically strong electronic correlations combined with the vanishing kinetic energy scale suggest a sensitive dependence of transport properties on the flat band states and make interacting flat bands promising candidates for exotic quantum transport. Utilizing the Drude weight, we investigate the low-frequency spectral properties of the electrical conductivity within a controlled analytic treatment of the many-body response at temperatures above the bandwidth and the interaction strength and below the bandgap. Focusing on this new transport regime, we demonstrate the potential of a quantum geometric approach for interacting systems and intermediate temperatures. The derived spectral weight yields unexplored four-point geometric contributions unrelated to the quantum metric, which questions the previously proposed projection methods. For long-ranged interactions, we show that the low-frequency spectral weight reduces to the variance of the Berry curvature.

Title: Impurities in a trapped 1D Bose gas of arbitrary interaction strength: localization-delocalization transition and absence of self-localization
Authors: Dennis Breu, Eric Vidal Marcos, Martin Will, Michael Fleischhauer
Abstract: We discuss impurities in a one-dimensional Bose gas with arbitrary boson-boson and boson-impurity interactions. To fully account for quantum effects, we employ numerical simulations based on the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) and - in the regime of strong boson-boson interactions - the mapping to weakly interacting fermions. A mean-field description of the Bose polaron based on coupled Gross-Pitaevski -- Schrödinger equations predicts the existence of a self-localized polaron. We here show that such a solution does not exist and is an artifact of the underlying decoupling approximation. To this end we consider a mobile impurity in a box potential. Our work demonstrates that correlations between the impurity position and the bosons are important even in the limit where mean-field approaches are expected to work well. Furthermore we derive analytical approximations for the energy of a single polaron formed by a heavy impurity for arbitrary interaction strengths and large but finite boson-boson couplings which accurately reproduce DMRG results. This demonstrates that the polaron problem of a heavy impurity in a 1D Bose gas can be accurately approximated by a proper mean-field description plus a linearized treatment of quantum fluctuations for arbitrary boson-boson and impurity-boson couplings. Finally we determine the polaron-polaron interaction potential $V(r)$ in Born-Oppenheimer approximation for small and intermediate distances $r$, which in the Tonks gas limit is oscillatory due to Friedel oscillations in the Bose gas.

Title: Elastic Screening of Pseudogauge Fields in Graphene
Authors: Christophe De Beule, Robin Smeyers, Wilson Nieto Luna, E. J. Mele, Lucian Covaci
Abstract: Lattice deformations in graphene couple to the low-energy electronic degrees of freedom as effective scalar and gauge fields. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we show that the optical component of the displacement field, i.e., the relative motion of different sublattices, contributes at equal order as the acoustic component and effectively screens the pseudogauge fields. In particular, we consider twisted bilayer graphene and corrugated monolayer graphene. In both cases, optical lattice displacements significantly reduce the overall magnitude of the pseudomagnetic fields. For corrugated graphene, optical contributions also reshape the pseudomagnetic field and significantly modify the electronic bands near charge neutrality. Previous studies based on continuum elasticity, which ignores this effect, have therefore systematically overestimated the strength of the strain-induced pseudomagnetic field. Our results have important consequences for the interpretation of experiments and design of straintronic applications.

Title: Edge-driven transition between extended quantum anomalous Hall crystal and fractional Chern insulator in rhombohedral graphene multilayers
Authors: Zezhu Wei, Ang-Kun Wu, Miguel Gonçalves, Shi-Zeng Lin
Abstract: Fractional Chern insulators (FCI) with fractionally quantized Hall conductance at fractional fillings and an extended quantum anomalous Hall (EQAH) crystal with an integer quantized Hall conductance over an extended region of doping were recently observed in pentalayer graphene. One particularly puzzling observation is the transition between the EQAH and FCI regimes, driven either by temperature or electrical current. Here we propose a scenario to understand these transitions based on the topologically protected gapless edge modes that are present in both the FCI and EQAH phases and should be most relevant at temperature scales below the energy gap. Our consideration is based on the simple assumption that the edge velocity in FCI is smaller than that in EQAHE and thus contributes to a higher entropy. We further argue that domains with opposite fractionally quantized Hall conductance are ubiquitous in the devices due to disorder, which gives rise to a network of edge modes. The velocity of the edge modes between domains is further reduced due to edge reconstruction. The edge velocity can also be reduced by current when the occupation of the edge mode approaches the gap edge. The edge entropy therefore drives the transition from EQAH to FCI either by temperature or current at a nonzero temperature.

Title: Tuning competition between charge order and superconductivity in the square-lattice $t$-$t'$-$J$ model
Authors: Xin Lu, Huaiming Guo, Wei-Qiang Chen, D. N. Sheng, Shou-Shu Gong
Abstract: Recently, a flurry of works have found strong competition between charge density wave (CDW) and superconductivity (SC) in the doped Hubbard and $t$-$J$ models on the square lattice. Interestingly, some recent results suggest that the electron-phonon coupling may suppress CDW order and enhance SC. In this work, we consider the square-lattice Hubbard model with the Holstein or Su-Schrieffer-Heeger electron-phonon coupling at the large-$U$ and antiadiabatic (infinite phonon frequency) limit, which gives an effective $t$-$J$ model with either a density attractive interaction $V$ or a $J_P$ term that contributes a larger spin exchange and a density repulsive interaction. To explore how these effective couplings may suppress CDW and give a SC, we implement the density matrix renormalization group simulation on the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model with $V$ or $J_P$ coupling. We focus on the {\it six-leg} cylinder system with the next-nearest-neighbor hopping $t'$, which hosts partially filled stripe and $d$-wave SC in phase diagram. By tuning $t'/t > 0$ and $V$ or $J_P$, we establish two quantum phase diagrams. In the SC phases, the increased $V$ or $J_P$ coupling can enhance the quasi-long-range SC order, consistent with some previous findings. Nonetheless, no SC emerges when the partially filled stripe phase disappears with increased $V$ or $J_P$. Instead, the system has a transition to either a phase-separation-like regime or a filled stripe phase. On the other hand, with increased $t'/t$, not only the partially filled stripe but the phase separation and filled stripe can also be tuned to SC phase. Our results suggest that although $V$ and $J_P$ couplings may strengthen hole binding, the hole dynamics controlled by $t'/t$ appears to play more crucial role for obtaining a SC in $t$-$J$ model.

Title: Nonlinearity of transparent SNS weak links decreases sharply with length
Authors: Valla Fatemi, Pavel D. Kurilovich, Anton R. Akhmerov, Bernard van Heck
Abstract: Superconductor-normal material-superconductor (SNS) junctions are being integrated into microwave circuits for fundamental and applied research goals. The short junction limit is a common simplifying assumption for experiments with SNS junctions, but this limit constrains how small the nonlinearity of the microwave circuit can be. Here, we show that a finite length of the weak link strongly suppresses the nonlinearity compared to its zero-length limit -- the suppression can be up to a factor of ten even when the length remains shorter than the induced coherence length. We tie this behavior to the nonanalytic dependence of nonlinearity on length, which the critical current does not exhibit. Further, we identify additional experimentally observable consequences of nonzero length, and we conjecture that anharmonicity is bounded between zero and a maximally negative value for any non-interacting Josephson junction in the presence of time-reversal symmetry. We promote SNS junction length as a useful parameter for designing weakly nonlinear microwave circuits.

Title: Formation, prevalence, and stability of bouncing-ball quantum scars
Authors: Simo Selinummi, Joonas Keski-Rahkonen, Fartash Chalangari, Esa Räsänen
Abstract: Quantum scars correspond to enhanced probability densities along unstable classical periodic orbits. In recent years, research on quantum scars has extended to various systems including the many-body regime. In this work we focus on the formation, prevalence, and stability of linear "bouncing-ball" (BB) scars in two-dimensional (2D) quantum wells. These scars have relevance as effective and controllable channels in quantum transport. We utilize imaginary time propagation to solve the 2D Schrödinger equation within an arbitrary external confining potential, specifically the quantum well model with external perturbations. We show how BB scars begin to emerge with a single perturbative peak, such as a repulsive bump or attractive dip that simulates the effect of a charged nanotip in the system. We then identify the optimal size of the perturbative peak to maximize the prevalence of these scars. Finally, we investigate the stability of BB scars against external noise and find that some of them are remarkably robust. This suggests promising opportunities for further applications of BB scars in quantum transport.

Title: Duality defect in a deformed transverse-field Ising model
Authors: Fei Yan, Robert Konik, Aditi Mitra
Abstract: Physical quantities with long lifetimes have both theoretical significance in the study of quantum many-body systems and practical implications for quantum technologies. In this manuscript, we investigate the roles played by topological defects in the construction of quasi-conserved quantities, using as a prototypical example the Kramers-Wannier duality defect in a deformed 1d quantum transverse field Ising model. We construct the duality defect Hamiltonian in three different ways: half-chain Kramers-Wannier transformation, utilization of techniques in the Ising fusion category, and defect-modified weak integrability breaking deformation. The third method is also applicable for the study of generic integrable defects under weak integrability breaking deformations. We also work out the deformation of defect-modified higher charges in the model and study their slower decay behavior. Furthermore, we consider the corresponding duality defect twisted deformed Floquet transverse field Ising model, and investigate the stability of the isolated zero mode associated with the duality defect in the integrable Floquet Ising model, under such weak integrability breaking deformation.

Title: Numerical investigation of quantum phases and phase transitions in a two-leg ladder of Rydberg atoms
Authors: Jose Soto, Natalia Chepiga
Abstract: Experiments on chains of Rydberg atoms appear as a new playground to study quantum phase transitions in 1D. As a natural extension, we report a quantitative ground-state phase diagram of Rydberg atoms arranged in a two-leg ladder that interact via van der Waals potential. We address this problem numerically, using the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm. Our results suggest that, surprisingly enough, $\mathbb{Z}_k$ crystalline phases, with the exception of the checkerboard phase, appear in pairs characterized by the same pattern of occupied rungs but distinguishable by a spontaneously broken $\tilde{\mathbb{Z}}_2$ symmetry between the two legs of the ladder. Within each pair, the two phases are separated by a continuous transition in the Ising universality class, which eventually fuses with the $\mathbb{Z}_k$ transition, whose nature depends on $k$. According to our results, the transition into the $\mathbb{Z}_2\otimes \tilde{\mathbb{Z}}_2$ phase changes its nature multiple of times and, over extended intervals, falls first into the Ashkin-Teller, latter into the $\mathbb{Z}_4$-chiral universality class and finally in a two step-process mediated by a floating phase. The transition into the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ phase with resonant states on the rungs belongs to the three-state Potts universality class at the commensurate point, to the $\mathbb{Z}_3$-chiral Huse-Fisher universality class away from it, and eventually it is through an intermediate floating phase. The Ising transition between $\mathbb{Z}_3$ and $\mathbb{Z}_3\otimes \tilde{\mathbb{Z}}_2$ phases, coming across the floating phase, opens the possibility to realize lattice supersymmetry in Rydberg quantum simulators.

Title: Altermagnetic and Noncentrosymmetric Metals
Authors: V.P.Mineev
Abstract: A theory of the normal and superconducting states of piezomagnetic metals, which are altermagnetic materials, has been developed. This has been done in comparison with the corresponding theoretical description for metals that do not have spatial inversion symmetry. Particular attention has been paid to the problem of the anomalous Hall effect, and its absence has been demonstrated in both altermagnetic and non-centrosymmetric metals. It has been shown that the superconducting state in altermagnets always arises by pairing electrons from zones split by spin-orbit interaction, which makes the existence of such superconductors unlikely.

Title: Rise and Fall of the Pseudogap in the Emery model: Insights for Cuprates
Authors: M. O. Malcolms, Henri Menke, Yi-Ting Tseng, Eric Jacob, Karsten Held, Philipp Hansmann, Thomas Schäfer
Abstract: The pseudogap in high-temperature superconducting cuprates is an exotic state of matter, displaying emerging Fermi arcs and a momentum-selective suppression of states upon cooling. We show how these phenomena are originating in the three-band Emery model by performing cutting-edge dynamical vertex approximation calculations for its normal state. For the hole-doped parent compound our results demonstrate the formation of a pseudogap due to short-ranged commensurate antiferromagnetic fluctuations. At larger doping values, progressively, incommensurate correlations and a metallic regime appear. Our results are in qualitative agreement with the normal state of cuprates, and, hence, represent a crucial step towards the uniform description of their phase diagrams within a single theoretical framework.

Title: Odd-parity Magnetism Driven by Antiferromagnetic Exchange
Authors: Yue Yu, Magnus B. Lyngby, Tatsuya Shishidou, Mercè Roig, Andreas Kreisel, Michael Weinert, Brian M. Andersen, Daniel F. Agterberg
Abstract: Realizing odd-parity, time-reversal-preserving, non-relativistic spin splitting is a central goal for spintronics applications. We propose a group-theory-based microscopic framework to induce odd-parity spin splitting from coplanar antiferromagnetic (AFM) states without spin-orbit coupling (SOC). We develop phenomenological models for 421 conventional period-doubling AFM systems in non-symmorphic space groups and construct minimal microscopic models for 119 of these. We find that these AFM states can attain three possible competing ground states. These ground states all break symmetries in addition to those broken by the usual AFM order. Specifically, they give rise to either odd-parity spin-splitting, nematic order, or scalar odd-parity order related to multiferroicity. Our microscopic theories reveal that the odd-parity spin-splitting energy scale is generically large and further reveal that the scalar odd-parity order gives a non-zero Berry curvature dipole without SOC. We identify 67 materials in the Magndata database for which our theory applies. We provide DFT calculations on FeSe that reveal an $h$-wave spin splitting consistent with our symmetry arguments and apply our microscopic model to determine the non-relativistic Edelstein response for CeNiAsO.

Title: Bulk superconductivity in pressurized trilayer nickelate Pr4Ni3O10 single crystals
Authors: Enkang Zhang, Di Peng, Yinghao Zhu, Lixing Chen, Bingkun Cui, Xingya Wang, Wenbin Wang, Qiaoshi Zeng, Jun Zhao
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in pressurized bilayer and trilayer nickelates has generated significant interest. However, their superconducting properties are often dependent on sample quality and pressure conditions, complicating the interpretation of the underlying physics. Finding new systems with optimized bulk superconducting properties is therefore important for advancing our understanding of these materials. Unlike cupates, where trilayer compounds typically exhibit the highest transition temperature (Tc), the bilayer nickelate La3Ni2O7 has thus far outperformed the trilayer La4Ni3O10 in reported Tc. Whether the trilayer nickelates have achieved the optimal Tc remains unclear, with various scenarios suggesting different possibilities. Here, we report the discovery of bulk superconductivity in pressurized Pr4Ni3O10 single crystals, achieving a maximum onset Tc of 40.5 K at 80.1 GPa, significantly exceeding the 30 K observed in La4Ni3O10. The bulk nature of superconductivity is confirmed by zero resistance and a strong diamagnetic response below Tc with a superconducting volume fraction exceeding 80%. These findings establish trilayer nickelates as genuine bulk high-temperature superconductors, provide new insights into the mechanisms driving superconductivity, and point to a promising route toward further enhancing superconducting properties in nickelates.

Title: Polarization-Resolved Core Exciton Dynamics in LiF Using Attosecond Transient Absorption Spectroscopy
Authors: Kylie J Gannan, Lauren B Drescher, Rafael Quintero-Bermudez, Navdeep Rana, Chengye Huang, Kenneth Schafer, Mette B Gaarde, Stephen R Leone
Abstract: The ability to control absorption by modifying the polarization of light presents an exciting opportunity to experimentally determine the orbital alignment of absorption features. Here, attosecond extreme ultraviolet (XUV) transient absorption spectroscopy is used to investigate the polarization dependence of core exciton dynamics in LiF thin films at the Li+ K edge. XUV pulses excite electrons from the Li 1s core level into the conduction band, allowing for the formation of a p-orbital-like core exciton, aligned along the XUV light polarization axis. A sub-5 fs near-infrared (NIR) probe pulse then arrives at variable time delays, perturbing the XUV-excited states and allowing the coherence decay of the core exciton to be mapped. The coherence lifetimes are found to be ~2.4 +- 0.4 fs, which is attributed to a phonon-mediated dephasing mechanism as in previous core exciton studies. The differential absorption features are also shown to be sensitive to the relative polarization of the XUV and NIR fields. The parallel NIR probe induces couplings between the initial XUV-excited p-like bright exciton and s-like dark excitons. When crossed pump and probe polarizations are used, the coupling between the bright and dark states is no longer dipole-allowed, and the transient absorption signal associated with the coupling is suppressed by approximately 90%. This interpretation is supported by simulations of a few-level model system, as well as analysis of the calculated band structure. The results indicate that laser polarization can serve as a powerful experimental tool for exploring the orbital alignment of core excitonic states in solid-state materials.

Title: The phase transition in bounded-size Achlioptas processes
Authors: Oliver Riordan, Lutz Warnke
Abstract: Perhaps the best understood phase transition is that in the component structure of the uniform random graph process introduced by Erdős and Rényi around 1960. Since the model is so fundamental, it is very interesting to know which features of this phase transition are specific to the model, and which are `universal', at least within some larger class of processes (a `universality class'). Achlioptas process, a class of variants of the Erdős--Rényi process that are easy to define but difficult to analyze, have been extensively studied from this point of view. Here, settling a number of conjectures and open problems, we show that all `bounded-size' Achlioptas processes share (in a strong sense) all the key features of the Erdős--Rényi phase transition. We do not expect this to hold for Achlioptas processes in general.

Title: Asymptotic Dynamics of Alternating Minimization for Bilinear Regression
Authors: Koki Okajima, Takashi Takahashi
Abstract: This study investigates the dynamics of alternating minimization applied to a bilinear regression task with normally distributed covariates, under the asymptotic system size limit where the number of parameters and observations diverge at the same rate. This is achieved by employing the replica method to a multi-temperature glassy system which unfolds the algorithm's time evolution. Our results show that the dynamics can be described effectively by a two-dimensional discrete stochastic process, where each step depends on all previous time steps, revealing the structure of the memory dependence in the evolution of alternating minimization. The theoretical framework developed in this work can be applied to the analysis of various iterative algorithms, extending beyond the scope of alternating minimization.

Title: TraceGrad: a Framework Learning Expressive SO(3)-equivariant Non-linear Representations for Electronic-Structure Hamiltonian Prediction
Authors: Shi Yin, Xinyang Pan, Fengyan Wang, Lixin He
Abstract: We propose a framework to combine strong non-linear expressiveness with strict SO(3)-equivariance in prediction of the electronic-structure Hamiltonian, by exploring the mathematical relationships between SO(3)-invariant and SO(3)-equivariant quantities and their representations. The proposed framework, called TraceGrad, first constructs theoretical SO(3)-invariant trace quantities derived from the Hamiltonian targets, and use these invariant quantities as supervisory labels to guide the learning of high-quality SO(3)-invariant features. Given that SO(3)-invariance is preserved under non-linear operations, the learning of invariant features can extensively utilize non-linear mappings, thereby fully capturing the non-linear patterns inherent in physical systems. Building on this, we propose a gradient-based mechanism to induce SO(3)-equivariant encodings of various degrees from the learned SO(3)-invariant features. This mechanism can incorporate powerful non-linear expressive capabilities into SO(3)-equivariant features with consistency of physical dimensions to the regression targets, while theoretically preserving equivariant properties, establishing a strong foundation for predicting Hamiltonian. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in prediction accuracy across eight challenging benchmark databases on Hamiltonian prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach not only improves the accuracy of Hamiltonian prediction but also significantly enhances the prediction for downstream physical quantities, and also markedly improves the acceleration performance for the traditional Density Functional Theory algorithms.

Title: A novel perspective on denoising using quantum localization with application to medical imaging
Authors: Amirreza Hashemi, Sayantan Dutta, Bertrand Georgeot, Denis Kouame, Hamid Sabet
Abstract: Background noise in many fields such as medical imaging poses significant challenges for accurate diagnosis, prompting the development of denoising algorithms. Traditional methodologies, however, often struggle to address the complexities of noisy environments in high dimensional imaging systems. This paper introduces a novel quantum-inspired approach for image denoising, drawing upon principles of quantum and condensed matter physics. Our approach views medical images as amorphous structures akin to those found in condensed matter physics and we propose an algorithm that incorporates the concept of mode resolved localization directly into the denoising process. Notably, unlike previous studies that considered localization as a hindrance, our approach considers quantum localization as a fundamental component of image reconstruction which is used to differentiate between noisy and non-noisy modes based on diffusivity and localization measurements. This perspective eliminates the need for hyperparameter tuning, making the proposed method a standalone algorithm which can be implemented with minimal manual intervention and can perform automatic filtering of noise regardless of noise level. Through numerical validation, we showcase the effectiveness of our approach in addressing noise-related challenges in imaging and especially medical imaging, underscoring its relevance for possible quantum computing applications.

Title: Geometrical Approach to Logical Qubit Fidelities of Neutral Atom CSS Codes
Authors: J.J. Postema, S.J.J.M.F. Kokkelmans
Abstract: Encoding quantum information in a quantum error correction (QEC) code enhances protection against errors. Imperfection of quantum devices due to decoherence effects will limit the fidelity of quantum gate operations. In particular, neutral atom quantum computers will suffer from correlated errors because of the finite lifetime of the Rydberg states that facilitate entanglement. Predicting the impact of such errors on the performance of topological QEC codes is important in understanding and characterising the fidelity limitations of a real quantum device. Mapping a QEC code to a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory with disorder allows us to use Monte Carlo techniques to calculate upper bounds on error rates without resorting to an optimal decoder. In this Article, we adopt this statistical mapping to predict error rate thresholds for neutral atom architecture, assuming radiative decay to the computational basis, leakage and atom loss as the sole error sources. We quantify this error rate threshold $p_\text{th}$ and bounds on experimental constraints, given any set of experimental parameters.

Title: Distinguishing Ion Dynamics from Muon Diffusion in Muon Spin Relaxation II -- Extension to Paramagnetic Muons
Authors: Ryosuke Kadono, Takashi U. Ito
Abstract: We extend the previously published model that distinguishes between the diffusive motion of diamagnetic muons and the dynamics of ions around the muon in matter, and propose a generalized model for {\sl paramagnetic muons} (Mu$^0$s, bound states of a muon and an unpaired electron) observed in non-metallic host materials. The new model distinguishes among the independent motion of unpaired electron associated with Mu$^0$, the self-diffusive motion of Mu$^0$ as single atomic entity, and that of the ions surrounding Mu$^0$, where the muon spin relaxation is induced by dynamical fluctuations of the hyperfine (HF) field exerted from the unpaired electron (e.g., due to spin/charge exchange reaction) and/or that of the nuclear hyperfine (NHF) interactions between the unpaired electron and the surrounding ions. We have applied this model to the muonated radicals (Mu$^0$s in a polaron state) in conducting polymers, and examined the validity of the interpretations claimed in the earlier literature that the spin relaxation is induced by quasi-one dimensional motion of the unpaired electron. The result suggests that experimental support for such a claim is still inadequate and needs to be reexamined, including the possibility of other origins for the fluctuations. It is expected that our model will prove a useful guide for $\mu$SR studies of various local dynamics involving paramagnetic muon states.

Title: Crosscap Quenches and Entanglement Evolution
Authors: Zixia Wei, Yasushi Yoneta
Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms by which complex correlations emerge through the dynamics of quantum many-body systems remains a fundamental challenge in modern physics. To address this, quench dynamics starting from nonthermal states have been extensively studied, leading to significant progress. In this paper, we propose a novel quench protocol, termed the "crosscap quench", to investigate how highly structured thermal pure states relax into typical ones. We begin by analyzing conformal field theories (CFTs) and derive universal features in the time evolution of the entanglement entropy. Furthermore, leveraging the AdS/CFT correspondence, we study holographic CFTs, providing an analytically tractable example in chaotic CFTs. Finally, we validate these findings through numerical simulations in both nonintegrable and integrable quantum spin systems.

Title: Towards Fast, Specialized Machine Learning Force Fields: Distilling Foundation Models via Energy Hessians
Authors: Ishan Amin, Sanjeev Raja, Aditi Krishnapriyan
Abstract: The foundation model (FM) paradigm is transforming Machine Learning Force Fields (MLFFs), leveraging general-purpose representations and scalable training to perform a variety of computational chemistry tasks. Although MLFF FMs have begun to close the accuracy gap relative to first-principles methods, there is still a strong need for faster inference speed. Additionally, while research is increasingly focused on general-purpose models which transfer across chemical space, practitioners typically only study a small subset of systems at a given time. This underscores the need for fast, specialized MLFFs relevant to specific downstream applications, which preserve test-time physical soundness while maintaining train-time scalability. In this work, we introduce a method for transferring general-purpose representations from MLFF foundation models to smaller, faster MLFFs specialized to specific regions of chemical space. We formulate our approach as a knowledge distillation procedure, where the smaller "student" MLFF is trained to match the Hessians of the energy predictions of the "teacher" foundation model. Our specialized MLFFs can be up to 20 $\times$ faster than the original foundation model, while retaining, and in some cases exceeding, its performance and that of undistilled models. We also show that distilling from a teacher model with a direct force parameterization into a student model trained with conservative forces (i.e., computed as derivatives of the potential energy) successfully leverages the representations from the large-scale teacher for improved accuracy, while maintaining energy conservation during test-time molecular dynamics simulations. More broadly, our work suggests a new paradigm for MLFF development, in which foundation models are released along with smaller, specialized simulation "engines" for common chemical subsets.

Title: Quantitative low-temperature spectral asymptotics for reversible diffusions in temperature-dependent domains
Authors: Noé Blassel, Tony Lelièvre, Gabriel Stoltz
Abstract: We derive novel low-temperature asymptotics for the spectrum of the infinitesimal generator of the overdamped Langevin dynamics. The novelty is that this operator is endowed with homogeneous Dirichlet conditions at the boundary of a domain which depends on the temperature. From the point of view of stochastic processes, this gives information on the long-time behavior of the diffusion conditioned on non-absorption at the boundary, in the so-called quasistationary regime. Our results provide precise estimates of the spectral gap and principal eigenvalue, extending the Eyring-Kramers formula. The phenomenology is richer than in the case of a fixed boundary and gives new insight into the sensitivity of the spectrum with respect to the shape of the domain near critical points of the energy function. Our work is motivated by--and is relevant to--the problem of finding optimal hyperparameters for accelerated molecular dynamics algorithms.
