Title: Topologically Protected Spatially Localized Modes: An Easy Experimental Realization of the Su--Schrieffer--Heeger Model
Authors: L. Q. English, A. Halchenko, F. Palmero
Abstract: In this paper, we review the basic concepts of topologically protected edge modes using the Su Schrieffer Heeger (SSH) model, originally introduced to describe electrical conductivity in doped polyacetylene polymer chains. We then propose an electrical circuit that emulates this model, provide its mathematical description, and present its experimental realization. The experimental setup is described in detail, with explanations designed to be broadly accessible without much prior familiarity with lattice theory, thus offering an introduction to this active area of research. Both theoretical predictions and experimental results confirm the presence of these modes, showing very good overall agreement. Using this concrete experimental system as a motivating example, we highlight the key aspects of topological protection.

Title: Nonreciprocal perfect Coulomb drag in electron-hole bilayers: coherent exciton superflow as a diode
Authors: Jun-Xiao Hui, Qing-Dong Jiang
Abstract: Distinguishing an exciton condensate from an excitonic gas or insulator remains a fundamental challenge, as both phases feature bound electron-hole pairs but differ only by the emergence of macroscopic phase coherence. Here, we theoretically propose that a spin-orbit-coupled bilayer system can host a finite-momentum exciton condensate exhibiting a nonreciprocal perfect Coulomb drag -- the coherent-exciton diode effect. This effect arises from the simultaneous breaking of inversion and time-reversal symmetries in the exciton condensate, resulting in direction-dependent critical counterflow currents. The resulting nonreciprocal perfect Coulomb drag provides a clear and unambiguous transport signature of phase-coherent exciton condensation, offering a powerful and experimentally accessible approach to identify, probe, and control exciton superfluidity in solid-state platforms.

Title: Quantum criticality at strong randomness: a lesson from anomaly
Authors: Yasamin Panahi, Subhayan Sahu, Naren Manjunath, Chong Wang
Abstract: Quantum criticality in the presence of strong quenched randomness remains a challenging topic in modern condensed matter theory. We show that the topology and anomaly associated with average symmetry can be used to predict certain nontrivial universal properties. Our focus is on systems subject to average Lieb--Schultz--Mattis constraints, where lattice translation symmetry is preserved only on average, while on-site symmetries remain exact. We argue that in the absence of spontaneous symmetry breaking, the system must exhibit critical correlations of local operators in two distinct ways: (i) for some operator $O_e$ charged under exact symmetries, the first absolute moment correlation $\overline{|\langle O_e(x)O^{\dagger}_e(y)\rangle|}$ decays slowly; and (ii) for some operator $O_a$ charged under average symmetries, the first-moment correlation $\overline{\langle O_a(x)O^{\dagger}_a(y)\rangle}$ decays slowly. We verify these predictions in a few examples: the random-singlet Heisenberg spin chain in one dimension, and the disordered free-fermion critical states in symmetry class BDI in one and two dimensions. Surprisingly, even for these well-studied systems, our anomaly-based argument reveals critical correlations overlooked in previous literature. We also discuss the experimental feasibility of measuring these critical correlations.

Title: Non-Hermitian free-fermion critical systems and logarithmic conformal field theory
Authors: Iao-Fai Io, Fu-Hsiang Huang, Chang-Tse Hsieh
Abstract: Conformal invariance often accompanies criticality in Hermitian systems. However, its fate in non-Hermitian settings is less clear, especially near exceptional points where the Hamiltonian becomes non-diagonalizable. Here we investigate whether a 1+1-dimensional gapless non-Hermitian system can admit a conformal description, focusing on a PT-symmetric free-fermion field theory. Working in the biorthogonal formalism, we identify the conformal structure of this theory by constructing a traceless energy-momentum tensor whose Fourier modes generate a Virasoro algebra with central charge $c=-2$. This yields a non-Hermitian, biorthogonal realization of a logarithmic conformal field theory, in which correlation functions exhibit logarithmic scaling and the spectrum forms Virasoro staggered modules that are characterized by universal indecomposability parameters. We further present a microscopic construction and show how the same conformal data (with finite-size corrections) can be extracted from the lattice model at exceptional-point criticality, thereby supporting the field-theory prediction.

Title: Approaching the Thermodynamic Limit with Neural-Network Quantum States
Authors: Luciano Loris Viteritti, Riccardo Rende, Subir Sachdev, Giuseppe Carleo
Abstract: Accessing the thermodynamic-limit properties of strongly correlated quantum matter requires simulations on very large lattices, a regime that remains challenging for numerical methods, especially in frustrated two-dimensional systems. We introduce the Spatial Attention mechanism, a minimal and physically interpretable inductive bias for Neural-Network Quantum States, implemented as a single learned length scale within the Transformer architecture. This bias stabilizes large-scale optimization and enables access to thermodynamic-limit physics through highly accurate simulations on unprecedented system sizes within the Variational Monte Carlo framework. Applied to the spin-$\tfrac12$ triangular-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on clusters of up to $42\times42$ sites. The ability to simulate such large systems allows controlled finite-size scaling of energies and order parameters, enabling the extraction of experimentally relevant quantities such as spin-wave velocities and uniform susceptibilities. In turn, we find extrapolated thermodynamic limit energies systematically better than those obtained with tensor-network approaches such as iPEPS. The resulting magnetization is strongly renormalized, $M_0=0.148(1)$ (about $30\%$ of the classical value), revealing that less accurate variational states systematically overestimate magnetic order. Analysis of the optimized wave function further suggests an intrinsically non-local sign structure, indicating that the sign problem cannot be removed by local basis transformations. We finally demonstrate the generality of the method by obtaining state-of-the-art energies for a $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model on a $20\times20$ square lattice, outperforming Residual Convolutional Neural Networks.

Title: Thermalization in classical systems with discrete phase space
Authors: Pavel Orlov, Enej Ilievski
Abstract: We study the emergence of statistical mechanics in isolated classical systems with local interactions and discrete phase spaces. We establish that thermalization in such systems does not require global ergodicity; instead, it arises from effective local ergodicity, where dynamics in a subsystem may appear pseudorandom. To corroborate that, we analyze the spectrum of the unitary evolution operator and propose an ansatz to describe statistical properties of local observables expanded in the eigenfunction basis - the classical counterpart of the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis. Our framework provides a unified perspective on thermalization in classical and quantum systems with discrete spectra.

Title: Straintronics and twistronics in bilayer graphene
Authors: Federico Escudero, Dong Wang, Pierre A. Pantaleón, Shengjun Yuan, Francisco Guinea, Zhen Zhan
Abstract: The interplay of twist and strain in bilayer graphene enables the formation of moiré patterns and narrow bands that host correlated and topological phases. While magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene has been widely studied, strain provides an additional and realistic control knob for band engineering. In this work, we first generate a global method to construct commensurate supercells for arbitrary twist and strain. Then, using atomistic tight-binding and strain-extended continuum models to study the commensurate structures, we identify configurations that minimize the bandwidth beyond the magic angle. The results reveal a strong dependence of band narrowing and topology on strain type, magnitude, direction and lattice relaxation. Particularly, shear strain produces a stronger distortion than uniaxial strain. Including electron-electron interactions through a self-consistent Hartree potential shows that strain broadens the bare bands while reducing electrostatic renormalization. Strain also drives topological transitions as the narrow and remote bands hybridize, establishing twisted and strained bilayer graphene as a tunable platform for flat-band and topological phenomena.

Title: Dynamic Simulations of Strongly Coupled Spin Ensembles for Inferring Nature of Electronic Correlations from Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
Authors: Charles Snider, Stephen Carr, D. E. Feldman, Chandrasekhar Ramanathan, V. F. Mitrović
Abstract: We develop an efficient package for the simulation of nuclear magnetic resonance spin echo experiments to study the effects of strong electronic spin correlations on the dynamics of the nuclear spin ensemble. A mean-field model is used to study correlated electronic phases through their hyperfine interaction with nuclear spins. We explore the dynamics of the interacting nuclear ensemble and discuss the key behaviors of the system. In particular, we classify the types of temporal asymmetry that the interaction induces in the system as well as a pulse-dependent shift in the spectral domain. Us- ing these results, we discuss how careful measurement of the pulse-dependent shiftcanbeusedtoextractinformationabouttheanisotropyoftheelectronic interaction and how these results represent a novel tool for the examination of exotic NMR signatures in strongly correlated materials. Finally, we re- view specific aspects of the simulation package developed for our exploration and give explicit examples where package can be used to infer range and anisotropy of electronic correlations. In particular, we discuss its structure, accuracy, and the technical merits of the various approximations used to model the nuclear spin ensemble.

Title: Universal reconstructive polarimetry with graphene-metal infrared photodetectors
Authors: Valentin Semkin, Kirill Kapralov, Ilya Mazurenko, Mikhail Kashchenko, Alexander Morozov, Yakov Matyushkin, Dmitry Mylnikov, Denis Bandurin, Li Lin, Alexey Bocharov, Dmitry Svintsov
Abstract: Measurement of light polarization has long been based on complex, bulk, and slow optical instruments. The advent of materials with in-situ variable polarization photoresponse has led to the concept of reconstructive polarimetry, where the detector itself plays the role of tunable polarizer. Materials enabling such functionality have been limited to complex van der Waals heterostructures. Here, we demonstrate the reconstructive polarimetry with infrared (IR) detectors based on simple gated graphene-metal junctions. The reconstruction exploits the gate tuning of polarization contrast, which enables the evaluation of both infrared power and polarization angle from photovoltage measurements at two sequential gate voltages. The physics enabling the polarimetry lies in polarization-dependent shift of the electron hot spot near the contact, and the gate tuning of the of light-sensitive barrier width. We further show the universality of polarization reconstruction, i.e. its feasibility with different geometries of the junction, and with graphene of different quality, from hBN-encapsulated to the scalable vapor-deposited wet-transferred samples.

Title: Single-Emitter Spectra from an Ensemble
Authors: Jonah R. Horowitz, Oliver J. Tye, Oliver M. Nix, Shaun Tan, Hogeun Chang, Jihyun Min, Taehyung Kim, Moungi G. Bawendi
Abstract: The heterogeneity in nanoscale emitters hinders efforts to understand their basic photophysics and limits their use in practical applications. Existing methods have difficulty accurately characterizing single-emitter spectra and optical heterogeneity on a statistical scale. Here, we introduce SPICEE (SPectrally Imbalanced Correlations from Ensemble Emission), a spectrally filtered photon-correlation technique that recovers single-particle emission lineshapes from an ensemble sample. Analytical derivations, numerical modeling, and experiments on a solution ensemble of emitters validate the technique. We apply SPICEE to blue-emitting ZnSeTe semiconductor nanocrystals relevant to display applications and find that the low color purity in the ensemble spectrum is primarily caused by a small subpopulation of nanocrystals with a distinct emission mechanism. This work demonstrates that SPICEE is a powerful high-throughput tool for accurately characterizing the single-emitter properties of nanoscale systems.

Title: Fractal Topology of Majorana Bound States in Superconducting Quasicrystals
Authors: William Caiger, Felix Flicker, Miguel-Ángel Sánchez-Martínez
Abstract: Quasicrystalline order induces a fractal energy spectrum, yet its impact on topological protection remains an open fundamental question. Here, we demonstrate that the topological phase transitions characterised by the appearance of Majorana Bound States themselves have a fractal character. By extending this analysis to the full family of Sturmian words, we uncover Kitaev's Butterfly $-$ a spectral fractal analogous to Hofstadter's butterfly, but fundamentally distinguished by a central superconducting gap. Within this framework, we identify Majorana's Butterfly as a fractal topological phase diagram governed by the competition between quasicrystallinity and superconducting pairing. We show that this competition dictates a hierarchy of Majorana stability, where the survival of the topological phase against fractal fragmentation is determined by the relative strength of these competing energy scales.

Title: Flow-induced bending response rheometer to measure viscoelastic bending of soft microrods
Authors: Barrett T Smith, Michal Czerepaniak, Maciej Lisicki, Sara M Hashmi
Abstract: Soft, microscale hydrogel fibers and rods play important roles in tissue engineering, flexible electronics, soft robotics, drug delivery, sensors, and other applications. Their viscoelastic mechanical properties, while critical for their function, can be challenging to characterize. We present a flow-induced bending response (FIBR) rheometer that quantifies the bending modulus and viscoelastic properties of small, hydrated fibers and rods using flow through a glass capillary. The fiber is positioned across the capillary entrance, and pressure-driven, controlled inflow of water exerts a quantifiable force on the sample. Fiber deflection is determined by video microscopy obtained simultaneously with measurements of flow rate. We develop an analytical model to resolve the hydrodynamic forces applied to the rod, and use Euler-Bernoulli beam theory to determine its material properties. Using a constant volume flow rate of water enables measurement of steady rod deflection, and thus the bending modulus. Application of viscous forces to the rod in a stepwise, cyclic or oscillatory manner enables measurement of time-dependent responses, creep recovery, viscoelastic moduli, and other properties. We demonstrate the versatility of this technique on natural and synthetic materials spanning diameters from 1 to 500 microns and elastic moduli ranging from 100 Pa to >100 MPa. Because the technique uses water to exert forces on the fiber, it works particularly well for hydrated materials, such as hydrogels and biological fibers, providing a versatile platform to characterize microscale mechanical properties of elongated structures.

Title: Phonon assisted absorption in Transition Metal Dichalcogenide heterostructures
Authors: Yifan Liu, Robert Dawson, Nathaniel Gabor, Vivek Aji
Abstract: The coupling of atomic vibrations to electronic excitations - traditionally understood to be a source of energy loss in semiconductors - has recently been explored in photosynthetic light harvesting as a means to circumvent dissipation by harnessing quantum vibronic coherence. Motivated by recent photocurrent measurements of vibronic sidebands in WSe$_2$/MoSe$_2$ optoelectronic devices, we present a nonperturbative theoretical framework for phonon-assisted absorption in van der Waals heterostructures. Using a polaron transformation, a closed-form expression for the optical absorption spectrum at arbitrary temperatures is presented. Our model includes both intraband and interband electron--phonon coupling. Detailed analysis shows that the observed periodic sidebands originate from the strong coupling between interlayer excitons and nearly dispersionless optical phonon modes. Comparing two limiting cases - one involving only intraband couplings, and another incorporating coherent interband processes - we show that interband phonon-assisted transitions are needed to account for the observed data. Beyond enabling the direct estimation of vibronic coupling strengths from spectroscopic data, these findings have profound consequences for our understanding of optical and optoelectronic responses: coherent interband coupling of atomic vibrations to excitons is essential to quantifying photoresponse in transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures.

Title: Revealing Short- and Long-range Li-ion diffusion in Li$_2$MnO$_3$ from finite-temperature dynamical mean field theory
Authors: Alex Taekyung Lee, Kristin A. Persson, Anh T. Ngo
Abstract: Li$_2$MnO$_3$ remains a crucial component of the Li-excess layered cathode family, $(1-x)\,\mathrm{LiMO_2} + x\,\mathrm{Li_2MnO_3}$ ($M$ = Mn, Ni, Co, \dots), but its role in limiting Li-ion mobility remains under debate. Here we combine DFT+$U$, finite-temperature DMFT with a continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo impurity solver, and nudged-elastic-band (NEB) calculations to investigate Li$^+$ migration for a single Li vacancy in paramagnetic Li$_2$MnO$_3$. Dynamical electronic correlations within DMFT substantially reduce the activation energies of the lowest-barrier pathways, yielding $E_a = 0.18$ eV for the shortest-range Li jump and $E_a = 0.50$ eV for the next-lowest pathway. The 0.18 eV barrier quantitatively reproduces the short-range activation energy extracted from $\mu^+$SR measurements, whereas the 0.50 eV barrier is consistent with the long-range transport activation energy obtained from ac-impedance measurements. This single-vacancy, paramagnetic DMFT description therefore provides a coherent explanation of both local and macroscopic probes without requiring highly clustered vacancy configurations or strong extrinsic disorder, an assumption compatible with nearly stoichiometric Li$_2$MnO$_3$ powders. Our results highlight the importance of finite-temperature dynamical correlations for Li-ion migration in correlated oxides and provide a framework for incorporating strong Coulomb interactions in future studies of transition-metal oxide battery materials.

Title: CVD Grown Hybrid MoSe$_2$-WSe$_2$ Lateral/Vertical Heterostructures with Strong Interlayer Exciton Emission

Abstract: Lateral heterostructures of 2D transition metal dichalcogenide offer a powerful platform to investigate photonic and electronic phenomena at atomically sharp interfaces. However, their controlled engineering, including tuning lateral domain size and integration into vertical van der Waals heterostructures with other 2D materials, remains challenging. Here, we present a facile route for the synthesis of two types of heterostructures consisting of monolayers of MoSe$_2$ and WSe$_2$ - purely lateral (HS I) and hybrid lateral/vertical (HS II) - using liquid precursors of transition metal salts and chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Depending on the growth parameters, the heterostructure type and their lateral dimensions can be adjusted. We characterized properties of the HS I and HS II by complementary spectroscopic and microscopic techniques including Raman and photoluminescence spectroscopy, and optical and atomic force microscopy, and scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy. The photoluminescence measurements reveal strong interlayer exciton emission in the MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ region of HS II, which dominates the spectrum at 4 K and persisting up to room temperature. These results demonstrate high optical quality of the grown heterostructures which in combination with scalability of the developed approach paves the way for fundamental studies and device applications based on these unique 2D quantum materials.

Title: Dynamical Effective Hamiltonian Approach to Second-Harmonic Generation in Quantum Magnets: Application to NiI$_2$
Authors: Banasree S. Mou, Stephen M. Winter
Abstract: Although second harmonic generation (SHG) is a promising and widely used method recently for studying 2D magnetic materials, the quantitative analysis of the full SHG tensor is currently challenging. In this letter, we describe a first-principles-based approach towards quantitative analysis of SHG in insulating magnets through formulation in terms of dynamical effective operators. These operators are computed by solving local many-body cluster models. We benchmark this method on NiI$_2$, a multiferroic 2D van der Waals antiferromagnet, demonstrating quantitative analysis of reported Rotational Anisotropy (RA)-SHG data. SHG is demonstrated to probe local ring-current susceptibilities, which provide sensitivity to short-range chiral spin-spin correlations. The described methods may be easily extended to other non-linear optical responses and materials.

Title: Origin of donor compensation in monoclinic (Al$_x$Ga$_{1{\rm -}x})_2$O$_3$ alloys
Authors: Sierra Seacat, Hartwin Peelaers
Abstract: (Al$_x$Ga$_{1{\rm -}x})_2$O$_3$ alloys are frequently used in heterostructures with monoclinic Ga$_2$O$_3$, resulting in a large conduction-band offset, which leads to charge carrier confinement, a property that is desirable for device applications. However, when (Al$_x$Ga$_{1{\rm -}x})_2$O$_3$ alloys are $n$-type doped with Si, the most efficient shallow donor, there is a significant reduction in the number of charge carriers when the Al content of the alloys is greater than 26%, rendering intentional doping ineffective. Here we show that this compensation is due to cation vacancies forming in response to donor doping. We use hybrid density functional theory to study cation vacancies in monoclinic AlGaO$_3$ and monoclinic Al$_2$O$_3$. We find that vacancies prefer to occupy split-vacancy configurations, similar to vacancies in Ga$_2$O$_3$. Furthermore, by comparing the formation energy of the vacancy with the formation energy of Si donors, we show that vacancies are lower in energy than Si donors, independent of the Fermi level, as soon as the alloys contain more than 16% Al. Therefore, cation vacancies will compensate the donor doping, explaining experimental observations.

Title: Switching Characteristics of Electrically Connected Stochastically Actuated Magnetic Tunnel Junction Nanopillars
Authors: Dairong Chen, Ahmed Sidi El Valli, Jonathan Z. Sun, Flaviano Morone, Dries Sels, Andrew D. Kent
Abstract: We investigate the stochastic dynamics of nanoscale perpendicular magnetic tunnel junctions (pMTJs) and the correlations that arise when they are electrically coupled. Individual junctions exhibit thermally activated spin-transfer torque switching with transition probabilities that are well described by a Poisson process. When two junctions are connected in parallel, circuit-mediated redistribution of voltages that occurs in real time as the junction resistances change leads to correlated switching behavior. A minimal stochastic model based on single-junction statistical switching properties and Kirchhoff's laws captures the coupled switching probabilities, while a Markov-chain formalism describes nonequilibrium steady states under multi-pulse driving. Further, these circuit-mediated interactions can be mapped onto the parameters of an Ising Hamiltonian, providing an interpretation in terms of effective spin-spin interactions. Our results demonstrate how simple electrical connections can generate Ising-like couplings and tunable stochastic dynamics in nanoscale magnets.

Title: Quantum phase transition in transverse-field Ising model on Sierpiński gasket lattice
Authors: Tymoteusz Braciszewski, Oliwier Urbański, Piotr Tomczak
Abstract: We study quantum phase transition in the transverse-field Ising model on the Sierpiński gasket. By applying finite-size scaling and numerical renormalization group methods, we determine the critical coupling and the exponents that describe this transition. We first checked our finite-size scaling and the renormalization methods on the exactly solvable one-dimensional chain, where we recovered proper values of critical couplings and exponents. Then, we applied the method to the Sierpiński gasket with 11 and 15 spins. We found a quantum critical point at $\lambda_c \approx 2.72$ to $2.93$, with critical exponents $z\approx0.84$, $\nu \approx 1.12 $, $\beta \approx 0.30$, and $\gamma \approx 2.54$. The lower dynamical exponent $z$ indicates that quantum fluctuations slow down due to fractal geometry, yielding an effective critical dimension of about 2.43. The numerical renormalization group method yielded similar results $\lambda_c = 2.765$, $\beta = 0.306$, supporting our findings. These exponents differ from those in both the one-dimensional and mean-field cases.

Title: Automated Spin Readout Signal Analysis Using U-Net with Variable-Length Traces and Experimental Noise
Authors: Yui Muto, Motoya Shinozaki, Hideaki Yuta, Tatsuo Tsuzuki, Kotaro Taga, Akira Oiwa, Takafumi Fujita, Tomohiro Otsuka
Abstract: Single-shot spin-state discrimination is essential for semiconductor spin qubits, but conventional threshold-based analysis of spin readout traces becomes unreliable under noisy conditions. Although recent neural-network-based methods improve robustness against experimental noise, they are sensitive to training conditions, restricted to fixed-length inputs, and limited to trace-level outputs without explicit temporal localization of transition events. In this work, we apply a U-Net architecture to spin readout signal analysis by formulating transition-event detection as a point-wise segmentation task in one-dimensional time-series data. The fully convolutional structure enables direct processing of variable-length traces. Point-wise and sample-wise evaluations demonstrate low readout error rates and high classification accuracy without retraining. The proposed method generalizes well to previously-unseen trace lengths and experimental non-Gaussian noise, outperforming a conventional threshold-based approach and providing a robust and practical solution for automated spin readout signal analysis.

Title: Electric field control of multiple switching regimes in a multiferroic
Authors: M. Ryzhkov, A. Granero, J. Wettstein, Anna Pimenov, X. Wang, L. Ponet, S.-W. Cheong, M. Mostovoy, Andrei Pimenov, S. Artyukhin
Abstract: Controlling magnetic moments by electric fields has been an everlasting goal for fundamental research. Achieving such control promises to substantially improve the efficiency of data storage and processing devices. A peculiar magnetoelectric behavior recently demonstrated in multiferroic \GdMn showing a switching through a cycle of four states when the magnetic field is ramped up and down through a critical field. Here we show that an external electric field can direct such switching to follow a predetermined sequence of magnetic states. By tuning electric and magnetic fields, large changes in the magnetic state can be achieved by relatively small external field variations. The material thus presents an exciting pradigm of an electrically controlled single crystal magnetic data storage device.

Title: Effect of magnetic field on whirling-anti-whirling order in icosahedral-quasicrystal approximant
Authors: Shinji Watanabe, Tatsuya Iwasaki
Abstract: Recent neutron measurement in the icosahedral quasicrystal approximant Au-SM-Tb (SM=Al, Ga) has revealed unique noncollinear magnetic order ``whirling-anti-whirling states''. Here, we report theoretical analysis on the magnetic-field-direction dependence on the whirling-anti-whirling order in the 1/1 approximant crystal. By performing exact-diagonalization calculation for the effective model taking into account the uniaxial magnetic anisotropy arising from the crystalline electric field, we show the metamagnetic transition takes place simultaneously with the topological transition under the magnetic field along the (111) direction. After the metamagnetic transition, the emergent fictious magnetic field induced by the chirality of noncoplanar magnetic moments appears, the analysis of which concludes that the topological Hall effect is expected to be observed in the electrical conductivity $\sigma_{xy}$ and $\sigma_{yz}$ for the applied field direction from (111) to (001).

Title: Violation of local equilibrium thermodynamics in one-dimensional Hamiltonian-Potts model
Authors: Hitomi Endo, Michikazu Kobayashi
Abstract: We investigate non-equilibrium phase coexistence associated with a first-order phase transition by numerically studying a one-dimensional Hamiltonian-Potts model with fractional spatial derivatives. The fractional derivative is introduced so as to reproduce the low-wavenumber density of states of the standard two-dimensional model, allowing phase coexistence to occur in a minimal one-dimensional setting under steady heat conduction. By imposing a constant heat flux through boundary heat baths, we observe stable coexistence of ordered and disordered phases separated by a stationary interface. We find that the temperature at the interface systematically deviates from the equilibrium transition temperature, demonstrating a clear violation of the local equilibrium description. This deviation indicates that equilibrium metastable states can be stabilized and controlled by a steady heat current. Furthermore, the interface temperature obtained in our simulations is in quantitative agreement with the prediction of global thermodynamics for non-equilibrium steady states. These results confirm that the breakdown of local equilibrium and the stabilization of metastable states are intrinsic features of non-equilibrium first-order phase transitions, independent of spatial dimensionality. Our study thus provides a minimal and controlled numerical model for exploring the fundamental limits of thermodynamic descriptions in non-equilibrium steady states.

Title: Ferroelectric dynamic-field-driven nucleation and growth model for predictive materials-to-circuit co-design
Authors: Yi Liang, Tony Chiang, Megan K. Lenox, John J. Plombon, Jon F. Ihlefeld, Wenhao Sun, John T. Heron
Abstract: Real ferroelectric devices operate under mixed and distorted time-varying voltages, yet the standard nucleation-growth frameworks used to interpret ferroelectric switching -- most notably the Kolmogorov-Avrami-Ishibashi (KAI) and nucleation-limited switching models (NLS) -- are derived under the critically limiting assumption of a constant electric field. Thus, the prevailing interpretation of ferroelectric switching dynamics fails under real operating conditions. Here we introduce a compact dynamic-field-driven nucleation and growth (DFNG) model that enables quantitative fits to switching transients across multiple ferroelectric materials to extract time-varying domain wall velocity and growth dimensionality, even under arbitrary voltage waveform. This capability then motivates its use in device modeling under complex signals spanning disparate time and frequency scales. Coupling the compact model to application-related waveforms facilitates a predictive materials-circuit co-design framework by linking nucleation and growth parameters to memory window, disturb error, speed, and energy dissipation for next-generation ferroelectric technologies.

Title: Tuning current flow in superconducting thin film strips by control wires. Applications to single photon detectors and diodes
Authors: Alex Gurevich
Abstract: It is shown that integration of a thin film superconducting strip with current-carrying control wires enables one to engineer a profile of supercurrent density $J(x)$ with no current crowding at the edges of a strip wider than the magnetic Pearl length $\Lambda$. Moreover, $J(x)$ in a strip can be tuned by control wires to produce an inverted $J(x)$ profile with dips at the edges to mitigate current crowding at lithographic defects and block premature penetration of vortices. These conclusions are corroborated by calculations of $J(x)$ in a thin strip coupled inductively with side control wires or in bilayer strip structures by solving the London and Ginzburg Landau equations in the thin film Pearl limit. Thermally-activated penetration of vortices from the edges and unbinding of vortex-antivortex pairs in inverted $J(x)$ profiles are evaluated. It is shown that these structures can be used to develop single-photon strip detectors much wider than $\Lambda$. Such detectors can be tuned {\it in situ} by varying current in control wires to reach the ultimate photon sensitivity limited by unbinding of vortex-antivortex pairs. The structures considered here also exhibit a non-reciprocal current response and behave as superconducting diodes.

Title: Physics-inspired transformer quantum states via latent imaginary-time evolution
Authors: Kimihiro Yamazaki, Itsushi Sakata, Takuya Konishi, Yoshinobu Kawahara
Abstract: Neural quantum states (NQS) are powerful ansätze in the variational Monte Carlo framework, yet their architectures are often treated as black boxes. We propose a physically transparent framework in which NQS are treated as neural approximations to latent imaginary-time evolution. This viewpoint suggests that standard Transformer-based NQS (TQS) architectures correspond to physically unmotivated effective Hamiltonians dependent on imaginary time in a latent space. Building on this interpretation, we introduce physics-inspired transformer quantum states (PITQS), which enforce a static effective Hamiltonian by sharing weights across layers and improve propagation accuracy via Trotter-Suzuki decompositions without increasing the number of variational parameters. For the frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model, our ansätze achieve accuracies comparable to or exceeding state-of-the-art TQS while using substantially fewer variational parameters. This study demonstrates that reinterpreting the deep network structure as a latent cooling process enables a more physically grounded, systematic, and compact design, thereby bridging the gap between black-box expressivity and physically transparent construction.

Title: Electron chirality and hydrodynamic helicity: Analysis in the atomic limit
Authors: Tatsuya Miki, Yuta Kakinuma, Masato Senami, Masahiro Fukuda, Michi-To Suzuki, Hiroaki Ikeda, Shintaro Hoshino
Abstract: Electron chirality has been proposed as a microscopic quantity that characterizes electronic handedness, yet its underlying control parameter has not been clearly identified. Furthermore, its applicability is limited to systems with spin-orbit coupling, which motivates the need for alternative measures of chirality. In this work, we explore two complementary measures of chirality: electron chirality and hydrodynamic helicity. By analyzing a minimal atomic model under chiral crystal fields, we clarify how the interplay among crystal fields, spin-orbit coupling, and electron correlation gives rise to non-zero values of chirality measures. Although electron chirality increases with both spin-orbit coupling and chiral crystal field strength, the dependence on these two factors is highly non-trivial. Particularly, when the chiral crystal field is varied continuously and the energy levels approach quasidegenerate points, the electron chirality is insensitive to spin-orbit coupling, resulting in a remarkable enhancement of chirality. In contrast, the hydrodynamic helicity, defined as a two-body pseudoscalar quantity, remains non-zero even without spin-orbit coupling, originating from electron-electron interactions. Perturbative analysis reveals distinct symmetry selection rules governing the two quantities. Our results provide fundamental insight into the origin of chiralities in electronic systems.

Title: Tuning interactions between static-field-shielded polar molecules with microwaves
Authors: Christopher J. Ho, Joy Dutta, Bijit Mukherjee, Jeremy M. Hutson, Michael R. Tarbutt
Abstract: The ability to tune interparticle interactions is one of the main advantages of using ultracold quantum gases for quantum simulation of many-body physics. Current experiments with ultracold polar molecules employ shielding with microwave or static electric fields to prevent destructive collisional losses. The interaction potential of microwave-shielded molecules can be tuned by using microwaves of two different polarisations, while for static-field-shielded molecules the tunability of interactions is more limited and depends on the particular species. In this work, we propose a general method to tune the interactions between static-field-shielded molecules by applying a microwave field. We carry out coupled-channel scattering calculations in a field-dressed basis set to determine loss rate coefficients and scattering lengths. We find that both the s-wave scattering length and the dipole length can be widely tuned by changing the parameters of the microwave field, while maintaining strong suppression of lossy collisions.

Title: Single crystal growth and properties of Au- and Ge-substituted EuPd$_2$Si$_2$
Authors: Michelle Ocker, Robert Möller, Marius Peters, Franziska Walther, Vivien Kirschall, Dominik C. Hezel, Michael Merz, Christo Guguschev, Cornelius Krellner, Kristin Kliemt
Abstract: We report on the single crystal growth of Eu(Pd$_{1-x}$Au$_x$)$_2$Si$_2$, $0< x\leq 0.2$, from a levitating Eu-rich melt using the Czochralski method. Our structural analysis of the samples confirms the ThCr$_2$Si$_2$-type structure as well as an increase of the room temperature $a$ and $c$ lattice parameters with increasing $x$. Chemical analysis reveals that, depending on the Au concentration, only about 25-35\% of the amount of Au available in the initial melt is incorporated into the crystal structure, resulting in a decreasing substitution level for increasing $x$. Through Au substitution, chemical pressure is applied and large changes in valence crossover temperatures are already observed for low substitution levels $x$. In contrast to previous studies, we do not find any signs of a first-order transition in samples with $x_{\rm nom}=0.1$ or AFM order for higher $x$. Furthermore, we observe the formation of quarternary side phases for a higher amount of Au in the melt. In addition, cubic-mm-sized single crystals of EuPd$_2$(Si$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$)$_2$ with $x_{\rm nom}=0.2$ were grown. The analysis of the X-ray fluorescence revealed that the crystals exhibit a slight variation in the Ge content. Such tiny compositional changes can cause changes in the sample properties concerning variations of the crossover temperature or changes of the type of the transition from crossover to magnetic order. Furthermore, we report on a new orthorhombic phase EuPd$_{1.42}$Si$_{1.27}$Ge$_{0.31}$ that orders antiferromagnetically below $17\,\rm K$.

Title: Robust Interlayer Exciton Interplay in Twisted van der Waals Heterotrilayer on a Broadband Bragg Reflector up to Room Temperature
Authors: Bhabani Sankar Sahoo, Shachi Machchhar, Avijit Barua, Martin Podhorský, Seth Ariel Tongay, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Chirag Chandrakant Palekar, Stephan Reitzenstein
Abstract: We report robust room temperature interlayer excitons in transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures engineered via precise stacking orientation and twist-angle control. We integrate 2H-stacked MoSe$_{2}$/$^{1}$WSe$_{2}$/$^{2}$WSe$_{2}$ heterotrilayer onto a chirped distributed Bragg reflector that acts as a backside mirror. This way, we fabricate a platform that hosts distinct heterotrilayer, heterobilayer, and homobilayer regions with enhanced excitonic features at elevated temperatures. Although the heterobilayer supports temperature-tunable singlet and triplet interlayer excitons, it exhibits low emission yield at 4 K. In comparison, the heterotrilayer shows remarkable excitonic properties, including pronounced band modulation, intervalley interlayer exciton transitions, and a tenfold photoluminescence enhancement along with a sevenfold increase in exciton decay time at cryogenic temperatures compared to the heterobilayer system. Temperature-dependent studies reveal intriguing interlayer exciton dynamics in the heterotrilayer, including the emergence of valley-polarized interlayer excitons, and the ability to maintain optical stability up to room temperature. Our results establish a clear strategy for engineering excitonic states across multilayer van der Waals heterostructures from 4 K to room temperature, providing a versatile platform for excitonic optoelectronics, quantum photonics, and tunable long-lived interlayer exciton states in scalable TMD heterostructures.

Abstract: Atomic-scale control over band alignment in single-layer lateral heterostructures (LHSs) of dissimilar transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) is critical for nextgeneration electronic, optoelectronic, and quantum technologies. However, direct experimental access to interfacial electronic states with nanometer precision remains a significant challenge. Here, we employ angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with nanoscale spatial resolution (nanoARPES) to directly map the epitaxial alignment and valence band evolution across MoSe2-WSe2 LHSs. By combining nanoARPES with spatially resolved photoluminescence, we correlate the evolution of the valence band maximum and exciton features across both atomically sharp and compositionally graded diffusive interfaces. We identified type-II band alignments governed by both material composition and interstitial-induced modifications of band offsets, in close agreement with density functional theory calculations. These results reveal fundamental mechanisms of electronic structure modulation at 1D TMDC heterointerfaces and provide a robust platform for tailored band engineering in van der Waals materials.

Title: Thermal conductivity in noncollinear magnets
Authors: Margherita Parodi, Sergey Artyukhin
Abstract: Magnetic memory and logic devices, including prospective ones based on skyrmions, inevitably produce heat. Thus, controlling heat flow is essential for their performance. Here we study how non-collinear spin arrangement affects the magnon contribution to thermal conductivity. As a paradigm system, we consider the most basic non-collinear magnet with a spin spiral ground state. Spin noncollinearity leads to anharmonic terms, resulting in magnon fusion and decay processes. These processes determine the magnon lifetime, which can be used to estimate thermal conductivity in a single-mode approximation. However, by solving the full Boltzmann equation numerically, we find a much higher thermal conductivity. This signifies that heat is carried not by individual magnons but by their linear combinations -- relaxons. The thermal conductivity is found to increase with the diminishing spiral pitch, consistent with recent experiments. The results provide the blueprint for calculating magnetic thermal transport in non-collinear magnets.

Title: Accelerating Complex Materials Discovery with Universal Machine-Learning Potential-Driven Structure Prediction
Authors: Yuqi An, Zhenbin Wang
Abstract: Universal machine-learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) have become powerful tools for accelerating computational materials discovery by replacing expensive first-principles calculations in crystal structure prediction (CSP). However, their effectiveness in identifying new, complex materials remains uncertain. Here, we systematically assess the capability of a uMLIP (i.e.,M3GNet) to accelerate CSP in quaternary oxides. Through extensive exploration of the Sr-Li-Al-O and Ba-Y-Al-O systems, we show that uMLIP can rediscover experimentally known materials absent from its training set and identify seven new thermodynamically and dynamically stable compounds. These include a new polymorph of Sr2LiAlO4 (P3221) and a new disordered phase, Sr2Li4Al2O7 (P1_bar). Furthermore, our results show stability predictions based on the semilocal PBE functional require cross-validation with higher-level methods, such as SCAN and RPA, to ensure reliability. While uMLIPs substantially reduce the computational cost of CSP, the primary bottleneck has shifted to the efficiency of search algorithms in navigating complex structural spaces. This work highlights both the promise and current limitations of uMLIP-driven CSP in the discovery of new materials.

Title: Single-Atom Adsorption on h-BN along the Periodic Table of Elements: From Pristine Surface to Vacancy-Engineered Sites
Authors: Ana S. Dobrota (1), Natalia V. Skorodumova (2), Igor A. Pašti (1 and 3) ((1) University of Belgrade - Faculty of Physical Chemistry, Belgrade, Serbia, (2) Applied Physics, Division of Materials Science, Department of Engineering Sciences and Mathematics, Luleå University of Technology, Luleå, Sweden, (3) Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts, Belgrade, Serbia)
Abstract: The adsorption of single atoms on pristine and defected hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) was systematically investigated using density functional theory. Elements from the first three rows of the periodic table, together with selected transition and coinage metals, were examined on the pristine surface and at boron- and nitrogen-vacancy sites. On pristine h-BN, adsorption is generally weak and dominated by dispersion forces, with measurable chemisorption limited to highly electronegative atoms such as C, O, and F. The introduction of vacancies transforms h-BN into a chemically active material, increasing adsorption energies by one to two orders of magnitude. The boron vacancy strongly stabilizes metallic and electropositive species through coordination to undercoordinated nitrogen atoms, whereas the nitrogen vacancy selectively binds electronegative and covalent adsorbates. Scaling of adsorption energies with elemental cohesive energies distinguishes regimes of physisorption, chemisorption, and substitutional stabilization. These insights provide a unified description of adsorption trends across the periodic table and establish defect engineering as an effective strategy for tailoring the catalytic, sensing, and electronic properties of h-BN.

Title: Solving models with generalized free fermions I: Algebras and eigenstates
Authors: Kohei Fukai, Balázs Pozsgay, István Vona
Abstract: We study quantum spin chains solvable via hidden free fermionic structures. We study the algebras behind such models, establishing connections to the mathematical literature of the so-called ``graph-Clifford'' or ``quasi-Clifford'' algebras. We also introduce the ``defining representation'' for such algebras, and show that this representation actually coincides with the terms of the Hamiltonian in two relevant models: the XY model and the ``free fermions in disguise'' model of Fendley. Afterwards we study a particular anti-symmetric combination of commuting Hamiltonians; this is performed in a model independent way. We show that for this combination there exists a reference state, and few body eigenstates can be created by the fermionic operators. Concrete application is presented in the case of the ``free fermions in disguise'' model.

Title: Acceleration of Atomistic NEGF: Algorithms, Parallelization, and Machine Learning
Authors: Mathieu Luisier, Nicolas Vetsch, Alexander Maeder, Vincent Maillou, Anders Winka, Leonard Deuschle, Chen Hao Xia, Manasa Kaniselvan, Marko Mladenovic, Jiang Cao, Alexandros Nikolaos Ziogas
Abstract: The Non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism is a particularly powerful method to simulate the quantum transport properties of nanoscale devices such as transistors, photo-diodes, or memory cells, in the ballistic limit of transport or in the presence of various scattering sources such as electronphonon, electron-photon, or even electron-electron interactions. The inclusion of all these mechanisms has been first demonstrated in small systems, composed of a few atoms, before being scaled up to larger structures made of thousands of atoms. Also, the accuracy of the models has kept improving, from empirical to fully ab-initio ones, e.g., density functional theory (DFT). This paper summarizes key (algorithmic) achievements that have allowed us to bring DFT+NEGF simulations closer to the dimensions and functionality of realistic systems. The possibility of leveraging graph neural networks and machine learning to speed up ab-initio device simulations is discussed as well.

Title: Nanoscale spin-wave frequency-selective limiter for 5G technology
Authors: Kristýna Davídková, Khrystyna Levchenko, Florian Bruckner, Roman Verba, Fabian Majcen, Qi Wang, Morris Lindner, Carsten Dubs, Vincent Vlaminck, Jan Klíma, Michal Urbánek, Dieter Suess, Andrii Chumak
Abstract: Power limiters are essential devices in modern radio frequency (RF) communications systems to protect highly sensitive input channels from large incoming signals. Nowadays-used semiconductor limiters suffer from high electronic noise and switching delays when approaching the GHz range, which is crucial for the modern generation of 5G communication technologies aiming to operate at the EU 5G high band (24.25-27.5 GHz). The proposed solution is to use ferrite-based Frequency Selective Limiters (FSLs), which maintain their efficiency at high GHz frequencies, although they have only been studied at the macroscale so far. In this study, we demonstrate a proof of concept of nanoscale FSLs. The devices are based on spin-wave transmission affected by four-magnon scattering phenomena in a 97-nm-thin Yttrium Iron Garnet (YIG) film. Spin waves were excited and detected using coplanar waveguide (CPW) transducers of the smallest feature size of 250 nm. The FSLs are tested in the frequency range up to 25 GHz, and the key parameters are extracted (power threshold, power limiting level, insertion losses, bandwidth) for different spin-wave modes and transducer lengths. An analytical theory has been formulated to describe the fundamental physical processes, and a numerical model has been developed to quantitatively describe the insertion losses and power characteristics of the FSLs. Additionally, the perspective of the spin-wave devices is discussed, including the possibility of simultaneously integrating three devices into one: a frequency-selective limiter, an RF filter, and a delay line, allowing for more efficient use of space and energy.

Title: Emergent 3D Fermiology and Magnetism in an Intercalated Van der Waals System

Strocov, Gianni Profeta, Federico Bisti
Abstract: Intercalation of magnetic atoms into van der Waals materials provides a versatile platform for tailoring unconventional magnetic properties. However, its impact on electronic dimensionality and exchange mechanisms remains poorly understood. Using Fe-intercalated TaS$_2$ as a model system, we combine X-ray absorption and resonant inelastic scattering with angle-resolved photoemission and first-principles calculations to reveal that intercalation reshapes the host electronic structure. We identify a spin-polarized intercalant-host hybridized band with pronounced out-of-plane dispersion crossing the Fermi level, providing an itinerant channel for interlayer magnetic exchange. This mechanism explains the breakdown of a purely atomic picture and establishes a direct link between lattice geometry, electronic dispersion, and magnetic order. Our findings demonstrate that intercalant-induced itinerancy enables tunable interlayer coupling in otherwise layered magnets, offering a general microscopic framework for engineering magnetic dimensionality in a broad class of intercalated vdW materials.

Title: Design of a 60.8 K superconducting hydride LiMgZr2H12 at ambient pressure via Lithium doping
Authors: Qun Wei, Xinyu Wang, Jing Luo, Meiguang Zhang, Bing Wei
Abstract: High-pressure hydrogen-rich compounds have long been regarded as promising room-temperature superconductor candidates; however, their practical applications are limited by their reliance on extreme compression. This study explores hydrogen-rich superconductors that may be stable at ambient pressures. Inspired by recent investigations of the MgZrH2n family, the LiMgZr2H12 structure with a Pmmm symmetry was constructed, and its thermodynamic, mechanical, and dynamical stability were evaluated using first-principles calculations. Electron-phonon coupling (EPC) analysis suggests that LiMgZr2H12 reaches a superconducting critical temperature (Tc) of 60.8 K at ambient pressure. Compared with MgZrH6, Li doping significantly increases the contribution of hydrogen atoms to the electron density of states near the Fermi level (EF) and enhances the EPC constant of the LiMgZr2H12 structure. LiMgZr2H12 exhibits a superconducting figure of merit of 1.56, which is significantly greater than that of MgZrH6, demonstrating its outstanding potential for practical applications. This work guides ambient-pressure design of high-Tc hydrides.

Title: Skyrmions in 2D chiral magnets with noncollinear ground states stabilized by higher-order interactions
Authors: Mathews Benny, Moinak Ghosh, Moritz A. Goerzen, Bjarne Beyer, Hendrik Schrautzer, Stefan Heinze, Souvik Paul
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions are intriguing topological spin textures that have attracted great attention due to their potential for future spintronic devices. Skyrmions have so far been explored in different magnetic materials, such as ferromagnets, antiferromagnets, and ferrimagnets. Here, we propose a new type of unconventional skyrmions stabilized in noncollinear magnets. Using first-principles calculations and atomistic spin simulations, we demonstrate that a noncollinear ground state can be stabilized in Rh/Co and Pd/Co atomic bilayers on the Re(0001) surface by four spin exchange interactions, although Co -- a material often used in applications -- is a prototypical ferromagnet with strong pairwise exchange interaction. We further show that unconventional skyrmion lattices and isolated skyrmions can emerge on this noncollinear magnetic background. Transition-state theory calculations reveal that these metastable skyrmions are protected by large energy barriers, suggesting that they could be observed in experiments. These unconventional types of skyrmions in noncollinear magnets might open new possibilities for topological spin transport or magnet-superconductor hybrid systems.

Title: Long-range spin glass in a field at zero temperature
Authors: Maria Chiara Angelini, Saverio Palazzi, Giorgio Parisi, Tommaso Rizzo
Abstract: We compute the critical exponents of the zero-temperature spin glass transition in a field on a one-dimensional long-range model, a proxy for higher-dimensional systems. Our approach is based on a novel loop expansion within the Bethe $M$-layer formalism, whose adaptation to this specific case is detailed here. The resulting estimates provide crucial benchmarks for numerical simulations that can access larger system sizes in one dimension, thus offering a key test of the theory of spin glasses in a field.

Title: Towards Polyoxometalate Nanoelectronics
Authors: Dominique Vuillaume, Anna Proust
Abstract: Polyoxometalates form a large family of molecular oxide clusters of the early transition metals with unique and tunable properties (multi-redox, thermal and chemical robustness, magnetic). We review more than 30 years of experimental research on the electron transport properties of polyoxometalates devices, from thin films and self-assembled monolayers down to single-molecule junctions. We focus on the relationship between the polyoxometalate structures (structural type, nature of metals and heteroatoms, role of the counterions, redox states, electrode linkers and functional ligands) and the electronic structures of the polyoxometalate-based devices (energy positions of the molecular orbitals, energy offset at the interfaces). Then, we critically discuss the performances of polyoxometalates in nanoelectronics devices: capacitance and resistive switching memories, spintronics, quantum bits and neuromorphic devices. We conclude with a discussion about pending issues and perspectives.

Title: Dynamic similarity of vortex shedding in a superfluid flowing past a penetrable obstacle
Authors: Junhwan Kwon, Y. Shin
Abstract: We numerically investigate wake dynamics in a superfluid flowing past a penetrable obstacle. Unlike an impenetrable object, a penetrable obstacle does not fully deplete the density. We define an effective diameter D_eff from the Mach-1 contour of the time-averaged irrotational flow around the obstacle, which delineates the local supersonic region where quantized vortices nucleate. Using this flow-defined length scale, we construct a superfluid Reynolds number Re_s = (v0 minus vc) times D_eff divided by (hbar over m), where v0 is the flow speed, vc is the critical velocity, and m is the particle mass. We show that Re_s organizes the wake dynamics across obstacle sizes and strengths: the transition from dipole-row emission to alternating vortex cluster shedding occurs at Re_s around 2, and both the Strouhal number and the drag coefficient collapse onto universal curves when plotted as functions of Re_s. These results extend the concept of dynamic similarity in superfluid flows to penetrable obstacles and demonstrate that the dynamically relevant length scale is determined by the supersonic region rather than by the geometric obstacle size.

Title: Topology and energy dependence of Majorana bound states in a photonic cavity
Authors: Aksel Kobiałka, Arnob Kumar Ghosh, Rodrigo Arouca, Annica M. Black-Schaffer
Abstract: Light-matter interaction plays a crucial role in modifying the properties of quantum materials. In this work, we investigate the effect of cavity induced photon fields on a topological superconductor hosting Majorana bound states (MBS). We model the system using a Peierls substitution of the photonic operator in the kinetic and spin-orbit terms, and utilize an exact diagonalization of Hamiltonian for a finite number of photons to investigate the coupled system. We find that the MBS persist even in the presence of a cavity field and notably appear at finite and tunable energy, in contrast to a usual 1D topological superconductor. The MBS energy is shifted by two processes: the cavity photon energy adds a constant energy shift, while the light-matter interaction induces additional parameter dependencies, such that the MBS experience a pseudo-dispersion as a function of both light-matter interaction and magnetic field. Additionally, we find that the MBS energy oscillations are suppressed with increasing light-matter interaction and that disorder stability is not impacted by the light-matter interaction. Combined, these offer additional tunability and stability of the MBS. As a second result, we establish a modified spectral localizer formalism as an essential tool for topological characterization of quantum matter in a cavity. The spectral localizer allows characterization at arbitrary energies, which is needed for probing different photon sectors. However, hybridization between different photon sectors in the low-frequency regime limits a straightforward application of a standard spectral localizer. We fully resolve this issue by judiciously applying an energy shift to the spectral localizer. Our work thus introduces a new avenue for controlling MBS via light-matter coupling and provides a framework for exploring cavity-modified topologies.

Title: Fluctuations of the inverted magnetic state and how to sense them
Authors: Anna-Luisa E. Römling, Artim L. Bassant, Rembert A. Duine
Abstract: Magnons are the low-energy excitations of magnetically ordered materials. While the magnetic moment of a ferromagnet aligns with an applied magnetic field, it has been experimentally shown that the magnetic order can be inverted by injecting spin current into the magnet. This results in an energetically unstable but dynamically stabilized state where the magnetic moment aligns antiparallel to an applied magnetic field, called the inverted magnetic state. The excitations on top of such a state have negative energy and are called antimagnons. The inverted state is subject to fluctuations, in particular, as shot noise in the spin current, which are different from fluctuations in equilibrium, especially at low temperatures. Here, we theoretically study the fluctuations of the inverted magnetic state and their signatures in experimental setups. We find that the fluctuations from the injection of spin current play a large role. In the quantum regime, the inverted magnetic state exhibits larger fluctuations compared to the equilibrium position, which can be probed using a qubit. Our results advance the understanding of the fundamental properties of antimagnons and their experimental controllability, and they pave the way for applications in spintronics and magnonics, such as spin wave amplification and entanglement.

Title: Unconventional superconductivity from lattice quantum disorder
Authors: Yu-Cheng Zhu, Jia-Xi Zeng, Xin-Zheng Li
Abstract: Unconventional superconductivity presents a defining and enduring challenge in condensed matter physics. Prevailing theoretical frameworks have predominantly emphasized electronic degrees of freedom, largely neglecting the rich physics inherent in the lattice. Although conventional phonon theory offers an elegant description of structural phase diagrams and lattice dynamics, its omission of nuclear quantum many-body effects results in misleading phase diagram interpretations and, consequently, an unsound foundation for superconducting theory. Here, by incorporating nuclear quantum many-body effects within first-principles calculations, we discover a lattice quantum disordered phase in superconductors H3S and La3Ni2O7. This phase occupies a triangular region in the pressure-temperature phase diagram, whose left boundary aligns precisely with Tc of the left flank of the superconducting dome. The Tcmax of this quantum disordered phase coincides with the maximum of superconducting Tc, indicating this phase as both the origin of superconductivity on the dome's left flank and a key ingredient of its pairing mechanism. Our findings advance the understanding of high-temperature superconductivity and establish the lattice quantum disordered phase as a unifying framework, both for predicting new superconductors and for elucidating phenomena in a broader context of condensed matter physics.

Title: Quantum Christoffel Nonlinear Magnetization
Authors: Xiao-Bin Qiang, Xiaoxiong Liu, Hai-Zhou Lu, X. C. Xie
Abstract: The Christoffel symbol is an essential quantity in Einstein's general theory of relativity. We discover that an electric field can induce a nonlinear magnetization in quantum materials, described by a Christoffel symbol defined in the Hilbert space of quantum states (quantum Christoffel symbol). Quite different from the previous scenarios, this orbital magnetization does not need spin-orbit coupling and inversion symmetry breaking. Through symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, we identify a number of point groups and 2D material candidates (e.g., BiF$_3$, ZnI$_2$, and Ru$_4$Se$_5$) that host this quantum Christoffel nonlinear magnetization. More importantly, this nonlinear magnetization allows the quantum Christoffel symbol to be probed by optical techniques such as magneto-optical Kerr spectroscopy or transport measurements such as tunneling magneto-resistance. This quantum Christoffel nonlinear magnetization gives a paradigm of how geometry dictates physics.

Title: Evidence for Many-Body States in NiPS$_3$ Revealed by Angle-Resolved Photoelectron Spectroscopy

Abstract: We present $\mu$-ARPES spectra of the Mott-insulating van der Waals antiferromagnet NiPS$_3$. Signatures of strong correlations- such as the onset of atomic or atomic-ligand multiplets and spin-orbit-entangled exciton have been observed in this material by various two-particle spectroscopies, but not previously in photoemission. Our measurements reveal a weakly dispersive feature at the valence-band edge that is absent in DFT+$U$ calculations and remains unchanged across the Néel transition. After critically examining and ruling out alternative interpretations, we show that an exact diagonalization of a NiS$_6$ cluster yields low-energy final-state configurations of mixed multiplet $d^7$ and $d^8\underline{L}$ character, whose energy differences are consistent with the observed additional feature. This implies that ARPES directly accesses local Ni-S multiplet physics in NiPS$_3$, revealing a many-body structure beyond mean-field theory. Our results confirm that NiPS$_3$ is an excellent model platform in which strong correlations, reduced dimensionality, and covalent metal-ligand bonding jointly shape both two- and single-particle spectroscopies, underscoring the need for a genuinely quantum many-body description of two-dimensional quantum materials.

Title: Probing quantum geometric nonlinear magnetization via second-harmonic magneto-optical Kerr effect
Authors: Xuan Qian, Xiao-Bin Qiang, Wenkai Zhu, Yuqing Huang, Yiyuan Chen, Hai-Zhou Lu, Yang Ji, Kaiyou Wang
Abstract: Quantum geometry provides an intrinsic framework for characterizing the geometric structure of quantum states. It highlights its relevance to various aspects of fundamental physics. However, its direct implications for magnetic phenomena remain largely unexplored. Here, we report the observation of electric-field-induced nonlinear magnetization in the nonmagnetic semimetal WTe$_2$ by using a second-harmonic magneto-optical Kerr effect (SMOKE) spectroscopy. We observe a robust nonlinear SMOKE signal that scales quadratically with current and persists up to 200 K. Theoretical modeling and scaling analysis indicate that this nonlinear magnetization is dominated by the orbital contribution and is intrinsically linked to the quantum Christoffel symbol. Just as the Christoffel symbol is a fundamental quantity encoding spacetime geometry in Einstein's general relativity, our work establishes a direct link between quantum geometry and nonlinear magnetization, and provides a geometric perspective for designing future orbitronic devices.

Title: Ab initio Phase Diagram of Ta2O5
Authors: Yan Gong, Huimin Tang, Yong Yang, Yoshiyuki Kawazoe
Abstract: Tantalum pentoxide (Ta2O5) is a polymorphic wide-bandgap semiconductor with outstanding dielectric properties and widespread use in optical and electronic technologies. Its rich structural diversity, arising from multiple polymorphs accessible under different synthesis conditions, has made Ta2O5 a long-standing subject of interest. However, a unified understanding of the thermodynamic stability and phase transitions of its polymorphs across pressure-temperature (P-T) space has remained elusive. Here, using first-principles calculations, we map the thermodynamic landscape of Ta2O5 and establish a comprehensive P-T phase diagram together with a phase-stability hierarchy. We find that Gamma-Ta2O5 and B-Ta2O5 dominate the phase diagram over a broad range of P-T conditions: Gamma-Ta2O5 is stabilized at low pressures, while B-Ta2O5 becomes thermodynamically favored at higher pressures up to ~ 60 GPa, beyond which Y-Ta2O5 emerges as the most stable phase. Crucially, nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) are shown to play a significant role in determining relative phase stability, contributing substantially to the Gibbs free energy and altering phase boundaries. A re-entrant phase transition between Gamma and B-Ta2O5 is predicted near ~ 2 GPa, revealing unexpected complexity in the phase behavior of this oxide. More generally, we identify a characteristic temperature (T_0), at which zero-point and thermal phonon contributions to the free energy become comparable, and show that T_0 is approximately one-third of the Debye temperature. This relationship provides a simple, physically transparent criterion for assessing the importance of NQEs in phase stability, with implications extending beyond Ta2O5 to a broad class of complex oxides.

Title: Resolving Quantum Criticality in the Honeycomb Hubbard Model
Authors: Fo-Hong Wang, Fanjie Sun, Chenghao He, Xiao Yan Xu
Abstract: The interplay between Dirac fermions and electronic correlations on the honeycomb lattice hosts a fundamental quantum phase transition from a semimetal to a Mott insulator, governed by the Gross-Neveu-Heisenberg (GNH) universality class. Despite its importance, consensus on the precise critical exponents remains elusive due to severe finite-size effects in numerical simulations and the lack of conformal bootstrap benchmarks. Here we try to resolve this long-standing controversy by performing projector determinant quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations on lattices of unprecedented size, reaching 10,368 sites. By developing a novel projected submatrix update algorithm, we achieve a significant algorithmic speedup that enables us to access the thermodynamic limit with high precision. We observe that the fermion anomalous dimension and the correlation length exponent converge rapidly, while the boson anomalous dimension exhibits a systematic size dependence that we resolve via linear extrapolation. To validate our analysis, we perform parallel large-scale simulations of the spinless $t$-$V$ model on the honeycomb lattice, which belongs to the Gross-Neveu-Ising class. Our results for the $t$-$V$ model, including the first QMC determination of the fermion anomalous dimension, show agreement with conformal bootstrap predictions, thereby corroborating the robustness of our methodology. Our work provides state-of-the-art critical exponents for the honeycomb Hubbard model and establishes a systematic finite-size scaling workflow applicable to a broad class of strongly correlated quantum systems, paving the way for resolving other challenging fermionic quantum critical phenomena.

Title: Orbital-selective Mottness Driven by Geometric Frustration of Interorbital Hybridization in Pr4Ni3O10

Abstract: The interplay among orbital-selective Mott physics, Hund's coupling, tunable structural motifs, and Kondo-like scattering establishes a compelling paradigm for understanding and engineering correlated multi-orbital systems, as vividly exemplified by nickelate superconductors. Here, using high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy combined with theoretical calculations, we systematically investigate the electronic properties of trilayer nickelates. In La4Ni3O10, we observe pronounced interorbital hybridization, whereas in Pr4Ni3O10, the flat d_(z^2 ) band becomes markedly incoherent and diminishes in spectral weight. By contrast, the dispersive d_(x^2-y^2 ) bands retain coherence in both compounds. This striking incoherence/coherence dichotomy identifies an orbital-selective Mott phase modulated by the interlayer Ni-O-Ni bonding angle. The depletion of the d_(z^2 ) orbitals further frustrates the interorbital hybridization and influences the density-wave transition in Pr4Ni3O10. Moreover, the density-wave gap is substantially reduced in Pr4Ni3O10, likely due to extra scattering channels provided by the local moments of Pr3+ cations. Our findings elucidate the intricate interplay among lattice, orbital, spin, and electronic degrees of freedom and reveal a feasible structural control parameter for the multi-orbital correlated state in trilayer nickelates, which provide a concrete framework for understanding the emergence of superconductivity under high pressure.

Title: Role of magnon-magnon interaction in optical excitation of coherent two-magnon modes
Authors: E.A. Arkhipova, A. E. Fedianin, I.A. Eliseyev, R.M. Dubrovin, P.P. Syrnikov, V.Yu. Davydov, A.M. Kalashnikova
Abstract: Two-magnon modes are terahertz-frequency magnetic excitations in antiferromagnets, governed by exchange interactions and involving magnons from the entire Brillouin zone. The ability to couple to light promotes two-magnon modes as contenders for ultrafast optical manipulation of the magnetic state, beyond conventional zone-center magnonics. While magnon-magnon interactions are known to critically shape the two-magnon line in spontaneous Raman scattering spectra, their role in coherent time-domain excitations remains unexplored. We report a detailed experimental and theoretical study of the influence of magnon-magnon interactions on coherent two-magnon modes in a cubic antiferromagnet excited via Impulsive Stimulated Raman scattering. We reveal the nontrivial evolution of coherent magnetic dynamics in the time domain and the corresponding spectrum and compare it with the spontaneous Raman scattering spectrum. By extending the spin-correlations based theory for two-magnon modes, we derive a unified description of their spectra in Raman Scattering and Impulsive Stimulated Raman Scattering and highlight the role of magnon-magnon interactions.

Title: Stochastic Dynamics of Diffusive Memristor Blocks for Neuromorphic Computing
Authors: Wendy Otieno, Alex Gabbitas, Debi Pattnaik, Pavel Borisov, Sergey Savel'ev, Alexander G. Balanov
Abstract: Biological systems use neural circuits to integrate input information and produce outputs. Synaptic convergence, where multiple neurons converge their inputs onto a single downstream neuron, is common in natural neural circuits. However, understanding specific computations performed by such neural blocks and implementating them in hardware requires further research. This work focuses on synaptic convergence in a simplified circuit of three spiking artificial neurons based on diffusive memristors. Numerical modelling and experiments reveal input voltage combinations that enable targeted activation of spiking for specific neuron configurations. We analyse the statistical characteristics of spiking patterns and interpret them from a computational perspective. The numerical simulations match experimental measurements. Our findings contribute to development of universal functional blocks for neuromorphic systems.

Title: Emergence of magnetic excitations in one-dimensional quantum mixtures under confinement
Authors: Pablo Capuzzi, Patrizia Vignolo, Anna Minguzzi, Silvia Musolino
Abstract: We obtain an exact solution for the spectral function for one-dimensional Bose-Bose and Fermi- Fermi mixtures with strong repulsive interactions, valid in arbitrary confining potentials and at all frequency scales. For the case of harmonic confinement we show that, on top of the ladder structure of the density excitations imposed by the external confinement, spin excitations emerge as sideband peaks, with dispersion related to the one of ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic spin chains and a width fundamentally larger for fermionic mixtures than for bosonic ones, as determined by the different symmetry of spin excited states. The observation of spin excitation branches can provide a univocal probe of interaction-induced magnetism in ultracold atoms.

Title: Machine Learning Modeling of Charge-Density-Wave Recovery After Laser Melting
Authors: Sankha Subhra Bakshi, Yunhao Fan, Gia-Wei Chern
Abstract: We investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of a laser-pumped two-dimensional spinless Holstein model within a semiclassical framework, focusing on the melting and recovery of long-range charge-density-wave order. Accurately describing this process requires fully nonadiabatic electron-lattice dynamics, which is computationally demanding due to the need to resolve fast electronic motion over long time scales. By analyzing the structure of the lattice force during nonequilibrium evolution, we show that the force naturally separates into a smooth quasi-adiabatic component and a residual bath-like contribution associated with fast electronic fluctuations. The quasi-adiabatic component depends only on the instantaneous local lattice configuration and can be efficiently learned using machine-learning techniques, while a minimal Langevin description of the bath term captures the essential features of the recovery dynamics. Combining these elements enables efficient and scalable simulations of long-time nonequilibrium dynamics on large lattices, providing a practical route to access driven correlated systems beyond the reach of direct nonadiabatic approaches.

Title: Stochastic Thermodynamics of Quantum-Induced Stochastic Dynamics
Authors: Pedro V. Paraguassú
Abstract: Quantum-Induced Stochastic Dynamics arises from the coupling between a classical system and a quantum environment. Unlike standard thermal reservoirs, this environment acts as a dynamic bath, capable of simultaneously exchanging heat and performing work. We formulate a thermodynamic framework for this semi-classical regime, defining heat, work, and entropy production. We derive a modified Second Law that accounts for non-equilibrium quantum features, such as squeezing. The framework is exemplified by an optomechanical setup, where we characterize the thermodynamics of the non-stationary noise induced by the cavity field.

Title: Ultrastable 2D glasses and packings explained by local centrosymmetry
Authors: A. Zaccone
Abstract: Using the most recent numerical data by Bolton-Lum \emph{et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. 136, 058201 (2026)], we demonstrate that ideal ultrastable glasses in the athermal limit (or ultrastable ideal 2D disk packings) possess a remarkably high degree of local centrosymmetry. In particular, we find that the inversion-symmetry order parameter for local force transmission introduced in Milkus and Zaccone, [Phys. Rev. 93, 094204 (2016)], is as high as $F_{IS}= 0.93546$, to be compared with $F_{IS}=1$ for perfect centrosymmetric crystals free of defects, and with $F_{IS} \sim 0.3-0.5$ for standard random packings. This observation provides a clear, natural explanation for the ultra-high shear modulus of ideal packings and ideal glasses, because the high centrosymmetry prevents non-affine relaxations which decrease the shear modulus. The same mechanism explains the absence of boson peak-like soft vibrational modes. These results also confirm what was found previous work, i.e. that the bond-orientational order parameter is a very poor correlator for the vibrational and mechanical

Title: Spin and Charge Conductivity in the Square Lattice Fermi-Hubbard Model
Authors: Linh Pham, Ehsan Khatami
Abstract: Dynamical properties are notoriously difficult to compute in numerical treatments of the Fermi-Hubbard model, especially in two spatial dimensions. However, they are essential in providing us with insight into some of the most important and less well-understood phases of the model, such as the pseudogap and strange metal phases at relatively high temperatures, or unconventional superconductivity at lower temperatures, away from the commensurate filling. Here, we use the numerical linked-cluster expansions to compute spin and charge optical conductivities of the model at different temperatures and strong interaction strengths via the exact real-time-dependent correlation functions of the current operators. We mitigate systematic errors associated with having a limited access to the long-time behavior of the correlators by introducing fits and allowing for non-zero Drude weights when appropriate. We compare our results to available data from optical lattice experiments and find that the Drude contributions can account for the theory-experiment gap in the DC spin conductivity of the model at half filling in the strong-coupling region. Our method helps paint a more complete picture of the conductivity in the two-dimensional Hubbard model and opens the door to studying dynamical properties of quantum lattice models in the thermodynamic limit.

Title: Polytype-Dependent Upconversion Photoluminescence in 3R-MoS2
Authors: Omri Meron, Idan Kizel, Dror Hershkovitz, Youngki Yeo, Nirmal Roy, Wei Cao, Moshe Ben Shalom, Haim Suchowski
Abstract: Ferroelectric van der Waals materials offer switchable polarization states, yet optical readout of their stacking configurations remains challenging. Building on the resonant exciton-exciton annihilation (EEA) mechanism in 2H-phase TMDs, we report the first observation of upconversion photoluminescence (UPL) in rhombohedral MoS2 and demonstrate that this many-body process is strongly polytype-dependent. Using low-temperature spectroscopy, we observe anti-Stokes emission with superlinear power dependence. Beyond serving as a layer-number sensor, UPL provides a sensitive probe of stacking order. Trilayer ABA and BAB polytypes, indistinguishable by surface potential measurements and second harmonic generation, exhibit markedly different UPL intensities, and this persists in thicker samples. First-principles calculations attribute this polytype dependence to modulation of the Gamma-point conduction manifold, which controls energy-matching conditions for the annihilation process. Power-dependent spectroscopy further disentangles two distinct annihilation channels originating from different dark exciton valleys, identified through their contrasting intensity scaling and opposite density-induced energy shifts. Crucially, the annihilation process doubles the energy separation of nearly degenerate dark excitons while converting their weak emission into bright signal, providing experimental access to valley-specific responses that are obscured in direct dark-exciton spectroscopy. Our findings demonstrate that ferroelectric configurations provide a new degree of freedom for controlling nonlinear optical processes, with implications for all-optical ferroelectric readout and electrically switchable wavelength conversion in two-dimensional materials.

Title: Structures and proximity effects of inhomogeneous population-imbalanced Fermi gases with pairing interactions
Authors: Bishal Parajuli, Devin J. Gagnon, Chih-Chun Chien
Abstract: By introducing spatially varying profiles of pairing interaction or spin polarization to quasi one-dimensional two-component atomic Fermi gases confined in box potentials, we analyze the ground state structures and properties when multiple phases coexist in real space by implementing the Bogoliubov--de~Gennes equation suitable for describing inhomogeneous fermion systems. While the BCS, Fulde--Ferrell--Larkin--Ovchinnikov (FFLO), and normal phases occupy different regions on the phase diagram when the parameters are uniform, a spatial change of pairing strength or spin polarization can drive the system from the FFLO phase to a normal gas or from a BCS superfluid to the FFLO phase in real space. The FFLO phase exhibits its signature modulating order parameter at the FFLO momentum due to population imbalance, and the pair correlation penetrates the polarized normal phase and exhibits proximity effects. Meanwhile, the BCS phase tends to repel population imbalance and maintain a plateau of pairing. Interestingly, a buffer FFLO phase emerges when the spatial change attempts to join the BCS and normal phase in the presence of spin polarization. By analyzing the pairing correlations, interfacial properties, and momentum-space spectra of the inhomogeneous structures, relevant length- and momentum- scales and their interplay are characterized. We also briefly discuss implications of inhomogeneous multi-phase atomic Fermi gases with population imbalance.

Title: The Mpemba effect in the Descartes protocol: A time-delayed Newton's law of cooling approach
Authors: Andrés Santos
Abstract: We investigate the direct and inverse Mpemba effects within the framework of the time-delayed Newton's law of cooling by introducing and analyzing the Descartes protocol, a three-reservoir thermal scheme in which each sample undergoes a single-step quench at different times. This protocol enables a transparent separation of the roles of the delay time $\tau$, the waiting time $t_{\text{w}}$, and the normalized warm temperature $\omega$, thus providing a flexible setting to characterize anomalous thermal relaxation. For instantaneous quenches, exact conditions for the existence of the Mpemba effect are obtained as bounds on $\omega$ for given $\tau$ and $t_{\text{w}}$. Within those bounds, the effect becomes maximal at a specific value $\omega=\widetilde{\omega}(t_{\text{w}})$, and its magnitude is quantified by the extremal value of the temperature-difference function at this optimum. Accurate and compact approximations for both $\widetilde{\omega}(t_{\text{w}})$ and the maximal magnitude $\text{Mp}(t_{\text{w}})$ are derived, showing in particular that the absolute maximum at fixed $\tau$ is reached for $t_{\text{w}}=\tau$. A comparison with a previously studied two-reservoir protocol reveals that, despite its additional control parameter, the Descartes protocol yields a smaller maximal magnitude of the effect. The analysis is extended to finite-rate quenches, where strict equality of bath conditions prevents a genuine Mpemba effect, although an approximate one survives when the bath time scale is sufficiently short. The developed framework offers a unified and analytically tractable approach that can be readily applied to other multi-step thermal protocols.

Title: Emergent correlations in the selected link-times along optimal paths
Authors: Iván Álvarez Domenech, Javier Rodríguez-Laguna, Pedro Córdoba-Torres, Silvia N. Santalla
Abstract: In the context of first-passage percolation (FPP), we investigate the statistical properties of the selected link-times (SLTs) -the random link times comprising the optimal paths (or geodesics) connecting two given points. We focus on weakly disordered square lattices, whose geodesics are known to fall under the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. Our analysis reveals universal power-law decays with the end-to-end distance for both the average and standard deviation of the SLTs, along with an intricate pattern of long-range correlations, whose scaling exponents are directly linked to KPZ universality. Crucially, the SLT distributions for diagonal and axial paths exhibit significant differences, which we trace back to the distinct directed and undirected nature, respectively, of the underlying geodesics. Moreover, we demonstrate that the SLT distribution violates the conditions of the central limit theorem. Instead, SLT sums follow the Tracy-Widom distribution characteristic of the KPZ class, which we associate with evidence for the emergence of high-order long-range correlations in the ensemble.

Title: Origin of mixed anisotropy in crystalline Permalloy and amorphous Cobalt thin films individually deposited on Si substrate
Authors: Kirti Kirti, Baisali Ghadai, Abinash Mishra, Rahulkrishnan R, Sucheta Mondal
Abstract: Magnetic anisotropy (MA) plays a crucial role in deciding both static and dynamic behaviour of magnetic thin films. It controls various phenomena, such as magnetization reversal, domain formation, domain-wall motion, spin-wave generation, and spin-wave propagation etc. We investigate the mixed anisotropies in face-centred-cubic Permalloy (fcc-Py) and amorphous Cobalt (a-Co) thin films deposited via rf magnetron sputtering on Si (100) substrate with thicknesses, d = 5-125 nm and t = 5-150 nm, respectively. X-ray diffraction technique, atomic force microscopy, and vibrating sample magnetometry are employed to study the structural, morphological, and magnetic properties. We adopt a qualitative approach to understand the nature of different anisotropies present in both materials. Mixed anisotropies evolve with film thicknesses for both fcc-Py and a-Co films. The role of growth conditions in the emergence of specific anisotropies is discussed in detail. An alteration of the magnetization easy axis from the conventional in-plane orientation is evidenced due to the collective influence of these mixed anisotropies. Based on the dominance of anisotropy components, their origin, and the direction of magnetization tilt, we categorize our samples as belonging to specific regimes. Introduction of magnetization tilt has been proven to be an extremely innovative way to improve the performance of spintronic devices so far. The one-to-one comparison between a sputter-deposited crystalline and an amorphous magnetic material could be beneficial for building a stronger foundation for that.

Title: Vacancy defects in square-triangle tilings and their implications for quasicrystals formed by square-shoulder particles
Authors: Alptuğ Ulugöl, Giovanni Del Monte, Eline K. Kempkes, Frank Smallenburg, Laura Filion
Abstract: Almost all observed square-triangle quasicrystals in soft-matter systems contain a large number of point-like defects, yet the role these defects play in stabilizing the quasicrystal phase remains poorly understood. In this work, we investigate the thermodynamic role of such defects in the widely observed 12-fold symmetric square-triangle quasicrystal. We develop a new Monte Carlo simulation to compute the configurational entropy of square-triangle tilings augmented to contain two types of irregular hexagons as defect tiles. We find that the introduction of defects leads to a notable entropy gain, with each defect contributing considerably more than a conventional vacancy in a periodic crystal. Intriguingly, the entropy gain is not simply due to individual defect types but isamplified by their combinatorial mixing. We then apply our findings to a microscopic model of core-corona particles interacting via a square-shoulder potential. By combining the configurational entropy with vibrational free-energy calculations, we predict the equilibrium defect concentration and confirm that the quasicrystalline phase contains a higher concentration of point-defects than a typical periodic crystal. These results provide a new understanding of the prominence of observed defects in soft-matter quasicrystals.

Title: Temperature driven false vacuum decay in coherently coupled Bose superfluids
Authors: Paniyanchatha Moolayil Sivasankar, Franco Dalfovo, Alessio Recati, Arko Roy
Abstract: The relaxation of a quantum field from a metastable state (false vacuum) to a stable one (true vacuum), also known as false vacuum decay, is a fundamental problem in quantum field theory and cosmology. We study this phenomenon using a two-dimensional interacting and coherently coupled Bose-Bose mixture, a platform that has already been employed experimentally to investigate false vacuum decay in one dimension. In such a mixture, it is possible to define an effective magnetization that acts as a quantum field variable. Using the Stochastic Gross-Pitaevskii equation (SGPE), we prepare thermal equilibrium states in the false vacuum and extract decay rates from the magnetization dynamics. The decay rates show an exponential dependence on temperature, in line with the thermal theory of instantons. Since the SGPE is based on complex scalar fields, it also allows us to explore the behavior of the phase, which turns out to become dynamic during decay. Our results confirm the SGPE as an effective tool for studying coupled magnetization and phase dynamics and the associated instanton physics in ultracold quantum gases.

Title: Classical Benchmarks of a Symmetry-Adapted Variational Quantum Eigensolver for Real-Time Green's Functions in Dynamical Mean-Field Theory
Authors: Aadi Singh, Chakradhar Rangi, Ka-Ming Tam
Abstract: We present a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) approach for solving the Anderson Impurity Model (AIM) arising in Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT). Recognizing that the minimal two-site approximation often fails to resolve essential spectral features, we investigate the efficacy of VQE for larger bath discretizations while adhering to near-term hardware constraints. We employ a symmetry-adapted ansatz enforcing conservation of particle number $(N)$, spin projection $(S_z=0)$, and total spin $(S^2=0)$ symmetry, benchmarking the performance against exact diagonalization across different interaction strengths using bath parameters extracted from the DMFT self-consistency loop. For a four-site model, the relative error in the ground state energy remains well below $0.01%$ with a compact parameter set $(N_p \le 30)$. Crucially, we demonstrate that the single-particle Green's function-the central quantity for DMFT-can be accurately extracted from VQE-prepared ground states via real-time evolution in the intermediate to strong interaction regimes. However, in the weak interaction regime, the Green's function exhibits noticeable deviations from the exact benchmark, particularly in resolving low-energy spectral features, despite the ground state energy showing excellent agreement. These findings demonstrate that VQE combined with real-time evolution can effectively extend quantum-classical hybrid DMFT beyond the two-site approximation, particularly for describing insulating phases. While this approach offers a viable pathway for simulating strongly correlated materials on near-term devices, the observation that accurate ground state energy does not guarantee accurate dynamical properties highlights a key challenge for applying such approaches to correlated metals.

Title: A Unified Categorical Description of Quantum Hall Hierarchy and Anyon Superconductivity
Authors: Donghae Seo, Taegon Lee, Gil Young Cho
Abstract: We present a unified category-theoretic framework for quantum Hall hierarchy constructions and anyon superconductivity based on modular tensor categories over $\mathrm{Rep}(\mathrm{U}(1))$ and $\mathrm{sRep}(\mathrm{U}(1)^f)$. Our approach explicitly incorporates conserved $\mathrm{U}(1)$ charge and formulates doping via a generalized stack-and-condense procedure, in which an auxiliary topological order is stacked onto the parent phase, and the quasiparticles created by doping subsequently condense. Depending on whether this condensation preserves or breaks the $\mathrm{U}(1)$ symmetry, the system undergoes a transition to a quantum Hall hierarchy state or to an anyon superconductor. For anyon superconductors, the condensate charge is determined unambiguously by the charged local bosons contained in the condensable algebra. Our framework reproduces all known anyon superconductors obtained from field-theoretic analyses and further predicts novel phases, including a charge-$2e$ anyon superconductor derived from the Laughlin state and charge-$ke$ anyon superconductors arising from bosonic $\mathbb{Z}_k$ Read-Rezayi states. By placing hierarchy transitions and anyon superconductivity within a single mathematical formalism, our work provides a unified understanding of competing and proximate phases near experimentally realizable fractional quantum Hall states.

Title: Single-run determination of the saturation vapor pressure and enthalpy of vaporization/sublimation of a substance undergoing successive solid-solid and solid-liquid phase transitions: the case of $N$-methyl acetamide
Authors: Mohsen Salimi, Aurelien Dantan, Henrik B. Pedersen
Abstract: We report on the dynamical measurement of the saturation vapor pressure of $N$-methyl acetamide in the temperature range $-30^\circ$C to $34^\circ$C. This is achieved by monitoring the pressure inside a vacuum chamber in which a precooled sample of the substance slowly thermalizes to the chamber temperature, undergoing first a phase transition between two crystalline structures around $1^\circ$C and then a solid-liquid phase transition around $30^\circ$C. Such a measurement provides in a single run accurate data for the saturation vapor pressure and the enthalpies of sublimation and vaporization of the different phases of the investigated substance.

Title: Learning ORDER-Aware Multimodal Representations for Composite Materials Design
Authors: Xinyao Li, Hangwei Qian, Jingjing Li, Ivor Tsang
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has shown remarkable success in materials discovery and property prediction, particularly for crystalline and polymer systems where material properties and structures are dominated by discrete graph representations. Such graph-central paradigm breaks down on composite materials, which possess continuous and nonlinear design spaces that lack well-defined graph structures. General composite descriptors, e.g., fiber volume and misalignment angle, cannot fully capture the fiber distributions that fundamentally determine microstructural characteristics, necessitating the integration of heterogeneous data sources through multimodal learning. Existing alignment-oriented multimodal frameworks have proven effective on abundant crystal or polymer data under discrete, unique graph-property mapping assumptions, but fail to address the highly continuous composite design space under extreme data scarcity. In this work, we introduce ORDinal-aware imagE-tabulaR alignment (ORDER), a multimodal pretraining framework that establishes ordinality as a core principle for composite material representations. ORDER ensures that materials with similar target properties occupy nearby regions in the latent space, which effectively preserves the continuous nature of composite properties and enables meaningful interpolation between sparsely observed designs. We evaluate ORDER on a public Nanofiber-enforced composite dataset and an internally curated dataset that simulates the construction of carbon fiber T700 with diverse fiber distributions. ORDER achieves consistent improvements over state-of-the-art multimodal baselines across property prediction, cross-modal retrieval, and microstructure generation tasks.

Title: Stable soap bubble clusters with multiple torus bubbles: getting a bit more exotic
Authors: Delbary Fabrice
Abstract: Recently, numerical examples of stable soap bubble clusters with multiple torus bubbles have been presented. The geometry of these clusters is based on the Platonic solids whose vertices have valence $3$ (in order to fulfill Plateau's laws): the tetrahedron, the cube, the dodecahedron. The clusters respectively contain a bubble of genus $3, 5, 11$. The construction is quite generic and can be used with any convex polyhedron. If stable, the cluster obtained using a polyhedron with $n$ faces has $3n+2$ bubbles and one of these bubbles has genus $n-1$. We propose here to show that is it possible to get stable soap bubble clusters with multiple torus bubbles using a geometry based on prisms and Archimedean solids as well.

Title: The Evolution of Lying in a Spatially-Explicit Prisoner's Dilemma Model
Authors: Gregg Hartvigsen
Abstract: I present the results from a spatial model of the prisoner's dilemma, played on a toroidal lattice. Each individual has a default strategy of either cooperating ($C$) or defecting ($D$). Two strategies were tested, including ``tit-for-tat'' (TFT), in which individuals play their opponent's last play, or simply playing their default play. Each individual also has a probability of telling the truth ($0 \leq P_{truth} \leq 1$) about their last play. This parameter, which can evolve over time, allows individuals to be, for instance, a defector but present as a cooperator regarding their last play. This leads to interesting dynamics where mixed populations of defectors and cooperators with $P_{truth} \geq 0.75$ move toward populations of truth-telling cooperators. Likewise, mixed populations with $P_{truth} < 0.7$ become populations of lying defectors. Both such populations are stable because they each have higher average scores than populations with intermediate values of $P_{truth}$. Applications of this model are discussed with regards to both humans and animals.

Title: Tailoring Quantum Chaos With Continuous Quantum Measurements
Authors: Preethi Gopalakrishnan, András Grabarits, Adolfo del Campo
Abstract: We investigate the role of quantum monitoring in the dynamical manifestations of Hamiltonian quantum chaos. Specifically, we analyze the generalized spectral form factor, defined as the survival probability of a coherent Gibbs state under continuous energy measurements. We show that quantum monitoring can tailor the signatures of quantum chaos in the dynamics, such as the extension of the ramp in the spectral form factor, by varying the measurement strength and detection efficiency. In particular, a typical quantum trajectory obtained by monitoring with unit efficiency exhibits enhanced quantum chaos relative to the average dynamics and to unitary evolution without measurements.

Title: Floquet-engineered fidelity revivals in the PXP model
Authors: Francesco Perciavalle, Francesco Plastina, Nicola Lo Gullo
Abstract: We explore the dynamics of the PXP model when subjected to a periodic drive, and unveil the mechanism through which the interplay between spectral properties and initial states governs the emergence of dynamical revivals and their evolution across the space of driving parameters. For Néel-ordered initial states, revivals follow well-defined trajectories in the parameter space of the driving, primarily determined by a dominant quasi-energy spacing in the Floquet spectrum. Initial states interpolating between Néel and fully polarized configurations exhibit hybrid dynamics, which can be controlled by tuning their overlap with Floquet eigenstates via the driving parameters. This control also allows steering different routes for avoiding Floquet thermalization, showing how both initial state choice and driving protocol shape long-lived dynamics in this driven quantum many-body systems.

Title: Modular Krylov Complexity as a Boundary Probe of Area Operator and Entanglement Islands
Authors: Niloofar Vardian
Abstract: We show that the area operator of a quantum extremal surface can be reconstructed directly from boundary dynamics without reference to bulk geometry. Our approach combines the operator-algebra quantum error-correction (OAQEC) structure of AdS/CFT with modular Krylov complexity. Using Lanczos coefficients of boundary modular dynamics, we extract the spectrum of the modular Hamiltonian restricted to the algebra of the entanglement wedge and isolate its central contribution, which is identified with the area operator. The construction is purely boundary-based and applies to superpositions of semiclassical geometries as well. As an application, we diagnose island formation and the Page transition in evaporating black holes using boundary modular evolution alone, bypassing any bulk extremization. More broadly, our results establish modular Krylov complexity as a concrete and computable probe of emergent spacetime geometry, providing a new route to accessing black hole interiors from boundary quantum dynamics.

Title: Gear-based 3D-printed Micromachines Actuated by Optical Tweezers
Authors: Alaa M. Ali, Gwenn Ulliac, Edison Gerena, Abdenbi Mohand-Ousaid, Sinan Haliyo, Aude Bolopion, Muamer Kadic
Abstract: The miniaturization of mechanical mechanisms is crucial to enable the development of compact, high-performance micromachines. However, the downscaling actuation of conventional gears and micromotors has remained limited by the inherent challenges of implementing mechanical/electrical powering. Here, we present the design, fabrication, and characterization of an optomechanical, gear-driven micromachine realized through two-photon polymerization 3D printing. The actuation is achieved using optical tweezers. The device integrates a microgear transmission system with an optically actuated part, enabling light-controlled micromachines. When illuminated by a highly focused laser source, the first gear generates rotational torque within the gear assembly, converting optical energy into directional mechanical work that can be transmitted to the coupled gear. We demonstrate the fabrication of micromachines using two-photon polymerization (2PP) laser writing, enabling the fabrication of spur gear trains and bevel gears that can produce out-of-plane rotations, which is not achievable with traditional micromachining fabrication techniques. The micromachines are composed of a single gear or a train of two or three gears without any unwanted adhesion between the components, leading to functioning systems. Experimentally, the fabricated micromachines were actuated using optical tweezers, demonstrating continuous gear rotation, effective motion transmission in gear trains, out-of-plane rotations, and the ability to amplify velocity or torque. Optical-tweezer actuation broadens the potential applications of these micromachines, particularly in biomedical and lab-on-a-chip systems, where precise, minimally invasive control at the microscale is essential.

Title: When pre-training hurts LoRA fine-tuning: a dynamical analysis via single-index models
Authors: Gibbs Nwemadji, Bruno Loureiro, Jean Barbier
Abstract: Pre-training on a source task is usually expected to facilitate fine-tuning on similar downstream problems. In this work, we mathematically show that this naive intuition is not always true: excessive pre-training can computationally slow down fine-tuning optimization. We study this phenomenon for low-rank adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning on single-index models trained under one-pass SGD. Leveraging a summary statistics description of the fine-tuning dynamics, we precisely characterize how the convergence rate depends on the initial fine-tuning alignment and the degree of non-linearity of the target task. The key take away is that even when the pre-training and down- stream tasks are well aligned, strong pre-training can induce a prolonged search phase and hinder convergence. Our theory thus provides a unified picture of how pre-training strength and task difficulty jointly shape the dynamics and limitations of LoRA fine-tuning in a nontrivial tractable model.

Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate the direct time-domain characterization of photonic-crystal nanolasers at telecom wavelengths using a nonlinear optical gating technique based on four-wave mixing. This approach enables the temporal characterization of the ultrafast emission dynamics under short-pulse excitation with picosecond time resolution. When a weak continuous-wave component is added to the pulsed pump, the emission becomes deterministic and the build-up time is considerably reduced. The difference between purely pulsed and hybrid excitation regimes points to the influence of pulse-to-pulse timing fluctuations. To elucidate this effect, we perform Langevin-based simulations that reproduce the experimentally observed broadening and confirm that time jitter, originating from spontaneous-emission noise near threshold, dominates the temporal dispersion. These results establish four-wave-mixing gating as a powerful method to probe nanolaser dynamics with picosecond precision.

Title: Ultralow radiative heat flux by Anderson localization in quasiperiodic plasmonic chains
Authors: Yizhi Hu, Kun Yan, Wei-Hua Xiao, Xiaobin Chen
Abstract: Anderson localization, arising from wave interference in disordered systems, profoundly hinders energy transport, yet its impact on radiative heat flux in many-body thermophotonic systems remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate a three-order-of-magnitude suppression of radiative heat transfer, resulting in ultralow radiative heat transfer, in a one-dimensional quasiperiodic chain of plasmonic nanoparticles. This suppression in radiative heat transfer is directly correlated with mode localization, as revealed by the mode decomposition of the transmission coefficient, which serves as evidence of Anderson localization. Furthermore, we elucidate the dependence of radiative thermal conductance reduction on interparticle spacing and material damping rates, uncovering the interplay between intrinsic Ohmic losses, mode localization, and long-range many-body interactions. Our findings advance the understanding of wave-mediated thermal transport in disordered photonic structures and suggest strategies for tailoring nanoscale heat management via engineered disorder.

Title: Equilibrium measures for higher dimensional rotationally symmetric Riesz gases
Authors: Sung-Soo Byun, Peter J. Forrester, Satya N. Majumdar, Gregory Schehr
Abstract: We study equilibrium measures for Riesz gases in dimension $d$ with pairwise interaction kernel $|x-y|^{-s}$, subject to radially symmetric external fields. We characterise broad classes of confining potentials for which the equilibrium measure is supported on the unit ball and admits an explicit density. Our main contribution is a converse construction: starting from a prescribed radially symmetric equilibrium density given as a power series in the squared radius, we determine the associated external potential and establish the corresponding Euler-Lagrange variational conditions. A key ingredient in the proof is an identity between two ${}_3F_2$ hypergeometric functions evaluated at unit argument, which is of independent interest. As applications, we identify the external potentials corresponding to equilibrium densities proportional to $(1-|x|^2)^\alpha$, $\alpha>-1$, and show that these potentials can be expressed in terms of Gauss hypergeometric functions ${}_2F_1$, reducing to polynomials for special values of $\alpha$. We also determine the equilibrium measure associated with purely power-type external potentials, often referred to as Freud or Mittag--Leffler potentials in the context of log gases, for which the equilibrium density admits an explicit ${}_2F_1$ representation. Furthermore, we apply our framework to a Coulomb gas in dimension $d+1$ confined by a harmonic potential to the half-space. We derive a necessary condition under which the equilibrium measure is fully supported on the boundary hyperplane of dimension $d$, with the induced density corresponding to that of a Riesz gas with exponent $s=d-1$.

Abstract: Raman spectroscopy and Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) are complementary, non-destructive techniques that provide rich and distinct insights into the structural and electronic properties of materials. Raman spectroscopy offers detailed information on vibrational modes, phase transitions, temperature, and local stress, while SHG is highly sensitive to symmetry and orientation, particularly in non-centrosymmetric structures. In this work, in addition to combining both techniques, we propose a novel approach to determine the nonlinear optical tensor, leveraging the spatial and ultra-fast temporal offset of a Bessel-Gaussian laser beam at the microscope's focal point.

Title: Generalized Time-Varying Drude Model for Dispersive and Lossy Modulations
Authors: Antonio Ganfornina-Andrades, J. Enrique Vázquez-Lozano, Iñigo Liberal, S. A. R. Horsley
Abstract: We develop a generalization of the time-varying Drude model, treating carrier density, effective mass, and collision rate as explicit functions of time. We derive expressions for polarization, susceptibility, displacement, and permittivity in different domains. Our analysis reveals that non-adiabatic modulations and time-dependent losses induce rich and distinct behaviors, leading to temporal blurring, selective gating and suppression, and low-frequency spectral reshaping. Besides underpinning and upgrading the current framework on photonics of time-varying media, this model may be useful in the design and fitting theoretical models with experimental realizations.

Title: Comprehensive Numerical Studies of Barren Plateau and Overparametrization in Variational Quantum Algorithm
Authors: Himuro Hashimoto, Akio Nakabayashi, Lento Nagano, Yutaro Iiyama, Ryu Sawada, Junichi Tanaka, Koji Terashi
Abstract: The variational quantum algorithm (VQA) with a parametrized quantum circuit is widely applicable to near-term quantum computing, but its fundamental issues that limit optimization performance have been reported in the literature. For example, VQA optimization often suffers from vanishing gradients called barren plateau (BP) and the presence of local minima in the landscape of the cost function. Numerical studies have shown that the trap in local minima is significantly reduced when the circuit is overparametrized (OP), where the number of parameters exceeds a certain threshold. Theoretical understanding of the BP and OP phenomena has advanced over the past years, however, comprehensive studies of both effects in the same setting are not fully covered in the literature. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive numerical study in VQA, quantitatively evaluating the impacts of BP and OP and their interplay on the optimization of a variational quantum circuit, using concrete implementations of one-dimensional transverse and longitudinal field quantum Ising model. The numerical results are compared with the theoretical diagnostics of BP and OP phenomena. The framework presented in this paper will provide a guiding principle for designing VQA algorithms and ansatzes with theoretical support for behaviors of parameter optimization in practical settings.

Title: Information-Theoretic Multi-Model Fusion for Target-Oriented Adaptive Sampling in Materials Design
Authors: Yixuan Zhang, Zhiyuan Li, Weijia He, Mian Dai, Chen Shen, Teng Long, Hongbin Zhang
Abstract: Target-oriented discovery under limited evaluation budgets requires making reliable progress in high-dimensional, heterogeneous design spaces where each new measurement is costly, whether experimental or high-fidelity simulation. We present an information-theoretic framework for target-oriented adaptive sampling that reframes optimization as trajectory discovery: instead of approximating the full response surface, the method maintains and refines a low-entropy information state that concentrates search on target-relevant directions. The approach couples data, model beliefs, and physics/structure priors through dimension-aware information budgeting, adaptive bootstrapped distillation over a heterogeneous surrogate reservoir, and structure-aware candidate manifold analysis with Kalman-inspired multi-model fusion to balance consensus-driven exploitation and disagreement-driven exploration. Evaluated under a single unified protocol without dataset-specific tuning, the framework improves sample efficiency and reliability across 14 single- and multi-objective materials design tasks spanning candidate pools from $600$ to $4 \times 10^6$ and feature dimensions from $10$ to $10^3$, typically reaching top-performing regions within 100 evaluations. Complementary 20-dimensional synthetic benchmarks (Ackley, Rastrigin, Schwefel) further demonstrate robustness to rugged and multimodal landscapes.

Title: Radial gradient of superionic hydrogen in Earth's inner core
Authors: Zepeng Wu, Liangrui Wei, Chen Gao, Shunqing Wu, Renata M. Wentzcovitch, Yang Sun
Abstract: Hydrogen is considered a major light element in Earth's core, yet the thermodynamics of its superionic phase and its distribution in the inner core remain unclear. Here, we compute ab initio Gibbs free energies for liquid and superionic hcp and bcc Fe-H phases and construct the superionic-liquid phase diagram over pressure-temperature conditions relevant to the Earth's inner core. We find that phase diagrams at different inner-core pressures collapse when temperatures are scaled by the melting temperature of pure iron, indicating that solid-liquid partitioning is controlled primarily by a reduced temperature relative to iron melting and is weakly sensitive to pressure. This scaling relation further reconciles previously reported discrepancies in partition coefficients among theoretical studies and yields good agreement with available experimental data at low pressures. By applying thermochemical constraints, our free-energy results reveal a radial hydrogen gradient within the inner core. These results demonstrate that compositional gradients of superionic hydrogen in the inner core emerge naturally from equilibrium thermodynamics and suggest a general mechanism governing the depth-dependent distribution of light elements within Earth's inner core.

Title: How to Train Your Resistive Network: Generalized Equilibrium Propagation and Analytical Learning
Authors: Jonathan Lin, Aman Desai, Frank Barrows, Francesco Caravelli
Abstract: Machine learning is a powerful method of extracting meaning from data; unfortunately, current digital hardware is extremely energy-intensive. There is interest in an alternative analog computing implementation that could match the performance of traditional machine learning while being significantly more energy-efficient. However, it remains unclear how to train such analog computing systems while adhering to locality constraints imposed by the physical (as opposed to digital) nature of these systems. Local learning algorithms such as Equilibrium Propagation and Coupled Learning have been proposed to address this issue. In this paper, we develop an algorithm to exactly calculate gradients using a graph theoretic and analytical framework for Kirchhoff's laws. We also introduce Generalized Equilibrium Propagation, a framework encompassing a broad class of Hebbian learning algorithms, including Coupled Learning and Equilibrium Propagation, and show how our algorithm compares. We demonstrate our algorithm using numerical simulations and show that we can train resistor networks without the need for a replica or readout over all resistors, only at the output layer. We also show that under the analytical gradient approach, it is possible to update only a subset of the resistance values without a strong degradation in performance.

Title: Entropy Geometry and Condensation in Wealth Allocation
Authors: Korak Biswas
Abstract: We develop a statistical framework for wealth allocation in which agents hold discrete units of wealth and macrostates are defined by how wealth is distributed across agents. The structure of the economic state space is characterized through a value convertibility function, which captures how effectively additional wealth can be transformed into productive or meaningful value. The derivative of this function determines the effective number of internally distinct configurations available to an agent at a given wealth level. In a closed setting with fixed total wealth and a fixed number of agents, we show that equilibrium wealth distributions follow directly from unbiased counting of admissible configurations and may display a condensation phenomenon, where a finite fraction of total wealth accumulates onto a single agent once the remaining agents can no longer absorb additional wealth. We then extend the framework to open systems in which both total wealth and the number of agents may vary. By embedding the system within a larger closed environment and analyzing a finite subsystem, we show that exponential weighting in wealth and agent number emerges naturally from counting arguments alone, without invoking explicit optimization or entropy maximization principles. This extension leads to a richer interpretation of wealth concentration: accumulation is no longer driven solely by excess wealth, but by a balance between wealth growth and the system's capacity to accommodate new agents. Condensation arises when this capacity is limited, forcing surplus wealth to concentrate onto a few agents. The framework thus provides a minimal and structurally grounded description of wealth concentration in both closed and open economic settings.

Title: Thermodynamics of the Heisenberg XXX chain with negative spin
Authors: Rong Zhong, Yang-Yang Chen, Kun Hao, Wen-li Yang, Vladimir Korepin
Abstract: We study the thermodynamics of the isotropic Heisenberg XXX spin chain with negative spin, focusing on the case $s=-1$. The model is equivalent to the quantum lattice nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) model and appears as an effective theory in deep inelastic scattering in high-energy quantum chromodynamics. Owing to its integrability, it admits a consistent Bethe Ansatz description and a well-defined thermodynamic limit. Using the thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz, we analyze the ground state, elementary excitations, and finite-temperature properties. In contrast to the conventional positive spin XXX chain, the negative spin model exhibits a distinct vacuum structure and excitation spectrum, leading to modified TBA equations and unconventional low-temperature behavior. Although the integral equations resemble those of the Lieb-Liniger Bose gas, the thermodynamics and scaling properties are qualitatively different and cannot be continuously connected. We derive the free energy, entropy, and specific heat, and identify a quantum phase transition separating different thermodynamic regimes. At zero temperature, the excitation spectrum becomes linear in the continuum limit and can be described by a conformal field theory. The low-temperature regime realizes a Luttinger-liquid like phase with features unique to the negative spin XXX chain.

Title: Transformation front kinetics in deformable ferromagnets
Authors: Michael Poluektov
Abstract: Materials such as magnetic shape-memory alloys possess an intrinsic coupling between material's magnetisation and mechanical deformation. These materials also undergo structural phase transitions, with phase boundaries separating different phases and the kinetics of the phase boundaries governed by the magnetic field and the mechanical stresses. There is a multiplicity of other materials revealing similar phenomena, e.g. magnetic perovskites. To model the propagation of the phase boundaries in deformable magnetic materials at the continuum scale, three ingredients are required: a set of governing equations for the bulk behaviour with coupled magnetic and mechanical degrees of freedom, a dependency of the phase boundary velocity on the governing factors, and a reliable computational method. The expression for the phase boundary velocity is usually obtained within the continuum thermodynamics setting, where the entropy production due to phase boundary propagation is derived, which gives a thermodynamic driving force for the phase boundary kinetics. For deformable ferromagnets, all three elements (bulk behaviour, interface kinetics, and computational approaches) have been explored, but under a number of limitations. The present paper focuses on the derivation of the thermodynamic driving force for transformation fronts in a general magneto-mechanical setting, adapts the cut-finite-element method for transformation fronts in magneto-mechanics, which allows for an exceptionally efficient handling of the propagating interfaces, without modifying the finite-element mesh, and applies the developments to qualitative modelling of magneto-mechanics of magnetic shape-memory alloys.

Title: Accelerating qubit reset through the Mpemba effect
Authors: Théo Lejeune, Miha Papič, John Goold, Felix C. Binder, François Damanet, Mattia Moroder
Abstract: Passive qubit reset is a key primitive for quantum information processing, whereby qubits are initialized by allowing them to relax to their ground state through natural dissipation, without the need for active control or feedback. However, passive reset occurs on timescales that are much longer than those of gate operations and measurements, making it a significant bottleneck for algorithmic execution. Here, we show that this limitation can be overcome by exploiting the Mpemba effect, originally indicating the faster cooling of hot systems compared to cooler ones. Focusing on the regime where coherence times exceed energy relaxation times ($T_2 > T_1$), we propose a simple protocol based on a single entangling two-qubit gate that converts local single-qubit coherences into fast-decaying global two-qubit coherences. This removes their overlap with the slowest decaying Liouvillian mode and enables a substantially faster relaxation to the ground state. For realistic parameters, we find that our protocol can reduce reset times by up to $50\%$ compared to standard passive reset. We analyze the robustness of the protocol under non-Markovian noise, imperfect coherent control and finite temperature, finding that the accelerated reset persists across a broad range of realistic error sources. Finally, we present an experimental implementation of our protocol on an IQM superconducting quantum processor. Our results demonstrate how Mpemba-like accelerated relaxation can be harnessed as a practical tool for fast and accurate qubit initialization.

Title: Tensorized orbitals for computational chemistry
Authors: Nicolas Jolly, Yuriel Núñez Fernández, Xavier Waintal
Abstract: Choosing a basis set is the first step of a quantum chemistry calculation and it sets its maximum accuracy. This choice of orbitals is limited by strong technical constraints as one must be able to compute a large number of six dimensional Coulomb integrals from these orbitals. Here we use tensor network techniques to construct representations of orbitals that essentially lift these technical constraints. We show that a large class of orbitals can be put into ``tensorized'' form including the Gaussian orbitals, Slater orbitals, linear combination thereof as well as new orbitals beyond the above. Our method provides a path for building more accurate and more compact basis sets beyond what has been accessible with previous technology. As an illustration, we construct optimized tensorized orbitals and obtain a 85% reduction of the error on the energy of the $H_2$ molecules with respect to a reference double zeta calculation (cc-pvDz) of the same size.

Title: Exotic 4f Correlated Electronic States of Ferromagnetic Kondo Lattice Compounds ReRh$_6$Ge$_4$ (Re=Ce, Ho, Er, Tm)
Authors: Caiqun Wang, Yu Gao, Jun Jiang, Qiaoni Chen, Haiyan Lu, Ping Qian
Abstract: CeRh$_6$Ge$_4$ stands out as the first stoichiometric metallic compound with a ferromagnetic quantum critical point, thereby garnering significant attention. Ferromagnetic Kondo lattice compounds ReRh$_6$Ge$_4$ (Re=Ce, Ho, Er, Tm) have been systematically investigated with density functional theory incorporating Coulomb interaction U and spin-orbital coupling. We determined the magnetic easy axis of CeRh$_6$Ge$_4$ is within the ab plane, which is in agreement with previous magnetization measurements conducted under external magnetic field and muSR experiments. We also predicted the magnetic easy axes for the other three compounds. For TmRh$_6$Ge$_4$, the magnetic easy axis aligns along the c axis, thus preserving the $C_3$ rotational symmetry of the c axis. Especially, there are triply degenerate nodal points along the $\Gamma-A$ direction in the band structure including spin-orbital coupling. A possible localized to itinerant crossover is revealed as $4f$ electrons increase from CeRh$_6$Ge$_4$ to TmRh$_6$Ge$_4$. Specifically, the $4f$ electrons of TmRh$_6$Ge$_4$ contribute to the formation of a large Fermi surface, indicating their participation in the conduction process. Conversely, the $4f$ electrons in HoRh$_6$Ge$_4$, ErRh$_6$Ge$_4$ and CeRh$_6$Ge$_4$ remain localized, which result in smaller Fermi surfaces for these compounds. These theoretical investigations on electronic structure and magnetic properties shed deep insight into the unique nature of $4f$ electrons, providing critical predictions for subsequent experimental studies.

Title: Large time effective kinetics $β$-functions for quantum (2+p)-spin glass
Authors: Vincent Lahoche, Dine Ousmane Samary, Parham Radpay
Abstract: This paper examines the quantum $(2+p)$-spin dynamics of a $N$-vector $\textbf{x}\in \mathbb{R}^N$ through the lens of renormalization group (RG) theory. The RG is based on a coarse-graining over the eigenvalues of matrix-like disorder, viewed as an effective kinetic whose eigenvalue distribution undergoes a deterministic law in the large $N$ limit. We focus our investigation on perturbation theory and vertex expansion for effective average action, which proves more amenable than standard nonperturbative approaches due to the distinct non-local temporal and replicative structures that emerge in the effective interactions following disorder integration. Our work entails the formulation of rules to address these non-localities within the framework of perturbation theory, culminating in the derivation of one-loop $\beta$-functions. Our explicit calculations focus on the cases $p=3$, $p=\infty$, and additional analytic material is given in the appendix.

Title: Role of scaling dimensions in generalized noises in fractional quantum Hall tunneling due to a temperature bias
Authors: Matteo Acciai, Gu Zhang, Christian Spånslätt
Abstract: Continued improvement of heat control in mesoscopic conductors brings novel tools for probing strongly correlated electron phenomena. Motivated by these advances, we comprehensively study transport due to a temperature bias in a quantum point contact device in the fractional quantum Hall regime. We compute the charge-current noise (so-called delta-$T$ noise), heat-current noise, and mixed noise and elucidate how these observables can be used to infer strongly correlated properties of the device. Our main focus is the extraction of so-called scaling dimensions of the tunneling anyonic quasiparticles, of critical importance to correctly infer their anyonic exchange statistics.

Title: Nonlocal conductance of a Majorana wire near the topological transition
Authors: Vladislav D. Kurilovich, William S. Cole, Roman M. Lutchyn, Leonid I. Glazman
Abstract: We develop a theory of the nonlocal conductance $G_{RL}(V)$ for a disordered Majorana wire tuned near the topological transition critical point. Under these conditions, the antisymmetric part of the differential conductance, $[G_{RL}(V) - G_{RL}(-V)] /2$, is the dominant one for a sufficiently long wire. This reflects the charge-neutral nature of the critical modes in the wire. We factorize the conductance into a term describing propagation of the critical modes along the wire, and terms describing the contacts between the wire and the normal leads. Topological transition affects only the former term. At the critical point, the localization length has a logarithmic singularity at the Fermi level, $l(E) \propto \ln(1 / E)$. This singularity directly manifests in the conductance magnitude, as $\ln |G_{RL}(V) / G_Q| \sim L / l(eV)$ for the wire of length $L \gg l(eV)$. Tuning the wire away from the immediate vicinity of the critical point changes the monotonicity of $l(E)$. This change in monotonicity allows us to define the width of the critical region around the transition point.

Title: Triggered ferroelectricity in HfO$_2$ from hybrid phonons and higher-order dynamical charges
Authors: Seongjoo Jung, Turan Birol
Abstract: Ferroelectric HfO$_2$ has emerged as a highly promising material for high-density nonvolatile memory and nanoscale transistor applications. However, the uncertain origin of polarization in HfO$_2$ limits our ability to fully understand and control its ferroelectricity. Ferroelectricity, the emergence of a spontaneous and switchable polarization in solids, is conventionally understood to be governed by unstable structural modes (phonons), arising either directly from an unstable polar phonon or indirectly through coupling of unstable nonpolar phonons with a polar mode. While these 'proper' and 'improper' mechanisms successfully explain ferroelectricity for most systems, they do not encompass all possible phenomena. Here, we present a novel mechanism of 'hybrid-triggered' ferroelectricity, where a polar order emerges through trilinear coupling without any structural instabilities. Our group theoretical analysis starting from a high-symmetry reference structure shows that this mechanism is realized in intensely-debated ferroelectric HfO$_2$, along with quantitative confirmation from first-principles calculations. We also show that dynamical charges in this material are highly unconventional, and a significant contribution to the total polarization arises solely from high-order couplings of nonpolar phonons. These findings underline that even simple crystal structures can host surprisingly complicated interplay between different structural orders, elucidate the origin of ferroelectricity and antiferroelectricity in fluorite-related structures, and provide foundational understanding for designing superior ferroelectric materials.

Title: Microscopic theory of Chern polarization via crystalline defect charge
Authors: Thivan M. Gunawardana, Frank Schindler, Ari M. Turner, Ryan Barnett
Abstract: The modern theory of polarization does not apply in its original form to systems with non-trivial band topology. Chern insulators are one such example. Defining polarization for them is complicated because they are insulating in the bulk but exhibit metallic edge states. Wannier functions formed a key ingredient of the original modern theory of polarization, but it has been considered that these cannot be applied to Chern insulators since they are no longer exponentially localized and the Wannier center, obtained from the Zak phase, is no longer gauge invariant. In this article, we provide an unambiguous definition of absolute polarization for a Chern insulator in terms of the Zak phase. We obtain our expression by studying the non-quantized fractional charge bound to lattice dislocations. Our expression can be computed directly from bulk quantities and makes no assumption on the edge state filling. It is fully consistent with previous results on the quantized charge bound to dislocations in the presence of crystalline symmetry. At the same time, our result is more general since it also applies to Chern insulators which do not have crystalline symmetries other than translations.

Title: Gauging Modulated Symmetries via Multiple Gauge Symmetry Operators and Adaptive Quantum Circuits
Authors: Jintae Kim, Jong Yeon Lee, Jung Hoon Han
Abstract: We introduce an extended framework for the simultaneous gauging of modulated symmetries in $(d+1)$ dimensions, employing {\it multiple} gauge symmetry operators whose corresponding gauging procedures must be carried out simultaneously. Simultaneous gauging can capture a broader class of dualities than sequential gauging, the latter corresponding to the conventional gauging applied in successive steps. In general, performing simultaneous gauging and conventional gauging in sequence constitutes the most general framework for gauging modulated symmetries. We further show that the associated duality transformations can be implemented via adaptive state preparation protocols. As a concrete example, we consider a dipole symmetry in $(2+1)$D and illustrate both the simultaneous gauging procedure and the adaptive preparation protocol. Interestingly, we find that the intermediate state of the simultaneous gauging/adaptive circuit corresponds to a symmetry-protected topological phase protected by the dipole bundle symmetry. Finally, we utilize the duality to analyze the phase diagram of the rank-2 toric code under transverse fields.

Title: The theory of planar ballistic SNS junctions at $T=0$
Authors: Edouard B. Sonin
Abstract: The Letter presents the theory of planar ballistic SNS junctions at $T=0$ for any normal layer thickness $L$ taking into account phase gradients in superconducting leads. The current-phase relation was derived in the model of the steplike pairing potential analytically and is exact in the limit of large ratio of the Fermi energy to the superconducting gap. At small $L$ (short junction) the obtained current-phase relation is essentially different from that in the previous theory neglecting phase gradients. It was confirmed by recent numerical calculations and was observed in the experiment on short InAs nanowire Josephson junctions. The analysis resolves the problem with the charge conservation law in the steplike pairing potential model.

Title: Energy Cascades in Driven Granular Liquids : A new Universality Class? I : Model and Symmetries
Authors: O. Coquand
Abstract: This article deals with the existence and scaling of an energy cascade in steady granular liquid flows between the scale at which the system is forced and the scale at which it dissipates energy. In particular, we examine the possible origins of a breaking of the Kolmogorov Universality class that applies to Newtonian liquids under similar conditions. In order to answer these questions, we build a generic field theory of granular liquid flows and, through a study of its symmetries, show that indeed the Kolmogorov scaling can be broken, although most of the symmetries of the Newtonian flows are preserved.

Title: Pulsed Magnetophononics in Gapped Quantum Magnets
Authors: B. Demazure, M. Krebs, G. S. Uhrig, B. Normand
Abstract: One route to the control of quantum magnetism at ultrafast timescales is magnetophononics, the modulation of magnetic interactions by coherently driven lattice excitations. Theoretical studies of a gapped quantum magnet subject to continuous, single-frequency driving of one strongly coupled phonon mode find intriguing phenomena including mutually repelling phonon-bitriplon excitations and global renormalization of the spin excitation spectrum. Because experiments are performed with ultrashort pulses that contain a wide range of driving frequencies, we investigate phonon-bitriplon physics under pulsed laser driving. We use the equations of motion to compute the transient response of the driven and dissipative spin-phonon system, which we characterize using the phonon displacement, phonon number, and triplon occupations. In the Fourier transforms of each quantity we discover a low-frequency energetic oscillation between the lattice and spin sectors, which is an intrinsically nonequilibrium collective mode, and demonstrate its origin as a beating between mutually repelling composite excitations. We introduce a phonon-bitriplon approximation that captures all the physics of hybridization, collective mode formation, and difference-frequency excitation, and show that sum-frequency phenomena also leave clear signatures in the repsonse. We model the appearance of such magnetophononic phenomena in the strongly-coupled spin-chain compound CuGeO$_3$, whose overlapping phonon and spin excitation spectra are well characterized, to deduce the criteria for their possible observation in quantum magnetic materials.

Title: Beyond Point Particles -- Extended Structural Dynamics and the H Theorem
Authors: Patrick BarAvi
Abstract: We propose an extended structural dynamics framework that enriches classical mechanics by treating particle orientation and internal structure as fundamental phase-space coordinates. This extension preserves Hamiltonian structure and Liouville invariance while revealing two distinct mechanisms for entropy production: (i) collisional randomization through orientation-dependent scattering (generalizing Boltzmann), and (ii) continuous geometric instability arising from rotational-deformational coupling. We argue this dual-mechanism structure provides a dynamical justification for the molecular chaos assumption central to Boltzmann-Lanford derivations, particularly in regimes (dense systems, few bodies, structured particles) where classical point-particle theory fails. Recent mathematical advances (Deng, Hani & Ma 2024) extend Lanford's theorem to arbitrary times but still require molecular chaos as input and apply only to dilute gases. This extended structural framework addresses the complementary philosophical question: how can molecular chaos itself emerge from deterministic dynamics? We show that geometric instability in extended phase space makes entropy-decreasing trajectories dynamically unstable, offering a structural explanation for the Second Law. This reframes thermodynamic irreversibility as a geometric property of structured motion rather than a purely statistical postulate.

Title: Liouvillian skin effects in two-dimensional electron systems at finite temperatures
Authors: Yuta Shigedomi, Tsuneya Yoshida
Abstract: Liouvillian skin effects, manifested as the localization of Liouvillian eigenstates around the boundary, are distinctive features of non-Hermitian systems and are particularly notable for their impact on system dynamics. Despite their significance, Liouvillian skin effects have not been sufficiently explored in electron systems. In this work, we demonstrate that a two-dimensional electron system on a substrate exhibits $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Liouvillian skin effects due to the interplay among energy dissipations, spin-orbit coupling, and a transverse magnetic field. In addition, our analysis of the temperature dependence reveals that these Liouvillian skin effects become pronounced below the energy scale of band splitting induced by the spin-orbit coupling and the magnetic field. While our $\mathbb{Z}$ Liouvillian skin effect leads to charge accumulation under quench dynamics, its relaxation time is independent of the system size, in contrast to that of previously reported Liouvillian skin effects. This difference is attributed to the scale-free behavior of the localization length, which is analogous to non-Hermitian critical skin effects.

Title: Sharp spectroscopic fingerprints of disorder in an incompressible magnetic state

Abstract: Disorder significantly impacts the electronic properties of conducting quantum materials by inducing electron localization and thus altering the local density of states and electric transport. In insulating quantum magnetic materials, the effects of disorder are less understood and can drastically impact fluctuating spin states like quantum spin liquids. In the absence of transport tools, disorder is typically characterized using chemical methods or by semi-classical modeling of spin dynamics. This requires high magnetic fields that may not always be accessible. Here, we show that magnetization plateaus -- incompressible states found in many quantum magnets -- provide an exquisite platform to uncover small amounts of disorder, regardless of the origin of the plateau. Using optical magneto-spectroscopy on the Ising-Heisenberg triangular-lattice antiferromagnet K$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$ exhibiting a 1/3 magnetization plateau, we identify sharp spectroscopic lines, the fine structure of which serves as a hallmark signature of disorder. Through analytical and numerical modeling, we show that these fingerprints not only enable us to quantify minute amounts of disorder but also reveal its nature -- as dilute vacancies. Remarkably, this model explains all details of the thermomagnetic response of our system, including the existence of multiple plateaus. Our findings provide a new approach to identifying disorder in quantum magnets.

Title: Ultracoherent self-assembled diamond nanomechanics reveals superfluid dynamics
Authors: Guanhao Huang, Chang Jin, Sophie Weiyi Ding, Chaoshen Zhang, Aaron M. Day, Tobias Elbs, Neil Sinclair, Sukhad Dnyanesh Joshi, Rodrick Kuate Defo, Bertrand I. Halperin, Evelyn Hu, Marko Lončar
Abstract: From gravitational-wave detection, protein force microscopy, to exploration of quantum-classical boundaries, many anticipated discoveries in fundamental science require improving measurement sensitivity limits. Through the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, mechanical dissipation sets the acoustic noise for this limit. Yet, even in high-purity crystals, the microscopic mechanisms responsible for the acoustic loss remain poorly understood. Tension-induced dissipation dilution offers a route to ultralow acoustic loss, but is challenging to implement in crystalline materials including single-crystal diamond. Here we realize a strain-engineered diamond nanomechanical platform using a liquid-assisted van der Waals self-assembly process that harnesses intrinsic surface forces to apply tensile stress exceeding 1 GPa. At cryogenic temperatures these resonators achieve quality factors beyond 10 billion (intrinsic material quality factors beyond 100 million). This exceptional coherence turns them into a sensitive probe for residual dissipation, elucidating three distinct two-level-system channels and one topological dissipation channel from a surface superfluid helium film. Our work shows how advancing mechanical coherence opens access to new regimes of physics in hybrid quantum systems, precision metrology, and condensed-matter physics.

Title: Evaluation of real-space second Chern number using the kernel polynomial method
Authors: Rui Chen, Bin Zhou
Abstract: We evaluate the real-space second Chern number of four-dimensional Chern insulators using the kernel polynomial method. Our calculations are performed on a four-dimensional system with $30^4$ sites, and the numerical results agree well with theoretical expectations. Moreover, we show that the method is capable of capturing the disorder effects. This is evidenced by the phase diagram obtained for disordered systems, which agrees well with predictions from the self-consistent Born approximation. Furthermore, we extend the method to six dimensions and perform an exploratory real-space calculation of the third Chern number. Although finite-size effects prevent full quantization, the numerical results show qualitative agreement with theoretical expectations. The study represents a step forward in the real-space characterization of higher-dimensional topological phases.

Title: Trustworthy AI-based crack-tip segmentation using domain-guided explanations
Authors: Jesco Talies, Eric Breitbarth, David Melching
Abstract: Ensuring the trustworthiness and robustness of deep learning models remains a fundamental challenge, particularly in high-stakes scientific applications. In this study, we present a framework called attention-guided training that combines explainable artificial intelligence techniques with quantitative evaluation and domain-specific priors to guide model attention. We demonstrate that domain-specific feedback on model explanations during training can enhance the model's generalization capabilities. We validate our approach on the task of semantic crack tip segmentation in digital image correlation data, which is a key application in the fracture mechanical characterization of materials. By aligning model attention with physically meaningful stress fields, such as those described by Williams' analytical solution, attention-guided training ensures that the model focuses on physically relevant regions. This finally leads to improved generalization and more faithful explanations.

Title: Unified description of cuprate superconductors by fractionalized electrons emerging from integrated analyses of photoemission spectra and quasiparticle interference
Authors: Shiro Sakai, Youhei Yamaji, Fumihiro Imoto, Tsuyoshi Tamegai, Adam Kaminski, Takeshi Kondo, Yuhki Kohsaka, Tetsuo Hanaguri, Masatoshi Imada
Abstract: Electronic structure of high-temperature superconducting cuprates is studied by analyzing experimental data independently obtained from two complementary spectroscopies, one, quasiparticle interference (QPI) measured by scanning-tunneling microscopy and the other, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and by combining these two sets of data in a unified theoretical analysis. Through explicit calculations of experimentally measurable quantities, we show that a simple two-component fermion model (TCFM) representing electron fractionalization succeeds in reproducing various detailed features of these experimental data: ARPES and QPI data are concomitantly reproduced by the TCFM in full energy and momentum spaces. The measured QPI pattern reveals a signature characteristic of the TCFM, distinct from the conventional single-component prediction, supporting the validity of the electron fractionalization in the cuprate. The integrated analysis also solves the puzzles of ARPES and QPI data that are seemingly inconsistent with each other. The overall success of the TCFM offers a comprehensive understanding of the electronic structure of the cuprates. We further predict that a characteristic QPI pattern should appear in the unoccupied high-energy part if the fractionalization is at work. We propose that integrated-spectroscopy analyses offer a promising way to explore challenging issues of strongly correlated electron systems.

Title: Likelihood-Based Heterogeneity Inference Reveals Non-Stationary Effects in Biohybrid Cell-Cargo Transport
Authors: Jan Albrecht, Lara S. Dautzenberg, Manfred Opper, Carsten Beta, Robert Großmann
Abstract: Variability of motility behavior in populations of microbiological agents is a ubiquitous phenomenon even in the case of genetically identical cells. Accordingly, passive objects introduced into such biological systems and driven by them will also exhibit heterogeneous motion patterns. Here, we study a biohybrid system of passive beads driven by active ameboid cells and use a likelihood approach to estimate the heterogeneity of the bead dynamics from their discretely sampled trajectories. We showcase how this approach can deal with information-scarce situations and provides natural uncertainty bounds for heterogeneity estimates. Using these advantages we particularly uncover that the heterogeneity in the system is time-dependent.

Title: Hopper-Like Growth of Higher-Order Topological Insulators
Authors: Yutaro Tanaka, Shuai Zhang, Tiantian Zhang, Shuichi Murakami
Abstract: Understanding crystal growth and morphology is a fundamental issue in condensed matter physics. While crystal morphology due to the distribution and dynamics of the diffusion field has been intensively studied, how the intrinsic material properties affect crystal morphology remains unclear. In this Letter, we demonstrate that higher-order topological phases can give rise to hollowed crystal morphologies, where the corners advance faster than the central regions of the crystal, through an unconventional mechanism originating from topological electronic states. We quantitatively show this connection by analyzing both the fractal dimension $D_f$ and the fractal dimension of coastlines $D_{f,c}$. When we compare the crystals in the normal insulator and higher-order topological insulator phases with the same $D_{f}$ in the case of relatively rapid crystal growth, the former is in the dendritic shape, while the latter is in the hopper-like shape, quantified by the smaller $D_{f,c}$ in the higher-order topological phase.

Title: Ultrafast giant enhancement of second harmonic generation in a strongly correlated cobaltite
Authors: Yuchen Cui, Qiaomei Liu, Qiong Wu, Shuxiang Xu, Junhan Huang, Hao Wang, Rongsheng Li, Shanshan Han, Wei Xu, Li Du, Ming Lu, Chunmei Zhang, Shangfei Wu, Xinbo Wang, Tao Dong, Li Yue, Dong Wu, Nanlin Wang
Abstract: We report the observation of ultrafast photoinduced giant enhancement of optical second harmonic generation (SHG) efficiency in cobaltite YbBaCo4O7. Upon femtosecond pumping at energies above the band gap, the system exhibits an ultrafast enhancement in SHG intensity, reaching up to 60 % higher than the initial value, then decays into a long-lived excited state maintaining the enhancement. The enhancement scales linearly with pump fluence but shows no dependence on pump polarization. A pure electronic process sets in within the first ~200 fs and is accompanied by a pronounced anisotropic amplification of nonlinear susceptibility. We propose this anomalous SHG enhancement originates from ultrafast electronic band renormalization arising from dynamical modification of electron correlations. Our findings open a new avenue for ultrafast optical control of nonlinear properties in strongly correlated materials.

Title: Analytical solution of a free-fermion chain with time-dependent ramps
Authors: Viktor Eisler, Riccarda Bonsignori, Stefano Scopa
Abstract: We provide an exact analytical solution of the single-particle Schrödinger equation for a chain of non-interacting fermions subject to a time-dependent linear potential, with its slope varied as an arbitrary function of time. The resulting dynamics exhibit self-similar behavior, with a structure reminiscent of the domain wall melting problem, albeit characterized by a nontrivial time-dependent length scale and phase. Building on this solution, we derive hydrodynamic predictions for the evolution of particle density, current, and entanglement entropy along the chain. In the special case of a sudden quench, the system develops a breathing interface region, which may be interpreted as a realization of Wannier-Stark localization, as previously suggested on the basis of hydrodynamic arguments.

Title: Unconventional criticality in $O(D)$-invariant loop-constrained Landau theory
Authors: Svitlana Kondovych, Asle Sudbø, Flavio S. Nogueira
Abstract: We study an unconventional phase transition in ferroelectrics where the polarization field is constrained to be divergence-free, allowing only loop-like configurations. This local constraint fundamentally alters the critical behavior, driving the system beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm. A renormalization group analysis shows that the polarization acquires an unusually large anomalous dimension, $\eta\approx 0.239$ in three dimensions, far exceeding the typical values in $O(3)$-invariant systems. We attribute this effect to a naturally induced gauge symmetry originating from the zero divergence constraint. Such gauge-field behavior is reminiscent of fractionalized phases, revealing a fundamental connection between constrained ferroelectrics and emergent gauge phenomena in correlated matter.

Title: Fabrication and Structural Analysis of Trilayers for Tantalum Josephson Junctions with Ta$_2$O$_5$ Barriers
Authors: Raahul Potluri, Rohin Tangirala, Jiangteng Liu, Alejandro Barrios, Praveen Kumar, Sage R. Bauers, Peter V. Sushko, David P. Pappas, Serena Eley
Abstract: Tantalum (Ta) has emerged as a promising low-loss material, enabling record coherence times in superconducting qubits. This enhanced performance is largely attributed to its stable native oxide, which may host fewer two-level system (TLS) defects, which are the key contributors to decoherence in superconducting circuits. Nevertheless, aluminum oxide remains the predominant choice for Josephson junction (JJ) barriers in most qubit architectures. Here, we investigate techniques for forming high-quality oxide layers on $\alpha$-phase tantalum films to develop tantalum-oxide JJ barriers. We explore thermal oxidation in a tube furnace, rapid thermal annealing, and plasma oxidation of both room-temperature and heated Ta films, characterize the resulting structures using X-ray techniques and electron microscopy, and propose a mechanistic picture of the oxidation pathways. We find that plasma oxidation provides the smoothest Ta$_2$O$_5$ layers, is compatible with in situ Ta deposition, and offers thickness control through the annealing temperature, advantageous for JJ fabrication. Lastly, we evaluate methods for growing Ta/TaO$_x$/Ta trilayers. All trilayers showed c-axis-oriented columnar growth of the bottom Ta layer, with sapphire substrates producing larger, better-aligned grains yet higher dislocation densities than silicon. Nucleation of c-axis-oriented $\alpha$-Ta on tantalum-oxide required an Nb seed layer, as direct Ta deposition yielded amorphous Ta. These results demonstrate the feasibility of $\alpha$-Ta/Nb/TaO$_x$/$\alpha$-Ta stacks for JJs with clean interfaces.

Title: Evolution of electronic and magnetic properties in Mn- and Co-alloyed ferromagnetic kagome metal Fe3Sn2

Abstract: Kagome metals are an intriguing class of quantum materials as the presence of both flat bands and Dirac points provides access to functional properties present in strongly correlated and topological materials. To fully harness these electronic features, the ability to tune the Fermi level relative to the band positions is needed. Here we explore the structural, electronic and magnetic impacts of substitutional alloying within ferromagnetic kagome metal Fe3Sn2 in thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. Transition metals Mn and Co are chosen as substitutes for Fe to reduce or increase the d-band electron count, thereby moving the Fermi level accordingly. We find that Co is not incorporated into the Fe3Sn2 structure but instead results in a two-phase Fe-Co and (Fe,Co)Sn composite. In contrast, Fe3-xMnxSn2 films are realized with x up to 1.0, retaining crystalline quality comparable to the parent phase. The incorporation of Mn repositions the flat bands relative to the Fermi level in a manner consistent with hole-doping, as revealed by hard x-ray photoemission and density functional theory. The Fe3-xMnxSn2 films retain room temperature ferromagnetism, with x-ray magnetic circular dichroism measurements confirming that the Fe and Mn moments are ferromagnetically aligned. The ability to hole-dope this magnetic kagome metal provides a platform for tuning properties such as anomalous Hall and Nernst responses.

Title: Liquid anomalies and Fragility of Supercooled Antimony
Authors: Flavio Giuliani, Francesco Guidarelli Mattioli, Yuhan Chen, Daniele Dragoni, Marco Bernasconi, John Russo, Lilia Boeri, Riccardo Mazzarello
Abstract: Phase-change materials (PCMs) based on group IV, V, and VI elements, such as Ge, Sb, and Te, exhibit distinctive liquid-state features, including thermodynamic anomalies and unusual dynamical properties, which are believed to play a key role in their fast and reversible crystallization behavior. Antimony (Sb), a monoatomic PCM with ultrafast switching capabilities, stands out as the only elemental member of this group for which the properties of the liquid and supercooled states have so far remained unknown. In this work, we use large-scale molecular dynamics simulations with a neural network potential trained on first-principles data to investigate the liquid, supercooled, and amorphous phases of Sb across a broad pressure-temperature range. We uncover clear signatures of anomalous behavior, including a density maximum and non-monotonic thermodynamic response functions, and introduce a novel octahedral order parameter that captures the structural evolution of the liquid. Moreover, extrapolation of the viscosity to the glass transition, based on configurational and excess entropies, indicates that Sb is a highly fragile material. Our results present a compelling new case for the connection between the liquid-state properties of phase-change materials and their unique ability to combine high amorphous-phase stability with ultrafast crystallization.

Title: Dynamics of stochastic oscillator chains with harmonic and FPUT potentials
Authors: Emilio N.M. Cirillo, Matteo Colangeli, Claudio Giberti, Lamberto Rondoni
Abstract: Inspired by recent studies on deterministic oscillator models, we introduce a stochastic one-dimensional model for a chain of interacting particles. The model consists of $N$ oscillators performing continuous-time random walks on the integer lattice $\mathbb{Z}$ with exponentially distributed waiting times. The oscillators are bound by confining forces to two particles that do not move, placed at positions $x_0$ and $x_{N+1}$, respectively, and they feel the presence of baths with given inverse temperatures: $\beta_L$ to the left, $\beta_B$ in the middle, and $\beta_R$ to the right. Each particle has an index and interacts with its nearest neighbors in index space through either a quadratic potential or a Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou type coupling. This local interaction in index space can give rise to effective long-range interactions on the spatial lattice, depending on the instantaneous configuration. Particle hopping rates are governed either by the Metropolis rule or by a modified version that breaks detailed balance at the interfaces between regions with different baths.

Title: Heat Coulomb blockade in a double-island metal-semiconductor device
Authors: A. V. Parafilo
Abstract: We study the thermal transport properties of a mesoscopic device comprising two metallic islands embedded in a two-dimensional electron gas in the integer quantum Hall regime. It is shown that the $2M$ ballistic edge channels connecting the islands to the external reservoirs and the $N$ inter-island channels play a central role in the phenomenon of heat Coulomb blockade. Unlike the single-island case, where the heat flux is reduced by exactly one quantum of thermal conductance, we predict an additional suppression proportional to the factor $M^2/(2N+M)^2$. We further examine a configuration in which the islands are placed between electrodes at different temperatures and identify the conditions under which the Wiedemann-Franz law is violated.

Title: Opposite impact of thermal expansion and phonon anharmonicity on the phonon-limited resistivity of elemental metals from first principles
Authors: Ao Wang, Junwen Yin, Félix Antoine Goudreault, Michel Côté, Olle Hellman, Samuel Poncé
Abstract: Understanding electrical resistivity in metals remains a central challenge in quantifying charge transport at finite temperature. Current first-principles calculations based on the Boltzmann transport equation often match experiments, yet they almost always neglect the effect of thermal expansion and phonon anharmonicity. We show that both effects exert an opposite impact on electron-phonon coupling and on electrical resistivity. Thermal expansion enhances the coupling and leads to overestimation of resistivity, whereas anharmonic effects reduce it. By explicitly incorporating both effects, we establish a more complete description of resistivity in elemental metals, demonstrated here for Pb, Nb, and Al.

Title: Dual thermal pseudo-critical features in a spin-1/2 Ising chain with twin-diamond geometry
Authors: Onofre Rojas
Abstract: We study the coupled twin-diamond chain, a decorated one-dimensional Ising model motivated by the magnetic structure of $\mathrm{Cu}_{2}(\mathrm{TeO}_{3})_{2}\mathrm{Br}_{2}$. By applying an exact mapping to an effective Ising chain, we obtain the full thermodynamic description of the system through a compact transfer-matrix formulation. The ground-state analysis reveals five distinct phases, including two frustrated sectors with extensive degeneracy. These frustrated regions give rise to characteristic entropy plateaus and separate the ordered phases in the zero-temperature diagram. At low temperatures the model exhibits peculiar sharp yet continuous variations of entropy, magnetization, and response functions, reflecting clear signatures of pseudo-transition behavior. The coupled twin-diamond chain thus provides an exactly solvable setting in which competing local configurations and internal frustration lead to pronounced dual pseudo-critical features in one dimension.

Title: Evaporative damping in open system theory of Bose-Einstein Condensates
Authors: Nils A. Krause, Ashton S. Bradley
Abstract: We derive a new damping mechanism in the open quantum systems description of Bose-Einstein condensates. It stems from previously neglected terms in the derivation of the stochastic projective Gross-Pitaevskii equation (SPGPE), accounting for a nonlinear evaporation of particles from the coherent into the incoherent region. We demonstrate that the mechanism, while so far assumed to be of minor importance, is comparable in strength to the widely employed number damping. We also provide a simplified (pseudo)-local and a dimensionally reduced form of this evaporative damping. The process completes the SPGPE description of ultracold Bose gases giving a full first-principles picture of their evolution at finite temperature.

Title: Generalized density functional theory framework for the non-linear density response of quantum many-body systems
Authors: Zhandos A. Moldabekov, Cheng Ma, Xuecheng Shao, Sebastian Schwalbe, Pontus Svensson, Panagiotis Tolias, Jan Vorberger, Tobias Dornheim
Abstract: A density functional theory (DFT) framework is presented that links functional derivatives of free-energy functionals to non-linear static density response functions in quantum many-body systems. Within this framework, explicit expressions are derived for various higher-order response functions of systems that are homogeneous on average, including the first theoretical result for the cubic response at the first harmonic $\chi_0^{(1,3)}(\vec{q})$. Specifically, our framework includes hitherto neglected mode-coupling effects that are important for the non-linear density response even in the presence of a single harmonic perturbation. We compare these predictions for $\chi_0^{(1,3)}(\vec{q})$ to new Kohn-Sham DFT simulations, leading to excellent agreement between theory and numerical results. Exact analytical expressions are also obtained for the long-wavelength limits of the ideal quadratic and cubic response functions. Particular emphasis is placed on the connections between the third- and fourth-order functional derivatives of the non-interacting free-energy functional $F_s[n]$ and the ideal quadratic and cubic response functions of the uniform electron gas, respectively. These relations provide exact constraints that may prove useful for the future construction of improved approximations to $F_s[n]$, in particular for warm dense matter applications at finite temperatures. Here, we use this framework to assess several commonly employed approximations to $F_s[n]$ through orbital-free DFT simulations of the harmonically perturbed ideal electron gas. The results are compared with Kohn-Sham DFT calculations across temperatures ranging from the ground state to the warm dense regime. Additionally, we analyze in detail the temperature- and wavenumber-dependent non-monotonic behavior of the ideal quadratic and cubic response functions.

Title: Correlation between the first-reaction time and the acquired boundary local time
Authors: Yilin Ye, Denis S. Grebenkov
Abstract: We investigate the statistical correlation between the first-reaction time of a diffusing particle and its boundary local time accumulated until the reaction event. Since the reaction event occurs after multiple encounters of the particle with a partially reactive boundary, the boundary local time as a proxy for the number of such encounters is not independent of, but intrinsically linked to, the first-reaction time. We propose a universal theoretical framework to derive their joint probability density and, in particular, the correlation coefficient. To illustrate the dependence of these correlations on the boundary reactivity and shape, we obtain explicit analytical solutions for several basic domains. The analytical results are complemented by Monte Carlo simulations, which we employ to examine the role of interior obstacles on correlations in disordered media. Applications of these statistical results in chemical physics are discussed

Title: Revisiting Jahn--Teller Transitions in Correlated Oxides with Monte Carlo Modeling
Authors: Liam A. V. Nagle-Cocco, Andrew L. Goodwin, Clare P. Grey, Siân E. Dutton
Abstract: Jahn--Teller (JT) distortions are a key driver of physical properties in many correlated oxide materials. Cooperative JT distortions, in which long-range orbital order reduces the symmetry of the average structure macroscopically, are common in JT-distorted materials at low temperatures. This long-range order will often melt on heating, \textit{via} a transition to a high-temperature state without long-range orbital order. The nature of this transition has been observed to vary with different materials depending on crystal structure; in LaMnO$_3$ the transition has generally been interpreted as order-disorder, whereas in layered nickelates $A$NiO$_2$ ($A$=Li,Na) there is a displacive transition. Alternatively, recent theoretical work has suggested that previous attributions of order-disorder may in fact be a consequence of phonon anharmonicity, rather than persistence of JT distortions, which would suggest that the displacive transition may be more common than currently believed. In this work, we run Monte Carlo simulations with a simple Hamiltonian which is modified to include terms dependent on the JT amplitude $\rho$, which is allowed to vary within the simulation \textit{via} the Metropolis algorithm. Our simulations yield distributions of JT amplitudes consistent with displacive rather than order-disorder behaviour for both perovskites and layered nickelates, suggesting that displacive-like JT transitions may be more common than previously assumed in both perovskites and layered nickelates. We also find significant differences between the transition observed for perovskites compared with layered nickelates, which we attribute to differing extensivity of configurational entropy on the two lattices, showing the crucial role of lattice geometry in determining behaviour.

Title: Electric-Switchable Chiral Magnons in PT-Symmetric Antiferromagnets
Authors: Jinyang Ni, Congzhe Yan, Peiyuan Cui, Zhijun Jiang, Yuanjun Jin, Guoqing Chang
Abstract: The magnons in antiferromagnetic insulators (AFIs) exhibit dual chirality, each carrying opposite spin angular momentum. However, in PT-symmetric AFIs, the magnon bands remain degenerate. In this work, we introduce a new class of PT-preserving AFIs in which the giant chiral splitting of magnons can be induced and controlled by an external electric field. Unlike conventional cases, such AFIs host a hidden dipole coupled to the antiferromagnetic order, which allows an external electric field to break the magnon sublattice symmetry and thereby largely lift the band degeneracy. Group theoretical analysis identifies the possible magnetic layer groups, while first-principles calculations and spin-wave theory reveal band splittings up to 20meV in Cr2CCl2 and Cr2CBr2 under the electric field of 0.2 V/Å, corresponding to an effective magnetic field of 200T. In addition, the electrically controlled magnon chiral splitting enables reversible switching of magnon-mediated spin currents. These findings open a new route toward nonvolatile spintronics based on magnons.

Title: Light-Emitting Diodes with Micrometer-Thick Perovskite Charge Transport Layers
Authors: Sang-Hyun Chin
Abstract: Over the past few decades, thin-film optoelectronic devices have shown significant advancements. Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) based on organic materials, polymers, quantum dots, as well as metal halide perovskites have achieved remarkable efficiencies and long lifetimes, making them ideal for applications in full-color displays and solid-state lighting. These devices typically feature a layered structure, with the light-emitting layer positioned between charge transport layers and two electrodes. This perspective reviews recent progress in LEDs utilizing perovskite charge transport layers and suggests potential pathways for further development in this field.

Title: Revealing Strain Effects on the Graphene-Water Contact Angle Using a Machine Learning Potential
Authors: Darren Wayne Lim, Xavier R. Advincula, William C. Witt, Fabian L. Thiemann, Christoph Schran
Abstract: Understanding how water wets graphene is critical for predicting and controlling its behavior in nanofluidic, sensing, and energy applications. A key measure of wetting is the contact angle made by a liquid droplet against the surface, yet experimental measurements for graphene span a wide range, and no consensus has emerged for free-standing graphene. Here, we use a machine learning potential with approaching ab initio accuracy to perform nanosecond-scale molecular dynamics and provide an atomistic first-principles benchmark for this unsolved problem. We find the contact angle of water on free-standing graphene, after finite-size correction, to be $72.1 \pm 1.5 °$. We also show that the three-phase contact line of a nanoscale water droplet couples strongly to the intrinsic thermal ripples of free-standing graphene, and that graphene's wetting properties are highly sensitive to mechanical strain. Tensile strain makes graphene significantly more hydrophobic, while compressive strain induces coherent ripples that the droplet "surfs", resulting in pronounced anisotropic wetting and contact angle hysteresis. Our results demonstrate that graphene's wetting properties are governed not only by its chemistry but also by its dynamic morphology, offering an additional explanation for the variability of experimental measurements. Furthermore, mechanical strain may be a practical route to controlling wetting in graphene-based technologies, with promising consequences for nanofluidic and nano-filtration applications.

Title: Invertible phases for mixed spatial symmetries and the fermionic crystalline equivalence principle
Authors: Arun Debray
Abstract: Freed-Hopkins give a mathematical ansatz for classifying gapped invertible phases of matter with a spatial symmetry in terms of Borel-equivariant generalized homology. We propose a slight generalization of this ansatz to account for cases where the symmetry type mixes nontrivially with the spatial symmetry, such as crystalline phases with spin-1/2 fermions. From this ansatz, we prove as a theorem a "fermionic crystalline equivalence principle," as predicted in the physics literature. Using this and the Adams spectral sequence, we compute classifications of some classes of phases with a point group symmetry; in cases where these phases have been studied by other methods, our results agree with the literature.

Title: Large Deviations in Safety-Critical Systems with Probabilistic Initial Conditions
Authors: Aitor R. Gomez, Manuela L. Bujorianu, Rafal Wisniewski
Abstract: We often rely on probabilistic measures -- e.g. event probability or expected time -- to characterize systems' safety. However, determining these quantities for extremely low-probability events is generally challenging, as standard safety methods usually struggle due to conservativeness, high-dimension scalability, tractability or numerical limitations. We address these issues by leveraging rigorous approximations grounded in the principles of Large Deviations theory. By assuming deterministic initial conditions, Large Deviations identifies a single dominant path in the low-noise limit as the most significant contributor to the rare-event probability: the instanton. We extend this result to incorporate stochastic uncertainty in the initial states, which is a common assumption in many applications. To that end, we determine an expression for the probability density of the initial states, conditioned on the unsafe rare event being observed. This expression gives access to the most probable initial conditions, as well as the most probable hitting time and path deviations, leading to the realization of the unsafe event. We demonstrate it's effectiveness by solving a high-dimensional and non-linear problem: a space collision.

Title: Generalized Tube Algebras, Symmetry-Resolved Partition Functions, and Twisted Boundary States
Authors: Yichul Choi, Brandon C. Rayhaun, Yunqin Zheng
Abstract: We introduce a class of generalized tube algebras which describe how finite, non-invertible global symmetries of bosonic 1+1d QFTs act on operators which sit at the intersection point of a collection of boundaries and interfaces. We develop a 2+1d symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT) picture of boundaries and interfaces which, among other things, allows us to deduce the representation theory of these algebras. In particular, we initiate the study of a character theory, echoing that of finite groups, and demonstrate how many representation-theoretic quantities can be expressed as partition functions of the SymTFT on various backgrounds, which in turn can be evaluated explicitly in terms of generalized half-linking numbers. We use this technology to explain how the torus and annulus partition functions of a 1+1d QFT can be refined with information about its symmetries. We are led to a vast generalization of Ishibashi states in CFT: to any multiplet of conformal boundary conditions which transform into each other under the action of a symmetry, we associate a collection of generalized Ishibashi states, in terms of which the twisted sector boundary states of the theory and all of its orbifolds can be obtained as linear combinations. We derive a generalized Verlinde formula involving the characters of the boundary tube algebra which ensures that our formulas for the twisted sector boundary states respect open-closed duality. Our approach does not rely on rationality or the existence of an extended chiral algebra; however, in the special case of a diagonal RCFT with chiral algebra $V$ and modular tensor category $\mathscr{C}$, our formalism produces explicit closed-form expressions - in terms of the $F$-symbols and $R$-matrices of $\mathscr{C}$, and the characters of $V$ - for the twisted Cardy states, and the torus and annulus partition functions decorated by Verlinde lines.

Title: Modelling Realistic Multi-layer devices for superconducting quantum electronic circuits
Authors: Giuseppe Colletta, Susan Johny, Jonathan A. Collins, Alessandro Casaburi, Martin Weides
Abstract: In this work, we present a numerical model specifically designed for 3D multilayer devices, with a focus on nanobridge junctions and coplanar waveguides. Unlike existing numerical models, ours does not approximate the physical layout or limit the number of constituent materials, providing a more accurate and flexible design tool. We calculate critical currents, current phase relationships, and the energy gap where relevant. We validate our model by comparing it with published data. Through our analysis, we found that using multilayer films significantly enhances control over these quantities. For nanobridge junctions in particular, multilayer structures improve qubit anharmonicity compared to monolayer junctions, offering a substantial advantage for qubit performance. For coated multilayer microwave circuits it allows for better studies of the proximity effect, including their effective kinetic inductance.

Abstract: Multiphase flows where particles, bubbles, or droplets are suspended in a fluid govern critical processes in biology, medicine, materials processing, and geophysics. However, observing their microscale dynamics in opaque systems has remained a fundamental challenge. We present Synchrotron X-ray Multi-Projection Imaging (XMPI), a novel approach enabling four-dimensional (3D+time) tracking of microparticles in dense suspension flows without requiring sample rotation. By capturing simultaneous projections from multiple angles using beam-split X-rays at synchrotron facilities, we resolve instantaneous particle positions and trajectories in opaque fluids such as blood. We demonstrate the potential of XMPI through individual particle tracking velocimetry (3D PTV) in dilute conditions, as well as multi-projection optical flow analysis in dense suspensions. The methodology provides otherwise inaccessible experimental validation for particle-resolved computational fluid dynamics models and allows, e.g., observation of inertial focusing effects and microstructural dynamics relevant to suspension rheology and biomedical flows. This work paves the way for high-resolution, time-resolved 4D imaging of complex multiphase flows across a range of scientific and industrial applications. Combining XMPI with recent AI-supported 4D reconstruction algorithms opens a new spatiotemporal frontier for high-speed, rotation-free microtomography.

Title: Neural Thermodynamics: Entropic Forces in Deep and Universal Representation Learning
Authors: Liu Ziyin, Yizhou Xu, Isaac Chuang
Abstract: With the rapid discovery of emergent phenomena in deep learning and large language models, understanding their cause has become an urgent need. Here, we propose a rigorous entropic-force theory for understanding the learning dynamics of neural networks trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants. Building on the theory of parameter symmetries and an entropic loss landscape, we show that representation learning is crucially governed by emergent entropic forces arising from stochasticity and discrete-time updates. These forces systematically break continuous parameter symmetries and preserve discrete ones, leading to a series of gradient balance phenomena that resemble the equipartition property of thermal systems. These phenomena, in turn, (a) explain the universal alignment of neural representations between AI models and lead to a proof of the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, and (b) reconcile the seemingly contradictory observations of sharpness- and flatness-seeking behavior of deep learning optimization. Our theory and experiments demonstrate that a combination of entropic forces and symmetry breaking is key to understanding emergent phenomena in deep learning.

Title: Robust Tripartite Entanglement Generation via Correlated Noise in Spin Qubits
Authors: Sander Driessen, Ji Zou, Even Thingstad, Jelena Klinovaja, Daniel Loss
Abstract: We investigate the generation of genuine tripartite entanglement in a triangular spin-qubit system due to spatially correlated noise. In particular, we demonstrate how the formation of a highly entangled dark state -- a W state -- enables robust, long-lived tripartite entanglement. Surprisingly, we find that environmentally induced coherent coupling does not play a crucial role in sustaining this entanglement. This contrasts sharply with the two-qubit case, where the induced coupling significantly influences the entanglement dynamics. Furthermore, we explore two promising approaches to enhance the tripartite entanglement by steering the system towards the dark state: post-selection and coherent driving. Our findings offer a robust method for generating high-fidelity tripartite entangled states with potential applications in quantum computation.

Title: Continuous-time parametrization of neural quantum states for quantum dynamics
Authors: Dingzu Wang, Wenxuan Zhang, Xiansong Xu, Dario Poletti
Abstract: Neural quantum states are a promising framework for simulating many-body quantum dynamics, as they can represent states with volume-law entanglement. As time evolves, the neural network parameters are typically optimized at discrete time steps to approximate the wave function at each point in time. Given the differentiability of the wave function stemming from the Schrödinger equation, here we impose a time-continuous and differentiable parameterization of the neural network by expressing its parameters as linear combinations of temporal basis functions with trainable, time-independent coefficients. We test this ansatz, referred to as the smooth neural quantum state (\textit{s}-NQS) with a loss function defined over an extended time interval, under a sudden quench of a non-integrable many-body quantum spin chain. We demonstrate accurate time evolution using a restricted Boltzmann machine as the instantaneous neural network architecture. We show that the parameterization enables accurate simulations with fewer variational parameters, independent of time-step resolution. Furthermore, the smooth neural quantum state also allows us to initialize and evaluate the wave function at times not included in the training set, both within and beyond the training interval.

Title: Free energy of the Coulomb gas in the determinantal case on Riemann surfaces
Authors: Lucas Bourgoin (IRMA)
Abstract: We derive the asymptotic expansion of the partition function of a Coulomb gas system in the determinantal case on compact Riemann surfaces of any genus g. Our main tool is the bosonization formula relating the analytic torsion and geometric quantities including the Green functions appearing in the definition of this partition function. As a result, we prove the geometric version of the Zabrodin-Wiegmann conjecture in the determinantal case.

Title: Error thresholds of toric codes with transversal logical gates
Authors: Yichen Xu, Yiqing Zhou, James P. Sethna, Eun-Ah Kim
Abstract: The threshold theorem promises a path to fault-tolerant quantum computation by suppressing logical errors, provided the physical error rate is below a critical threshold. While transversal gates offer an efficient method for implementing logical operations, they risk spreading errors and potentially lowering this threshold compared to a static quantum memory. Available threshold estimates for transversal circuits are empirically obtained and limited to specific, sub-optimal decoders. To establish rigorous bounds on the negative impact of error spreading by the transversal gates, we generalize the statistical mechanical (stat-mech) mapping from quantum memories to logical circuits. We establish a mapping for two toric code blocks that undergo a transversal CNOT (tCNOT) gate. Using this mapping, we quantify the impact of two independent error-spreading mechanisms: the spread of physical bit-flip errors and the spread of syndrome errors. In the former case, the stat-mech model is a 2D random Ashkin-Teller model. We use numerical simulation to show that the tCNOT gate reduces the optimal bit-flip error threshold to $p=0.080$, a $26\%$ decrease from the toric code memory threshold $p=0.109$. The case of syndrome error coexisting with bit-flip errors is mapped to a 3D random 4-body Ising model with a plane defect. There, we obtain a conservative estimate error threshold of $p=0.028$, implying an even more modest reduction due to the spread of the syndrome error compared to the memory threshold $p=0.033$. Our work establishes that an arbitrary transversal Clifford logical circuit can be mapped to a stat-mech model, and a rigorous threshold can be obtained correspondingly.

Title: Krylov Complexity of Supersymmetric SYK Models
Authors: James Chryssanthacopoulos, David Vegh
Abstract: We study the effect of supersymmetry breaking on Krylov complexity in the $\mathcal{N}=2$ SYK model under irrelevant and mass deformations of the Hamiltonian. The irrelevant deformation breaks $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry down to $\mathcal{N}=1$, while the mass deformation breaks supersymmetry completely. Using Krylov subspace methods, we analyze the Lanczos sequence, Krylov dimension, complexity, and entropy at finite system size as functions of deformation strength. Both deformations enlarge the Krylov space, but the mass deformation, which completely lifts the energy degeneracy, generates a stronger enhancement. Krylov complexity exhibits initial quadratic growth, followed by linear growth, across both deformations. We observe that both deformations increase the quadratic and linear growth rates of Krylov complexity at early times. At late times, the irrelevant deformation increases the saturation complexity as a fraction of the Krylov dimension, while the mass deformation decreases it. This reveals distinct signatures of how supersymmetry breaking impacts quantum complexity.

Abstract: Fiber reinforcement and polymer matrix respond differently to manufacturing conditions due to mismatch in coefficient of thermal expansion and matrix shrinkage during curing of thermosets. These heterogeneities generate residual stresses over multiple length scales, whose partial release leads to process-induced deformation (PID), requiring accurate prediction and mitigation via optimized non-isothermal cure cycles. This study considers a unidirectional AS4 carbon fiber/amine bi-functional epoxy prepreg and models PID using a two-mechanism framework that accounts for thermal expansion/shrinkage and cure shrinkage. The model is validated against manufacturing trials to identify initial and boundary conditions, then used to generate PID responses for a diverse set of non-isothermal cure cycles (time-temperature profiles). Building on this physics-based foundation, we develop a data-driven surrogate based on Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets). A DeepONet is trained on a dataset combining high-fidelity simulations with targeted experimental measurements of PID. We extend this to a Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) DeepONet, where branch-network features are modulated by external parameters, including the initial degree of cure, enabling prediction of time histories of degree of cure, viscosity, and deformation. Because experimental data are available only at limited time instances (for example, final deformation), we use transfer learning: simulation-trained trunk and branch networks are fixed and only the final layer is updated using measured final deformation. Finally, we augment the framework with Ensemble Kalman Inversion (EKI) to quantify uncertainty under experimental conditions and to support optimization of cure schedules for reduced PID in composites.

Title: A reduced model for droplet dynamics with interfacial viscosity
Authors: Fabio Guglietta, Diego Taglienti, Mauro Sbragaglia
Abstract: We propose an extension of the phenomenological Maffettone-Minale (MM) model (P.L. Maffettone and M. Minale, J. Non-Newton. Fluid Mech. 78, 227-241 (1998)) to describe the time-dependent deformation of a droplet with interfacial viscosity in a shear flow. The droplet, characterised by surface tension $\sigma$, is spherical at rest with radius $R$ and deforms into an ellipsoidal shape under a shear flow of rate $G$, described by a symmetric second-order morphological tensor $\boldsymbol{S}$. In addition to surface tension, the extended MM (EMM) model incorporates interfacial shear and dilatational viscosities, $\mu_s$ and $\mu_d$, through the corresponding Boussinesq numbers $\mbox{Bq}_s=\mu_s/\mu R$ and $\mbox{Bq}_d=\mu_d/\mu R$, where $\mu$ is the bulk viscosity. A central goal of this work is to quantify the parameter range over which the EMM model provides a realistic description of droplet deformation, as a function of the capillary number Ca$=\mu R G/\sigma$ and the Boussinesq numbers. To this end, model predictions are systematically compared with fully resolved numerical simulations.

Title: Critical and multicritical Lee-Yang fixed points in the local potential approximation
Authors: Dario Benedetti, Fanny Eustachon, Omar Zanusso
Abstract: The multicritical generalizations of the Lee-Yang universality class arise as renormalization-group fixed points of scalar field theories with complex $i\varphi^{2n+1}$ interaction, $n\in\mathbb{N}$, just below their upper critical dimension. It has been recently conjectured that their continuation to two dimensions corresponds to the non-unitary conformal minimal models $\mathcal{M}(2,2n+3)$. Motivated by that, we revisit the functional renormalization group approach to complex $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetric scalar field theories in the Local Potential Approximation, without or with wavefunction renormalization (LPA and LPA' respectively), aiming to explore the fate of the $i\varphi^{2n+1}$ theories from their upper critical dimension to two dimensions. The $i\varphi^{2n+1}$ fixed points are identified using a perturbative expansion of the functional fixed-point equation near their upper critical dimensions, and they are followed to lower dimensions by numerical integration of the full equation. A peculiar feature of the complex $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetric potentials is that the fixed points are characterized by real but negative anomalous dimensions $\eta$, and in low dimension $d$, this can lead to a change of sign of the scaling dimensions $\Delta=(d-2+\eta)/2$, thus requiring a novel analysis of the analytical properties of the functional fixed-point equations. We are able to follow the Lee-Yang universality class ($n=1$) down to two dimensions, and numerically determine the scaling dimension of the fundamental field as a function of $d$. On the other hand, within the LPA', multicritical Lee-Yang fixed points with $n>1$ cannot be continued to $d=2$ due to the existence of unexpected non-perturbative fixed points that annihilate with the $i\varphi^{2n+1}$ fixed points.

Authors: Siyuan Chen, Mingchen Sun, Jian Tang
Abstract: Advances in accelerator technology have led to significant improvements in the quality of muon beams over the past decades. Investigations of the muon and muonium enable precise measurements of fundamental constants, as well as searches for new physics beyond the Standard Model. Furthermore, by utilizing muon beams with high intensity and polarization, studies of the dynamics of the muon and muonium within atomic level can offer valuable insights into materials science. This review presents recent progress and prospects at the frontiers of muon beams and high-precision muonium physics. It also provides an overview of novel methods and detection techniques to achieve high sensitivities in different areas, including particle physics, nuclear physics, materials science and beyond.

Title: Efficient and tunable narrowband second-harmonic generation by a large-area etchless lithium niobate metasurface
Authors: Yaping Hou, Yigong Luan, Yu Fan, Alfonso Nardi, Attilio Zilli, Bobo Du, Jinyou Shao, Marco Finazzi, Chunhui Wang, Lei Zhang, Michele Celebrano
Abstract: Optical resonances in nanostructures enable strong enhancement of nonlinear processes at the nanoscale, such as second-harmonic generation (SHG), with high-$Q$ modes providing intensified light--matter interactions and sharp spectral selectivity for applications in filtering, sensing, and nonlinear spectroscopy. Thanks to the recent advances in thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) technology, these key features can be now translated to lithium niobate for realizing novel nanoscale nonlinear optical platforms. Here, we demonstrate a large-area metasurface, realized by scalable nanoimprint lithography, comprising a slanted titanium dioxide (TiO$_2$) nanograting on etchless TFLN for efficient narrowband SHG. This is enabled by the optimal coupling of quasi-bound state in the continuum (q-BIC) modes with a narrowband pulsed laser pump. The demonstrated normalized SHG efficiency is $0.15\%\,\mathrm{cm}^2/\mathrm{GW}$, which is among the largest reported for LN metasurfaces. The low pump peak intensity ($3.64~\mathrm{kW}/\mathrm{cm}^2$) employed, which enables SHG even by continuous-wave pumping, allows envisioning integrated and portable photonic applications. SHG wavelength tuning from $870$ to $920~\mathrm{nm}$ with stable output power as well as polarization control is also achieved by off-normal pump illumination. This versatile platform opens new opportunities for sensing, THz generation and detection, and ultrafast electro-optic modulation of nonlinear optical signals.
