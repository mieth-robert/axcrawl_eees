            <h2>Investigation of Hardware Architecture Effects on Quantum Algorithm Performance: A Comparative Hardware Study</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Askar Oralkhan, Temirlan Zhaxalykov</p>
            <p>Cloud-accessible quantum processors enable direct execution of quantum algorithms on heterogeneous hardware platforms. Unlike classical systems, however, identical quantum circuits may exhibit substantially different behavior across devices due to architectural variations in qubit connectivity, gate fidelity, and coherence times. In this work, we systematically benchmark five representative quantum algorithms - Bell state preparation, GHZ state generation, Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), Grover's Search, and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) - across trapped-ion, superconducting, and simulator backends using Amazon Braket. Performance metrics including fidelity, CHSH violation, success probability, circuit depth, and gate counts are evaluated. Our results demonstrate a strong dependence of algorithmic performance on hardware topology and noise characteristics. For example, 10-qubit GHZ states achieved fidelities above 0.8 on trapped-ion hardware, while superconducting platforms dropped below 0.15 due to routing overhead and accumulated two-qubit gate errors. These findings highlight the importance of hardware-aware algorithm selection and provide practical guidance for benchmarking in the NISQ era.</p>

            <h2>Temporal Kirkwood-Dirac Quasiprobability Distribution and Unification of Temporal State Formalisms through Temporal Bloch Tomography</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhian Jia, Kavan Modi, Dagomir Kaszlikowski</p>
            <p>Temporal quantum states generalize the multipartite density operator formalism to the time domain, enabling a unified treatment of quantum systems with both timelike and spacelike correlations. Despite a growing body of temporal state formalisms, their precise operational relationships and conceptual distinctions remain unclear. In this work, we resolve this issue by extending the Kirkwood-Dirac (KD) quasiprobability distribution to arbitrary multi-time quantum processes and, more broadly, to general spatiotemporal settings. We define left, right, and doubled temporal KD quasiprobabilities, together with their real components, which we identify as temporal Margenau-Hill (MH) quasiprobabilities. All of these quantities are experimentally accessible through interferometric measurement schemes. By characterizing their nonclassical features, we show that the generalized KD framework provides a unified operational foundation for a wide class of temporal state approaches and can be directly implemented via temporal or spatiotemporal Bloch tomography.</p>

            <h2>From compatibility of measurements to exploring Quantum Darwinism on NISQ</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emery Doucet, Sebastian Deffner</p>
            <p>Quantum Darwinism explains how tenets of classical reality, such as objectivity and repeatability, emerge within a quantum universe. As a mathematical framework, Quantum Darwinism also provides guiding principles that determine what physical models support emergent classical behavior, what specific observables obey classical laws, and much more. For instance, in a recent work we elucidated that the limit under which Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability distributions become effectively classical coincides with the regime where the underlying physical model obeys the rules of Quantum Darwinism. In the present work, we study the breaking of Quantum Darwinism in a specific model and how that translates to non-classical measurement statistics. Interestingly, this provides effective tools for benchmarking the genuine quantum characteristics of NISQ hardware, which we demonstrate with IonQ's trapped-ion and IBM's superconducting quantum computing platforms.</p>

            <h2>Analytical Solutions to Asymmetric Two-Photon Rabi Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Baradaran, L.M. Nieto, S. Zarrinkamar</p>
            <p>Within the Segal-Bargmann representation, a generalized Rabi model is considered that includes both two-photon and asymmetric terms. It is shown that, through a suitable transformation, nearly exact solutions can be obtained using the Bethe ansatz approach. Applying this approach to the meromorphic structure of the resulting differential equation, solutions in exact analytical form of the fourth-order problem are presented for both an arbitrary state and for the restriction between the parameters.</p>

            <h2>A three-dimensional multimode lumped-element resonator for collective spin manipulation and dispersive readout</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhuo Chen, Wenhua Qin, Hanyu Ren, Ziyi Liu, Kae Nemoto, William John Munro, Yingqiu Mao, Johannes Majer</p>
            <p>We report a three-dimensional lumped-element multimode microwave resonator that enables homogeneous collective manipulation and dispersive readout of a macroscopic spin ensemble. By exploiting geometric symmetry, two antisymmetric modes with strongly suppressed cross-talk are engineered to spatially overlap and couple to the same ensemble at distinct frequencies. Using negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond at 28 mK, we observe collective strong coupling with a coupling strength of 5.0 MHz and demonstrate non-destructive dispersive readout via a detuned mode. The compact design, tunable coupling, and high field homogeneity make this resonator a versatile device for hybrid spin-photon systems and multimode solid-state quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Narrowband four-photon states from spontaneous four-wave mixing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yifan Li, Justin Yu Xiang Peh, Chang Hoong Chow, Boon Long Ng, Vindhiya Prakash, Christian Kurtsiefer</p>
            <p>We observe time-correlated four photons within a correlation window of 20ns from spontaneous four-wave mixing via a double-Lambda scheme in a cold cloud of Rb-87 atoms. In contrast to high-power pulsed pumping of chi^(2) nonlinear processes in crystals, our scheme generates correlated four-photon states by direct continuous-wave pumping at nominal powers. We verify the presence of genuinely correlated four-photon states over accidentals by higher-order intensity cross-correlation measurements and accidental subtraction. We infer a time-correlated four-photon generation rate of 2.5(4)x10^6 counts per second close to saturation. The photons produced are near-resonant with atomic transitions, and have a bandwidth in the order of MHz, making them readily compatible with quantum networking applications involving atoms.</p>

            <h2>Bath-free squeezed phonon lasing via intrinsic ion-phonon coupling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chen-Yu Lee, Guin-Dar Lin</p>
            <p>We present a theoretical model for realizing squeezed lasing in a trapped-ion system without relying on engineered baths or tailored dissipative reservoirs. Our approach leverages the intrinsic ion-phonon interactions, where two trapped ions, each interacting with a shared vibrational mode, are driven on both red- and blue-sideband transitions. This enables the creation of a squeezed state of motion through the dynamic coupling between the ions' internal states and the phonon mode. Unlike traditional methods that require bath engineering, our model demonstrates that squeezed lasing can be achieved through a direct manipulation of ion-phonon interactions, with no external reservoirs required. We explore the steady-state behavior of the system, analyzing the onset of lasing, gain-loss balance, and the role of the squeezing parameter in shaping the phonon field's statistical properties. Furthermore, we show how external coherent drives can stabilize phase coherence and achieve controlled quadrature squeezing, offering a simple yet effective method for achieving squeezed lasing in quantum mechanical systems. Our findings provide new insights into the realization of squeezed states in phonon-based systems, with potential applications in quantum metrology and information processing.</p>

            <h2>Squeezing-Enhanced Two-Phase Estimation with N-Particle W-type States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Huan Zhang, Ying Xia, Xiuxing Zhang, Shoukang Chang, Wei Ye</p>
            <p>We investigate the simultaneous estimation of two optical phases in a three-mode interferometer assisted by optical parametric amplification (OPA). By employing the normally ordered characteristic-function formalism, we analytically obtain all photon-number moments of the output quantum state, enabling an explicit evaluation of the quantum Fisher information matrix for multiparameter phase estimation. In the lossless scenario, we show that uniformly applied OPA significantly enhances the attainable precision beyond that of an unamplified interferometer. By analyzing the second-order correlation functions, we demonstrate that this enhancement originates from the amplification of intra-mode photon-number correlations, rather than from inter-mode correlations. We further extend our analysis to realistic interferometers with photon loss using a purification-based variational approach. Although loss degrades the achievable precision, the OPA-assisted scheme retains a clear advantage for moderate loss, indicating a degree of robustness against dissipation. Our results clarify the physical mechanism underlying OPA-enhanced multiparameter quantum metrology and provide guidelines for optimizing phase estimation protocols in realistic noisy environments.</p>

            <h2>Breaking the Exponential: Decoherence-Driven Power-Law Spontaneous Emission in Waveguide Quantum Electrodynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stefano Longhi</p>
            <p>We investigate the spontaneous emission of a two-level system coupled to a photonic waveguide, showing that dynamical dephasing in the photon modes profoundly alters the decay law. In the absence of dephasing, the emitter displays conventional exponential decay followed by a long-time power-law tail -- observable only at extremely low survival probabilities. Strikingly, when dephasing is introduced, a robust power-law decay emerges already at short times, driven by photon diffusion in the dynamically disordered environment rather than spectral edge effects. These results reveal a novel, decoherence-induced mechanism for non-exponential spontaneous emission in waveguide QED platforms.</p>

            <h2>Generation of squeezed optical states via stored classical pulses in a Bose gas</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sevilay Sevinçli, Dennis Rätzel, Markus Krutzik, Mehmet Özgür Oktel, Mustafa Gündoğan</p>
            <p>We propose and analyze a scheme to generate squeezed light by storing a classical probe pulse in a Bose--Einstein condensate (BEC) and exploiting the nonlinear evolution caused by atom--atom collisions during the storage time. A $\Lambda$-type optical memory interface maps a chosen temporal probe mode onto a single phase-matched collective spin wave; for a coherent input this prepares a tunable coherent spin state of a two-component BEC, with its initial spin orientation set by the stored mean excitation number and the phase relation between the probe and control fields. Collisional interactions during storage then implement one-axis-twisting dynamics and generate spin squeezing in the atomic ensemble. We account for realistic loss and finite memory and retrieval efficiencies, and model readout as a single-mode beam-splitter mapping that transfers the atomic quadrature squeezing onto a propagating optical mode. We identify optimal storage times and predict that, under realistic conditions, several dB of squeezing can be transferred to the retrieved light.</p>

            <h2>From Superradiance to Superabsorption: An Exact Treatment of Non-Markovian Cooperative Radiation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ignacio González, Ángel Rivas</p>
            <p>We investigate the emergence of cooperative radiation phenomena in ensembles of two-level atoms coupled to a lossy resonant cavity beyond the Markovian and mean-field approximations. By deriving a complete analytical solution for the two-emitter case and employing a numerically exact method for larger ensembles, we characterize the full transition from Markovian to non-Markovian collective dynamics for systems of up to $10^3$ emitters. Our results reveal three distinct regimes: a Markovian phase exhibiting the standard superradiant burst, a non-Markovian phase featuring spontaneous superabsorption of the emitted field, and a critical regime marked by pulsed collective emission. We show that the critical spectral width separating these behaviors increases monotonically with the number of emitters, demonstrating that environmental memory effects can be enhanced by cooperativity. Finally, we find that the superradiant scaling of the peak intensity progressively degrades with increasing system size, approaching a subquadratic law in the limit of a perfect cavity. In this regime, spontaneous superabsorption emerges as a distinct manifestation of non-Markovian cooperativity.</p>

            <h2>Superradiant Quantum Phase Transition in Open Systems: System-Bath Interaction at the Critical Point</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniele Lamberto, Gabriele Orlando, Salvatore Savasta</p>
            <p>The occurrence of a second-order quantum phase transition in the Dicke model is a well-established feature. On the contrary, a comprehensive understanding of the corresponding open system, particularly in the proximity of the critical point, remains elusive. When approaching the critical point, the system inevitably enters first the system-bath ultrastrong coupling regime and finally the deepstrong coupling regime, causing the failure of usual approximations adopted to describe open quantum systems. We study the interaction of the Dicke model with bosonic bath fields in the absence of additional approximations, which usually relies on the weakness of the system-bath coupling. We find that the critical point is not affected by the interaction with the environment. Moreover, the interaction with the environment is not able to affect the system ground-state condensates in the superradiant phase, whereas the bath fields are infected by the system and acquire macroscopic occupations. The obtained reflection spectra display lineshapes which become increasingly asymmetric, both in the normal and superradiant phases, when approaching the critical point.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement Detection with Variational Quantum Interference: Theory and Experiment</h2>

            <p>Entanglement detection is a fundamental task in quantum information science, serving as a cornerstone for quantum benchmarking and foundational studies. With an increasing qubit number that can be effectively controlled, there is a pressing need for a scalable and robust detection protocol which requires minimal resources while maintaining high detection capability. By integrating the Positive Partial Transposition criterion with variational quantum interference, we propose an entanglement detection protocol that requires moderate classical and quantum computation resources. We numerically show that this protocol achieves a high detection capability with shallow quantum circuits, surpassing some widely-used entanglement detection methods. The protocol also exhibits strong resilience to circuit noise, ensuring its applicability across different physical platforms. We further demonstrate the protocol experimentally on an eight-photon linear-optical platform, where it successfully detects the entanglement of a three-qubit mixed state that is inaccessible to conventional entanglement witnesses. By combining quantum interference with classical optimization, our protocol provides a scalable and resource-efficient route toward practical entanglement detection.</p>

            <h2>Quantum aspects of spacetime: A quantum optics view of acceleration radiation and black holes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> C. R. Ordonez, A. Chakraborty, H. E. Camblong, M. O. Scully, W. G. Unruh</p>
            <p>For the centennial of quantum mechanics, we offer an overview of the central role played by quantum information and thermalization in problems involving fundamental properties of spacetime and gravitational physics. This is an open area of research still a century after the initial development of formal quantum mechanics, highlighting the effectiveness of quantum physics in the description of all natural phenomena. These remarkable connections can be highlighted with the tools of modern quantum optics, which effectively addresses the three-fold interplay of interacting atoms, fields, and spacetime backgrounds describing gravitational fields and noninertial systems. In this review article, we select aspects of these phenomena centered on quantum features of the acceleration radiation of particles in the presence of black holes. The ensuing horizon-brightened radiation (HBAR) provides a case study of the role played by quantum physics in nontrivial spacetime behavior, and also shows a fundamental correspondence with black hole thermodynamics.</p>

            <h2>Rare-Event Quantum Sensing using Logical Qubits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robert Ott, Torsten V. Zache, Soonwon Choi, Adam M. Kaufman, Hannes Pichler</p>
            <p>We present a novel protocol to detect rare signals in a noisy environment using quantum error correction (QEC). The key feature of our protocol is the discrimination between signal and noise through distinct higher-order correlations, realized by the non-linear processing that occurs during syndrome extraction in QEC. In this scheme, QEC has two effects: First, it sacrifices part of the signal $\epsilon$ by recording a reduced, stochastic, logical phase $\phi_L = \mathcal{O}(\epsilon^3)$. Second, it corrects the physical noise and extends the (logical) coherence time for signal acquisition. For rare signals occurring at random times in the presence of local Markovian noise, we explicitly demonstrate an improved sensitivity of our approach over more conventional sensing strategies.</p>

            <h2>Quantum sensing with critical systems: impact of symmetry, imperfections, and decoherence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yinan Chen, Sara Murciano, Pablo Sala, Jason Alicea</p>
            <p>Entangled many-body states enable high-precision quantum sensing beyond the standard quantum limit. We develop interferometric sensing protocols based on quantum critical wavefunctions and compare their performance with Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) and spin-squeezed states. Building on the idea of symmetries as a metrological resource, we introduce a symmetry-based algorithm to identify optimal measurement strategies. We illustrate this algorithm both for magnetic systems with internal symmetries and Rydberg-atom arrays with spatial symmetries. We study the robustness of criticality for quantum sensing under non-unitary deformations, symmetry-preserving and symmetry-breaking decoherence, and qubit loss -- identifying regimes where critical systems outperform GHZ states and showing that non-unitary deformation can even enhance sensing precision. Combined with recent results on log-depth preparation of critical wavefunctions, interferometric sensing in this setting appears increasingly promising.</p>

            <h2>A Broadband Nanowire Quantum Dot Cavity Design for the Efficient Extraction of Entangled Photons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sayan Gangopadhyay, Sasan V. Grayli, Sathursan Kokilathasan, Michael E. Reimer</p>
            <p>A bright source of on-demand entangled photons is needed for quantum networks. A single quantum dot in a site-selected nanowire waveguide is a promising candidate for realizing such sources. However, such sources are associated with poor single-photon indistinguishability, limiting their applicability in quantum networks. A common approach for enhancing the single-photon indistinguishability in quantum dot-based entangled photon sources is to implement a broadband optical cavity. Achieving a high-Purcell cavity while retaining the advantages of the nanowire, such as directional emission, a broad operational bandwidth, and high light extraction efficiency, has been a significant challenge. Here, we propose a nanowire cavity based on quasi-bound states in the continuum formed by the strong coupling of two resonant optical modes. We numerically predict this design to support a cavity mode with 4 nm bandwidth and a Purcell enhancement of $\sim$17. This cavity mode enables a directional far-field emission profile (88% overlap with a Gaussian) with a light extraction efficiency of $\sim$74%. Our solution opens up a route for generating entangled photon pairs with enhanced extraction efficiency and single-photon indistinguishability for the practical realization of quantum networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicholas S. Yama, Chun-Chi Wu, Fariba Hatami, Kai-Mei C. Fu</p>
            <p>The efficient interfacing of quantum emitters and photons is fundamental to quantum networking. Quantum defects embedded in integrated nanophotonic circuits are promising for such applications due to the deterministic light-matter interactions of high-cooperativity ($C>1$) cavity quantum electrodynamics and potential for scalable integration with active photonic processing. Silicon-vacancy (SiV) centers embedded in diamond nanophotonic cavities are a leading approach due to their excellent optical and spin coherence, however their long-term scalability is limited by the diamond itself, as its suspended geometry and weak nonlinearity necessitates coupling to a second processing chip. Here we realize the first high-cooperativity coupling of quantum defects to hybrid-integrated nanophotonics in a scalable, planar platform. We integrate more than 600 gallium phosphide (GaP) nanophotonic cavities on a diamond substrate with near-surface SiV centers. We examine a particular device with two strongly coupled SiV centers in detail, confirming above-unity cooperativity via multiple independent measurements. Application of an external magnetic field via a permanent magnet enables optical resolution of the SiV spin transitions from which we determine a spin-relaxation time $T_1>0.4$ ms at 4 K. We utilize the high cooperativity coupling to observe spin-dependent transmission switching and the quantum jumps of the SiV spin via single-shot readout. These results, coupled with GaP's strong nonlinear properties, establish GaP-on-diamond as a scalable planar platform for quantum network applications.</p>

            <h2>Unconditionally teleported quantum gates between remote solid-state qubit registers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mariagrazia Iuliano, Nicolas Demetriou, H. Benjamin van Ommen, Constantijn Karels, Tim H. Taminiau, Ronald Hanson</p>
            <p>Quantum networks connecting quantum processing nodes via photonic links enable distributed and modular quantum computation. In this framework, quantum gates between remote qubits can be realized using quantum teleportation protocols. The essential requirements for such non-local gates are remote entanglement, local quantum logic within each processor, and classical communication between nodes to perform operations based on measurement outcomes. Here, we demonstrate an unconditional Controlled-NOT quantum gate between remote diamond-based qubit devices. The control and target qubits are Carbon-13 nuclear spins, while NV electron spins enable local logic, readout, and remote entanglement generation. We benchmark the system by creating a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state, showing genuine 4-partite entanglement shared between nodes. Using deterministic logic, single-shot readout, and real-time feed-forward, we implement non-local gates without post-selection. These results demonstrate a key capability for solid-state quantum networks, enabling exploration of distributed quantum computing and testing of complex network protocols on fully integrated systems.</p>

            <h2>Landau Zener Interaction Enhanced Quantum Sensing in Spin Defects of Hexagonal Boron Nitride</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammad Abdullah Sadi, Tiamike Dudley, Luca Basso, Thomas Poirier, James H. Edgar, Jacob Henshaw, Peter A. Bermel, Yong P. Chen, Andrew Mounce</p>
            <p>Negatively charged boron vacancies (V$_{\text{B}}^{-}$) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) comprise a promising quantum sensing platform, optically addressable at room temperature and transferrable onto samples. However, broad hyperfine-split spin transitions of the ensemble pose challenges for quantum sensing with conventional resonant excitation due to limited spectral coverage. While isotopically enriched hBN using $^{10}$B and $^{15}$N isotopes (h$^{10}$B$^{15}$N) exhibits sharper spectral features, significant inhomogeneous broadening persists. We demonstrate that, implemented via frequency modulation on an FPGA, a frequency-ramped microwave pulse achieves around 4-fold greater $|0\rangle\rightarrow|-1\rangle$ spin-state population transfer and thus contrast than resonant microwave excitation and thus 16-fold shorter measurement time for spin relaxation based quantum sensing. Quantum dynamics simulations reveal that an effective two-state Landau-Zener model captures the complex relationship between population inversion and pulse length with relaxations incorporated. Our approach is robust and valuable for quantum relaxometry with spin defects in hBN in noisy environments.</p>

            <h2>Simulation of noisy quantum circuits using frame representations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Janek Denzler, Jose Carrasco, Jens Eisert, Tommaso Guaita</p>
            <p>One of the core research questions in the theory of quantum computing is to find out to what precise extent the classical simulation of a noisy quantum circuits is possible and where potential quantum advantages can set in. In this work, we introduce a unified framework for the classical simulation of quantum circuits based on frame theory, encompassing and generalizing a broad class of existing simulation strategies. Within this framework, the computational cost of a simulation algorithm is determined by the one-norm of an associated quasi-probability distribution, providing a common quantitative measure across different simulation approaches. This enables a comprehensive perspective on common methods for the simulation of noisy circuits based on different quantum resources, such as entanglement or non-stabilizerness. It further provides a clear scheme for generating novel classical simulation algorithms. Indeed, by exploring different choices of frames within this formalism and resorting to tools of convex optimization, we are able not only to obtain new insights and improved bounds for existing methods -- such as stabilizer state simulation or Pauli back-propagation -- but also to discover a new approach with an improved performance based on a generalization of the Pauli frame. We, thereby, show that classical simulation techniques can directly benefit from a perspective -- that of frames -- that goes beyond the traditional classification of quantum resources.</p>

            <h2>Fast convergence of Majorana Propagation for weakly interacting fermions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giorgio Facelli, Hamza Fawzi, Omar Fawzi</p>
            <p>Simulating the time dynamics of an observable under Hamiltonian evolution is one of the most promising candidates for quantum advantage as we do not expect efficient classical algorithms for this problem except in restricted settings. Here, we introduce such a setting by showing that Majorana Propagation, a simple algorithm combining Trotter steps and truncations, efficiently finds a low-degree approximation of the time-evolved observable as soon as such an approximation exists. This provides the first provable guarantee about Majorana Propagation for Hamiltonian evolution. As an application of this result, we prove that Majorana Propagation can efficiently simulate the time dynamics of any sparse quartic Hamiltonian up to time $t_{\text{max}}(u)$ depending on the interaction strength $u$. For a time horizon $t \leq t_{\text{max}}(u)$, the runtime of the algorithm is $N^{O(\log(t/\varepsilon))}$ where $N$ is the number of Majorana modes and $\varepsilon$ is the error measured in the normalized Frobenius norm. Importantly, in the limit of small $u$, $t_{\text{max}}(u)$ goes to $+\infty$, formalizing the intuition that the algorithm is accurate at all times when the Hamiltonian is quadratic.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement negativity for a free scalar chiral current</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Malen Arias, Marina Huerta, Andrei Rotaru, Erik Tonni</p>
            <p>We study the entanglement negativity for the free, scalar chiral current in two spacetime dimensions, which is a simple model violating the Haag duality in regions with nontrivial topology. For the ground state of the system, both on the line and on the circle, we consider the setups given by two intervals, either adjacent or disjoint. We find analytic expressions for the moments of the partial transpose of the reduced density matrix and the logarithmic negativity. In the limit of small separation distance, this expression yields the same subleading topological contribution occurring in the mutual information. In the limit of large separation distance between the two intervals, the exponential decay of the logarithmic negativity is obtained from its analytic expression. The analytic formulas are checked against exact numerical results from a bosonic lattice model, finding a perfect agreement. We observe that, since the chiral current generates the neutral subalgebra of the full chiral Dirac fermion theory, this analysis highlights how symmetries produce nontrivial features in the entanglement structure that are analogue to those ones already observed in the mutual information for regions with nontrivial topology.</p>

Conversely, in this paper, we aim at exploiting multipartite entanglement as inter-network resource. Specifically, we consider the interconnection of different Quantum Local Area Networks (QLANs), and we show that multipartite entanglement allows to dynamically generate an inter-QLAN artificial topology, by means of local operations only, that overcomes the limitations of the physical QLAN topologies. To this aim, we first design the multipartite entangled state to be distributed within each QLAN. Then, we show how such a state can be engineered to: i) interconnect nodes belonging to different QLANs, and ii) dynamically adapt to different inter-QLAN traffic patterns. Our contribution aims at providing the network engineering community with a hands-on guideline towards the concept of artificial topology and artificial neighborhood.</p>

            <h2>Long-distance distribution of atom-photon entanglement based on a cavity-free cold atomic ensemble</h2>

            <p>Constructing a quantum memory node with the ability of long-distance atom-photon distribution is the essential task for future quantum networks, enabling distributed quantum computing, quantum cryptography and remote sensing. Here we report the demonstration of a quantum-network node with a simple cavity-free cold atomic ensemble. This node gives an initial retrieval efficiency of approximately 50\% and memory lifetime of 160 $\mu$s for atomic qubits. With the aid of a high-efficiency and polarization-independent quantum frequency conversion (QFC) module, the generated entangled photon in the node at 780-nm wavelength is converted to telecom S band at 1522 nm, enabling atom-photon distribution over long distance. We observe an entanglement fidelity between the atoms and telecom photon exceeding 80\% after photon transmission over 20-km fiber, the remaining infidelity being dominated by atomic decoherence. The low-noise QFC with an external efficiency up to 48.5\% gives a signal-to-noise-ratio of 6.9 for transmitted photons with fiber length up to 100 km, laying the cornerstone for entanglement distribution at a hundred-km level. This result provides a new platform towards the realization of a long-distance quantum network.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nathan A. Harper, Ayantika Sengupta, Emily Y. Hwang, Scott K. Cushing</p>
            <p>Multiphoton states are needed for quantum communication and computation. Multiphoton states are significantly more difficult to generate than one- and two-photon states because two individual down-conversion processes must be cascaded. Only efficiencies of $<100$ Hz/mW have been reported to date. We integrate two down-converters on the same thin-film lithium niobate waveguide, significantly enhancing the cascaded process efficiency to $237 \pm 36$ kHz/mW. The measured $4.4 \times 10^{-5}$ probability of the second down-converter, which sets the limit on detectable triplet rates, exceeds those of previous triplet sources by an order of magnitude and demonstrates a path towards MHz rates of triplets for quantum applications.</p>

            <p>While two-photon Hong-Ou-Mandel interference visibility has become a standard metric for single-photon sources, many optical quantum technologies require the generation and manipulation of larger photonic states. To date, efficiency limitations have prevented scaling quantum dot-based interference to the coalescence of more than two photons at a single beamsplitter. We overcome this limitation by combining a state-of-the-art quantum dot source with deterministic demultiplexing, enabling the direct observation of quantum interference fringes arising from up to four photons. We measure high mean interference contrasts of $93.0 \pm 0.1~\%$ for two photons, and $84.1 \pm 1.0~\%$ for four photons, with the complex fringe structure fully reproduced by a theoretical model. These results reveal the existence of "deep fringes" whose minima are unaffected by distinguishable photons, rendering the maximum contrast of four-photon interference highly sensitive to multi-photon emission but robust against photon distinguishability. We predict that these phenomena will extend to interference of larger numbers of photons, with relevance across a range of potential optical quantum technologies. A Fisher information analysis demonstrates that interference fringes from our source can exhibit phase sensitivity beyond the standard quantum limit, illustrating potential applications in quantum metrology.</p>

            <h2>Optimizing Fault-tolerant Cat State Preparation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tom Peham, Erik Weilandt, Robert Wille</p>
            <p>Cat states are an important resource for fault-tolerant quantum computing, where they serve as building blocks for a variety of fault-tolerant primitives. Consequently, the ability to prepare high-quality cat states at large fault distances is essential. While optimizations for low fault distances or small numbers of qubits exist, higher fault distances can be achieved via generalized constructions with potentially suboptimal circuit sizes. In this work, we propose a cat state preparation scheme based on preparing two cat states with low-depth circuits, followed by a transversal CNOT and measurement of one of the states. This scheme prepares $w$-qubit cat states fault-tolerantly up to fault distances of $9$ using $\lceil\log_2 w\rceil+1$ depth and at most $3w-2$ CNOTs and $2w$ qubits. We discuss that the combinatorially challenging aspect of this construction is the precise wiring of the transversal CNOT and propose three methods for finding these: two based on Satisfiability Modulo Theory solving and one heuristic search based on a local repair strategy. Numerical evaluations show that our circuits achieve a high fault-distance while requiring fewer resources as generalized constructions.</p>

            <h2>Non-Markovian dynamics of the giant atom beyond the rotating-wave approximation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mei Yu, Walter T. Strunz, Stefan Nimmrichter</p>
            <p>Superconducting qubits coupled to meandering transmission lines or surface acoustic waves may realize giant artificial atoms, whose spatially separated coupling points give rise to long-lived non-Markovian dynamics. Previous studies were limited to the zero-temperature, weak-coupling regime, where the rotating-wave approximation applies and only single-phonon processes contribute. Here we go beyond these limits using the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM). We show that HEOM accurately captures the exact dynamics at zero temperature and weak coupling, whereas perturbative Redfield theory fails due to long bath memory times. The non-Markovian effects persist at finite temperatures. In the strong-coupling regime, they are further enhanced, and we observe bound-state formation at zero temperature with only two coupling points. These results establish giant atoms as a powerful platform for exploring non-Markovian open quantum dynamics and their applications in quantum information and thermodynamics.</p>

            <h2>Multiphoton Interference with a symmetric SU(N) beam splitter and the generalization of the extended Hong-Ou-Mandel effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paul M. Alsing, Richard J. Birrittella, Peter L. Kaulfuss</p>
            <p>We examine multiphoton interference with a symmetric $SU(N)$ beam splitter $S_N$, an extension of features of the $SU(2)$ 50/50 beam splitter extended Hong-Ou-Mandel (eHOM) effect, whereby one obtains a zero amplitude (probability) for the output coincidence state (defined by equal number of photons $n/N$ in each output port), when a total number $n$ of photons impinges on the $N$-port device. These are transitions of the form $|n_1,n_2,\ldots,n_N\rangle\overset{S_N}{\to}|n/N\rangle^{\otimes N}$, where $n=\sum_{i=1}^N n_i$, which generalize the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) effect $|1,1\rangle \overset{S_2}{\to}|1,1\rangle $, the eHOM effect $|n_1,n_2\rangle \overset{S_2}{\to}|\tfrac{n_1+n_2}{2},\tfrac{n_1+n_2}{2}\rangle $, and the generalized HOM effect (gHOM) $|1\rangle^{\otimes N}\overset{S_N}{\to}|1\rangle^{\otimes N}$, which have previously been studied in the literature. The emphasis of this work is on illuminating how the overall destructive interference occurs in separate groups of destructive interferences of sub-amplitudes of the total zero amplitude. We develop symmetry properties for the generalized eHOM effect (geHOM) $|n_1,n_2,\ldots,n_N\rangle\overset{S_N}{\to}|n/N\rangle^{\otimes N}$ involving a zero amplitude governed by Perm($\Lambda$)=0, for an appropriately constructed matrix $\Lambda(S_N)$ built from the matrix elements of $S_N$. We develop an analytical constraint equation for Perm$(\Lambda)$ for arbitrary $N$ that allows us to determine when it is zero. We generalize the SU(2) beam splitter feature of central nodal line (CNL), which has a zero diagonal along the output probability distribution when one of the input states is of odd parity (containing only odd number of photons), to the general case of $N = 2 * N'$ where $N'\in odd$.</p>

            <h2>Hybrid non-degenerate parametric amplifier for a microwave cavity mode and an NV ensemble</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Roman Ovsiannikov, Kurt Jacobs, Andrii G. Sotnikov, Matthew E. Trusheim, Denys I. Bondar</p>
            <p>We introduce an implementation of a non-degenerate parametric amplifier in which the signal and idler modes, respectively, a microwave mode and an ensemble of spins (e.g., nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond), are operated in their linear regime. This paramp, which amplifies signals in both parts at room and cryogenic temperatures, can be used to generate both the two-mode and single-mode squeezing of either system. It requires merely modulating the frequency of the spin ensemble at the sum of the cavity and spin frequencies (providing the classical pump) with the two systems sufficiently detuned. This effect is remarkable given that modulating a spin ensemble by itself produces neither amplification nor squeezing, unlike modulating an oscillator, and that an off-resonant perturbative analysis would suggest that modulating the spin ensemble merely parametrically drives the cavity mode. With typical cavity parameters including a cavity quality factor~$Q=10^4$, and a 1 GHz modulation amplitude, the microwave signal can be amplified by approximately $18~\mbox{dB}$ in $1.7~\mbox{$\mu$s}$, with a resonant bandwidth of about $0.5~\mbox{MHz}$. At $10~\mbox{mK}$ with the same modulation amplitude and a cavity and spin $Q=5\times 10^4$ it generates approximately $5~\mbox{dB}$ of squeezing. We also examine the experimental requirements for implementation.</p>

            <p>Many symmetry protected or symmetry enriched phases of quantum matter have the property that every ground state in a given such phase endows measurement based quantum computation with the same computational power. Such phases are called computational phases of quantum matter. Here, we experimentally verify four theoretical predictions for them on an IBM superconducting quantum device. We comprehensively investigate how symmetric imperfections of the resource states translate into logical decoherence, and how this decoherence is mitigated. In particular, the central experiment probes the scaling law from which the uniformity of computational power follows. We also analyze the correlated regime, where local measurements give rise to logical operations collectively. We test the prediction that densest packing of a measurement-based algorithms remains the most efficient, in spite of the correlations. Our experiments corroborate the operational stability of measurement based quantum computation in quantum phases of matter with symmetry.</p>

            <h2>Tailoring Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions via Double-Mode Squeezing Manipulation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kaiyuan Cao, Haodong Wang, Xiang-Ping Jiang, Shu chen, Jian Wang</p>
            <p>We propose a protocol to tailor dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) by double-mode squeezing onto the initial state in the XY chain. The effect of squeezing depends critically on the system's symmetry and parameters. When the squeezing operator breaks particle-hole symmetry (PHS), DQPTs become highly tunable, allowing one to either induce transitions within a single phase or suppress them. Remarkably, when PHS is preserved and the squeezing strength reaches $r=\pi/4$, a universal class of DQPTs emerges, independent of the quench path. This universality is characterized by two key features: (i) the collapse of all Fisher zeros onto the real-time axis, and (ii) the saturation of intermode entanglement to its maximum in each $(k,-k)$ modes. Moreover, the critical momenta governing the DQPTs coincide exactly with the modes attaining the maximal entanglement. At this universal point, the dynamical phase vanishes, leading to a purely geometric evolution marked by $\pi$-jumps in the Pancharatnam geometric phase. Our work establishes initial-state squeezing as a versatile tool for tailoring far-from-equilibrium criticality and reveals a direct link between entanglement saturation and universal nonanalytic dynamics.</p>

            <p>Aluminum remains the central material for superconducting qubits, and considerable effort has been devoted to optimizing its deposition and patterning for quantum devices. However, while post-processing of Nb- and Ta-based resonators has been widely explored, primarily focusing on oxide removal using buffered oxide etch (BOE), post-treatment strategies for Al resonators remain underdeveloped. This challenge becomes particularly relevant for industry-scale fabrication with multichip bonding, where delays between sample preparation and cooldown require surface treatments that preserve low dielectric loss during extended exposure to ambient conditions. In this work, we investigate surface modification approaches for Al resonators subjected to a 24-hour delay prior to cryogenic measurement. Passivation using self-limiting oxygen and fluorine chemistries was evaluated utilizing different plasma processes. Remote oxygen plasma treatment reduced dielectric losses, in contrast to direct plasma, likely due to additional ashing of residual resist despite the formation of a thicker oxide layer on both Si and Al surfaces. A fluorine-based plasma process was developed that passivated the Al surface with fluorine for subsequent BOE treatment. However, increasing fluorine incorporation in the aluminum oxide correlated with higher loss, identifying fluorine as an unsuitable passivation material for Al resonators. Finally, selective oxide removal using HF vapor and phosphoric acid was assessed for surface preparation. HF vapor selectively etched SiO2 while preserving Al2O3, whereas phosphoric acid exhibited the opposite selectivity. Sequential application of both etches yielded dielectric losses as low as $\delta_\mathrm{LP} = 5.2 \times 10^{-7}$ ($Q\mathrm{i} \approx 1.9\,\mathrm{M}$) in the single photon regime, demonstrating a promising pathway for robust Al-based resonator fabrication.</p>

            <p>We investigate the feasibility of extracting infinite volume scattering phase shift on quantum computers in a simple one-dimensional quantum mechanical model, using the formalism established in Ref.~\cite{Guo:2023ecc} that relates the integrated correlation functions (ICF) for a trapped system to the infinite volume scattering phase shifts through a weighted integral. The system is first discretized in a finite box with periodic boundary conditions, and the formalism in real time is verified by employing a contact interaction potential with exact solutions. Quantum circuits are then designed and constructed to implement the formalism on current quantum computing architectures. To overcome the fast oscillatory behavior of the integrated correlation functions in real-time simulation, different methods of post-data analysis are proposed and discussed. Test results on IBM hardware show that good agreement can be achieved with two qubits, but complete failure ensues with three qubits due to two-qubit gate operation errors and thermal relaxation errors.</p>

In particular, we compare bulk excitation with evanescently coupled TE and TM waveguide modes. In Er$^{3+}$:CaWO$_4$, we observe a pronounced polarization-dependent surface effect. TE-coupled spectra closely reproduce bulk behavior. In contrast, TM coupling induces strong inhomogeneous broadening and an asymmetric low-energy shoulder of the site S1 Y1Z1 transition, with linewidths exceeding those of the bulk by more than a factor of four. Temperature-dependent measurements and surface termination studies indicate that surface charges are the dominant mechanism. Er$^{3+}$:YVO$_4$ remains largely unaffected by mode polarization, and surface termination leads only to minor spectral shifts. These observations suggest that non-charge-neutral rare-earth systems are more susceptible to surface-induced decoherence sources than charge-neutral hosts.</p>

            <p>The Rashba, Dresselhaus, and Weyl Hamiltonians form a foundational framework for modeling spin-orbit interactions across condensed matter systems. Although they describe distinct material classes and produce seemingly different spin textures, they are conventionally treated as separate, unrelated theoretical frameworks. Here, this work demonstrates that the linear 2D Rashba and Weyl models are connected by a specific unitary transformation that maps one Hamiltonian exactly onto the other. The same unitary can be applied to map the linear Dresselhaus-1 model onto the Dresselhaus-2 models and vice versa. Such hidden correspondence establishes a unified theoretical foundation for spin-orbit interactions, deepening our conceptual understanding of spin-orbit coupling and opening new avenues for exploring complex spin textures. To illustrate the application, this work introduces a unique, improved, and more realistic model Hamiltonian H_MKM combining all known foundational spintronic models, where the stringent condition of equal spin-orbit coupling strength of Rashba and Dresselhaus may not be required to observe persistent spin texture under MKM transformation.</p>

            <p>We investigate the transition rates of a centripetally accelerated atom inside a high-quality cavity and show that they can be extensively tuned by adjusting the cavity resonance and the rotation frequency. Crucially, while inertial atoms cannot be excited in vacuum, rotation induces spontaneous excitation via the circular Unruh effect, with the cavity serving only as an amplifier. Using experimentally feasible parameters, we demonstrate that, in one scenario, the excitation rate can reach $\sim 10^7~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ while emission remains negligible, enabling substantial population inversion. In another scenario, both excitation and emission can simultaneously attain $\sim 10^7~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, corresponding to millions of transitions per second for a single atom. These findings highlight a powerful method for manipulating atomic transition rates for quantum applications and open a promising route toward experimental verification of the circular Unruh effect with state-of-the-art quantum technologies.</p>

We begin with covert communication of classical information under a secrecy constraint. We then leverage this result to construct a coding scheme for covert entanglement generation.</p>

Otherwise, the satellite up-link can be rerouted to the ground nodes to form a pair-wise ground network. Leveraging both the time and frequency correlations of our photon-pair source, we demonstrate an increased coincidence-to-accidental ratio without additional resource overhead in a five-node network. To contextualize these experimental findings, we project their performance in a quantum key distribution scenario and outline a feasible route toward field deployment, using integrated photonics to enable network integration of up to 72 users.</p>

This motivates migration to higher operation frequencies, which demands high-frequency amplification with near-quantum-limited noise characteristics for qubit readout.

The wireless design eliminates losses and impedance mismatches that become problematic at high frequencies. The WJPA achieves more than 20~dB of gain across a tunable frequency range of 21--23.5~GHz, with a typical dynamic bandwidth of 3~MHz. Through Y-factor measurements and a qubit-based photon number calibration, we show that the amplifier exhibits an added noise of approximately two photons.</p>

            <p>We develop the theory of dynamical superradiance -- the collective exchange of energy between an ensemble of initially excited emitters and a single-mode cavity -- for organic materials where electronic states are coupled to vibrational modes. We consider two models to capture the vibrational effects: first, vibrations treated as a Markovian bath for two-level emitters, via a pure dephasing term in the Lindblad master equation for the system; second, vibrational modes directly included in the system via the Holstein--Tavis--Cummings Hamiltonian. By exploiting the permutation symmetry of the emitters and weak U(1) symmetry, we develop a numerical method capable of exactly solving the Tavis-Cummings model with local dissipation for up to 140 emitters. Using the exact method, we validate mean-field and second-order cumulant approximations and use them to describe macroscopic numbers of emitters. We analyse the dynamics of the average cavity photon number, electronic coherence, and Bloch vector length, and show that the effect of vibrational mode coupling goes beyond simple dephasing. Our results show that superradiance is possible in the presence of vibrational mode coupling; for negative cavity detunings, the vibrational coupling may even enhance superradiance. We identify asymmetry of the photon number rise time as a function of the detuning of the cavity frequency as an experimentally accessible signature of such vibrationally assisted superradiance.</p>

            <p>Four decades after Richard Feynman's famous remark, we have reached a stage at which nature can be simulated quantum mechanically. Quantum simulation is among the most promising applications of quantum computing. However, like many quantum algorithms, it is severely constrained by noise in near-term hardware. Quantum-inspired algorithms provide an attractive alternative by avoiding the need for error-prone quantum devices. In this study, we demonstrate that the coherent Ising machine and simulated bifurcation algorithms can accurately reproduce the electronic energy profiles of H_2 and H_2O, capturing their essential energetic features. Notably, we obtain computational times of 1.2 s and 2.4 s for the H_2 and H_2O profiles, respectively, representing a substantial speed-up compared to gate-based quantum computing approaches, which typically require at least 6 s to compute a single molecular geometry with comparable accuracy. These results highlight the potential of quantum-inspired approaches for scaling to larger molecular systems and for future applications in chemistry and materials science.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luca Ion, Adam Smith</p>
            <p>Solving interacting multi-particle systems is a central challenge in quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics. In this work, we investigate the computation of ground states and ground-state energies for the He-H+ and H2O molecules using quantum computing techniques. We employ the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), implemented both on a quantum computer simulator and on an IBM quantum device. The resulting energies are benchmarked against exact ground-state energies obtained via classical methods. Simulations of the H2O molecule were performed on Nottingham's High Performance Computing (HPC) facilities.</p>

            <h2>More is uncorrelated: Tuning the local correlations of SU($N$) Fermi-Hubbard systems via controlled symmetry breaking</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Edoardo Zavatti, Gabriele Bellomia, Matteo Ferraretto, Samuele Giuli, Massimo Capone</p>
            <p>Cold-atom experiments based on alkali-like atoms provide us with a tool to experimentally realize Hubbard models with a large number $N$ of components. The value of $N$ can be seen as a new handle to tune the properties of the system, leading to new physics both in the case of fully SU($N$) symmetric systems, or in the presence of controlled symmetry breaking. We focus on the Mott transition at global half filling and we characterize local correlations between particles through the \emph{inter-flavor mutual information}, an experimentally accessible quantity that rigorously measures the distance from the closest gaussian state, unveiling features that cannot be accessed by conventional probes of Mottness. We prove that these correlations are fully independent from local entanglement and quantum discord, and, using Dynamical Mean-Field Theory, we show that the SU(4) system has significantly smaller correlations than the SU(2) counterpart. In the atomic limit we prove that increasing $N$ further decreases the strength of the correlations. This suggests that a controlled reduction of the symmetry, reducing the number of effective components, can be used to enhance the degree of correlation. We confirm this scenario solving the model for $N=4$ and gradually breaking the symmetry via a Raman field, revealing an evolution from the SU(4) to the SU(2) Mott transition as the symmetry-breaking term increases, with a sudden recovery of the large correlations of the SU(2) model at weak Raman coupling in the Mott state. By further exploring the interplay between energy repulsion and the Raman field, we obtain a rich phase diagram with three different phases -- a metal, a band insulator, and a Mott insulator -- all coexisting at a single tricritical point.</p>

            <h2>Non-Hermitian higher-order topological insulators enabled by altermagnet engineering</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiang Ji, Dengfeng Wang, Tong Zhou, Xiaosen Yang</p>
            <p>We show that proximity to an altermagnet provides an efficient route to engineering non-Hermitian higher-order topological phases. The proximity-induced altermagnetic order gaps the edge states of a topological insulator, thereby driving a transition from a first-order to a second-order topological phase. When combined with nonreciprocal hopping, the system exhibits both the non-Hermitian skin effect and a hybrid skin-topological effect, whereby first-order edge states and second-order corner states accumulate at selected corners of the lattice. We demonstrate that the spectral winding number of the edge states under cylindrical geometry dictates this corner localization and can be reversed by tuning the altermagnetic order. Consequently, both edge and corner states become directionally controllable. Our results establish altermagnets as a versatile platform for realizing and tuning skin-topological phenomena in non-Hermitian higher-order topological systems.</p>

            <h2>Gravitational time dilation in quantum clock interferometry with entangled multi-photon states and quantum memories</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mustafa Gündoğan, Roy Barzel, Dennis Rätzel</p>
            <p>Gravitational time dilation implies that clocks held at different heights accumulate different proper times. We analyze a memory-assisted quantum clock interferometer in which a frequency-bin photonic clock is stored in two vertically separated quantum memories for a controllable duration, such that the joint state evolves in a quantum superposition of two proper times. After retrieval, the photonic modes interfere in a Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interferometer, for which we derive analytic expressions for the resulting multiphoton detection statistics. Extending this HOM-based scheme from entangled photon pairs to frequency-entangled 2N-photon inputs, we show that the proper-time dependent phase is amplified by a factor N, leading to an N-times faster collapse and revival of the interference signal compared with the two-photon case. Incorporating finite memory efficiency and lifetime, we identify regimes where this modulation remains observable. For parameters compatible with demonstrated Rb and Cs memories and achievable optical frequency separations, the first collapse occurs for height differences in the order of 10-100 m with subsecond to few-second storage times, while suitable rare-earth ion and alkali memory combinations can reduce the required height to the few-metre scale. These results establish near-term laboratory conditions for observing entanglement dynamics driven by gravitational time dilation in a photonic platform.</p>

            <p>Time-translation symmetry strongly constrains physical dynamics, yet systematic characterization for continuous-variable systems lags behind its discrete-variable counterpart. We close this gap by providing a rigorous classification of Gaussian quantum operations that are covariant under time translations, termed Gaussian covariant operations. We show that several key results known for discrete-variable covariant operations break down in the Gaussian optical setting: discrepancies arise in physical and thermodynamic implementation, in the extensivity of asymmetry, and in catalytic advantages. Our results provide comprehensive mathematical and operational toolkits for Gaussian covariant operations, including a peculiar pair of asymmetry measures that are completely non-extensive. Our findings also reveal surprising consequences of the interplay among symmetry, Gaussianity, and thermodynamic constraints, suggesting that real-world scenarios with multiple constraints have a rich structure not accessible from examining individual constraints separately.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zahra Jalali-Mola, Saeid Asgarnezhad-Zorgabad</p>
            <p>Rabi oscillations characterize light-matter hybridization in the waveguide quantum electrodynamics~(WQED) framework, with their associated decay rates reflecting excitation damping, yet their behavior remains unresolved when collective emitters are coupled to a collective waveguide mode. This scenario reveals a conceptually novel collective-light-collective-matter interaction, realizable when a timed-Dicke state~(TDS) of subwavelength emitters couples to a slow, delocalized surface-plasmon mode, forming a hybridized plasmon-polariton~(HPP). The HPP acquires its directionality from the TDS via momentum matching. It also exhibits plasmonic characteristics, with excitation frequencies following the surface-plasmon dispersion relation. We obtain a Rabi oscillation and a long-time decay that describe the HPP and use them to reveal weak- and strong-coupling regimes through the emergence of normal-mode splitting. By performing a finite-time Lyapunov-exponent analysis, we show that the HPP also exhibits instantaneous decay and identify three distinct decay regimes: early-time rapid, transient-time oscillatory, and long-time classical. Finally, by analyzing the emission spectrum, we observe an anticrossing of the peak doublets~(a feature also seen in cavity QED setups) which originates from quantum vacuum effects and the resulting non-Markovian HPP evolution in our WQED.</p>

            <h2>Photon blockade effect from synergistic optical parametric amplification and driving force in Kerr-medium single-mode cavity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhang Zhiqiang</p>
            <p>This work investigates photon blockade control in a hybrid quantum system containing a Kerr-nonlinear cavity coupled to an optical parametric amplifier (OPA). The dynamics are governed by a master equation derived from an effective Hamiltonian that includes cavity decay. To obtain analytical solutions, the system's quantum state is expanded in the Fock basis up to the two-photon level. Solving the steady-state Schrodinger equation yields probability amplitudes and the analytical conditions for optimal photon blockade. Results confirm that photon blockade is achievable with suitable parameters. Excellent agreement is found between the analytical solutions and numerical simulations for the steady-state, equal-time second-order correlation function, validating both the analytical method and the blockade effect. Numerically, the average intracavity photon number increases significantly under resonance, providing a theoretical pathway for enhancing single-photon source brightness. Furthermore, the driving phase is shown to regulate the optimal blockade region: it shifts the parabolic region within the two-dimensional parameter space of driving strength and OPA nonlinearity and can even reverse its opening direction. The influence of Kerr nonlinearity is also examined. Photon blockade remains robust across a wide range of Kerr strengths. Physical analysis attributes the effect to destructive quantum interference between two distinct excitation pathways that suppress two-photon states. While Kerr nonlinearity shifts the system's energy levels, it does not disrupt this interference mechanism, explaining the effect's stability over a broad parameter range.</p>

            <h2>The Quantum State Continuity Problem and Temporal Enforcement Against Fork Attacks</h2>

            <p>We introduce the Quantum State Continuity Problem (QSCP), a security objective orthogonal to identity authentication that captures whether a systems current execution is a legitimate continuation of a unique past execution. We show that classical and stateless quantum authentication mechanisms fail to enforce continuity and remain vulnerable to fork attacks. To address this gap, we propose the Quantum State Continuity Witness (QSCW), a minimal quantum-assisted primitive that enforces temporal linkage of execution through stateful quantum evolution and cumulative auditing. Using a GHZ-based toy instantiation and extensive simulation, we demonstrate that temporal enforcement suppresses fork attacks with exponential decay in success probability, while remaining robust to noise and system parameters. Our results highlight execution continuity as a distinct and underexplored dimension of system security.</p>

            <p>The research on open quantum systems is important for both quantum computing and quantum sensing. So far, we can only use the main equation to make an approximate description. The dynamics of a single Fluxonium qubit under Markovian environment satisfied Lindblad Master Equation. In experiments, pulse sequence dynamic decoupling (DD) can enhance the coherence of qubits and effectively suppress noise. Two Fluxonium qubits sensitive to two-level systems (TLS) noise. TLS formed by material defects results in noise with significant non-Markovian characteristics. The dynamics of non-Markovian noise satisfied the post Markov Master Equation (PMME). The TLS noise spectrum is mainly concentrated in low frequencies, so traditional DD cannot effectively suppress TLS noise. The relaxation and dephasing behavior with a complex dynamic characteristics. Based on Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, we put forward a novel DD sequence and design a TLS-tailored dynamical decoupling protocol by optimizing pulse locations to minimize noise power spectral overlap with the Lorentzian shape. Using PMME-consistent framework, we can obtain a stronger low frequency suppression and significantly prolong both Bell-based fidelity and entanglement. We explore specific DD design and precise modeling of entanglement dynamics under non-Markovian TLS noise. Our dynamical decoupling protocol can effectively improve entanglement gates fidelity in NISQ quantum devices.</p>

            <p>While two-photon Hong-Ou-Mandel interference visibility has become a standard metric for single-photon sources, many optical quantum technologies require the generation and manipulation of larger photonic states. To date, efficiency limitations have prevented scaling quantum dot-based interference to the coalescence of more than two photons at a single beamsplitter. We overcome this limitation by combining a state-of-the-art quantum dot source with deterministic demultiplexing, enabling the direct observation of quantum interference fringes arising from up to four photons. We measure high mean interference contrasts of $93.0 \pm 0.1~\%$ for two photons, and $84.1 \pm 1.0~\%$ for four photons, with the complex fringe structure fully reproduced by a theoretical model. These results reveal the existence of "deep fringes" whose minima are unaffected by distinguishable photons, rendering the maximum contrast of four-photon interference highly sensitive to multi-photon emission but robust against photon distinguishability. We predict that these phenomena will extend to interference of larger numbers of photons, with relevance across a range of potential optical quantum technologies. A Fisher information analysis demonstrates that interference fringes from our source can exhibit phase sensitivity beyond the standard quantum limit, illustrating potential applications in quantum metrology.</p>

            <h2>Single-Step Hybrid CV-DV Transfer of Multipartite W States Using Cat-State Qubits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muhammad Nehal Khan, Sumrah Hussain</p>
            <p>We propose a deterministic hybrid continuous-variable-discrete-variable (CV-DV) scheme for the single-step transfer of an $n$-qubit W state encoded in photonic Schr$\ddot{o}$dinger cat-state qubits within a circuit QED architecture. Logical qubits are encoded in even- and odd-parity cat states of bosonic modes, while effective Raman-type interactions between resonator pairs are mediated by a single superconducting flux qutrit operating in the dispersive regime. The protocol coherently transfers the multipartite W state in a single collective operation without populating higher excited atomic levels, thereby strongly suppressing decoherence. Numerical simulations based on the full Lindblad master equation, including realistic cavity dissipation, qutrit relaxation and dephasing, and inter-cavity crosstalk, show that a three-qubit cat-state W state can be transferred with a maximum fidelity of approximately $0.92$. These results demonstrate the feasibility of scalable hybrid CV-DV entanglement transfer using current circuit QED technology.</p>

            <p>The Kolmogorov consistency condition (KCC) defines the statistical boundary between classical and quantum dynamics. Its violation signifies the breakdown of a classical Markov description of temporal correlations. In this work, we establish a direct analytical connection between KCC violation and non-Markovianity in open quantum dynamics, revealing how memory effects manifest as departures from classical probabilistic consistency. Within a generic two-level open quantum system framework, we establish quantitative connections between the magnitude of KCC violation and key information-theoretic and thermodynamic quantities, such as mutual information, the Fano factor, heat exchange, and entropy production rate, thereby enabling a thermodynamic interpretation of temporal quantum correlations. Furthermore, we uncover formal correspondences between KCC violation, the Leggett-Garg inequality, and the negativity of the Kirkwood-Dirac quasi-distribution, identifying them as complementary witnesses of temporal quantum non-classicality. Our results thus provide a unified framework linking information-theoretic, thermodynamic, and temporal indicators of quantumness in open quantum systems.</p>

            <p>We introduce a digital-analog quantum computing framework that enables counterdiabatic protocols to be implemented at constant circuit depth, allowing fast and resource-efficient quantum state preparation on current quantum hardware. Counterdiabatic protocols suppress diabatic excitations in finite-time adiabatic evolution, but their practical application is limited by the non-local structure of the required Hamiltonians and the resource overhead of fully digital implementations. Counterdiabatic terms can be expressed as truncated expansions of nested commutators of the adiabatic Hamiltonian and its parametric derivative. Here, we show how this algebraic structure can be efficiently realized in a digital-analog setting using commutator product formulas. Using native multi-qubit analog interactions augmented by local single-qubit rotations, this approach enables higher-order counterdiabatic protocols whose implementation requires a constant number of analog blocks for any fixed truncation order, independent of system size. We demonstrate the method for two-dimensional spin models and analyze the associated approximation errors. These results show that digital-analog quantum computing enables a qualitatively new resource scaling for counterdiabatic protocols and related quantum control primitives, with direct implications for quantum simulation, optimization, and algorithmic state preparation on current quantum devices.</p>

            <p>Non-Markovian memory effects in open quantum systems provide valuable resources for preserving coherence and enhancing controllability. However, exploiting them requires strategies adapted to history-dependent dynamics. We introduce a reinforcement-learning framework that autonomously learns to amplify information backflow in a driven two-level system coupled to a structured reservoir. Using a reward based on the positive time derivative of the trace distance associated with the Breuer-Laine-Piilo measure, we train PPO and SAC agents and benchmark their performance against gradient-based optimal control theory (OCT). While OCT enhances a single dominant backflow peak, RL policies broaden this revival and activate additional contributions in later memory windows, producing sustained positive trace-distance growth over a longer duration. Consequently, the integrated non-Markovianity achieved by RL substantially exceeds that obtained with OCT. These results demonstrate how long-horizon, model-free learning naturally uncovers distributed-backflow strategies and highlight the potential of reinforcement learning for engineering memory effects in open quantum systems.</p>

It consists of deriving analytical expressions for linear entropy and purity under the bipartitions $(x|yz)$, $(y|xz)$, and $(xy|z)$ using the Wigner function framework. Our results indicate that excitations in any oscillator basically enhance the redistribution of correlations across the system. The mixing angle $\theta$ governs entanglement intensity, ranging from separability to maximal correlation. Moreover, we reveal the symmetry relations, notably $S_{Ly}[(n,m,l),\theta]=S_{Lz}[(n,m,l),-\theta]$ and an intrinsic symmetry within $(x|yz)$. Hence, we clarify how excitation levels and mixing angles create and enhance entanglement in the three coupled harmonic oscillators.</p>

            <p>Quantum steering is one of the most intriguing phenomena in quantum mechanics and is essential for understanding correlations in multi-body systems. Despite its importance, analytical results for coupled three-body oscillators remain scarce. In this work, we investigate this phenomenon through a geometrical diagonalization approach, which reduces the degrees of freedom associated with the system's steering properties. Specifically, we derive analytical expressions for quantum steering in all possible directions using the Wigner function framework, as it provides a complete description of the system's quantum state. Our results indicate that excitations significantly enhance quantum steering across the system; this stands in contrast to the ground state $(0,0,0)$, which exhibits no steerable correlations. Furthermore, both the directionality and topology of these correlations are governed by the spatial distribution of the excitations rather than their magnitude. We also observe symmetric steering behavior between oscillators $x$, $y$, and $z$ under equivalent excitation conditions, which can be formalized as $S^{(n,m,l)}_{x\to z}(\theta)=S^{(n,m,l)}_{x\to y}(-\theta),\quad S^{(n,m,l)}_{z\to x}(\theta)=S^{(n,m,l)}_{y\to x}(-\theta)$, and $S^{(n,m,l)}_{y\to z}(\theta)=S^{(n,m,l)}_{z\to y}(-\theta)$.

            <p>We propose an efficient two-stage protocol for generating distant entanglement in a magnon-mediated hybrid quantum system, where magnons serve dual roles as both interaction mediators and qubits. This integrated design reduces the physical component count while leveraging the inherent advantages of magnons, such as their strong coupling via magnetic dipole interactions, low dissipation, and high integrability. In our setup, a superconducting resonator interfaces between a local superconducting qubit (SQ) and a local magnonic system (QM1), which is waveguide-coupled to a remote magnonic system (QM2). The protocol comprises two stages: (i) deterministic Bell-state generation between the SQ and QM1 using shortcuts to adiabaticity, and (ii) coherent state transfer to QM2 via engineered Hamiltonian dynamics. This adiabatic characteristic enhances robustness against environmental dissipation. Numerical simulations under realistic noise conditions confirm strong resilience to decoherence, achieving fidelity $F > 0.90$ and negativity $\mathcal{N}_2 > 0.40$. These results establish the protocol as a scalable and practical building block for distributed quantum networks.</p>

            <p>Quantum resources can, in principle, enable Heisenberg-limited (HL) sensing, yet no-go theorems imply that HL scaling is generically unattainable in realistic noisy devices. While quantum error correction (QEC) can suppress noise, its use in quantum sensing is constrained by stringent requirements, including prior noise characterization, restrictive signal-noise compatibility conditions, and measurement-based syndrome extraction with global control. Here we introduce an ICO-based QEC protocol, providing the first application of indefinite causal order (ICO) to QEC. By coherently placing auxiliary controls and noisy evolution in an indefinite causal order, the resulting noncommutative interference enables an auxiliary system to herald and correct errors in real time, thereby circumventing the limitations of conventional QEC and restoring HL scaling. We rigorously establish the protocol for single- and multi-noise scenarios and demonstrate its performance in single-qubit, many-body, and continuous-variable platforms. We further identify regimes in which error correction can be implemented entirely by unitary control, without measurements. Our results reveal ICO as a powerful resource for metrological QEC and provide a broadly applicable framework for noise-resilient quantum information processing.</p>

            <h2>Implicitly Restarted Lanczos Enables Chemically-Accurate Shallow Neural Quantum States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei Liu, Wenjie Dou</p>
            <p>The variational optimization of high-dimensional neural network models, such as those used in neural quantum states (NQS), presents a significant challenge in machine intelligence. Conventional first-order stochastic methods (e.g., Adam) are plagued by slow convergence, sensitivity to hyperparameters, and numerical instability, preventing NQS from reaching the high accuracy required for fundamental science. We address this fundamental optimization bottleneck by introducing the implicitly restarted Lanczos (IRL) method as the core engine for NQS training. Our key innovation is an inherently stable second-order optimization framework that recasts the ill-conditioned parameter update problem into a small, well-posed Hermitian eigenvalue problem. By solving this problem efficiently and robustly with IRL, our approach automatically determines the optimal descent direction and step size, circumventing the need for demanding hyperparameter tuning and eliminating the numerical instabilities common in standard iterative solvers. We demonstrate that IRL enables shallow NQS architectures (with orders of magnitude fewer parameters) to consistently achieve extreme precision (1e-12 kcal/mol) in just 3 to 5 optimization steps. For the F2 molecule, this translates to an approximate 17,900-fold speed-up in total runtime compared to Adam. This work establishes IRL as a superior, robust, and efficient second-order optimization strategy for variational quantum models, paving the way for the practical, high-fidelity application of neural networks in quantum physics and chemistry.</p>

            <p>Based on Ref.\cite{Riccardi A}, we investigate the entropy and variance squeezing of a V-type atom in a dissipative cavity, and discuss the influences of parameters including the spontaneously generated interference (SGI) ($\theta$), the cavity-environment coupling ($\gamma_0/\kappa$) and the atom-cavity detuning ($\Delta$) on the atomic squeezing by using different initial states. The results show that no squeezing of $S_y$ occurs under any condition and that variance squeezing of $S_x$ appears only when $\Delta>0$. Entropy squeezing quantifies quantum fluctuations more precisely than variance squeezing. Moreover, the atomic squeezing of $S_x$ clearly depends on $\theta$, $\gamma_0/\kappa$, $\Delta$ and the initial state. These findings are meaningful for quantum information processing as an ultra-low-noise resource.</p>

            <p>Stark shifts introduce additional phases that constrain the set of entangling gates that can be prepared via two-photon transitions in the strong Rydberg blockade limit. For non-independently addressed qubits, by controlling the absolute phases and the local amplitudes of the pulses at each qubit, we show that any two-qubit phase gate can be prepared with high fidelity using a three-pulse sequence. Based on these insights, we introduce two robust control schemes tailored to different phase gates that yield better results with pulse sequences of either even or odd length.</p>

            <h2>Generation of circular polarized high-order harmonics from single color quantum light</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lidija Petrovic, Philipp Stammer, Maciej Lewenstein, Javier Rivera-Dean</p>
            <p>The atomic response to an ultra-intense driving field produces a characteristic high-harmonic spectrum featuring a rapid drop in intensity for the lower harmonics, followed by a plateau and a sharp cutoff. This response vanishes for circularly polarized classical drivers -- a limitation that can be overcome by introducing quantum features into the driving field. In this work, we show that squeezed highly elliptically polarized drivers not only enable the high-harmonic generation (HHG) process in classically forbidden regimes of large ellipticity, but also yield highly elliptical harmonic radiation with pronounced super-Poissonian photon statistics. Moreover, we show that the HHG spectral features encode information about the quantum nature of the driving field, revealing the presence of its squeezed field fluctuations. By analyzing the HHG spectral intensity dependence as a function of the driver's ellipticity and squeezing orientation, we identify a means to probe the driving field's quantum properties that intrinsically lie in the high-photon number regime.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wilson S. Martins, Markus Hennrich, Ferdinand Schmidt-Kaler, Igor Lesanovsky</p>
            <p>Quantum simulation of interacting many-body spin systems is routinely performed with cold trapped ions, and systems with hundreds of spins have been studied in one and two dimensions. In the most common realizations of these platforms, spin degrees of freedom are encoded in low-lying electronic levels, and interactions among the spins are mediated through crystal vibrations. Here we propose a new approach which enables the quantum simulation of two-dimensional spin systems with interaction strengths that are increased by orders of magnitude. This, together with the unprecedented longevity of trapped ions, opens an avenue for the exploration of phenomena that take place on long timescales, e.g., slow and collective relaxation in frustrated and kinetically constrained systems. Our platform makes use of the strong dipolar interactions among electronic Rydberg states and planar confinement provided by a Penning trap. We investigate how the strong electric and magnetic fields that form this trap affect the properties of the Rydberg states and show that spin-spin interaction strengths on the order of MHz are achievable under experimentally realistic conditions. As a brief illustration of the capabilities of this quantum simulator, we study the entanglement in a frustrated spin system realized by three ions.</p>

            <p>Quantum walk serves as a versatile tool for universal quantum computing and algorithmic research. However, the implementation of discrete-time quantum walks (DTQWs) with superconducting circuits is still constrained by some limitations such as operation precision, circuit depth and connectivity. With improved hardware efficiency by using superconducting qutrits (three-level systems), we experimentally demonstrate a scalable DTQW in a superconducting circuit, observing the ballistic spreading of quantum walk in a qutrit chain. The usage of qutrits in our implementation allows hardware efficiently encoding of the walker position and the coin degree of freedom. By exploiting the flexibility and intrinsic symmetries of qutrit-based DTQWs, we successfully prepare two topological phases in the chain. For the first time, particle-hole-symmetry-protected edge states, bounded at the interface between these two topological phases, are observed in the superconducting platform. Measured parameter dependencies further validate the properties of edge states. The scalability and gate-control compatibility of the demonstrated DTQWs enable a versatile tool for superconducting quantum computing and quantum simulation.</p>

            <p>We propose and experimentally demonstrate a global parametric gate that generates multi-qubit entangled states in a single step. By applying a parametric drive to a common qubit at precise detunings relative to computational qubits, we directly produce two-, three-, and four-qubit entanglement with state fidelities of 99.4\%\pm0.2\%, 93.4\%\pm0.3\%, and 91.4\%\pm0.3\%, respectively. This scheme enables efficient, reconfigurable control using only microwave drives and is compatible with fixed-frequency qubits. Error analyses indicate that infidelity stems primarily from decoherence and coherent control errors, with negligible contributions from static ZZ coupling and flux noise. Furthermore, simulations with state-of-the-art parameters predict this global gate can generate high-fidelity (99.70\%) entanglement in systems of up to six qubits.</p>

            <p>Photon-induced Near-field Electron Microscopy (PINEM) effect has revealed the quantum interaction between free electrons and optical near filed, which demonstrated plenty of novel phenomena of manipulating free electron wave packet and detecting/shaping quantum photonic states. However, free electrons generally only absorb/emit one photon at a time, while the physical mechanism and phenomena of free electron-two-photon interaction have not been studied yet. Moreover, the relationship between PINEM and Kapitza-Dirac (KD) effect and nonlinear Compton scattering is still unclear. Here we develop the full quantum theory of electron-photon interaction considering the two-photon process. It is revealed that the emission/absorption of two photons by electrons can be greatly enhanced by manipulating the electric field component of optical near field, and the quantum interference between single-photon and two-photon processes can occur in some circumstances, which affects the photon number state, electron energy states and electron-photon entanglement. Meanwhile, it is found that the KD effect (elastic electron-photon scattering) and nonlinear Compton scattering (inelastic electron-photon scattering) are also a kind of two-photon process and the distribution of electrons can be deduced analytically based on the full quantum theory. Our work uncovers the possible abundant phenomena when free electron interacting with two photons, paves the way for more in-depth studies of nonlinear processes in electron-photon quantum interactions in the future.</p>

            <p>Frequency-tunable superconducting transmon qubits are a cornerstone of scalable quantum processors, yet their performance is often degraded by sensitivity to low-frequency flux noise. Here we present a doubly-connected gradiometric transmon (the ``8-mon") that incorporates a nano-airbridge to link its two loops. This design preserves full electrical tunability and remains fully compatible with standard X-mon control and readout, requiring no additional measurement overhead. The airbridge interconnect eliminates dielectric loss, which enables the 8-mon to achieve both energy relaxation times $T_{\rm 1}$ comparable to reference X-mons and, in the small flux-bias regime, a nearly threefold enhancement in Ramsey coherence time $T_{\rm 2}^*$. This improved $T_{\rm 2}^*$ reaches the same order as $T_{\rm 1}$ without employing echo decoupling. The device also exhibits superior long-term frequency stability even without any magnetic field shielding. We develop a spatially correlated flux-noise model whose simulations quantitatively reproduce the experimental coherence trends, revealing the coexistence of short- and long-correlation-length magnetic noise in the superconducting chip environment. By unifying high tunability with intrinsic flux-noise suppression through a robust geometric design, the 8-mon provides a practical pathway toward more coherent and stable superconducting quantum processors.</p>

            <p>Quantum machine learning (QML) is expected to offer new opportunities to process high-dimensional data efficiently by exploiting the exponentially large state space of quantum systems. In this work, we apply quantum extreme reservoir computing (QERC) to the classification of microstructure images of polymer alloys generated using self-consistent field theory (SCFT). While previous QML efforts have primarily focused on benchmark datasets such as MNIST, our work demonstrates the applicability of QERC to engineering data with direct materials relevance. Through numerical experiments, we examine the influence of key computational parameters-including the number of qubits, sampling cost (the number of measurement shots), and reservoir configuration-on classification performance. The resulting phase classifications are depicted as phase diagrams that illustrate the phase transitions in polymer morphology, establishing an understandable connection between quantum model outputs and material behavior. These results illustrate QERC performance on realistic materials datasets and suggest practical guidelines for quantum encoder design and model generalization. This work establishes a foundation for integrating quantum learning techniques into materials informatics.</p>

            <h2>Topological Obstructions for Quantum Adiabatic Algorithms: Evidence from MaxCut Instances</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Prathamesh S. Joshi</p>
            <p>Quantum adiabatic algorithms are commonly analyzed through local spectral properties of an interpolating Hamiltonian, most notably the minimum energy gap. While this perspective captures an important constraint on adiabatic runtimes, it does not fully describe the global structure of spectral evolution in optimization problems with degenerate solution manifolds. In this work, we show that degeneracy alone imposes unavoidable global constraints on spectral flow, even in instances where adiabatic algorithms succeed with high probability. Focusing on digitized quantum adiabatic evolutions, we analyze the eigenphases of the cumulative unitary operator generated along the interpolation path. By explicitly tracking eigenphase trajectories, we demonstrate that multiple spectral bands are forced to interact, braid, and permute before coalescing into a degenerate manifold at the end of the evolution. This global reordering manifests as persistent spectral congestion and nontrivial band permutations that cannot be removed by increasing evolution time or refining the digitization. Using MaxCut instances with controlled degeneracy as a concrete setting, we extract quantitative diagnostics of spectral congestion and explicitly compute the induced band permutations. Our results show that successful adiabatic optimization can coexist with complex and constrained spectral flow, revealing a form of topological obstruction rooted in the global connectivity of eigenstates rather than in local gap closures. These findings highlight intrinsic limitations of gap-based analyses and motivate spectral-flow-based diagnostics for understanding adiabatic algorithms in degenerate optimization landscapes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stefan Kettemann</p>
            <p>We extend the recently introduced strong disorder renormalization group method in real space, well suited to study bond disordered antiferromagnetic power law coupled quantum spin chains, to study excited states, and finite temperature properties. First, we apply it to a short range coupled spin chain, which is defined by the model with power law interaction, keeping only interactions between adjacent spins. We show that the distribution of the absolute value of the couplings is the infinite randomness fixed point distribution. However, the sign of the couplings becomes distributed, and the number of negative couplings increases with temperature $T.$ Next, we derive the Master equation for the power law long range interaction between all spins with power exponent $\alpha$. While the sign of the couplings is found to be distributed, the distribution of the coupling amplitude is given by the strong disorder distribution with finite width $2\alpha,$ with small corrections for $\alpha >2$. Resulting finite temperature properties of both short and power law long ranged spin systems are derived, including the magnetic susceptibility, concurrence and entanglement entropy.</p>

            <p>Can purely mechanical systems generate intelligent language? We prove that dissipative quantum dynamics with analytically tractable non-local context aggregation produce coherent text generation, while conservation laws cause fundamental failure. Employing Koopman operators with closed-form path integral propagators, we show irreversible computation fundamentally requires both controlled information dissipation and causal context aggregation. Spectral analysis reveals emergent eigenvalue structure, separating into decay modes (forgetting), growth modes (amplification), and neutral modes (preservation) -- the essential ingredients for directed information flow. Hamiltonian constraints force the elimination of these dissipative modes and degrading performance despite unchanged model capacity. This establishes language generation as dissipative quantum field theory, proving mechanical systems acquire intelligence through the combination of dissipation and non-locality, not through conservation.</p>

            <p>We investigate the non-Hermitian Kitaev chain with non-reciprocal hopping amplitudes and asymmetric superconducting pairing. We work out the symmetry structure of the model and show that particle-hole symmetry (PHS) is preserved throughout the entire parameter regime. As a consequence of PHS, the topological phase transition point of a finite open chain coincides with that of the periodic (infinite) system. By explicitly constructing the zero-energy wave functions (Majorana modes), we show that Majorana modes necessarily occur as reciprocal localization pairs accumulating on opposite boundaries, whose combined probability density exhibits an exact cancellation of the non-Hermitian skin effect for the zero energy modes. Excited states, by contrast, generically display skin-effect localization, with particle and hole components accumulating at opposite ends of the system. At the level of bulk topology, we further construct a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant in restricted parameter regimes that correctly distinguishes the topological and trivial phases. Finally, we present the topological phase diagram of the non-Hermitian Kitaev chain across a broad range of complex parameters and delineate the associated phase boundaries.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arghya Maity, Paranjoy Chaki, Ahana Ghoshal, Ujjwal Sen</p>
            <p>We propose a quantum heat transformer (QHT), a quantum thermodynamic device that modulates temperature gradients between two thermal junctions in quantum systems. Functionally, the QHT is analogous to classical absorption heat transformers in its ability to redistribute thermal energy without external work input. Moreover, we show that its performance ratio mirrors that of classical voltage transformers, where the intrinsic parameters of the system play a role similar to the coil turn ratios. We initially design the device for a three-qubit system, representing the smallest possible self-contained heat transformer model. Subsequently we extend to four-qubit systems, with a specific emphasis on exploring the step-down mode as the primary focus. We showcase the versatility and adaptability of the models by illustrating that a variety of self-contained setups can be constructed, each corresponding to different configurations of the interaction Hamiltonian and their associated self-contained conditions. An important effect in this study is the proof of existence of a necessarily transient step-down quantum heat transformer, that has a dual-mode characteristic, wherein the desired step-down mode can be realized within the transient regime of an originally designed step-up mode of the QHT. We also investigate how to control this transient domain up to which the necessarily transient mode can be achieved, by regulating the initial temperature of the qubits in the four-qubit settings. Therefore, this quantum heat transformer model not only acts as an analog to the classical transformers, but also enjoys advanced characteristics, enabling it to function in both step-up and step-down modes within the same setup, unattainable for classical transformers.</p>

            <p>Multi-photon processes deteriorate the quantum non-demolition (QND) character of the dispersive readout in circuit QED, causing readout to lag behind single and two-qubit gates, in both speed and fidelity. Alternative methods such as the longitudinal readout have been proposed, however, it is unknown to what extent multi-photon processes hinder this approach. Here we investigate the QND character of the longitudinal readout of the transmon qubit. We show that the deleterious effects that arise due to multi-photon transitions can be heavily suppressed with detuning, owing to the fact that the longitudinal interaction strength is independent of the transmon-resonator detuning. We consider the effect of circuit disorder, the selection rules that act on the transmon, as well as the description of longitudinal readout in the classical limit of the transmon to show qualitatively that longitudinal readout is robust. We show that fast, high-fidelity QND readout of transmon qubits is possible with longitudinal coupling.</p>

            <p>Dispersive readout, the standard method for measuring superconducting qubits, is limited by multiphoton qubit-resonator processes arising even at moderate drive powers. These processes degrade performance, causing dispersive readout to lag behind single- and two-qubit gates in both speed and fidelity. In this work, we propose a novel readout method, termed "junction readout". Junction readout leverages the nonperturbative cross-Kerr interaction resulting from coupling a qubit and a resonator via a Josephson junction. Furthermore, by adding a capacitive coupling in parallel to the junction, Purcell decay can be suppressed without the need for a Purcell filter. We also show that junction readout is more robust against deleterious multiphoton processes, and offers greater flexibility for resonator frequency allocation. Crucially, junction readout achieves superior performance compared to dispersive readout while maintaining similar hardware overhead. Numerical simulations show that junction readout can achieve fidelities exceeding $99.99\%$ in under $30$ ns, making it a promising alternative for superconducting qubit readout with current hardware.</p>

            <p>We investigate a Lieb lattice of quantum emitters coupled to a two-dimensional waveguide network and demonstrate that this system supports an energetically isolated flat band, enabling localization despite the presence of long-range photon-mediated couplings. We then explore the two-excitation dynamics in both the softcore and hardcore interaction regimes, which arise from the nonlinearity of the emitters. In the softcore regime, we observe interaction-induced photon transport within the flat band, mediated by the formation of bound photon pairs. In the hardcore regime, corresponding to the two-level atom limit, we instead find the emergence of metastable exciton-like dressed states involving both flat and dispersive bands. Our findings highlight how the interplay between the collective behavior of emitters and effective photon-photon interactions can provide a platform for studying highly correlated photonic states in flat-band systems.</p>

This work explores the potential of neural networks to find the quasi-inverse of qubit channels for any values of the channel parameters while keeping the quasi-inverse as a physically realizable quantum operation. We introduce a physics-inspired loss function based on the mean of the square of the modified trace distance (MSMTD). The scaled trace distance is used so that the neural network does not increase the length of the Bloch vector of the quantum states, which ensures that the network behaves as a completely positive and trace-preserving (CPTP) quantum channel. The Kraus operators of the quasi-inverse channel were obtained by performing quantum process tomography on the trained neural network.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guruprasad Kadam</p>
            <p>In this work, we introduce a novel state-dependent quantum cloning (copying) process by introducing a new class of ancillary system -- an adaptive ancilla -- modifying the conventional state-dependent quantum copying process. This state-dependent ancillary system is not pre-engineered to match the quantum state to be cloned; rather, it dynamically aligns with the quantum state to be cloned via interaction. However, the space of states that it can clone is restricted by the symmetry principles. This process, while resembling quantum cloning, adheres to the no-cloning theorem due to its state-dependent and non-universal nature. We demonstrate that stimulated emission offers a concrete physical realization of state-dependent quantum copying via an adaptive ancilla. We explore how a quantum state, for instance, a photon polarization, can be cloned through light-matter interactions when the ancillary system, such as an excited atom, contains implicit structural information about the quantum state in the form of a structured set of dynamical response channels. We reinterpret the excited atomic state as a realization of an adaptive ancilla, and cloning of a photon polarization state occurs when the quantum state of an excited atom dynamically aligns with the polarization state of the photon through physical interaction. We demonstrate that the true limits of cloning arise solely not from the no-cloning theorem, but from the symmetries imposed on physical systems\textthreequartersemdash constraints which may, in principle, be relaxed or engineered in suitable quantum systems, for instance in Rydberg atoms.</p>

We analyze the experimental resource requirements considering the unique qubit connectivity of the dynamically reconfigurable qubits in the optical tweezer array. The required qubit number scales linearly with the problem size, representing a significant improvement over existing Rydberg-based quantum annealing approaches that incur quadratic overhead. These results provide a concrete roadmap for future experimental efforts towards demonstrating quantum advantage in NP problem solving using Rydberg atomic systems. Our construction indicates that atomic qubits offer favorable circuit depth scaling compared to quantum processors with fixed local connectivity.</p>

            <p>A fundamental task in quantum information is to approximate a pure quantum state in terms of sparse states or, for a bipartite system, states of bounded Schmidt rank. The optimal deterministic approximation in each case is straightforward, and maximizes the fidelity: keep the largest entries or singular values. On the other hand, random mixtures of sparse states can achieve quadratically improved trace distances, and yield nontrivial bounds on other distance measures like the robustness. In this work, we give efficient algorithms for finding mixtures of sparse states that optimally approximate a given pure state in either trace distance or robustness. These algorithms also yield descriptions of efficiently samplable ensembles of sparse, or less-entangled, states that correspond to these optimal mixed approximations. This can be used for the truncation step of algorithms for matrix product states, improving their accuracy while using no extra memory, and we demonstrate this improvement numerically. Our proofs use basic facts about convex optimization and zero-sum games, as well as rigorous guarantees for computing maximum-entropy distributions.</p>

            <h2>Size-consistent implementation of Hamiltonian simulation-based quantum-selected configuration interaction method for the supramolecular approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kenji Sugisaki</p>
            <p>The quantum-selected configuration interaction (QSCI) method is a promising approach for large-scale quantum chemical calculations on currently available quantum hardware. However, its naive implementation lacks size consistency, which is essential for accurate intermolecular interaction energy calculations using the supramolecular approach. Here, we present a size-consistent implementation of QSCI by sampling Slater determinants for the dimer in the localized molecular orbital basis, constructing the subspaces for the monomers and dimer, and augmenting the dimer subspace with additional determinants required for size consistency. Implemented within the Hamiltonian simulation-based QSCI (HSB-QSCI) framework, our method numerically satisfies size consistency for 4H/8H/12H clusters, the FH dimer, and the FH--H$_2$O system. Application to intermolecular interaction energy calculations of hydrogen-bonded FH dimer and FH--H$_2$O demonstrates that our approach reproduces complete active space-configuration interaction (CAS-CI) values with errors below 0.04 kcal mol$^{-1}$.</p>

            <h2>EPR Revisited: Context-Indexed Elements of Reality and Operational Completeness</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mikołaj Sienicki, Krzysztof Sienicki</p>
            <p>We reframe the EPR argument through an operational lens, replacing the notion of fixed "elements of reality" with context-indexed conditional states - what's often referred to as a measurement assemblage. This move deliberately sidesteps the assumption of context-independent values for incompatible observables. Our updated version of the Reality Criterion works like this: if Alice measures observable x and obtains outcome a, then Bob's system must adopt a conditional state that ensures the corresponding outcome for that specific context. Crucially, we also assume operational completeness - a condition that quantum mechanics satisfies when we're dealing with quantum-reachable assemblages. Now, in any theory where one party cannot signal to the other (so-called one-sided no-signaling theories), perfect predictions do support drawing context-indexed inferences. But - and this is key - they don't legitimize assigning fixed values across all contexts. We rigorously demonstrate this distinction. To ground the argument, we offer examples: the qubit singlet scenario using Pauli settings and CJWR thresholds, a continuous-variable case based on the Reid criteria, and a counterexample in the spirit of the PR box, which highlights the boundaries of what quantum theory can actually reach.</p>

            <h2>Universal quantum control over non-Hermitian continuous-variable systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhu-yao Jin, Jun Jing</p>
            <p>Current studies of non-Hermitian continuous-variable systems heavily revolved around the singularities in the eigen-spectrum by mimicking their discrete-variable counterparts. The growing discussions over the nonunitary features in time evolution, however, are limited in scalability and controllability. We here develop a general theory to control an arbitrary number of bosonic modes under the time-dependent non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Far beyond the subspace of few excitations, our control theory operates in the full Hilbert space within the Heisenberg framework and exploits the gauge potential underlying the instantaneous frames rather than the eigen-spectrum. In particular, the instantaneous frames are defined by time-dependent ancillary operators as linear combinations of laboratory-frame operators; while the associated gauge potential arises from the unitary transformation connecting the time-dependent and stationary ancillary frames. We find that the upper triangularization condition of non-Hermitian Hamiltonian's coefficient matrix in the stationary ancillary frame gives rise to nonadiabatic passages of two time-dependent ancillary operators, also leading to exact solutions of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. At the end of these passages, the probability conservation of the system wavefunction can be automatically restored without artificial normalization. Our theory is exemplified with the perfect and nonreciprocal state transfers in a cavity magnonic system. The former holds for arbitrary initial states and is irrelevant to both parity-time symmetry of the coefficient matrix and exceptional points of eigen-spectrum; and the latter is consistent with the coherent perfect absorbtion. We essentially constructs the universal quantum control (UQC) theory for the non-Hermitian continuous-variable systems, promising a powerful and reliable approach for their coherent control.</p>

            <h2>A fast and exact approach for stabilizer Rényi entropy via the XOR-FWHT algorithm</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xuyang Huang, Han-Ze Li, Jian-Xin Zhong</p>
            <p>Quantum advantage is widely understood to rely on key quantum resources beyond entanglement, among which nonstabilizerness (quantum ``magic'') plays a central role in enabling universal quantum computation. However, a direct brute-force enumeration of all Pauli strings and the corresponding expectation values from a length-$2^N$ state vector, where $N$ is the system size, yields an overall computational cost scaling as $O(8^N)$, which quickly becomes infeasible as the system size grows. Here we reformulate the second-order stabilizer Rényi entropy in a bitstring language, expose an underlying XOR-convolution structure on $\mathbb Z_2^N$, and reduce the computation to $2^N$ fast Walsh-Hadamard transforms of length, together with pointwise operations, yielding a deterministic and exact XOR fast Walsh-Hadamard transforms algorithm with runtime scaling $O(N4^N)$ and natural parallelism. This algorithm enables high-precision, medium-scale exact calculations for generic state vectors. It provides a practical tool for probing the scaling, phase diagnostics, and dynamical fine structure of quantum magic in many-body systems.</p>

            <h2>Pauli stabilizer formalism for topological quantum field theories and generalized statistics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yitao Feng, Hanyu Xue, Ryohei Kobayashi, Po-Shen Hsin, Yu-An Chen</p>
            <p>Topological quantum field theory (TQFT) provides a unifying framework for describing topological phases of matter and for constructing quantum error-correcting codes, playing a central role across high-energy physics, condensed matter, and quantum information. A central challenge is to formulate topological order on lattices and to extract the properties of topological excitations from microscopic Hamiltonians. In this work, we construct new classes of lattice gauge theories as Pauli stabilizer models, realizing a wide range of TQFTs in general dimensions. We develop a lattice description of extended excitations and systematically determine their generalized statistics. Our main example is the (4+1)D fermionic-loop toric code, obtained by condensing the $e^2m^2$-loop in the (4+1)D $\mathbb{Z}_4$ toric code. We show that the loop excitation exhibits fermionic loop statistics: the 24-step loop-flipping process yields a phase of $-1$. Our Pauli stabilizer models realize all twisted 2-form gauge theories in (4+1)D, the higher-form Dijkgraaf-Witten TQFT classified by $H^5(B^2G,U(1))$. Beyond (4+1)D, the fermionic-loop toric codes form a family of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders in arbitrary dimensions, realized as explicit Pauli stabilizer codes using $\mathbb{Z}_4$ qudits. Finally, we develop a Pauli-based framework that defines generalized statistics for extended excitations in any dimension, yielding computable lattice unitary processes to detect nontrivial statistics. For example, we propose anyonic membrane statistics in (6+1)D, as well as fermionic membrane and volume statistics in arbitrary dimensions. We construct new families of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders: the fermionic-membrane toric code and the fermionic-volume toric code. In addition, we demonstrate that $p$-dimensional excitations in $2p+2$ spatial dimensions can support anyonic $p$-brane statistics for only even $p$.</p>

            <h2>Tunable quantum criticality and pseudocriticality across the fixed-point annihilation in the anisotropic spin-boson model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Manuel Weber</p>
            <p>Spin-boson models are simple examples of quantum dissipative systems, but also serve as effective models in quantum magnetism and exhibit nontrivial criticality. Recently, they have been established as a platform to study the nontrivial renormalization-group (RG) scenario of fixed-point annihilation, in which two intermediate-coupling RG fixed points collide and generate an extremely slow RG flow near the collision. For the Bose Kondo model, a single $S=1/2$ spin where each spin component couples to an independent bosonic bath with power-law spectrum $\propto \omega^s$ via dissipation strengths $\alpha_i$, $i\in\{x,y,z\}$, such phenomena occur sequentially for the U(1)-symmetric model at $\alpha_z=0$ and the SU(2)-symmetric case at $\alpha_z = \alpha_{xy}$, as the bath exponent $s<1$ is tuned. Here we use an exact wormhole quantum Monte Carlo method for retarded interactions to explore how this nontrivial fixed-point structure affects the phase diagram and phase transitions of the anisotropic model. In particular, we show how fixed-point annihilation within a symmetry-enhanced critical manifold leads to (i) a continuous order-to-order transition beyond the Landau paradigm, (ii) a symmetry-enhanced first-order transition, and (iii) pseudocriticality, which can be tuned into each other via the bath exponent $s$. We extract critical exponents at the continuous transition, but also find scaling behavior at the symmetry-enhanced first-order transition, for which the inverse correlation-length exponent is given by the bath exponent $s$. Moreover, we provide direct numerical evidence for pseudocritical scaling on both sides of the fixed-point collision, which manifests in an extremely slow drift of the correlation-length exponent. We also study the crossover away from the SU(2)-symmetric case and determine the phase boundary of an extended U(1)-symmetric critical phase.</p>

            <p>The Schur-Horn theorem is a well-known result that characterizes the relationship between the diagonal elements and eigenvalues of a symmetric (Hermitian) matrix. In this paper, we extend this theorem by exploring the eigenvalue perturbation of a symmetric (Hermitian) matrix with fixed diagonals, which is referred to as the continuity of the Schur-Horn mapping. We introduce a concept called strong Schur-Horn continuity, characterized by minimal constraints on the perturbation. We demonstrate that several categories of matrices exhibit strong Schur-Horn continuity. Leveraging this notion, along with a majorization constraint on the perturbation, we prove the Schur-Horn continuity for general symmetric (Hermitian) matrices. The Schur-Horn continuity finds applications in oblique manifold optimization related to quantum computing.</p>

            <p>Completely positive transformations play an important role in the description of state changes in quantum mechanics, including the time evolution of open quantum systems. One useful tool to describe them is the so-called Choi isomorphism, which maps completely positive transformations to positive semi-definite matrices. Accordingly, there are numerous proposals to generalize the Choi isomorphism. In the present paper, we show that the 1976 paper of Gorini, Kossakowski and Sudarshan (GKS) already holds the key for a further generalization and study the resulting GKS isomorphism. As an application, we compute the GKS matrix of the time evolution of a general open quantum system up to second order in time.</p>

            <p>We uncover a new class of dynamical quantum instability in driven magnets leading to emergent enhancement of antiferromagnetic correlations even for purely ferromagnetic microscopic couplings. A primary parametric amplification creates a frequency-tuned nested magnon distribution in momentum space, which seeds a secondary instability marked by the emergence of enhanced antiferromagnetic correlations, mirroring the instability of nested Fermi surfaces in electronic systems. In sharp contrast to the fermionic case, however, the magnon-driven instability is intrinsically non-equilibrium and fundamentally inaccessible in thermal physics. Its quantum mechanical origin sets it apart from classical instabilities such as Faraday and modulation instabilities, which underlie several instances of dynamical behavior observed in magnetic and cold-atom systems.</p>

            <p>We theoretically investigate resonant x-ray scattering from two non-interacting Ne+ ions driven by an intense attosecond pulse using a non-relativistic, QED-based time-dependent framework. Our model includes Rabi oscillations, photoionization, Auger decay, and quantum interference among elastic scattering and resonance fluorescence pathways. We analyze how the total scattering signal depends on pulse intensity, atomic configuration, and initial electronic state. We find that the total resonant scattering yield exceeds its non-resonant counterpart; the angular dependence of the signal qualitatively resembles a two-atom structure factor; and the visibility of interference fringes is sensitive to pulse area and the initial electronic state. Only a subset of final states reached via resonance fluorescence exhibits interference, determined by the indistinguishability of photon emission pathways. Fringe visibility is maximized in the linear scattering regime, where ionization is minimal and resonance fluorescence pathways can be largely indistinguishable. These results highlight optimal conditions for applying ultrafast resonant x-ray scattering to single-particle imaging.</p>

            <p>Quantum scattering calculations for strongly interacting molecular systems are computationally demanding due to the large number of molecular states coupled by the anisotropy of atom - molecule interactions. We demonstrate that thermal rate coefficients for total (elastic + inelastic) atom - molecule scattering are insensitive to the interaction anisotropy of the underlying potential energy surface. In particular, we show that the rate coefficients for Rb-H$_2$ and Rb-N$_2$ scattering at room temperature can be computed to 1% accuracy with anisotropy set to zero, reducing the complexity of coupled channel quantum scattering calculations to numerical solutions of a single differential equation. Our numerical calculations and statistical analysis based on Gaussian process regression elucidate the origin and limitations of the invariance of the total scattering rate coefficients to changes in atom - molecule interaction anisotropy.</p>

            <p>Motivated by the profound connection between quantum mechanics and spacetime geometry, particularly the conjectured correspondence between wormholes and quantum entanglement as proposed in the ER=EPR framework, this study investigate the influence of wormhole geometries on quantum information extraction. We examine the correlation-specifically mutual information (MI) and entanglement-extracted by two Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detectors from the quantum vacuum field in the presence of a BTZ wormhole featuring a null-like throat, also known as an Einstein-Rosen bridge. First, we analyze how the detector's position relative to the wormhole throat and the throat's size affect the extracted MI. Our results indicate that the wormhole enhances MI extraction, with maximal MI achieved when the detectors are located at specific image-symmetric points connected by the wormhole. By analyzing the behavior of the nonlocal contribution term and the classical noise term, it is found that the correlations extracted contain genuine non-classical components. This work highlights the feasibility of extracting quantum correlations through null-like wormhole geometries and provides a novel perspective for probing the potential relationship between spacetime topology and the nonlocal characteristics of quantum mechanics.</p>

            <p>We study a periodically driven macrospin system with anisotropic long-range interactions and collective dissipation, described by a Lindblad master equation. In the thermodynamic limit ($N\to\infty$), a mean-field treatment yields classical equations of motion, whose dynamics are characterized via the maximal Lyapunov exponent (MLE). Focusing on the thermodynamic limit, we map out chaotic, quasiperiodic, and periodic phases via bifurcation diagrams, MLEs, and Fourier spectra of evolved observables, identifying classic period-doubling bifurcations and fractal boundaries in the regions of attractors. Finite-size quantum simulations in the Dicke basis reveal that while both quantum and classical systems exhibit diverse dynamical phases, finite-size effects suppress some behaviors present in the thermodynamic limit. The sign of $\lambda_{\mathrm{max}}$ serves as a key indicator of convergence between quantum and classical dynamics, which agree over timescales up to the Lyapunov time. Analysis of the density matrix shows that convergence occurs only when its nonzero elements are sharply localized. However, the nonconvergence does not imply a fundamental difference between quantum and classical dynamics: in chaotic regimes, although the evolution orbits of quantum and classical systems show significant differences, quantum evolution becomes mixed and diffusively explores the Hilbert space, signaling quantum chaos, which can be confirmed by the delocalized nature of the density matrix.</p>

            <p>Distributed quantum computing (DQC) is a promising technique for scaling up quantum systems. While significant progress has been made in DQC for quantum circuit models, there exists much less research on DQC for measurement-based quantum computing (MBQC), which is a universal quantum computing model that is essentially different from the circuit model and particularly well-suited to photonic quantum platforms. In this paper, we propose DC-MBQC, the first distributed quantum compilation framework tailored for MBQC. We identify and address two key challenges in enabling DQC for MBQC. First, for task allocation among quantum processing units (QPUs), we develop an adaptive graph partitioning algorithm that preserves the structure of the graph state while balancing the workload across QPUs. Second, for inter-QPU communication, we introduce the layer scheduling problem and propose an algorithm to solve it. Regrading realistic hardware requirements, we optimize the execution time of running quantum programs and the corresponding required photon lifetime to avoid fatal failures caused by photon loss. Our experiments demonstrate a $7.46\times$ improvement on required photon lifetime and $6.82\times$ speedup with 8 fully-connected QPUs, which further confirm the advantage of distributed quantum computing in photonic systems.

            <p>Realizing the full potential of quantum computation requires Quantum Error Correction (QEC). QEC reduces error rates by encoding logical information across redundant physical qubits, enabling errors to be detected and corrected. A common decoder used for this task is Minimum Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) a graph-based algorithm that relies on edge weights to identify the most likely error chains. In this work, we propose a data-driven decoder named Neural Minimum Weight Perfect Matching (NMWPM). Our decoder utilizes a hybrid architecture that integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to extract local syndrome features and Transformers to capture long-range global dependencies, which are then used to predict dynamic edge weights for the MWPM decoder. To facilitate training through the non-differentiable MWPM algorithm, we formulate a novel proxy loss function that enables end-to-end optimization. Our findings demonstrate significant performance reduction in the Logical Error Rate (LER) over standard baselines, highlighting the advantage of hybrid decoders that combine the predictive capabilities of neural networks with the algorithmic structure of classical matching.</p>

For the case of harmonic oscillator bath linearly and diagonally coupled to exciton states, closed form expressions showing all the explicit time dependences are derived.

For more general cases of system-bath coupling, the quantum master equation (QME) approach is employed for the derivation of multistep time evolution equations for Green function-like operators. Solution of these equations is feasible at the level of 2nd order non-Markovian QME, and the new approach can account for inter-exciton coupling, dephasing, relaxation, and non-Markovian effects in a consistent manner.</p>

            <p>Electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in $\Lambda$-type atomic systems underpins quantum technologies such as high-fidelity memory and nonlinear optics, but conventional setups face intrinsic limitations. Standard geometries of one-dimensional atomic chains coupled to waveguides allow only a single bright superradiant channel, while subradiant modes remain weakly accessible, limiting control over collective radiative behavior and dark-state pathways. This leads to unwanted inelastic processes, degrading memory fidelity and reducing nonlinear photon generation efficiency. Here, we propose two two-dimensional (2D) atomic lattice geometries coupled to a photonic crystal waveguide, namely Zigzag and Orthogonal structures. In the Zigzag model, engineered collective super- and subradiant modes produce a flattened EIT window, broadening the transmission bandwidth and suppressing unwanted scattering to enhance quantum memory fidelity. In the Orthogonal model, four-wave mixing (FWM) intensity is amplified by up to six orders of magnitude relative to a conventional one-dimensional $\Lambda$-type EIT chain with identical $\Gamma_{1D}$, $\Omega_c$, and probe intensity, with localized idler photons forming well-defined spectral modes. These results demonstrate a versatile route to engineer structured photonic reservoirs for on-demand photon generation, high-fidelity quantum storage, and enhanced nonlinear optical processes.</p>

            <p>As quantum dot (QD)-based spin qubits advance toward larger, more complex device architectures, rapid, automated device characterization and data analysis tools become critical. The orientation and spacing of transition lines in a charge stability diagram (CSD) contain a fingerprint of a QD device's capacitive environment, making these measurements useful tools for device characterization. However, manually interpreting these features is time-consuming, error-prone, and impractical at scale. Here, we present an automated protocol for extracting underlying capacitive properties from CSDs. Our method integrates machine learning, image processing, and object detection to identify and track charge transitions across large datasets without manual labeling. We demonstrate this method using experimentally measured data from a strained-germanium single-quantum-well (planar) and a strained-germanium double-quantum-well (bilayer) QD device. Unlike for planar QD devices, CSDs in bilayer germanium heterostructure exhibit a larger set of transitions, including interlayer tunneling and distinct loading lines for the vertically stacked QDs, making them a powerful testbed for automation methods. By analyzing the properties of many CSDs, we can statistically estimate physically relevant quantities, like relative lever arms and capacitive couplings. Thus, our protocol enables rapid extraction of useful, nontrivial information about QD devices.</p>

            <h2>Casimir-Lifshitz Theory for Cavity Modification of Ground-State Energy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oleg V. Kotov, Johannes Feist, Francisco J. García-Vidal, Timur O. Shegai</p>
            <p>A theory for ground-state modifications of matter embedded in a Fabry-Perot cavity and whose excitations are described as harmonic oscillators is presented. Based on Lifshitz's theory for vacuum energy and employing a Lorentz model for the material permittivity, a nonperturbative macroscopic QED model that accounts for the infinite number of cavity modes with a continuum of their wavevectors was built. Differences from the commonly used single-mode Hopfield Hamiltonian are revealed. The nonresonant role of polaritons in the ground-state energy shift is also demonstrated, showing that the cavity effect is mainly caused by static screening occurring at very low frequencies. The theory allows for a straightforward incorporation of losses and temperature effects.</p>

            <h2>Clifford Circuits Augmented Grassmann Matrix Product States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Atis Yosprakob, Wei-Lin Tu, Tsuyoshi Okubo, Kouichi Okunishi, Donghoon Kim</p>
            <p>Recent advances in combining Clifford circuits with tensor-network (TN) methods have shown that classically simulable disentanglers can suppress substantial portions of the entanglement structure, effectively alleviating the bond-dimension bottleneck in TN simulations. In this work, we develop a variational TN framework based on Grassmann tensor networks, which natively encode fermionic statistics while preserving locality. By incorporating locally defined Clifford circuits within the fermionic formalism, we simulate benchmark models including the tight-binding and $t$-$V$ models. Our results show that Clifford disentangling removes the classically simulable component of entanglement, leading to a reduced bond dimension and improved accuracy in ground-state energy estimates. Interestingly, once the natural Grassmann-evenness requirement of the fermionic formulation is taken into account and Clifford gates with identical entanglement action are grouped together, the original set of 11520 two-qubit Clifford gates reduces to only 12 distinct gates. This strong reduction leads to a more efficient disentangling scheme within the fermionic framework. These findings highlight the potential of Clifford-augmented Grassmann TNs as a scalable and accurate tool for studying strongly correlated fermionic systems, particularly in higher dimensions.</p>

            <h2>High-Efficiency Three-Stroke Quantum Isochoric Heat Engine: From Infinite Potential Wells to Magic Angle Twisted Bilayer Graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hadi Mohammed Soufy, Colin Benjamin</p>
            <p>We introduce a three-stroke quantum isochoric cycle that functions as a heat engine operating between two thermal reservoirs. Implemented for a particle confined in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, the cycle's performance is benchmarked against the classical three-stroke triangular and isochoric engines. We find that the quantum isochoric cycle achieves a higher efficiency than both classical counterparts and also surpasses the efficiency of the recently proposed three-stroke quantum isoenergetic cycle. Owing to its reduced number of strokes, the design substantially lowers control complexity in nanoscale thermodynamic devices, offering a more feasible route to experimental realization compared to conventional four-stroke architectures. We further evaluate the cycle in graphene-based systems under an external magnetic field, including monolayer graphene (MLG), AB-stacked bilayer graphene (BLG), and twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) at both magic and non-magic twist angles. Among these platforms, magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) attains the highest efficiency at fixed work output, highlighting its promise for quantum thermodynamic applications.</p>

            <h2>Quantization of Physical Interaction Strengths via Singular Moduli</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Prasoon Saurabh</p>
            <p>Since the 2019 redefinition of the SI units, precision metrology has sought to anchor all physical quantities to fundamental constants and integer invariants. While the optical frequency comb revolutionized timekeeping by discretizing the continuum of light into countable teeth, and the Quantum Hall Effect standardized resistance via topological invariants, a comparable standard for interaction strength remains elusive. Currently, measuring the coupling constant ($g$) between quantum systems is an estimation problem, inherently subject to drift, noise, and fabrication variance. Here, we introduce Interaction Metrology, a protocol that transforms the measurement of coupling strengths from an analog estimation into a topological counting problem. By engineering a specific class of algebraic catastrophe -- the Unimodal $X_9$ singularity -- in a driven-dissipative lattice, we prove that the system's interaction moduli are topologically forced to take discrete, quantized values, forming a "Geometric $k$-Comb." We derive the universality class of this quantization, showing that it arises from the discrepancy between the Milnor ($\mu$) and Tjurina ($\tau$) numbers of the effective potential, a strictly non-Hermitian effect forbidden in standard quantum mechanics. Finally, we provide an ab-initio blueprint for a silicon nitride implementation, demonstrating that this quantization is robust against disorder levels exceeding current foundry tolerances. This discovery establishes a universal standard for force sensing and quantum logic gates, enabling the calibration of interaction strengths with topological certainty.</p>

            <h2>DifGa: Differentiable Error Mitigation for Multi-Mode Gaussian and Non-Gaussian Noise in Quantum Photonic Circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dennis Delali Kwesi Wayo, Rodrigo Alves Dias, Leonardo Goliatt, Sven Groppe</p>
            <p>We introduce DifGa, a fully differentiable error-mitigation framework for continuous-variable (CV) quantum photonic circuits operating under Gaussian loss and weak non-Gaussian noise. The approach is demonstrated using analytic simulations with the this http URL backend of PennyLane, where quantum states are represented by first and second moments and optimized end-to-end via automatic differentiation. Gaussian loss is modeled as a beam splitter interaction with an environmental vacuum mode of transmissivity $\eta \in [0.3,0.95]$, while non-Gaussian phase noise is incorporated through a differentiable Monte-Carlo mixture of random phase rotations with jitter amplitudes $\delta \in [0,0.7]$. The core architecture employs a multi-mode Gaussian circuit consisting of a signal, ancilla, and environment mode. Input states are prepared using squeezing and displacement operations with parameters $(r_s,\varphi_s,\alpha)=(0.60,0.30,0.80)$ and $(r_a,\varphi_a)=(0.40,0.10)$, followed by an entangling beam splitter with angles $(\theta,\phi)=(0.70,0.20)$. Error mitigation is achieved by appending a six-parameter trainable Gaussian recovery layer comprising local phase rotations and displacements, optimized by minimizing a quadratic loss on the signal-mode quadratures $\langle \hat{x}_0\rangle$ and $\langle \hat{p}_0\rangle$ using gradient descent with fixed learning rate $0.06$ and identical initialization across experiments. Under pure Gaussian loss, the optimized recovery suppresses reconstruction error to near machine precision ($<10^{-30}$) for moderate loss ($\eta \ge 0.5$). When non-Gaussian phase noise is present, noise-aware training using Monte Carlo averaging yields robust generalization, reducing error by more than an order of magnitude compared to Gaussian-trained recovery at large phase jitter. Runtime benchmarks confirm linear scaling with the number of Monte Carlo samples.</p>

            <h2>Efficient simulation of logical magic state preparation protocols</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samyak Surti, Lucas Daguerre, Isaac H. Kim</p>
            <p>Developing space- and time-efficient logical magic state preparation protocols will likely be an essential step towards building a large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computer. Motivated by this need, we introduce a scalable method for simulating logical magic state preparation protocols under the standard circuit-level noise model. When applied to protocols based on code switching, magic state cultivation, and magic state distillation, our method yields a complexity polynomial in (i) the number of qubits and (ii) the non-stabilizerness, e.g., stabilizer rank or Pauli rank, of the target encoded magic state. The efficiency of our simulation method is rooted in a curious fact: every circuit-level Pauli error in these protocols propagates to a Clifford error at the end. This property is satisfied by a large family of protocols, including those that repeatedly measure a transversal Clifford that squares to a Pauli. We provide a proof-of-principle numerical simulation that prepares a magic state using such logical Clifford measurements. Our work enables practical simulation of logical magic state preparation protocols without resorting to approximations or resource-intensive state-vector simulations.</p>

            <p>We present here several new exact results for a number of entangled states: the W-state of three qubits and its generalization -- Dicke states for more than three qubits. We derive these results by bounding the expected values of the Bell-Mermin operators. We review the three qubit GHZ Mermin device, make its generalization to four qubits, and then construct analogous Mermin devices for the generalized Dicke states of three and four qubits. As a result of studying if their operations can be fully explained by Mermin's instructional sets, we show that the GHZ and Dicke states of three qubits and the GHZ state of four qubits do not allow such a description. However, among the two generalized Dicke states of four qubits, one does allow and the other does not allow such a description.</p>

            <h2>Squeezed states for Frenkel-like two-fermion composite bosons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francisco Figueiredo, Itzhak Roditi</p>
            <p>We investigate squeezed states of composite bosons (cobosons) formed by pairs of spin-$1/2$ fermions, with emphasis on Frenkel-like cobosons. While squeezing for standard bosonic modes is well established, its extension to cobosons requires accounting for Pauli blocking and the resulting non-canonical commutation algebra. Building on earlier constructions of coboson coherent states, we define squeezed cobosons as eigenstates of a Bogoliubov transformed coboson operator and derive explicit expressions for the associated quadrature variances. We show that the underlying fermionic structure leads to state-dependent modifications of the Heisenberg--Robertson uncertainty bound, which may fall below the canonical bosonic limit without implying any violation of uncertainty principles. Numerical results based on finite-dimensional matrix representations illustrate how these effects constrain the attainable squeezing. Our framework is relevant to composite boson systems such as tightly bound electron-hole pairs and provides a physically transparent setting to probe compositeness through observable quadrature fluctuations.</p>

            <p>Multiphoton states are needed for quantum communication and computation. Multiphoton states are significantly more difficult to generate than one- and two-photon states because two individual down-conversion processes must be cascaded. Only efficiencies of $<100$ Hz/mW have been reported to date. We integrate two down-converters on the same thin-film lithium niobate waveguide, significantly enhancing the cascaded process efficiency to $237 \pm 36$ kHz/mW. The measured $4.4\times10^{-5}$ probability of the second down-converter, which sets the limit on detectable triplet rates, exceeds those of previous triplet sources by an order of magnitude and demonstrates a path towards MHz rates of triplets for quantum applications.</p>

            <p>Quantum entanglement is a crucial resource in quantum information processing, advancing quantum technologies. The greater the uncertainty in subsystems' pure states, the stronger the quantum entanglement between them. From the dual form of $q$-concurrence ($q\geq 2$) we introduce the total concurrence. A bona fide measure of quantum entanglement is introduced, the $\mathcal{C}^{t}_q$-concurrence ($q \geq 2$), which is based on the total concurrence. Analytical lower bounds for the $\mathcal{C}^{t}_q$-concurrence are derived. In addition, an analytical expression is derived for the $\mathcal{C}^{t}_q$-concurrence in the cases of isotropic and Werner states. Furthermore, the monogamy relations that the $\mathcal{C}^{t}_q$-concurrence satisfies for qubit systems are examined. Additionally, based on the parameterized $\alpha$-concurrence and its complementary dual, the $\mathcal{C}^{t}_\alpha$-concurrence $(0\leq\alpha\leq\frac{1}{2})$ is also proposed.</p>

            <h2>Parametric amplification of continuous variable entangled state for loss-tolerant multi-phase estimation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sijin Li, Wei Wang</p>
            <p>Quantum parameter estimation exploits quantum states to achieve estimation sensitivity beyond classical limit. In continuous variable (CV) regime, squeezed state has been exploited to implement deterministic phase estimation. It is however, often restricted by fragility of quantum states. The quantum phase estimation sensitivity of squeezed state is significantly affected by loss or detection inefficiency, which restrict its applications. This issue can be solved by using a method of parametric amplification of squeezed state \cite{OPA}. In this work, we implement multi-phase estimation with optical parametric amplification of entanglement generated from squeezed states. We find multi-phase estimation sensitivity is robust against loss or detection inefficiency, where we use two-mode Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen entangled state and four-mode cluster state for analysis. Our work provides a method for realizing large-scale quantum metrology in real-world applications against loss or detection inefficiency.</p>

            <p>Quantum key distribution (QKD) enables secure communication by harnessing the fundamental principles of quantum physics, which inherently guarantee information-theoretic security and intrinsic resistance to quantum computing attacks. However, the secure key rate of QKD typically decreases exponentially with increasing channel distance. In this work, by developing a novel polarization-state preparation method, an ultra-low time-jitter laser source and superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors, we demonstrate a 5-GHz integrated QKD system featuring ultra-low quantum bit error rates (QBERs). The system achieves secure key rates of 1.076 Mbps at 150 km and 105 kbps at 200 km over standard single-mode fiber channels, respectively. Our system substantially enhances the secure key rate, enabling high-resolution video calls with one-time-pad encryption over intercity backbone QKD links.

            <p>Multipartite entangled states possess a number of non-intuitive properties, making them a useful resource for various quantum information-processing tasks. The three-qubit W-state is one such example where every state is robust to single-qubit loss. However, this state is not suitable for deterministic distribution, and deterministic communication protocols. Here, we focus on the distribution of a non-symmetric version of such states, namely $W_{\mathrm{mod}}$ states. These states belong to the W-class, and have one ebit of entanglement across a specific bipartition, enabling deterministic teleportation and superdense coding. In particular, we describe a few protocols through which these multipartite entangled states can be distributed {\it deterministically} in a quantum network by first preparing them locally in a central node and then transmitting individual qubits to the end nodes. We analyse the performance of these protocols based on the fidelity of the final distributed state, considering all types of noises that can act during the distribution. Finally, we compare the performance of the protocols to the case where the distribution is performed without any central node.</p>

            <h2>Gravitationally Induced Entanglement Between Particles in Harmonic Traps: Limits for Gaussian States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julia Tokarska, Andrzej Dragan</p>
            <p>Gravitationally induced entanglement has been proposed as a probe of the quantum nature of gravity. This work analyzes a system of two particles in harmonic traps interacting only through gravity, considering thermal and two-mode squeezed initial states. For thermal states, a maximum temperature is identified above which entanglement cannot be generated, and for fixed system parameters an optimal trap frequency that maximizes the logarithmic negativity is found. Squeezing the initial state does not further enhance the entanglement generation, but increases the temperature range over which it can be observed. Extending the analysis to general Gaussian states, an upper bound on the achievable entanglement is derived and shown to be saturated, for example, by ground and squeezed states. The results show that the amount of entanglement generated in this setup is extremely small, highlighting the experimental challenges of observing gravitationally induced quantum effects.</p>

            <p>An effective model for describing the relativistic quantum dynamics of a radiating electron is developed via a relativistic generalization of the Lindblad master equation. By incorporating both radiation reaction and vacuum fluctuations into the Dirac equation within an open quantum system framework, our approach captures the Zitterbewegung of the electron, ensuing noncommutativity of its effective spatial coordinates, and provides the quantum analogue of the Landau-Lifshitz (LL) classical equation of motion with radiation reaction. We develop the corresponding phase-space representation via the relativistic Wigner function and derive the semiclassical limit through a Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation. The latter elucidates the signature of quantum vacuum fluctuations in the LL equation, and shows its relationship with the corrected Sokolov equation. Our results offer a robust framework for investigating quantum radiation reaction effects in ultrastrong laser fields.</p>

            <p>In this work, we investigate the dynamics of quantum synchronization in a four-mode optomechanical system, focusing on the influence of the Coulomb interaction between two mechanical resonators. We analyze the effect of the Coulomb coupling on three distinct synchronization regimes, i.e., complete quantum synchronization, $\phi$-synchronization, and quantum phase synchronization. Our results show that while the Coulomb interaction plays a pivotal role in significantly enhancing quantum phase synchronization by facilitating energy exchange and phase coherence, it has little impact on complete and $\phi$-synchronization. This indicates that amplitude and frequency locking are primarily determined by the optical driving, whereas phase alignment depends critically on inter-resonator coupling. We also demonstrate that the oscillations of the two optical cavities, which are indirectly coupled via the mechanical resonators, can become aligned over time, resulting in classical synchronization. These findings provide a robust mechanism for controlling collective quantum dynamics and offer a foundation for applications in quantum communication, precision sensing, and the development of synchronized quantum networks.</p>

A focus is on nonlocally interacting spin systems realized by coupling many atoms to a delocalized mode of light.

By extension, letting the intracavity light act back on the atoms enables coherent photon-mediated interactions. I start by discussing collective spin models, emphasizing applications in entanglement-enhanced metrology, before proceeding to richer many-body physics enabled by incorporating spatiotemporal control or employing multiple cavity modes. I will highlight opportunities for leveraging these tools for quantum simulations inspired by problems in condensed matter and quantum gravity. Along the way, I provide a pedagogical introduction to criteria for strong atom-light coupling, illustrate how the corresponding figure of merit -- the cooperativity -- sets fundamental limits on the coherence of atom-light interactions, and discuss prospects for harnessing high-cooperativity cavity QED in quantum simulation and computation.</p>

            <p>Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) features a high key rate and compatibility with classical optical communication. Developing expandable and efficient CVQKD networks will promote the deployment of large-scale quantum communication networks in the future. This paper proposes a CVQKD network based on the entangled states of an optical frequency comb. This scheme generates Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen entangled states with a frequency comb structure through the process of a type-II optical parametric oscillator. By combining with the scheme of entanglement in the middle, a fully connected CVQKD network capable of distributing secret keys simultaneously can be formed. We analyze the security of the system in the asymptotic case. Simulation results show that under commendable controlling of system loss and noise, the proposed scheme is feasible for deploying a short-distance fully connected CVQKD network. Loss will be the main factor limiting the system's performance. The proposed scheme provides new ideas for a multi-user fully connected CVQKD network.</p>

            <p>The interplay between topology and non-Hermiticity gives rise to exotic dynamic phenomena that challenge conventional wave-packet propagation and entanglement dynamics. While recent studies have established the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) as a key mechanism for anomalous wave dynamics, a unified framework for characterizing and controlling entanglement evolution in non-Hermitian topological systems remains underdeveloped. Here, by combining theory and experiments, we demonstrate that entanglement entropy (EE) and transport currents serve as robust dynamic probes to distinguish various non-Hermitian topological regimes. Using a generalized non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model implemented in an acoustic analog platform, we identify three dynamic phases, bulk-like, edge-like, and skin-like regimes, each exhibiting unique EE signatures and transport characteristics. In particular, skin-like dynamics exhibit periodic information shuttling with finite, oscillatory EE, while edge-like dynamics lead to complete EE suppression. We further map the dynamic phase diagram and show that EE scaling and temporal profiles directly reflect the competition between coherent delocalization and NHSE-driven localization. Our results establish a programmable approach to steering entanglement and transport via tailored non-Hermitian couplings, offering a pathway for engineering quantum information dynamics in synthetic phononic, photonic, and quantum simulators.</p>

            <p>This paper focuses on the study of linear exciton Hall and Nernst effects in monolayer two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors, employing the semi-classical transport theory. By deriving the exciton Berry curvature in momentum space for a general inhomogeneous 2D system, we establish its dependence on the Berry curvature and the effective mass of electron and hole. As illustrative examples, the exciton Hall effect in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and black phosphorus (BP) are calculated. For these materials, we demonstrate that a linear Hall (Nernst) exciton current with the non-zero Berry curvature is strictly forbidden by the symmetries. This finding aligns with earlier experimental observations on the exciton Hall effect in MoSe$_2$. In contrast, a strong anisotropy in BP leads to a net linear Hall current of excitons, exhibiting a relatively large value and resembling an anomalous Hall effect rather than a valley Hall effect. Our work reveals that the specific symmetry of 2D materials can induce a significant linear exciton Hall (Nernst) effect even without Berry curvature, which is normally forbidden with non-zero Berry curvature in the monolayer 2D material. This observation holds promise for future optoelectronic applications and offers exciting possibilities for experimental exploration.</p>

            <p>Quantum simulation relies on the preparation and control of low-entropy many-body systems to reveal the behavior of classically intractable models. The development of new approaches for realizing such systems therefore represents a frontier in quantum science. Here we experimentally demonstrate a new protocol for generating ultracold, itinerant many-body states in a tunnel-coupled two-dimensional optical lattice. We do this by adiabatically connecting a near-ground-state-cooled array of up to 50 single strontium-86 atoms with a Bose-Hubbard superfluid. Through comparison with finite-temperature quantum-Monte-Carlo calculations, we estimate that the entropy per particle of the prepared many-body states is approximately $2 k_B$, and that the achieved temperatures are consistent with a significant superfluid fraction. This represents the first time that itinerant many-body systems have been prepared from rearranged atoms, opening the door to bottom-up assembly of a wide range of neutral-atom and molecular systems.</p>

            <p>Superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) cavities offer a promising platform for quantum computing due to their long coherence times, yet integrating nonlinear elements like transmons for control often introduces additional loss. We report a multimode quantum system based on a 2-cell elliptical shaped SRF cavity, comprising two cavity modes weakly coupled to an ancillary transmon circuit, designed to preserve coherence while enabling efficient control of the cavity modes. We mitigate the detrimental effects of the transmon decoherence through careful design optimization that reduces transmon-cavity couplings and participation in the dielectric substrate and lossy interfaces, to achieve single-photon lifetimes of 20.6 ms and 15.6 ms for the two modes, and a pure dephasing time exceeding 40 ms. This marks an order-of-magnitude improvement over prior 3D multimode memories. Leveraging sideband interactions and novel error-resilient protocols, including measurement-based correction and post-selection, we achieve high-fidelity control over quantum states. This enables the preparation of Fock states up to $N = 20$ with fidelities exceeding 95%, the highest reported to date to the authors' knowledge, as well as two-mode entanglement with an estimated coherence-limited fidelities of 99.9% after post-selection. These results establish our platform as a robust foundation for quantum information processing, allowing for future extensions to high-dimensional qudit encodings.</p>

            <h2>Local-available quantum correlation swapping in one-parameter X states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hermann L. Albrecht</p>
            <p>Although introduced for entanglement, quantum repeaters and swapping protocols have been analyzed for other quantum correlations (QC), such as quantum discord. In 2015, Mundarain and Ladrón de Guevara [Quantum Inf. Process. 14, 4493 (2015)] introduced local-available quantum correlations (LAQC), which are a promising yet understudied quantum correlation. Recently, Bellorin et al. [Int. J. Mod. Phys. B 36, 22500990 (2022), Int. J. Mod. Phys. B 36, 2250154 (2022)] obtained exact analytical results for the LAQC quantifier of general 2-qubit X states. Building up from those results, we analyzed the LAQC swapping for 2-qubit X states. As expected, we find that if the initial states are non-classical and the one used for the projective measurement is entangled, the final state will generally have non-zero LAQC. Using the properties of this quantum correlation, we establish the conditions for a QCS scheme that leads to a final state with a non-zero LAQC measure. We illustrate these results by analyzing five families of one-parameter 2-qubit X states, including families where the projective measure leads to a separable state, but whose LAQC measure is non-zero. This feature opens the possibility for this quantum correlation to be considered a genuine resource in quantum information technology.</p>

            <p>Absolutely maximally entangled (AME) pure states of a system composed of $N$ parties are distinguished by the property that for any splitting at least one partial trace is maximally mixed. Due to maximal possible correlations between any two selected subsystems these states have numerous applications in various fields of quantum information processing including multi-user teleportation, quantum error correction and secret sharing. We present an updated survey of various techniques to generate such strongly entangled states, including those going beyond the standard construction of graph and stabilizer states. Our contribution includes, in particular, analysis of the degree of entanglement of reduced states obtained by partial trace of AME projectors, states obtained by a symmetric superposition of GHZ states, an orthogonal frequency square representation of the "golden" AME state and an updated summary of the number of local unitary equivalence classes.</p>

            <h2>Logical Error Rates for the Surface Code Under a Mixed Coherent and Stochastic Circuit-Level Noise Model Inspired by Trapped Ions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tyler LeBlond, Peter Groszkowski, Justin G. Lietz, Christopher M. Seck, Ryan S. Bennink</p>
            <p>With fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) on the horizon, it is critical to understand sources of logical error in plausible hardware implementations of quantum error-correcting codes (QECC). In this work, we consider logical error rates for the surface code implemented on a hypothetical grid-based trapped-ion quantum charge-coupled device (QCCD) architecture. Specifically, we construct logical channels for the idling surface code and examine its diamond error under a mixed coherent and stochastic circuit-level noise model inspired by trapped ions. We include the coherent dephasing noise that is known to accumulate during physical qubit idling and transport in these systems, determining idling and transport durations using the time-resolved output of the trapped-ion surface code compiler (TISCC). To estimate expectation values of logical Pauli observables following hardware circuits containing non-Clifford sources of noise, we utilize a Monte Carlo technique to sample from an underlying quasi-probability distribution of Clifford circuits that we independently simulate in a phase-sensitive fashion. We verify error suppression up to code distance $d=11$ at coherent dephasing rates near and below those of current-generation trapped-ion quantum computers and find that logical error rates align with those of analogous fully stochastic simulations in this regime. Exploring higher dephasing rates at $d=3-5$, we find evidence for growing coherent rotations about all three logical Pauli axes, increased diagonal logical error process matrix elements relative to those of stochastic simulations, and a reduced dephasing rate threshold. Overall, our work paves a way toward realistic hardware emulation of small fault-tolerant quantum processes, e.g., members of a FTQC instruction set.</p>

            <h2>Resolving Microscopic Correlated Electron Dynamics via 2000-Qubit Quantum Simulation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jaka Vodeb</p>
            <p>Understanding how quantum materials return to equilibrium after being driven into excited states is a fundamental problem in condensed matter physics. A prototypical material, 1T-TaS$_2$, exhibits complex electronic textures made up of domain walls, which slowly reorganize into a more uniform structure as the system relaxes. At low temperatures, this process becomes dominated by quantum rather than thermal effects. In this work, we use large-scale noise-driven quantum simulations-spanning more than 2000 qubits-to study this relaxation process through an effective model known as the transverse-field Ising model in a longitudinal field. By mathematically transforming this model into a simpler form, we identify the basic microscopic steps involved: rather than moving collectively, the domain walls evolve through a sequence of noise-driven single-particle tunneling events. A detailed analysis of how the relaxation rate depends on temperature and model parameters confirms this picture. Our findings show that quantum simulation can provide rare, predictive insight into the inner workings of real quantum materials, and establish a practical pathway for studying complex non-equilibrium processes using current-generation quantum hardware.</p>

            <h2>Empty-Signal Detection and the Principle-Level Feasibility of Arbitrarily Long-Distance Repeaterless Quantum Communication</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hao Shu</p>
            <p>Practical repeaterless quantum communication (PRQC) is fundamentally constrained by the divergence of the quantum bit error rate (QBER) arising from the interplay between channel loss and single-photon detector (SPD) dark counts. As the channel transmission rate decays exponentially with distance, vacuum-induced dark counts inevitably dominate detection events beyond a finite range, driving the QBER toward 50\% and rendering PRQC infeasible. Here, a theoretical framework termed empty-signal detection (ESD) is established to address this long-standing limitation at the level of principle. By encoding particle-existence information (PEI) onto an auxiliary degree of freedom (DOF) and employing controlled operations together with multi-copy analysis, the ESD paradigm enables vacuum-induced detection events to be identified and filtered without disturbing the encoded quantum information. Consequently, the non-empty signal rate (NESR) of the accepted signals can be stabilized at a distance-independent level under physically reasonable conditions, thereby suppressing the fundamental QBER within the secure bounds of PRQC, irrespective of channel attenuation. As a result, PRQC can, in principle, remain feasible over arbitrarily long distances, with the fundamental limitation shifting from distance-dependent QBER divergence to resource-dependent efficiency trade-offs. By providing a rigorous theoretical resolution of the fundamental QBER-induced distance limitation, this work clarifies the principle-level scalability of PRQC. Furthermore, the vacuum-filtering framework developed here may also be of interest in a broader class of loss-sensitive or detection-based quantum tasks.</p>

            <h2>Navigating entanglement via Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida exchange: Snake, bouncing, boundary-residing, pulse, and damping-stabilized time-frozen trajectories</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Son-Hsien Chen, Seng Ghee Tan, Ching-Ray Chang</p>
            <p>Entanglement dynamics are fundamental to quantum technologies, yet navigating their temporal profiles (trajectories) remains challenging. Here, we propose a scalable solid-state platform based on RKKY exchange, where two spin qubits couple to a central spin qudit that oscillatorily spin-polarizes the surrounding conduction electrons. We introduce the exchange-time integral (ETI), which maps the spatial motion of the qubits to a time-dependent exchange interaction and serves as an effective "trajectory clock" governing the system evolution. We focus specifically on entanglement trajectories initially near the entanglement-unentanglement boundary, with the distance to this boundary quantified by concurrence extended to include negative values. By alternating the sign changes of the exchange, implemented through vibrational motion of qubits, the ETI enables programmable entanglement trajectories. For in-phase and antiphase vibrations, including scenarios with controlled stopping at the RKKY exchange-free nodes, we identify distinctive trajectories: snake (repeatedly crossing the boundary), bouncing (immediately reversing upon reaching the boundary), boundary-residing (remaining at the transition point), and pulse (controllable entanglement intervals). The vibration phase creates asymmetric shifts to the trajectories. The proposed device offers built-in error correction against dephasing by utilizing both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic regimes. Out-of-phase vibrations drive trajectories away from the boundary, accessing larger entanglement values but with irregular/unsteady final states. To stabilize these trajectories, we introduce a damping mechanism. Our framework offers a systematic method for navigating and engineering entanglement dynamics in quantum systems, with potential applications in quantum computation, cryptography, and metrology.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Signatures of Strange Attractors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bence Dárdai, Gábor Vattay</p>
            <p>In classical mechanics, driven systems with dissipation often exhibit complex, fractal dynamics known as strange attractors. This paper addresses the fundamental question of how such structures manifest in the quantum realm. We investigate the quantum Duffing oscillator, a paradigmatic chaotic system, using the Caldirola-Kanai (CK) framework, where dissipation is integrated directly into a time-dependent Hamiltonian. By employing the Husimi distribution to represent the quantum state in phase space, we present the first visualization of a quantum strange attractor within this model. Our simulations demonstrate how an initially simple Gaussian wave packet is stretched, folded, and sculpted by the interplay of chaotic dynamics and energy loss, causing it to localize onto a structure that beautifully mirrors the classical attractor. This quantum "photograph" is inherently smoothed, blurring the infinitely fine fractal details of its classical counterpart as a direct consequence of the uncertainty principle. We supplement this analysis by examining the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC), which shows that stronger dissipation clarifies the exponential growth associated with the classical Lyapunov exponent, thereby confirming the model's semiclassical behavior. This work offers a compelling geometric perspective on open chaotic quantum systems and sheds new light on the quantum-classical transition.</p>

            <h2>Coupled-wire construction of non-Abelian higher-order topological phases</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiaxin Pan, Longwen Zhou</p>
            <p>Non-Abelian topological charges (NATCs), characterized by their noncommutative algebra, offer a framework for describing multigap topological phases beyond conventional Abelian invariants. While higher-order topological phases (HOTPs) host boundary states at corners or hinges, their characterization has largely relied on Abelian invariants such as winding and Chern numbers. Here, we propose a coupled-wire scheme of constructing non-Abelian HOTPs and analyze a non-Abelian second-order topological insulator as its minimal model. The resulting Hamiltonian supports hybridized corner modes, protected by parity-time-reversal plus sublattice symmetries and described by a topological vector that unites a non-Abelian quaternion charge with an Abelian winding number. Corner states emerge only when both invariants are nontrivial, whereas weak topological edge states of non-Abelian origins arise when the quaternion charge is nontrivial, enriching the bulk-edge-corner correspondence. The system further exhibits both non-Abelian and Abelian topological phase transitions, providing a unified platform that bridges these two distinct topological classes. Our work extends the understanding of HOTPs into non-Abelian regimes and suggests feasible experimental realizations in synthetic quantum systems, such as photonic or acoustic metamaterials.</p>

            <h2>Quantization of Physical Interaction Strengths via Singular Moduli</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Prasoon Saurabh</p>
            <p>Since the 2019 redefinition of the SI units, precision metrology has sought to anchor all physical quantities to fundamental constants and integer invariants. While the optical frequency comb revolutionized timekeeping by discretizing the continuum of light into countable teeth, and the Quantum Hall Effect standardized resistance via topological invariants, a comparable standard for interaction strength remains elusive. Currently, measuring the coupling constant ($g$) between quantum systems is an estimation problem, inherently subject to drift, noise, and fabrication variance. Here, we introduce Interaction Metrology, a protocol that transforms the measurement of coupling strengths from an analog estimation into a topological counting problem. By engineering a specific class of algebraic catastrophe -- the Unimodal $X_9$ singularity -- in a driven-dissipative lattice, we prove that the system's interaction moduli are topologically forced to take discrete, quantized values, forming a "Geometric $k$-Comb." We derive the universality class of this quantization, showing that it arises from the discrepancy between the Milnor ($\mu$) and Tjurina ($\tau$) numbers of the effective potential, a strictly non-Hermitian effect forbidden in standard quantum mechanics. Finally, we provide an ab-initio blueprint for a silicon nitride implementation, demonstrating that this quantization is robust against disorder levels exceeding current foundry tolerances. This discovery establishes a universal standard for force sensing and quantum logic gates, enabling the calibration of interaction strengths with topological certainty.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dennis Delali Kwesi Wayo, Rodrigo Alves Dias, Leonardo Goliatt, Sven Groppe</p>
            <p>We introduce DifGa, a fully differentiable error-mitigation framework for continuous-variable (CV) quantum photonic circuits operating under Gaussian loss and weak non-Gaussian noise. The approach is demonstrated using analytic simulations with the this http URL backend of PennyLane, where quantum states are represented by first and second moments and optimized end-to-end via automatic differentiation. Gaussian loss is modeled as a beam splitter interaction with an environmental vacuum mode of transmissivity $\eta \in [0.3,0.95]$, while non-Gaussian phase noise is incorporated through a differentiable Monte-Carlo mixture of random phase rotations with jitter amplitudes $\delta \in [0,0.7]$. The core architecture employs a multi-mode Gaussian circuit consisting of a signal, ancilla, and environment mode. Input states are prepared using squeezing and displacement operations with parameters $(r_s,\varphi_s,\alpha)=(0.60,0.30,0.80)$ and $(r_a,\varphi_a)=(0.40,0.10)$, followed by an entangling beam splitter with angles $(\theta,\phi)=(0.70,0.20)$. Error mitigation is achieved by appending a six-parameter trainable Gaussian recovery layer comprising local phase rotations and displacements, optimized by minimizing a quadratic loss on the signal-mode quadratures $\langle \hat{x}_0\rangle$ and $\langle \hat{p}_0\rangle$ using gradient descent with fixed learning rate $0.06$ and identical initialization across experiments. Under pure Gaussian loss, the optimized recovery suppresses reconstruction error to near machine precision ($<10^{-30}$) for moderate loss ($\eta \ge 0.5$). When non-Gaussian phase noise is present, noise-aware training using Monte Carlo averaging yields robust generalization, reducing error by more than an order of magnitude compared to Gaussian-trained recovery at large phase jitter. Runtime benchmarks confirm linear scaling with the number of Monte Carlo samples.</p>

            <h2>Efficient simulation of logical magic state preparation protocols</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samyak Surti, Lucas Daguerre, Isaac H. Kim</p>
            <p>Developing space- and time-efficient logical magic state preparation protocols will likely be an essential step towards building a large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computer. Motivated by this need, we introduce a scalable method for simulating logical magic state preparation protocols under the standard circuit-level noise model. When applied to protocols based on code switching, magic state cultivation, and magic state distillation, our method yields a complexity polynomial in (i) the number of qubits and (ii) the non-stabilizerness, e.g., stabilizer rank or Pauli rank, of the target encoded magic state. The efficiency of our simulation method is rooted in a curious fact: every circuit-level Pauli error in these protocols propagates to a Clifford error at the end. This property is satisfied by a large family of protocols, including those that repeatedly measure a transversal Clifford that squares to a Pauli. We provide a proof-of-principle numerical simulation that prepares a magic state using such logical Clifford measurements. Our work enables practical simulation of logical magic state preparation protocols without resorting to approximations or resource-intensive state-vector simulations.</p>

As a result of studying if their operations can be fully explained by Mermin's instructional sets, we show that the GHZ and Dicke states of three qubits and the GHZ state of four qubits do not allow such a description. However, among the two generalized Dicke states of four qubits, one does allow and the other does not allow such a description.</p>

            <p>Broad applications of quantum computers will require error correction (EC). However, quantum hardware roadmaps indicate that physical qubit numbers will remain limited in the foreseeable future, leading to residual logical errors that limit the size and accuracy of achievable computations. Recent work suggested logical error mitigation (LEM), which applies known error mitigation (EM) methods to logical errors, eliminating their effect at the cost of a runtime overhead. Improving the efficiency of LEM is crucial for increasing the logical circuit volumes it enables to execute. We introduce syndrome-aware logical error mitigation (SALEM), which makes use of the syndrome data measured during error correction, when mitigating the logical errors. The runtime overhead of SALEM is exponentially lower than that of previously proposed LEM schemes, resulting in significantly increased circuit volumes that can be executed accurately. Notably, relative to the routinely used combination of error correction and syndrome rejection (post-selection), SALEM increases the size of reliably executable computations by orders of magnitude. In this practical setting in which space and time are both resources that need to be optimized, our work reveals a surprising phenomenon: SALEM, which tightly combines EC with EM, can outperform physical EM even above the standard fault-tolerance threshold. Thus, SALEM can make use of EC in regimes of physical error rates at which EC is commonly deemed useless.</p>

            <p>We present a hybrid quantum-classical framework augmented with learned error mitigation for solving the viscous Burgers equation on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. Using the Cole-Hopf transformation, the nonlinear Burgers equation is mapped to a diffusion equation, discretized on uniform grids, and encoded into a quantum state whose time evolution is approximated via Trotterized nearest-neighbor circuits implemented in Qiskit. Quantum simulations are executed on noisy Aer backends and IBM superconducting quantum devices and are benchmarked against high-accuracy classical solutions obtained using a Krylov-based solver applied to the corresponding discretized Hamiltonian. From measured quantum amplitudes, we reconstruct the velocity field and evaluate physical and numerical diagnostics, including the L2 error, shock location, and dissipation rate, both with and without zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE). To enable data-driven error mitigation, we construct a large parametric dataset by sweeping viscosity, time step, grid resolution, and boundary conditions, producing matched tuples of noisy, ZNE-corrected, hardware, and classical solutions together with detailed circuit metadata. Leveraging this dataset, we train an attention-based graph neural network that incorporates circuit structure, light-cone information, global circuit parameters, and noisy quantum outputs to predict error-mitigated solutions. Across a wide range of parameters, the learned model consistently reduces the discrepancy between quantum and classical solutions beyond what is achieved by ZNE alone. We discuss extensions of this approach to higher-dimensional Burgers systems and more general quantum partial differential equation solvers, highlighting learned error mitigation as a promising complement to physics-based noise reduction techniques on NISQ devices.</p>

            <p>We investigate squeezed states of composite bosons (cobosons) formed by pairs of spin-$1/2$ fermions, with emphasis on Frenkel-like cobosons. While squeezing for standard bosonic modes is well established, its extension to cobosons requires accounting for Pauli blocking and the resulting non-canonical commutation algebra. Building on earlier constructions of coboson coherent states, we define squeezed cobosons as eigenstates of a Bogoliubov transformed coboson operator and derive explicit expressions for the associated quadrature variances. We show that the underlying fermionic structure leads to state-dependent modifications of the Heisenberg--Robertson uncertainty bound, which may fall below the canonical bosonic limit without implying any violation of uncertainty principles. Numerical results based on finite-dimensional matrix representations illustrate how these effects constrain the attainable squeezing. Our framework is relevant to composite boson systems such as tightly bound electron-hole pairs and provides a physically transparent setting to probe compositeness through observable quadrature fluctuations.</p>

            <p>Quantum entanglement is a crucial resource in quantum information processing, advancing quantum technologies. The greater the uncertainty in subsystems' pure states, the stronger the quantum entanglement between them. From the dual form of $q$-concurrence ($q\geq 2$) we introduce the total concurrence.

Analytical lower bounds for the $\mathcal{C}^{t}_q$-concurrence are derived. In addition, an analytical expression is derived for the $\mathcal{C}^{t}_q$-concurrence in the cases of isotropic and Werner states. Furthermore, the monogamy relations that the $\mathcal{C}^{t}_q$-concurrence satisfies for qubit systems are examined. Additionally, based on the parameterized $\alpha$-concurrence and its complementary dual, the $\mathcal{C}^{t}_\alpha$-concurrence $(0\leq\alpha\leq\frac{1}{2})$ is also proposed.</p>

            <p>Quantum speed limits (QSLs) establish intrinsic bounds on the minimum time required for the evolution of quantum systems. We present a class of QSLs formulated in terms of the two-parameter Sharma-Mittal entropy (SME), applicable to finite-dimensional systems evolving under general nonunitary dynamics. In the single-qubit case, the QSLs for both quantum channels and non-Hermitian dynamics are analyzed in detail. For many-body systems, we explore the role of SME-based bounds in characterizing the reduced dynamics and apply the results to the XXZ spin chain model. These entropy-based QSLs characterize fundamental limits on quantum evolution speeds and may be employed in contexts including entropic uncertainty relations, quantum metrology, coherent control and quantum sensing.</p>

            <h2>Parametric amplification of continuous variable entangled state for loss-tolerant multi-phase estimation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sijin Li, Wei Wang</p>
            <p>Quantum parameter estimation exploits quantum states to achieve estimation sensitivity beyond classical limit. In continuous variable (CV) regime, squeezed state has been exploited to implement deterministic phase estimation. It is however, often restricted by fragility of quantum states. The quantum phase estimation sensitivity of squeezed state is significantly affected by loss or detection inefficiency, which restrict its applications. This issue can be solved by using a method of parametric amplification of squeezed state \cite{OPA}. In this work, we implement multi-phase estimation with optical parametric amplification of entanglement generated from squeezed states. We find multi-phase estimation sensitivity is robust against loss or detection inefficiency, where we use two-mode Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen entangled state and four-mode cluster state for analysis. Our work provides a method for realizing large-scale quantum metrology in real-world applications against loss or detection inefficiency.</p>

            <p>Quantum key distribution (QKD) enables secure communication by harnessing the fundamental principles of quantum physics, which inherently guarantee information-theoretic security and intrinsic resistance to quantum computing attacks. However, the secure key rate of QKD typically decreases exponentially with increasing channel distance. In this work, by developing a novel polarization-state preparation method, an ultra-low time-jitter laser source and superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors, we demonstrate a 5-GHz integrated QKD system featuring ultra-low quantum bit error rates (QBERs). The system achieves secure key rates of 1.076 Mbps at 150 km and 105 kbps at 200 km over standard single-mode fiber channels, respectively. Our system substantially enhances the secure key rate, enabling high-resolution video calls with one-time-pad encryption over intercity backbone QKD links. This work represents a significant step forward in the development of high-performance practical QKD systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Souvik Chatterjee, Prasenjit Deb, Chandan Datta, Pankaj Agrawal</p>
            <p>Multipartite entangled states possess a number of non-intuitive properties, making them a useful resource for various quantum information-processing tasks. The three-qubit W-state is one such example where every state is robust to single-qubit loss. However, this state is not suitable for deterministic distribution, and deterministic communication protocols. Here, we focus on the distribution of a non-symmetric version of such states, namely $W_{\mathrm{mod}}$ states. These states belong to the W-class, and have one ebit of entanglement across a specific bipartition, enabling deterministic teleportation and superdense coding. In particular, we describe a few protocols through which these multipartite entangled states can be distributed {\it deterministically} in a quantum network by first preparing them locally in a central node and then transmitting individual qubits to the end nodes. We analyse the performance of these protocols based on the fidelity of the final distributed state, considering all types of noises that can act during the distribution. Finally, we compare the performance of the protocols to the case where the distribution is performed without any central node.</p>

            <h2>Gravitationally Induced Entanglement Between Particles in Harmonic Traps: Limits for Gaussian States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julia Tokarska, Andrzej Dragan</p>
            <p>Gravitationally induced entanglement has been proposed as a probe of the quantum nature of gravity. This work analyzes a system of two particles in harmonic traps interacting only through gravity, considering thermal and two-mode squeezed initial states. For thermal states, a maximum temperature is identified above which entanglement cannot be generated, and for fixed system parameters an optimal trap frequency that maximizes the logarithmic negativity is found. Squeezing the initial state does not further enhance the entanglement generation, but increases the temperature range over which it can be observed. Extending the analysis to general Gaussian states, an upper bound on the achievable entanglement is derived and shown to be saturated, for example, by ground and squeezed states. The results show that the amount of entanglement generated in this setup is extremely small, highlighting the experimental challenges of observing gravitationally induced quantum effects.</p>

            <p>An effective model for describing the relativistic quantum dynamics of a radiating electron is developed via a relativistic generalization of the Lindblad master equation. By incorporating both radiation reaction and vacuum fluctuations into the Dirac equation within an open quantum system framework, our approach captures the Zitterbewegung of the electron, ensuing noncommutativity of its effective spatial coordinates, and provides the quantum analogue of the Landau-Lifshitz (LL) classical equation of motion with radiation reaction. We develop the corresponding phase-space representation via the relativistic Wigner function and derive the semiclassical limit through a Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation. The latter elucidates the signature of quantum vacuum fluctuations in the LL equation, and shows its relationship with the corrected Sokolov equation. Our results offer a robust framework for investigating quantum radiation reaction effects in ultrastrong laser fields.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yevgeny Bar Lev, Jad C. Halimeh, Achilleas Lazarides</p>
            <p>With the advent of quantum simulation experiments of lattice gauge theories (LGTs), an open question is the effect of non-Hermiticity on their rich physics. The well-known PXP model, a U$(1)$ LGT with a two-level electric field in one spatial dimension, has become a paradigm of exotic physics in and out of equilibrium. Here, we introduce a non-Hermitian version in which the spin-flip rate differs between the two spin directions. While the naive expectation is that non-Hermiticity might suppress coherent phenomena such as quantum many-body scars, we find that when the facilitating direction of the spin is disfavored, the oscillations are instead \emph{enhanced}, decaying much slower than in the PXP limit. We demonstrate that this can be understood through a similarity transformation that maps our model to the standard PXP model, revealing that the oscillations are enhanced versions of the PXP scars. Our work provides an analytically tractable and conceptually simple example where non-Hermiticity enhances the stability of dynamically non-trivial coherent many-body modes.</p>

            <p>In this work, we investigate the dynamics of quantum synchronization in a four-mode optomechanical system, focusing on the influence of the Coulomb interaction between two mechanical resonators. We analyze the effect of the Coulomb coupling on three distinct synchronization regimes, i.e., complete quantum synchronization, $\phi$-synchronization, and quantum phase synchronization. Our results show that while the Coulomb interaction plays a pivotal role in significantly enhancing quantum phase synchronization by facilitating energy exchange and phase coherence, it has little impact on complete and $\phi$-synchronization. This indicates that amplitude and frequency locking are primarily determined by the optical driving, whereas phase alignment depends critically on inter-resonator coupling. We also demonstrate that the oscillations of the two optical cavities, which are indirectly coupled via the mechanical resonators, can become aligned over time, resulting in classical synchronization. These findings provide a robust mechanism for controlling collective quantum dynamics and offer a foundation for applications in quantum communication, precision sensing, and the development of synchronized quantum networks.</p>

            <p>These lecture notes discuss applications of atom-light interactions in cavities to quantum metrology, simulation, and computation. A focus is on nonlocally interacting spin systems realized by coupling many atoms to a delocalized mode of light. We will build up from the fundamentals: understanding how a cavity enables light to coherently imprint information on atoms and atoms to imprint information on the light, enabling quantum non-demolition measurements that constitute a powerful means of engineering nonclassical states. By extension, letting the intracavity light act back on the atoms enables coherent photon-mediated interactions. I start by discussing collective spin models, emphasizing applications in entanglement-enhanced metrology, before proceeding to richer many-body physics enabled by incorporating spatiotemporal control or employing multiple cavity modes. I will highlight opportunities for leveraging these tools for quantum simulations inspired by problems in condensed matter and quantum gravity. Along the way, I provide a pedagogical introduction to criteria for strong atom-light coupling, illustrate how the corresponding figure of merit -- the cooperativity -- sets fundamental limits on the coherence of atom-light interactions, and discuss prospects for harnessing high-cooperativity cavity QED in quantum simulation and computation.</p>

            <p>Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) features a high key rate and compatibility with classical optical communication. Developing expandable and efficient CVQKD networks will promote the deployment of large-scale quantum communication networks in the future. This paper proposes a CVQKD network based on the entangled states of an optical frequency comb. This scheme generates Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen entangled states with a frequency comb structure through the process of a type-II optical parametric oscillator. By combining with the scheme of entanglement in the middle, a fully connected CVQKD network capable of distributing secret keys simultaneously can be formed. We analyze the security of the system in the asymptotic case. Simulation results show that under commendable controlling of system loss and noise, the proposed scheme is feasible for deploying a short-distance fully connected CVQKD network. Loss will be the main factor limiting the system's performance. The proposed scheme provides new ideas for a multi-user fully connected CVQKD network.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Li-Wei Wang, Bolun Hu, Haixiao Zhang, Kefan Sun, Ying Cheng, Jian-Hua Jiang</p>
            <p>The interplay between topology and non-Hermiticity gives rise to exotic dynamic phenomena that challenge conventional wave-packet propagation and entanglement dynamics. While recent studies have established the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) as a key mechanism for anomalous wave dynamics, a unified framework for characterizing and controlling entanglement evolution in non-Hermitian topological systems remains underdeveloped. Here, by combining theory and experiments, we demonstrate that entanglement entropy (EE) and transport currents serve as robust dynamic probes to distinguish various non-Hermitian topological regimes. Using a generalized non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model implemented in an acoustic analog platform, we identify three dynamic phases, bulk-like, edge-like, and skin-like regimes, each exhibiting unique EE signatures and transport characteristics. In particular, skin-like dynamics exhibit periodic information shuttling with finite, oscillatory EE, while edge-like dynamics lead to complete EE suppression. We further map the dynamic phase diagram and show that EE scaling and temporal profiles directly reflect the competition between coherent delocalization and NHSE-driven localization. Our results establish a programmable approach to steering entanglement and transport via tailored non-Hermitian couplings, offering a pathway for engineering quantum information dynamics in synthetic phononic, photonic, and quantum simulators.</p>

            <h2>Linear exciton Hall and Nernst effects in monolayer two-dimensional semiconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weilong Guo, Lianguo Li, Qingjun Tong, Ci Li</p>
            <p>This paper focuses on the study of linear exciton Hall and Nernst effects in monolayer two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors, employing the semi-classical transport theory. By deriving the exciton Berry curvature in momentum space for a general inhomogeneous 2D system, we establish its dependence on the Berry curvature and the effective mass of electron and hole. As illustrative examples, the exciton Hall effect in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and black phosphorus (BP) are calculated. For these materials, we demonstrate that a linear Hall (Nernst) exciton current with the non-zero Berry curvature is strictly forbidden by the symmetries. This finding aligns with earlier experimental observations on the exciton Hall effect in MoSe$_2$. In contrast, a strong anisotropy in BP leads to a net linear Hall current of excitons, exhibiting a relatively large value and resembling an anomalous Hall effect rather than a valley Hall effect. Our work reveals that the specific symmetry of 2D materials can induce a significant linear exciton Hall (Nernst) effect even without Berry curvature, which is normally forbidden with non-zero Berry curvature in the monolayer 2D material. This observation holds promise for future optoelectronic applications and offers exciting possibilities for experimental exploration.</p>

            <p>Quantum simulation relies on the preparation and control of low-entropy many-body systems to reveal the behavior of classically intractable models. The development of new approaches for realizing such systems therefore represents a frontier in quantum science. Here we experimentally demonstrate a new protocol for generating ultracold, itinerant many-body states in a tunnel-coupled two-dimensional optical lattice. We do this by adiabatically connecting a near-ground-state-cooled array of up to 50 single strontium-86 atoms with a Bose-Hubbard superfluid. Through comparison with finite-temperature quantum-Monte-Carlo calculations, we estimate that the entropy per particle of the prepared many-body states is approximately $2 k_B$, and that the achieved temperatures are consistent with a significant superfluid fraction. This represents the first time that itinerant many-body systems have been prepared from rearranged atoms, opening the door to bottom-up assembly of a wide range of neutral-atom and molecular systems.</p>

            <p>We prove that the ``chordality condition'', which was established in arXiv:2412.18018 as a necessary condition for an entropy vector to be realizable by a holographic simple tree graph model, is also sufficient. The proof is constructive, demonstrating that the algorithm introduced in arXiv:2512.18702 for constructing a simple tree graph model realization of a given entropy vector that satisfies this condition always succeeds. We emphasize that these results hold for an arbitrary number of parties, and, given that any entropy vector realizable by a holographic graph model can also be realized, at least approximately, by a stabilizer state, they highlight how techniques originally developed in holography can provide broad insights into entanglement and information theory more generally, and in particular, into the structure of the stabilizer and quantum entropy cones. Moreover, if the strong form of the conjecture from arXiv:2204.00075 holds, namely, if all holographic entropy vectors can be realized by (not necessarily simple) tree graph models, then the result of this work demonstrates that the essential data that encodes the structure of the holographic entropy cone for an arbitrary number of parties, is the set of ``chordal'' extreme rays of the subadditivity cone.</p>

            <p>The performance and scalability of semiconductor quantum-dot (QD) qubits are limited by electrostatic drift and charge noise that shift operating points and destabilize qubit parameters. As systems expand to large one- and two-dimensional arrays, manual recalibration becomes impractical, creating a need for autonomous stabilization frameworks. Here, we introduce a method that uses the full network of charge-transition lines in repeatedly acquired double-quantum-dot charge stability diagrams (CSDs) as a multidimensional probe of the local electrostatic environment. By accurately tracking the motion of selected transitions in time, we detect voltage drifts, identify abrupt charge reconfigurations, and apply compensating updates to maintain stable operating conditions. We demonstrate our approach on a 10-QD device, showing robust stabilization and real-time diagnostic access to dot-specific noise processes. The high acquisition rate of radio-frequency reflectometry CSD measurements also enables time-domain noise spectroscopy, allowing the extraction of noise power spectral densities, the identification of two-level fluctuators, and the analysis of spatial noise correlations across the array. From our analysis, we find that the background noise at 100~$\mu$\si{\hertz} is dominated by drift with a power law of $1/f^2$, accompanied by a few dominant two-level fluctuators and an average linear correlation length of $(188 \pm 38)$~\si{\nano\meter} in the device. These capabilities form the basis of a scalable, autonomous calibration and characterization module for QD-based quantum processors, providing essential feedback for long-duration, high-fidelity qubit operations.</p>

            <p>For more than 50 years, an elegant energy gap (EG) law developed by Englman and Jortner [Mol. Phys. {\bf 18}, 145 (1970)] has served as a key theory to understand and model nearly exponential dependence of nonradiative transition rates on the difference of energy between the initial and final states. This work revisits the theory, clarifies key assumptions involved in the rate expression, and provides a generalization for the cases where the effects of temperature dependence and low frequency modes cannot be ignored. For a specific example where the low frequency vibrational and/or solvation responses can be modeled as an Ohmic spectral density, a simple generalization of the EG law is provided. Test calculations demonstrate that this generalized EG law brings significant improvement over the original EG law. Both the original and generalized EG laws are also compared with stationary phase approximations developed for electron transfer theory, which suggests the possibility of a simple interpolation formula valid for any value of EG.</p>

            <p>The GKP encoding is a top contender among bosonic codes for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Analysis of the GKP code is complicated by the fact that finite-energy code states leak out of the ideal GKP code space and are not orthogonal. We analyze a variant of the GKP stabilizer measurement circuit using damped, approximate GKP states that virtually project onto the ideal GKP code space between rounds of error correction even when finite-energy GKP states are used. This allows us to identify logical maps between projectors; however, due to finite-energy effects, these maps fail to resolve completely positive, trace-preserving channels on the logical code space. We present two solutions to this problem based on channel twirling the damping operator. The first twirls over the full stabilizer group motivated by standard binning (SB) decoding that converts small amounts of damping into Gaussian random noise. The second twirls over a set of representative Pauli shifts that keeps the energy in the code finite and allow for arbitrary decoding. This approach is not limited to small damping, can be applied when logical GKP unitaries or other sources of CV noise are present, and allows us to study general decoding, which can be optimized to the noise in the circuit. Focusing on damping, we compare decoding strategies tailored to different levels of effective squeezing. While our results indicate that SB decoding is suboptimal for finite-energy GKP states, the advantage of optimized decoding over SB decoding shrinks as the energy in the code increases, and moreover the performance of both strategies converges to that of the stabilizer-twirled logical channel. These studies provide stronger arguments for commonplace procedures in the analysis of GKP error correction:(i) using stochastically shifted GKP states in place of coherently damped ones, and(ii) the use of SB decoding.</p>

            <p>Superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) cavities offer a promising platform for quantum computing due to their long coherence times, yet integrating nonlinear elements like transmons for control often introduces additional loss. We report a multimode quantum system based on a 2-cell elliptical shaped SRF cavity, comprising two cavity modes weakly coupled to an ancillary transmon circuit, designed to preserve coherence while enabling efficient control of the cavity modes. We mitigate the detrimental effects of the transmon decoherence through careful design optimization that reduces transmon-cavity couplings and participation in the dielectric substrate and lossy interfaces, to achieve single-photon lifetimes of 20.6 ms and 15.6 ms for the two modes, and a pure dephasing time exceeding 40 ms. This marks an order-of-magnitude improvement over prior 3D multimode memories. Leveraging sideband interactions and novel error-resilient protocols, including measurement-based correction and post-selection, we achieve high-fidelity control over quantum states. This enables the preparation of Fock states up to $N = 20$ with fidelities exceeding 95%, the highest reported to date to the authors' knowledge, as well as two-mode entanglement with an estimated coherence-limited fidelities of 99.9% after post-selection. These results establish our platform as a robust foundation for quantum information processing, allowing for future extensions to high-dimensional qudit encodings.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hermann L. Albrecht</p>
            <p>Although introduced for entanglement, quantum repeaters and swapping protocols have been analyzed for other quantum correlations (QC), such as quantum discord. In 2015, Mundarain and Ladrón de Guevara [Quantum Inf. Process. 14, 4493 (2015)] introduced local-available quantum correlations (LAQC), which are a promising yet understudied quantum correlation. Recently, Bellorin et al. [Int. J. Mod. Phys. B 36, 22500990 (2022), Int. J. Mod. Phys. B 36, 2250154 (2022)] obtained exact analytical results for the LAQC quantifier of general 2-qubit X states. Building up from those results, we analyzed the LAQC swapping for 2-qubit X states. As expected, we find that if the initial states are non-classical and the one used for the projective measurement is entangled, the final state will generally have non-zero LAQC. Using the properties of this quantum correlation, we establish the conditions for a QCS scheme that leads to a final state with a non-zero LAQC measure. We illustrate these results by analyzing five families of one-parameter 2-qubit X states, including families where the projective measure leads to a separable state, but whose LAQC measure is non-zero. This feature opens the possibility for this quantum correlation to be considered a genuine resource in quantum information technology.</p>

We present an updated survey of various techniques to generate such strongly entangled states, including those going beyond the standard construction of graph and stabilizer states. Our contribution includes, in particular, analysis of the degree of entanglement of reduced states obtained by partial trace of AME projectors, states obtained by a symmetric superposition of GHZ states, an orthogonal frequency square representation of the "golden" AME state and an updated summary of the number of local unitary equivalence classes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Truong-Son P. Van, Daniel Maienshein, David W. Snoke</p>
            <p>We show that a simple model of non-Hermitian noise gives rise to the telegraph switching behavior seen in experiments with single qubits, without any reference to the existence of photons as corpuscles. This lends support to a continuous collapse interpretation of quantum mechanics, but can also be viewed as a model of continuous detection of a steady-state process in the incoherent limit. We show explicitly that such a system obeys the Born rule for particle counting statistics, even though no particle behavior has been invoked at any point in the calculation.</p>

            <h2>Empty-Signal Detection and the Principle-Level Feasibility of Arbitrarily Long-Distance Repeaterless Quantum Communication</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hao Shu</p>
            <p>Practical repeaterless quantum communication (PRQC) is fundamentally constrained by the divergence of the quantum bit error rate (QBER) arising from the interplay between channel loss and single-photon detector (SPD) dark counts. As the channel transmission rate decays exponentially with distance, vacuum-induced dark counts inevitably dominate detection events beyond a finite range, driving the QBER toward 50\% and rendering PRQC infeasible. Here, a theoretical framework termed empty-signal detection (ESD) is established to address this long-standing limitation at the level of principle. By encoding particle-existence information (PEI) onto an auxiliary degree of freedom (DOF) and employing controlled operations together with multi-copy analysis, the ESD paradigm enables vacuum-induced detection events to be identified and filtered without disturbing the encoded quantum information. Consequently, the non-empty signal rate (NESR) of the accepted signals can be stabilized at a distance-independent level under physically reasonable conditions, thereby suppressing the fundamental QBER within the secure bounds of PRQC, irrespective of channel attenuation. As a result, PRQC can, in principle, remain feasible over arbitrarily long distances, with the fundamental limitation shifting from distance-dependent QBER divergence to resource-dependent efficiency trade-offs. By providing a rigorous theoretical resolution of the fundamental QBER-induced distance limitation, this work clarifies the principle-level scalability of PRQC. Furthermore, the vacuum-filtering framework developed here may also be of interest in a broader class of loss-sensitive or detection-based quantum tasks.</p>

            <h2>Multipartite quantum entanglement in $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric molecular optomechanics: Nonreciprocal enhancement and thermal resilience to \SI{500}{\kelvin}</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> E. Kongkui Berinyuy, C. Tchodimou, P. Djorwé, S. K. Singh, S. G. Nana Engo</p>
            <p>We present a theoretical framework for a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric double-cavity molecular optomechanical system demonstrating nonreciprocal enhancement of multipartite quantum entanglement at elevated temperatures. All bipartite entanglement channels ($E_{ac}$, $E_{aB_1}$, $E_{cB_2}$, $E_{B_1B_2}$) simultaneously maximize at optimal nonreciprocal asymmetry $J_1/J_2 \approx 5$, with entanglement persisting to $T \sim \SIrange{400}{500}{\kelvin}$ (material-limited ceiling) two orders of magnitude beyond conventional optomechanical systems. This thermal resilience and balanced enhancement across all channels arise from synergistic combination of ultra-high-frequency molecular vibrations ($\omega_m/2\pi = \SI{30}{\tera\hertz}$), collective $\sqrt{N}$ coupling enhancement with $N=\num{e6}$ molecules, and directional nonreciprocal coupling shielding entanglement-generating interactions from backaction noise. Unlike optical parametric amplifier schemes where vibration-vibration enhancement suppresses optical-vibration correlations, our $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric architecture circumvents this fundamental trade-off, validated through rigorous stability analysis via Routh-Hurwitz criterion.</p>

            <h2>Navigating entanglement via Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida exchange: Snake, bouncing, boundary-residing, pulse, and damping-stabilized time-frozen trajectories</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Son-Hsien Chen, Seng Ghee Tan, Ching-Ray Chang</p>
            <p>Entanglement dynamics are fundamental to quantum technologies, yet navigating their temporal profiles (trajectories) remains challenging. Here, we propose a scalable solid-state platform based on RKKY exchange, where two spin qubits couple to a central spin qudit that oscillatorily spin-polarizes the surrounding conduction electrons. We introduce the exchange-time integral (ETI), which maps the spatial motion of the qubits to a time-dependent exchange interaction and serves as an effective "trajectory clock" governing the system evolution. We focus specifically on entanglement trajectories initially near the entanglement-unentanglement boundary, with the distance to this boundary quantified by concurrence extended to include negative values. By alternating the sign changes of the exchange, implemented through vibrational motion of qubits, the ETI enables programmable entanglement trajectories. For in-phase and antiphase vibrations, including scenarios with controlled stopping at the RKKY exchange-free nodes, we identify distinctive trajectories: snake (repeatedly crossing the boundary), bouncing (immediately reversing upon reaching the boundary), boundary-residing (remaining at the transition point), and pulse (controllable entanglement intervals). The vibration phase creates asymmetric shifts to the trajectories. The proposed device offers built-in error correction against dephasing by utilizing both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic regimes. Out-of-phase vibrations drive trajectories away from the boundary, accessing larger entanglement values but with irregular/unsteady final states. To stabilize these trajectories, we introduce a damping mechanism. Our framework offers a systematic method for navigating and engineering entanglement dynamics in quantum systems, with potential applications in quantum computation, cryptography, and metrology.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Signatures of Strange Attractors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bence Dárdai, Gábor Vattay</p>
            <p>In classical mechanics, driven systems with dissipation often exhibit complex, fractal dynamics known as strange attractors. This paper addresses the fundamental question of how such structures manifest in the quantum realm. We investigate the quantum Duffing oscillator, a paradigmatic chaotic system, using the Caldirola-Kanai (CK) framework, where dissipation is integrated directly into a time-dependent Hamiltonian. By employing the Husimi distribution to represent the quantum state in phase space, we present the first visualization of a quantum strange attractor within this model. Our simulations demonstrate how an initially simple Gaussian wave packet is stretched, folded, and sculpted by the interplay of chaotic dynamics and energy loss, causing it to localize onto a structure that beautifully mirrors the classical attractor. This quantum "photograph" is inherently smoothed, blurring the infinitely fine fractal details of its classical counterpart as a direct consequence of the uncertainty principle. We supplement this analysis by examining the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC), which shows that stronger dissipation clarifies the exponential growth associated with the classical Lyapunov exponent, thereby confirming the model's semiclassical behavior. This work offers a compelling geometric perspective on open chaotic quantum systems and sheds new light on the quantum-classical transition.</p>

            <p>The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is among leading candidates for achieving quantum advantage on near-term processors. While typically implemented with a transverse-field mixer (XM-QAOA), the Grover-mixer variant (GM-QAOA) offers a compelling alternative due to its global search capabilities. This work investigates the application of GM-QAOA to Higher-Order Unconstrained Binary Optimization (HUBO) problems, also known as Polynomial Unconstrained Binary Optimization (PUBO), which constitute a generalized class of combinatorial optimization tasks characterized by intrinsically multi-variable interactions. We present a comprehensive numerical study demonstrating that GM-QAOA, unlike XM-QAOA, exhibits monotonic performance improvement with circuit depth and achieves superior results for HUBO problems. An important component of our approach is an analytical framework for modeling GM-QAOA dynamics, which enables a classical approximation of the optimal parameters and helps reduce the optimization overhead. Our resource-efficient parameterized GM-QAOA nearly matches the performance of the fully optimized algorithm while being far less demanding, establishing it as a highly effective approach for complex optimization tasks. These findings highlight GM-QAOA's potential and provide a practical pathway for its implementation on current quantum hardware.</p>

            <p>Developing robust and high performance quantum software is challenging due to the dynamic nature of existing Python-based frameworks, which often suffer from runtime errors and scalability bottlenecks. In this work, we present LogosQ, a high performance backend agnostic quantum computing library implemented in Rust that enforces correctness through compile time type safety. Unlike existing tools, LogosQ leverages Rust static analysis to eliminate entire classes of runtime errors, particularly in parameter-shift rule gradient computations for variational algorithms. We introduce novel optimization techniques, including direct state-vector manipulation, adaptive parallel processing, and an FFT optimized Quantum Fourier Transform, which collectively deliver speedups of up to 900 times for state preparation (QFT) and 2 to 5 times for variational workloads over Python frameworks (PennyLane, Qiskit), 6 to 22 times over Julia implementations (Yao), and competitive performance with Q sharp. Beyond performance, we validate numerical stability through variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) experiments on molecular hydrogen and XYZ Heisenberg models, achieving chemical accuracy even in edge cases where other libraries fail. By combining the safety of systems programming with advanced circuit optimization, LogosQ establishes a new standard for reliable and efficient quantum simulation.</p>

            <h2>Relation between time- and spacelike entanglement entropy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wu-zhong Guo, Song He, Yu-Xuan Zhang</p>
            <p>In this study, we establish a connection between timelike and spacelike entanglement entropy. We show that timelike entanglement entropy is closely related to spacelike entanglement entropy and its temporal derivative. For a broad class of states, it can be uniquely determined by a linear combination of spacelike entanglement entropy and its first-order temporal derivative. This relation holds, for instance, in states conformally equivalent to the vacuum in two-dimensional conformal field theories. For more general states, we demonstrate that the relation can be constructed perturbatively. Our results suggest that timelike entanglement entropy is constrained by causality. Moreover, this relation provides a unified framework for timelike and spacelike entanglement entropy, within which the imaginary component of timelike entanglement entropy can be understood as arising from the non-commutativity between the twist operator and its first-order temporal derivative.</p>

            <p>Classical $(r,\delta)$-locally recoverable codes are designed for avoiding loss of information in large scale distributed and cloud storage systems. We introduce the quantum counterpart of those codes by defining quantum $(r,\delta)$-locally recoverable codes which are quantum error-correcting codes capable of correcting $\delta -1$ qudit erasures from sets of at most $r+ \delta -1$ qudits. We give a necessary and sufficient condition for a quantum stabilizer code $Q(C)$ to be $(r,\delta)$-locally recoverable. Our condition depends only on the puncturing and shortening at suitable sets of both the symplectic self-orthogonal code $C$ used for constructing $Q(C)$ and its symplectic dual $C^{\perp_s}$. When $Q(C)$ comes from a Hermitian or Euclidean dual-containing code, and under an extra condition, we show that there is an equivalence between the classical and quantum concepts of $(r,\delta)$-local recoverability. A Singleton-like bound is stated in this case and examples attaining the bound are given.</p>

            <p>This work presents a systematic account of elimination of angular dependency from nonrelativistic Schrödinger equation for a three-body quantum system with arbitrary masses, charges, angular momentum, and parity. The resulting reduced Schrödinger equation (RSE) for the reduced wave components, corresponding to the basis of solid bipolar harmonics, is presented in a compact matrix operator form. The variational form of RSE, providing a practical tool for calculating energy levels and wave functions, is also derived. The resulting angular integrals were derived by expanding bipolar harmonics in a basis of parity-adapted Wigner functions. The theoretical results are numerically validated by computing accurate energy levels for selected states of the helium atom in the explicitly correlated Hylleraas-type basis. The work aims to serve as a self-contained reference for the previously scattered throughout the scientific literature formulation of RSE, offering a convenient foundation for further analytical studies of three-particle quantum systems with arbitrary angular momentum and parity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Boris A. Khanikati, Konstantin Y. Bliokh</p>
            <p>Wave vortices constitute a large family of wave entities, closely related to phase singularities and orbital angular momentum (OAM). So far, two main classes of localized wave vortices have been explored: (i) transversely-localized monochromatic vortex beams that carry well-defined longitudinal OAM and propagate/diffract along the longitudinal $z$-axis in space, and (ii) 2D-localized spatiotemporal vortex pulses that carry the more elusive transverse (or tilted) OAM and propagate/diffract along both the $z$-axis and time. Here we introduce another class of wave vortices which are localized in a 2D $(x,y)$ plane, do not propagate in space (apart from uniform radial deformations), and instead propagate/diffract solely along time. These vortices possess well-defined transverse OAM and can naturally appear in 2D wave systems, such as surface polaritons or water waves. We provide a general integral expression for time-diffracting 2D wave vortices, their underlying ray model, and examples of approximate and exact wave solutions. We also analyze the temporal Gouy phase closely related to the rotational evolution in such vortices. Finally, we show that time-diffracting 2D vortices can provide strong spatiotemporal concentration of energy and OAM at sub-wavelength and oscillation-period scales.</p>

            <h2>Coupled-wire construction of non-Abelian higher-order topological phases</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiaxin Pan, Longwen Zhou</p>
            <p>Non-Abelian topological charges (NATCs), characterized by their noncommutative algebra, offer a framework for describing multigap topological phases beyond conventional Abelian invariants. While higher-order topological phases (HOTPs) host boundary states at corners or hinges, their characterization has largely relied on Abelian invariants such as winding and Chern numbers. Here, we propose a coupled-wire scheme of constructing non-Abelian HOTPs and analyze a non-Abelian second-order topological insulator as its minimal model. The resulting Hamiltonian supports hybridized corner modes, protected by parity-time-reversal plus sublattice symmetries and described by a topological vector that unites a non-Abelian quaternion charge with an Abelian winding number. Corner states emerge only when both invariants are nontrivial, whereas weak topological edge states of non-Abelian origins arise when the quaternion charge is nontrivial, enriching the bulk-edge-corner correspondence. The system further exhibits both non-Abelian and Abelian topological phase transitions, providing a unified platform that bridges these two distinct topological classes. Our work extends the understanding of HOTPs into non-Abelian regimes and suggests feasible experimental realizations in synthetic quantum systems, such as photonic or acoustic metamaterials.</p>

            <p>The transition to chaos for quantum dynamics is quantified via a finely tunable mixed random matrix ensemble. The {\it mixed Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (mGOE)} forms a pedagogically accessible family of systems in simulating {\it Many-Body Localization (MBL)} transitions. It can be tuned from chaotic to localized and heavy-tailed localized phases in a continuous fashion, providing an opportunity to explore new phases. We numerically study how the spectral properties of mGOE evolve during these transitions. Characterization of transition to quantum chaos is computed and analyzed via empirical spectral density, nearest-neighbor spacing, and adjacent gap ratios with statistical uncertainty quantifications that strengthens the robustness of evidence of transitions. The transition is identified as {\it Wigner Cat Phases}, because of the shape of empirical spectral densities, which depens on the tuneable parameter. These simulated phases in mGOE appear to be an ideal tool to study {\it Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH)} and its related transitions, representing a family of physical systems under different localisation and disorder strengths.</p>

            <h2>Bell-Inequality Violation for Continuous, Non-Projective Measurements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shalender Singh, Santosh Kumar</p>
            <p>Many solid-state quantum platforms do not permit sharp, projective measurements but instead yield continuous voltage or field traces under weak, non-demolition readout. In such systems, standard Bell tests based on dichotomic projective measurements are not directly applicable, raising the question of how quantum nonlocality can be certified from continuous time-series data. Here we develop a general theoretical framework showing that Bell-CHSH inequality violation can be extracted from continuous, non-projective measurements without assuming any specific collapse model or phase distribution. We show that sufficiently long continuous measurements of a single entangled pair sample its internal phase-probability structure, enabling effective dichotomic observables to be constructed through phase-sensitive projections and coarse-graining. The resulting Bell correlator is governed by two experimentally accessible resources: intrinsic single-qubit phase spread and nonlocal phase locking between qubits. We benchmark the resulting estimator against conventional projective-measurement CHSH tests implemented via quantum-circuit simulations using Qiskit, finding quantitative agreement in the Bell-violating regime without parameter fitting. Classical deterministic correlations cannot violate the CHSH bound, whereas quantum phase-locked systems recover the nonlinear angular dependence characteristic of entanglement. Our results provide a practical route to demonstrating Bell nonlocality in platforms where measurements are inherently continuous and weak.</p>

            <p>Wavefunction collapse is often regarded as an unavoidable consequence of quantum measurement. Here we show that in driven-dissipative quantum systems, continuous measurement can extract information without disturbing the physical steady-state ensemble. Using the stochastic master equation formalism, we identify measurement-invariant steady states whose unconditional density matrix remains unchanged under continuous monitoring, despite the presence of measurement-induced collapse at the level of individual quantum trajectories. This separation between conditional collapse and ensemble invariance leads to a regime of partial collapse, in which measurement-induced localization is transient and continuously counteracted by dissipation and drive. We establish a necessary and sufficient condition for steady-state invariance under continuous measurement and show-that it holds over a finite range of measurement strengths. Our results clarify how information gain and measurement backaction can be dynamically decoupled in open quantum systems, with implications for continuous quantum sensing and the foundations of nonprojective measurement.</p>

            <p>The transverse-field Ising model is useful for studying interacting qubit arrays. The Lieb--Robinson correlation function can be used to characterize the propagation of quantum information in Ising chains. Considerable work has been done to establish bounds on this correlation function in various circumstances. To actually calculate the value of the correlation function directly typically requires a state space which grows exponentially with system size, and so is intractable for all but relatively small systems. We employ a recently-developed method that enables direct calculation of the value of the Lieb--Robinson correlation function and which scales linearly with system size. This enables the computation for systems with many hundreds of qubits, revealing the propagation of quantum information down the chain. We extend this technique to the problem of Ising chains with randomly disordered coupling strengths. Increasing disorder causes localization of the quantum correlations and halts propagation of quantum information.</p>

            <p>Two-stage stochastic programming often discretizes uncertainty into scenarios, but scenario enumeration makes expected recourse evaluation scale at least linearly in the scenario count. We propose qGAN-QAOA, a unified quantum-circuit workflow in which a pre-trained quantum generative adversarial network encodes the scenario distribution and QAOA optimizes first-stage decisions by minimizing the full two-stage objective, including expected recourse cost. With the qGAN parameters fixed after training, we evaluate the objective as the expectation value of a problem Hamiltonian and optimize only the QAOA variational parameters. We interpret non-anticipativity as a condition on measurement outcome statistics and prove that the first-stage measurement marginal is independent of the scenario. For uniformly discretized uncertainty, the diagonal operator encoding the uncertainty admits a sparse Pauli-Z expansion via the Walsh--Hadamard transform, yielding polylogarithmic scaling of gate count and circuit depth with the number of scenarios. Numerical experiments on the stochastic unit commitment problem (UCP) with photovoltaic (PV) uncertainty compare the expected cost of the proposed method with classical expected-value and two-stage stochastic programming baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of qGAN-QAOA as a two-stage decision model.</p>

            <p>The out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) is a powerful tool for probing quantum information scrambling, a fundamental process by which local information spreads irreversibly throughout a quantum many-body system. Experimentally measuring the OTOC, however, is notoriously challenging due to the need for time-reversed evolution. Here, we present an experimental evaluation of the OTOC on a quantum computer, using three distinct protocols to address this challenge: the rewinding time method (RTM), the weak-measurement method (WMM), and the irreversibility-susceptibility method (ISM). Our experiments investigate the quantum dynamics of an XXZ spin-1/2 chain prepared in a thermal Gibbs state. As a key contribution, we provide the first experimental demonstration of the ISM, using the numerical emulator of the trapped-ion quantum computer, reimei. We also conduct a detailed comparative analysis of all three methods, revealing method-dependent behaviors in the measured OTOC. This work not only validates these protocols as practical tools for exploring quantum chaos on near-term hardware but also offers crucial insights into their respective advantages and limitations, providing a practical framework for future experimental investigations.</p>

The gate retains the $\pi-2\pi-\pi$ structure with an additional detuning added to the $2\pi$ pulse on the target qubit. The protocol reaches within a factor of 2.39 (1.68) of the fundamental fidelity limit set by Rydberg lifetime for equal (asymmetric) Rabi frequencies on the control and target qubits. We generalize the gate protocol to arbitrary controlled phases. We design optimal target-qubit phase waveforms to generalize the gate across a range of interaction strengths and we find that, within this family of gates, the constant-phase protocol is time-optimal for a fixed laser Rabi frequency and tunable interaction strength. Robust control methods are used to design gates that are robust against variations in Rydberg Rabi frequency or interaction strength.</p>

            <h2>Optimal Threshold for Fracton Codes and Nearly Saturated Code Capacity in Three Dimensions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giovanni Canossa, Lode Pollet, Miguel A. Martin-Delgado, Hao Song, Ke Liu</p>
            <p>Fracton codes have been intensively studied as novel topological states of matter, yet their fault-tolerant properties remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigate the optimal thresholds of self-dual fracton codes, in particular the checkerboard code, against stochastic Pauli noise. By utilizing a statistical-mechanical mapping combined with large-scale parallel tempering Monte Carlo simulations, we calculate the optimal code capacity of the checkerboard code to be $p_{th} \simeq 0.108(2)$. This value is the highest among known three-dimensional codes and nearly saturates the theoretical limit for topological codes. Our results further validate the generalized entropy relation for two mutually dual models, $H(p_{th}) + H(\tilde{p}_{th}) \approx 1$, and extend its applicability beyond standard topological codes. This verification indicates the Haah's code also possesses a code capacity near the theoretical limit $p_{th} \approx 0.11$. These findings highlight fracton codes as highly resilient quantum memory and demonstrate the utility of duality techniques in analyzing intricate quantum error-correcting codes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anwesha Chakraborty, Lucas Hackl, Mario Kieburg</p>
            <p>We study the average bipartite entanglement entropy of Haar-random pure states in quantum many-body systems with global $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ symmetry, constrained to fixed total spin $J$ and magnetization $J_z = 0$. Focusing on spin-$\tfrac12$ lattices and subsystem fractions $f < \frac{1}{2}$, we derive a asymptotic expression for the average entanglement entropy up to constant order in the system volume $V$. In addition to the expected leading volume law term, we prove the existence of a $\frac{1}{2}\log V$ finite-size correction resulting from the scaling of the Clebsch-Gordon coefficients and compute explicitly the $O(1)$ contribution reflecting angular-momentum coupling within magnetization blocks. Our analysis uses features of random matrix ensembles and provides a fully analytical treatment for arbitrary spin densities, thereby extending Page type results to non-Abelian sectors and clarifying how $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ symmetry shapes average entanglement.</p>

            <h2>Symmetry-Preserving Variational Quantum Simulation of the Heisenberg Spin Chain on Noisy Quantum Hardware</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rudraksh Sharma</p>
            <p>Variational quantum algorithms are among the most promising approaches for simulating interacting quantum many-body systems on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. However, the practical success of variational quantum eigensolvers (VQE) critically depends on the structure of the chosen variational ansatz. In this work, we investigate the ground-state properties of the one-dimensional antiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin-1/2 chain using both generic hardware-efficient ansatz and physics-informed, symmetry-preserving variational circuits. We benchmark variational results against exact diagonalization and noiseless simulations, and subsequently validate the approach on real IQM Garnet quantum hardware. Our results demonstrate that incorporating physical symmetries into the circuit design leads to significantly improved energy estimates, enhanced robustness against hardware noise, and clearer convergence behavior when compared to hardware-efficient ansatz under identical resource constraints. These findings highlight the importance of problem specific ansatz construction for reliable quantum simulations in the NISQ era.</p>

            <h2>Emergence of nonclassical radiation in strongly laser-driven quantum systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ivan Gonoskov, Christian Hünecke, Stefanie Gräfe</p>
            <p>Nonclassical light sources are central to emerging quantum technologies, yet current platforms offer limited tunability and typically operate at low photon numbers. In parallel, strong-field physics provides widely tunable, bright coherent radiation through high-order harmonic generation (HHG), but its quantum optical character has remained largely unexplained. While recent experiments have revealed signatures of entanglement, squeezing, and quantum-state modification in both the driving and generated fields, a unified theoretical framework capable of identifying the origin and controllability of these effects has been missing. Here we introduce a fully quantum, analytically tractable theory of intense light-matter interaction that rigorously captures the emergence of nonclassicality in HHG. Our approach employs a parametric factorization of the coupled electron-field system into a driven electronic state and a dynamically perturbed quantum optical field, derived directly from the time-dependent Schrödinger equation without requiring conditioning, homodyne detection, or mode-selection techniques. We show how quantum correlations, squeezing, and Wigner-function negativity arise intrinsically from the interaction dynamics, and we identify the precise conditions under which specific nonclassical features are amplified or suppressed. The theory enables predictive design of bright, high-photon-number quantum states at tunable frequencies, and we demonstrate its utility by outlining realistic conditions for generating bright nonclassical ultraviolet light. Our results establish a comprehensive foundation for strong-field quantum optics and open new avenues toward tabletop quantum light sources for sensing, communication, and photonic quantum information processing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xingjian He, Aoqian Shi, Jianjun Liu, Jiangbin Gong</p>
            <p>Criticality-based quantum sensing exploits hypersensitive response to system parameters near phase transition points. This work uncovers two metrological advantages offered by topological phase transitions when the probe is prepared as topological edge states. Firstly, the order of topological band touching is found to determine how the metrology sensitivity scales with the system size. Engineering a topological phase transition with higher-order band touching is hence advocated, with the associated quantum Fisher information scaling as $ \mathcal{F}_Q \sim L^{2p}$, with $L$ the lattice size in one dimension, and $p$ the order of band touching. Secondly, with a topological lattice accommodating degenerate edge modes (such as multiple zero modes), preparing an $N$-particle entangled state at the edge and then adiabatically tuning the system to the phase transition point grows quantum entanglement to macroscopic sizes, yielding $\mathcal{F}_Q \sim N^2 L^{2p}$. This work hence paves a possible topological phase transition-based route to harness entanglement, large lattice size, and high-order band touching for quantum metrology.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ido Fridman, Shemuel Sternklar, Eliran Talker</p>
            <p>We investigated experimentally and theoretically a cavity-free microwave field that couples the two ground states of a {\Lambda}-type atomic system, thereby forming a closed {\Delta} configuration. In this regime, the absence of cavity-imposed phase matching leads to a strong sensitivity of the ground-state coherence to the microwave field parameters. We observe that the coherent population trapping (CPT) resonance exhibits a pronounced dependence on the microwave power and detuning, resulting in measurable changes in resonance contrast, linewidth, and center frequency. To explain these effects, we develop a numerical density-matrix model in which the ground-state coherence explicitly incorporates the microwave coupling strength, capturing the essential physics of this no-phase-matching {\Delta} system. The excellent agreement between theory and experiment establishes a simple and robust framework for microwave control of cavity-free {\Delta}-type atomic systems, with direct implications for compact atomic clocks and quantum-enhanced quantum sensing platforms.</p>

            <p>The van der Waals interaction between neutral atoms is typically studied using stationary perturbation theory for the short-distance (London) limit, while long-distance (Casimir-Polder) results are usually derived via semiclassical, time-dependent approaches. In this pedagogical article, we demonstrate that reformulating stationary perturbation theory calculations in terms of time-ordered correlation functions significantly simplifies the mathematical treatment. This reformulation is particularly advantageous for higher-order calculations required in the long-distance regime, where retardation effects become important. Our approach provides a unified framework that connects both limiting cases while offering a clear conceptual picture suitable for advanced quantum mechanics courses.</p>

The inequality is valid for all states on the Poincaré-Bloch sphere, but few laboratory studies have investigated violations with the full sphere. In this article, we explore the experimental verifications of the predicted violations of the CHSH inequality with Bell and non-Bell states with same and different linear and elliptically polarized basis states for each photon. We find that Bell states violate CHSH when using the same basis for both photons, regardless of their ellipticity, whereas they show no violations for photon projections in different bases. We found non-Bell maximally-entangled states for which the converse is true.</p>

            <p>The study of quantum correlations within relativistic spacetimes, and the consequences of relativistic causality on information processing using such correlations, has gained much attention in recent years. In this paper, we establish a unified framework in the form of operational no-signalling constraints to study both nonlocal and temporal correlations within general relativistic spacetimes. We explore several intriguing consequences arising from our framework. Firstly, we show that the violation of the operational no-signalling constraints in Minkowski spacetime implies either a logical paradox or an operational infringement of Poincaré symmetry. We thereby examine and subvert recent claims in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 110401 (2022)] on the possibility of witnessing operationally detectable causal loops in Minkowski spacetime. Secondly, we explore the possibility of jamming of nonlocal correlations, controverting a recent claim in [Nat. Comm. 16, 269 (2025)] that a physical mechanism for jamming would necessarily lead to superluminal signalling. Finally, we show that in black hole spacetimes certain nonlocal correlations under and across the event horizon can be jammed by any agent without spoiling the operational no-signalling constraints.</p>

            <p>Divalent atoms have emerged as powerful alternatives to alkalis in ultracold atom platforms, offering unique advantages arising from their two-electron structure. Among these species, ytterbium (Yb) is especially promising, yet its anionic properties and its Rydberg spectrum remain comparatively unexplored. In this work, we perform a first and comprehensive experimental and theoretical investigation of ultralong-range Rydberg molecules (ULRMs) of $^{174}$Yb in $6sns\,^1S_0$ Rydberg states across nearly two decades in principal quantum number $n$ and three orders of magnitude in molecular binding energy. Using the Coulomb Green's function formalism, we compute Born-Oppenheimer molecular potentials describing the Rydberg atom in the presence of a ground-state perturber and achieve quantitative agreement with high-resolution molecular spectra. This enables the extraction of low-energy electron-Yb scattering phase shifts, including the zero-energy $s$-wave scattering length and the positions of two spin-orbit split $p$-wave shape resonances. Our results provide strong evidence that the Yb$^{-}$ anion exists only as a metastable resonance. We additionally show the sensitivity of ULRM spectra to the atomic quantum defects, using this to refine the value for the $6s23f\, ^1F_3$ quantum defect. Together, these findings establish Yb ULRMs as a powerful probe of electron-Yb interactions and lay essential groundwork for future Rydberg experiments with divalent atoms.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate a three-dimensional magneto-optical trap (MOT) of a metal hydride molecule, CaH. We are able to scatter $\sim$$10^{4}$ photons with vibrational loss covered up to vibrational quantum number $\nu=2$. This allows us to laser slow the molecular beam near zero velocity with a "white-light" technique and subsequently load it into a radio-frequency MOT. The MOT contains 230(40) molecules, limited by beam source characteristics and predissociative loss of CaH. The temperature of the MOT is below one millikelvin. The predissociative loss mechanism could, in turn, facilitate controlled dissociation of the molecule, offering a possible route to optical trapping of hydrogen atoms for precision spectroscopy.</p>

            <p>A massless scalar field in two spacetime dimensions splits into two independent sectors of left and right-moving modes on the light cone. At the quantum level, these two sectors carry a representation of the group of affine transformations of the real line, with translations corresponding to transformations generated by light-cone momenta and dilations given by light-cone Rindler momenta formed by a linear combination of generators of boosts and dilations. One-particle states for inertial observers are eigenvectors of translation generators belonging to irreducible representations of the affine group. Rindler one-particle states are related to eigenfunctions of the generator of dilations. We show that simple manipulations connecting these two representations involving the Mellin transform can be used to derive the thermal spectrum of Rindler particles observed by an accelerated observer. Beyond providing a representation-theoretic basis for vacuum thermal effects, our results suggest that analogous phenomena may arise in any quantum system admitting realizations of translation and dilation eigenstates.</p>

            <p>We introduce generalisations of von Neumann entanglement entropy that are invariant with respect to certain scale transformations. These constructions are based on Unit-Invariant Singular Value Decomposition (UISVD) with its right-, left-, and bi-invariant incarnations, which itself are variations of the standard Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) that remain invariant under (appropriate set of) diagonal transformations. These measures are naturally defined for non-Hermitian or rectangular operators and remain useful when the input and output spaces possess different dimensions or metric weights. We apply the UISVD entropy and discuss its advantages in the physically interesting framework of Biorthogonal Quantum Mechanics, whose important aspect is indeed the behavior under scale transformations. Further, we illustrate features of UISVD-based entropies in other representative settings, from simple quantum mechanical bipartite states to random matrices relevant to quantum chaos and holography, and in the context of Chern-Simons theory. In all cases, the UISVD yields stable, physically meaningful entropic spectra that are invariant under rescalings and normalisations.</p>

            <p>In the present study, we apply shortcut to adiabaticity pulses (time-dependent Rabi frequency and detuning) for the efficient population transfer from the ground to the exciton state in a GaAs/InGaAs quantum dot with phonon-induced dephasing. We use the time-evolving matrix product operator (TEMPO) method to propagate system in time and find that, for temperatures below $ 20 \ \text{K} $ and pulse duration up to $ 10 \ \text{ps} $, a very good transfer efficiency is obtained in general. We explain these results using a Bloch-like equation derived from a generalized Lindblad equation, which adequately describes system dynamics at lower temperatures. For higher temperatures, the transfer efficiency is significantly reduced except for subpicosecond pulses, where the shortcut Rabi frequency reduces to a delta pulse attaining a fast population inversion. The present work is expected to find application in quantum technologies which exploit quantum dots for single-photon generation on demand.</p>

            <p>Hybrid semiconductor-superconductor qubits have recently emerged as a promising alternative to traditional platforms, combining material advantages with device-level tunability. A defining feature is their gate-tunable Josephson coupling, enabling superconducting qubit architectures with full electric-field control and offering a path toward scalable, low-crosstalk quantum processors. This approach seeks to merge benefits of superconducting and semiconductor qubits, for instance by encoding quantum information in the spin of a quasiparticle occupying an Andreev bound state, thus combining long coherence times with fast, flexible control. Progress has accelerated through bottom-up engineering of Andreev states in coupled quantum dot arrays, leading to architectures such as minimal Kitaev chains hosting Majorana zero modes. In parallel, Hamiltonian-protected designs aim to enhance resilience against local noise and decoherence by exploiting superconducting phase dynamics and discrete charge or flux degrees of freedom. This article reviews recent theoretical and experimental advances in hybrid qubits, providing an overview of physical mechanisms, device implementations, and emerging architectures, with emphasis on their potential for (topologically) protected quantum information processing. While many designs remain at proof-of-concept stage, rapid progress suggests practical demonstrations may soon be achievable.</p>

In this work we numerically simulate the coherent control of a Ge hole spin using surface acoustic waves. The periodic strain dynamically modulates the $g$-tensor matrix and causes fast spin rotation under a small acoustic amplitude. Moreover, we show a strong anisotropy and confinement dependence of the Rabi frequency coming from the phase-shifted longitudinal and shear strain components.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saranesh Prembabu, Shu-Heng Shao, Ruben Verresen</p>
            <p>Gapless quantum phases can become distinct when internal symmetries are enforced, in analogy with gapped symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. However, this distinction does not always lead to protected edge modes, raising the question of how the bulk-boundary correspondence is generalized to gapless cases. We propose that the spatial interface between gapless phases -- rather than their boundaries -- provides a more robust fingerprint. We show that whenever two 1+1d conformal field theories (CFTs) differ in symmetry charge assignments of local operators or twisted sectors, any symmetry-preserving spatial interface between the theories must flow to a non-invertible defect. We illustrate this general result for different versions of the Ising CFT with $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2^T$ symmetry, obtaining a complete classification of allowed conformal interfaces. When the Ising CFTs differ by nonlocal operator charges, the interface hosts 0+1d symmetry-breaking phases with finite-size splittings scaling as $1/L^3$, as well as continuous phase transitions between them. For general gapless phases differing by an SPT entangler, the interfaces between them can be mapped to conformal defects with a certain defect 't Hooft anomaly. This classification also gives implications for higher-dimensional examples, including symmetry-enriched variants of the 2+1d Ising CFT. Our results establish a physical indicator for symmetry-enriched criticality through symmetry-protected interfaces, giving a new handle on the interplay between topology and gapless phases.</p>

            <p>Fermi's golden rule (FGR) serves as the basis for many expressions of spectroscopic observables and quantum transition rates. The utility of FGR has been demonstrated through decades of experimental confirmation. However, there still remain important cases where the evaluation of a FGR rate is ambiguous or ill-defined. Examples are cases where the rate has divergent terms due to the sparsity in the density of final states or time dependent fluctuations of system Hamiltonians. Strictly speaking, assumptions of FGR are no longer valid for such cases. However, it is still possible to define modified FGR rate expressions that are useful as effective rates. The resulting modified FGR rate expressions resolve a long standing ambiguity often encountered in using FGR and offer more reliable ways to model general rate processes. Simple model calculations illustrate the utility and implications of new rate expressions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haruki Emori, Hiroyasu Tajima</p>
            <p>Defining an error of measurement has long been a foundational problem in science: even in classical experiments, data are statistical and admit no single universally optimal definition of error. In quantum mechanics, the challenge deepens: observed entities often lack preexisting definite values, and the act of measurement unavoidably disturbs the system of interest. Consequently, both error and disturbance must be quantified, and various definitions have been proposed to date. However, a unified perspective for understanding the differences and similarities among these diverse definitions of error and disturbance, and an operational framework for distinguishing between them, remain elusive. In this Letter, we propose a novel framework for defining error and disturbance using irreversibility. Our framework converts the error and disturbance of a quantum measurement of a system under consideration into the irreversibility of an ancillary qubit system, using a quantum comb composed of loss and recovery processes. The mechanism enables us to make the operational distinction that error uses the classical outputs, while disturbance uses the quantum outputs of the measurement in the recovery process. Furthermore, our framework yields several key consequences: (i) it encompasses existing definitions, (ii) it establishes a universal constraint on error and disturbance defined by any measure of an arbitrary quantum process under a conservation law, and (iii) it reveals an operational connection between irreversibility and the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC), a metric of quantum chaos. It also provides a constraint on the OTOC under a conservation law and a method for its experimental evaluation, which is demonstrated on a quantum processor.</p>

            <p>A simple 4th order propagator [Ture and Jang, {\it J. Phys. Chem. A.} {\bf 128}, 2871 (2024)] based on the Magnus expansion (ME) is extended to the Liouville space for both closed-system and Lindbladian open-system quantum dynamics. For both dynamics, commutator free versions of 4th order propagators are provided as well. These propagators are then applied to the dynamics of a driven $\Lambda$-system, where Lindblad terms represent the effect of a photonic bath. For both dynamics, the accuracy of the rotating wave approximation (RWA) for the matter-radiation interaction is assessed. We confirmed reasonable performance of RWA for weak and resonant fields. However, small errors appear for moderate fields and substantial errors can be found for strong fields where coherent population trapping can still be expected. We also found that the presence of bath for open system quantum dynamics consistently reduces the errors of the RWA. These results provide a quantitative information on how the RWA breaks down beyond weak field or for non-resonant cases. Major results are benchmarked against results of our 6th order ME-based propagator. We also provide numerical comparison of our algorithms with other 4th order algorithms for the $\Lambda$-system. These confirm reasonable performance of our simple propagators and the improvement gained through commutator-free expressions.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we study excitations and dissipation in two infinite parallel metallic plates undergoing relative motion. The degrees of freedom of the electrons in both plates are modeled using the 1+2 dimensional Dirac field, and a nonlocal potential is selected to describe the interaction between the two plates. The internal relative motion is introduced via a Galilean boost, with one plate assumed to slide relative to the other. We then calculate the effective action of the system and derive the vacuum occupation number in momentum space using a perturbative method. Numerical plots reveal that the vacuum occupation number, as a function of momentum, is isotropic for a motion speed $v = 0$ and anisotropic for nonzero $v$. The relative motion induces energy transfer between the plates, leading to on-shell excitations in a manner analogous to the dissipative process of the Schwinger effect. Consequently, we study the motion-induced dissipation effects and the dissipative forces through the quantum action. Numerical results demonstrate that both the imaginary part of the quantum action due to the motion boost and the dissipative force exhibit a threshold as functions of $v$, and both are positively correlated with $v$.</p>

The localization process has universal features for the plateaus duration and the delocalization time. Interactions among the excitations favor this process even for tiniest disorder levels. Our findings can be applied to design stroboscopic protocols where sequences of transport and localization can be tailored. We establish relevant connections to noise-engineering of quantum devices in noisy intermediate-scale quantum simulators platforms, and to realistic biological systems where noise and disorder coexist.</p>

            <p>Complex quantum networks are powerful tools in the modeling of transport phenomena, particularly for biological systems, and enable the study of emergent phenomena in many-body quantum systems. High connectivity and long-range interactions induce strong constraints on the system dynamics. Here, we study the transport properties of a quantum network described by the paradigmatic XXZ Hamiltonian, with non-trivial graph connectivity and topology, and long-range interactions. We show how long-range interactions induce memory preserving effects and strongly affect the spreading of the excitations due to cooperative shielding. We describe the memory-preserving effect in all-to-all connected regular networks with distance-independent couplings. Indeed, the memory of the number of initially injected excitations is preserved over long times, encoded in the number of frequencies present in the dynamics. Interestingly, we find that memory-preserving effects occur also in less regular graphs, such as quantum networks with either power-law node connectivity or complex, small-world type, architectures. We discuss the implications of these properties in biology-related problems, such as an application to Weber's law in neuroscience, and their implementation in specific quantum technologies via biomimicry. We also show how the presence of long-range interaction strongly affects the dynamics of the excitations in small-world networks and power law all-to-all coupled networks. Indeed, because of cooperative shielding blue, as the connectivity or the range of interaction increases, the initial excitation spreads more slowly among the network and becomes strongly dependent on the initial conditions.</p>

            <h2>Learning to erase quantum states: thermodynamic implications of quantum learning theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haimeng Zhao, Yuzhen Zhang, John Preskill</p>
            <p>The energy cost of erasing quantum states depends on our knowledge of the states. We show that learning algorithms can acquire such knowledge to erase many copies of an unknown state at the optimal energy cost. This is proved by showing that learning can be made fully reversible and has no fundamental energy cost itself. With simple counting arguments, we relate the energy cost of erasing quantum states to their complexity, entanglement, and magic. We further show that the constructed erasure protocol is computationally efficient when learning is efficient. Conversely, under standard cryptographic assumptions, we prove that the optimal energy cost cannot be achieved efficiently in general. These results also enable efficient work extraction based on learning. Together, our results establish a concrete connection between quantum learning theory and thermodynamics, highlighting the physical significance of learning processes and enabling provably-efficient learning-based protocols for thermodynamic tasks.</p>

            <h2>Flow to Nishimori universality in weakly monitored quantum circuits with qubit loss</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Malte Pütz, Romain Vasseur, Andreas W.W. Ludwig, Simon Trebst, Guo-Yi Zhu</p>
            <p>In circuit-based quantum state preparation, qubit loss and coherent errors are circuit imperfections that imperil the formation of long-range entanglement beyond a certain threshold. The critical theory at the threshold is a continuous entanglement transition known to be described by a (2+0)-dimensional non-unitary conformal field theory which, for the two types of imperfections of certain circuits, is described by either percolation or Nishimori criticality, respectively. Here we study the threshold behavior when the two types of errors simultaneously occur and show that, when moving away from the Clifford-regime of projective stabilizer measurements, the percolation critical point becomes unstable and the critical theory flows to Nishimori universality. We track this critical renormalization group (RG) crossover flow by mapping out the entanglement phase diagrams, parametrized by the probability and strength of random weak measurements, of two dual protocols preparing surface code or GHZ-class cat states from a parent cluster state via constant-depth circuits. Extensive numerical simulations, using hybrid Gaussian fermion and tensor network / Monte Carlo sampling techniques on systems with more than a million qubits, demonstrate that an infinitesimal deviation from the Clifford regime leads to a sudden, strongly non-monotonic entanglement growth at the incipient non-unitary RG flow. We argue that spectra of scaling dimensions of both the percolation and Nishimori fixed points exhibit multifractality. For percolation, we provide the exact (non-quadratic) multifractal spectrum of exponents, while for the Nishimori fixed point we show high-precision numerical results for five leading exponents characterizing multifractality.</p>

            <p>Telecom wavelength quantum dots (QDs) are emerging as a promising solution for generating deterministic single photons compatible with existing fiber optic infrastructure. Emission in the low loss C band minimizes transmission losses, making them ideal for long distance quantum communication. In this work, we present a demonstration of both Stark tuning and charge state control of individual InAs/InP QDs operating within the telecom C-band. These QDs are grown by droplet epitaxy and embedded in an InP based n++-i-n+ heterostructure fabricated using MOVPE. The gated architecture enables the tuning of emission energy via the quantum confined Stark effect, with a tuning range exceeding 2.4 nm. It also allows for control over the QD charge occupancy, enabling access to multiple discrete excitonic states. Electrical tuning of the fine structure splitting is further demonstrated, opening a route to entangled photon pair generation at telecom wavelengths. The single photon character is confirmed via second order correlation measurements. These advances enable QDs to be tuned into resonance with other systems, such as cavity modes and emitters, marking a critical step toward scalable, fiber compatible quantum photonic devices.</p>

Quantum sensing and metrology is an emerging field that lies at the cross-roads of quantum physics, quantum technology, and the discipline in which the parameter estimation is to be performed. While miniaturization of devices often requires quantum mechanics to be utilized for understanding and planning of a parameter estimation, quantum-enhanced sensing is also possible that uses paradigmatic quantum characteristics like quantum coherence and quantum entanglement to go beyond the so-called standard quantum limit. The current review hopes to bring together the concepts related to quantum sensing as realized in ensemble systems, like spin ensembles, light-matter systems, and Bose-Einstein condensates, and lattice systems, like those which can be modeled by the Bose- and Fermi-Hubbard models, and quantum spin models.</p>

            <p>Optical non-Gaussian states hold great promise as a pivotal resource for advanced optical quantum information processing and fault-tolerant long-distance quantum communication. Establishing their faithful transmission in a real-world communication channel, therefore, marks an important milestone. In this study, we experimentally demonstrate the distribution of such non-Gaussian states in a functioning telecommunication channel that connects separate buildings within the DTU campus premises. We send photon-subtracted squeezed states, exhibiting pronounced Wigner negativity, through 300 m of deployed optical fibers to a distant building. Using quantum homodyne tomography, we fully characterize the states upon arrival. Our results show the survival of the Wigner function negativity after transmission when correcting for detection losses, indicating that the established link can potentially facilitate the violation of Bell's inequality and enable quantum steering. This achievement not only validates the practical feasibility of distributing non-Gaussian states in real-world settings, but also provides an exciting impetus towards realizing fully coherent quantum networks for high-dimensional, continuous-variable quantum information processing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Keisuke Kataoka, Yoshihito Kuno, Takahiro Orito, Ikuo Ichinose</p>
            <p>Measurement-only (quantum) circuit (MoC) gives possibility to realize the states with rich entanglements, topological orders and quantum memories. This work studies the MoC, in which the projective-measurement operators consist of stabilizers of the toric code and competitive local Pauli operators. The former correspond to terms of the toric code on a triangular lattice and the later to external magnetic and electric fields. We employ efficient numerical stabilizer algorithm to trace evolving states undergoing phase transitions. We elucidate the phase diagram of the MoC system with the observables such as, topological entanglement entropy (TEE), disorder parameters of 1-form symmetries and emergent logical operators. We clarify the locations of the phase transitions through the observation of the above quantities and obtain precise critical exponents to examine if the observables exhibit the critical behavior simultaneously under the MoC and transitions belong to the same universality class. In contrast to the TC Hamiltonian system and toric code MoC on a square lattice, the system on the triangular lattice is not self-dual nor bipartite, and then, coincidence by symmetries, such as critical behaviors across the TC and Higgs/confined phase, does not takes place. Then, the toric code MoC on the triangular lattice provides us a suitable playground to clarify the mutual relationship between the TEE, spontaneous symmetry breaking of the 1-form symmetries, and emergence of logical operators. Obtained results indicate that toric code MoC on the triangular lattice exhibits a few distinct phase transitions with different location and critical exponents, and some of them are closely related with the two-dimensional percolation transition.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Scott Bogner, Heiko Hergert, Morten Hjorth-Jensen, Ryan LaRose, Dean Lee, Matthew Patkowski</p>
            <p>We introduce a method called resolution refinement that allows one to bootstrap eigenstate preparation on a quantum computer. We first prepare an eigenstate of a low-resolution Hamiltonian using any method of choice. The eigenstate is then lifted to higher resolution and adiabatically evolved to produce the corresponding eigenstate of a higher-fidelity Hamiltonian. We give examples of resolution refinement applied to both single-particle basis states as well as a spatial lattice grid. For basis refinement, we compute few-body ground states of the Busch model for interacting particles in a harmonic trap in one dimension. For lattice refinement, we compute Hartree-Fock nuclear states for a central Woods-Saxon potential in three dimensions, and we compute bound states and continuum states in a multi-species Hubbard model of fermions in one dimension. In all cases, the method is efficient and requires an adiabatic evolution time that scales with the inverse of the energy gap times the square root of the system size. We show that this very favorable scaling arises from the fact that resolution refinement does not make large changes to the structure or energies of the low-energy eigenstates.</p>

            <h2>Beyond Single-Device Constraints: A System-Level Theoretical Framework for High-Performance Single-Photon Detection at Room Temperature</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hao Shu</p>
            <p>Photon detection, a fundamental quantum technology, is traditionally treated as a fixed device-level operation governed by intrinsic properties of single-photon detectors (SPDs). High-performance detection has therefore largely relied on superconducting technologies whose requirement for cryogenic operation imposes substantial infrastructure constraints, limiting scalable deployments. Here, the enhanced single-photon detection (ESPD) framework is presented as a system-level theoretical paradigm that shifts photon detection from device-centric optimization to an integrated quantum-information-processing task, by reformulating it as an iteratively enhanced process integrating state-preparation, controlled operations, projective measurements, and multi-copy analysis. ESPD enables systematic performance enhancement through architectural design rather than material modification, thereby circumventing superconducting components, allowing high-performance detection using exclusively room-temperature hardware. Numerical simulations grounded in physically motivated parameters indicate that the ESPD framework can upgrade a conventional room-temperature SPD to effective DE exceeding 93\% and DCR below $10^{-9}$, which are comparable to state-of-the-art superconducting SPDs and can significantly relax the minimal tolerable channel transmission rate in quantum communications. While physical realization would require further component integration, this work establishes a rigorous theoretical framework for enhancing detection performance through architectural quantum-information principles, providing a general blueprint for transcending device-level constraints and guiding the development of next-generation room-temperature quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Universal Quantum Random Access Memory: A Data-Independent Unitary Construction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Leonardo Bohac</p>
            <p>We present a construction for Quantum Random Access Memory (QRAM) that achieves a single, data-independent unitary operator. Unlike routing-based approaches or circuit methods that yield data-dependent unitaries, our Universal QRAM encodes data in memory qubits that act as quantum control signals within a block-diagonal permutation structure. The key insight is that memory qubits serve as control signals, enabling coherent lookup when addresses are in superposition. For N addresses with K-bit data words, the construction requires $\log_2 N + K + NK$ qubits and decomposes into exactly $NK$ multi-controlled gates. We verify the construction for $N \in \{2, 4, 8, 16\}$ and $K \in \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$, confirming that the resulting unitary is a pure permutation matrix with zero error across all data configurations. This approach simplifies QRAM implementation by separating fixed circuit structure from variable data encoding.</p>

            <p>Recently, Sharoglazova et al. claimed to have proven a violation of the basic tenet of Bohmian mechanics, namely the phase-speed relation $\vec{v}(\vec{r},t)=\frac{\hbar}{m}\vec{\nabla}S(\vec{r},t)$. Here, $S(\vec{r},t)$ is the (real) phase of the wave function $\psi(\vec{r},t)=\rho^{\frac{1}{2}}(\vec{r},t)e^{iS(\vec{r},t)}$. In a nutshell, they have measured the speed of a claimed evanescent wave, which is real and therefore must have $\vec{\nabla}S=\vec{0}$. However, Fig. 2 clearly shows a density motion from one waveguide to the other, implying a nonzero density current, $\vec{j}(\vec{r},t)=\frac{\hbar}{m}\Im(\psi^*\vec{\nabla}\psi)$. If we combine this evidence with the mathematical identity $\vec{\nabla}S=\frac{m}{\rho}\vec{j}$, we should instead conclude that $\vec{\nabla}S\neq\vec{0}$. So, where does this apparent inconsistency come from?</p>

            <p>We study finite two-dimensional disordered systems with periodic confinement. At low energies, eigenstates exhibit strong Anderson localization, while at higher energies a subset of states forms variational scars with anisotropic intensity patterns that violate random wave expectations. Scaling theory predicts that all states localize in two dimensions, yet energy-dependent localization lengths and finite system size allow these regimes to coexist. We demonstrate that this coexistence produces distinct, robust signatures in both spatial intensity patterns and spectral statistics that are directly observable in mesoscopic electronic, photonic, and cold atom systems.</p>

            <h2>Contraction 2.0 Natural Metrics in Contraction Analysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Winfried Lohmiller, Jean-Jacques Slotine</p>
            <p>Contraction analysis establishes exponential incremental convergence of a nonlinear system by solving a linear matrix inequality for a contraction metric, and has become a standard resource for solving problems in nonlinear control and estimation. This paper shows that, for a general nonlinear time-varying system, a contraction metric can be systematically derived by rewriting the system dynamics as a complex natural gradient dynamics. In this form, the variational dynamics can be modally decomposed with geodesic coordinates, and exact exponential convergence rates can be computed. The results are extended to systems with nonlinear inequality constraints. All derivations are tensor-based, and the computed eigenvalues themselves are coordinate-invariant, i.e., the contraction rates are independent of the chosen coordinate system. Simple examples including a gravity pendulum, gradient descent with non-convex cost, Schuler dynamics, and a two-link manipulator, illustrate that the computation of the decomposed convergence rates is straightforward. The role of inequality constraints is illustrated for a controller confined to an operational envelope.</p>

            <h2>Tensor network approximation of Koopman operators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dimitrios Giannakis, Mohammad Javad Latifi Jebelli, Michael Montgomery, Philipp Pfeffer, Jörg Schumacher, Joanna Slawinska</p>
            <p>We propose a tensor network framework for approximating the evolution of observables of measure-preserving ergodic systems. Our approach is based on a spectrally-convergent approximation of the skew-adjoint Koopman generator by a diagonalizable, skew-adjoint operator $W_\tau$ that acts on a reproducing kernel Hilbert space $\mathcal H_\tau$ with coalgebra structure and Banach algebra structure under the pointwise product of functions. Leveraging this structure, we lift the unitary evolution operators $e^{t W_\tau}$ (which can be thought of as regularized Koopman operators) to a unitary evolution group on the Fock space $F(\mathcal H_\tau)$ generated by $\mathcal H_\tau$ that acts multiplicatively with respect to the tensor product. Our scheme also employs a representation of classical observables ($L^\infty$ functions of the state) by quantum observables (self-adjoint operators) acting on the Fock space, and a representation of probability densities in $L^1$ by quantum states. Combining these constructions leads to an approximation of the Koopman evolution of observables that is representable as evaluation of a tree tensor network built on a tensor product subspace $\mathcal H_\tau^{\otimes n} \subset F(\mathcal H_\tau)$ of arbitrarily high grading $n \in \mathbb N$. A key feature of this quantum-inspired approximation is that it captures information from a tensor product space of dimension $(2d+1)^n$, generated from a collection of $2d + 1$ eigenfunctions of $W_\tau$. Furthermore, the approximation is positivity preserving. The paper contains a theoretical convergence analysis of the method and numerical applications to two dynamical systems on the 2-torus: an ergodic torus rotation as an example with pure point Koopman spectrum and a Stepanoff flow as an example with topological weak mixing.</p>

            <p>A system of several Wannier-Mott excitons interacting with phonons in a bulk material is considered. We show that strong exciton-phonon coupling causes the formation of a coherent two-exciton state -- the exciton pair. Unlike the biexcitons, where the photons play the role of force carrier, the exciton pair is formed via entanglement with the long-living phonon mode: (i) The essentially multi-particle theory requires excitons (cobosons composed of an electron and a hole) to satisfy the mixed Bose-Fermi statistics; (ii) This allows us to formulate a system of non-linear dynamic equations, using the multiconfiguration Hartree method applied to the Frohlich Hamiltonian. The system of equations possesses a stationary solution, which, for the case of a single exciton, describes the excitonic polaron and corresponds to the exciton pair in the two-exciton case. We also compare the fluorescent spectra of exciton polarons and exciton pairs estimated from our theory with those observed in experiments on room-temperature superfluorescence (collective emission of fluorescent light) in hybrid perovskites to give an additional insight into the superfluorescence phenomenon.</p>

First, we construct an $\Omega$-spectrum $\mathit{IP}_*$ whose homotopy groups are isomorphic to the smooth homotopy group of invertible gapped quantum systems on Euclidean spaces. Second, we develop a model for the homology theory associated with the $\Omega$-spectrum $\mathit{IP}_*$, describing it in terms of the space of quantum systems placed on an arbitrary subspace of a Euclidean space. This involves introducing the concept of localization flow, a semi-infinite path of quantum systems with decaying interaction range, inspired by Yu's localization C*-algebra in coarse index theory. Third, we incorporate spatial symmetries given by a crystallographic group $\Gamma $ and define the $\Omega$-spectrum $\mathit{IP}_*^\Gamma$ of $\Gamma$-invariant invertible phases. We propose a strategy for computing the homotopy group $\pi_n(\mathit{IP}_d^\Gamma )$ that uses the Davis--Lück assembly map and its description by invertible gapped localization flow. In particular, we show that the assembly map is split injective, and hence $\pi_n(\mathit{IP}_d^\Gamma)$ contains a computable direct summand.</p>

            <p>A thermodynamic analysis of weakly nonlocal non-relativistic fluids is presented under the assumption that an additional scalar field also contributes to the dynamics. The most general evolution of this field and the constitutive relations for the pressure tensor and energy current density are determined by the Liu procedure. Classical holography of perfect (\ie non-dissipative) fluids is generally proven, according to which the divergence of the pressure tensor can be given by the gradient of a corresponding scalar potential. A consequence of holographic property is vorticity conservation, which opens the way toward wave-function representation of hydrodynamic equations to obtain the Schrödinger equation. Another special case of the derived fluid model is Newtonian gravity, when the internal variable is the gravitational potential itself. Coupled phenomena, such as the Schrödinger--Newton system, are also discussed. The presented thermodynamic framework can shed light on some connections between formulations of classical and quantum physics.</p>

            <p>Quantum Separation Logic (QSL) has been proposed as an effective tool to improve the scalability of deductive reasoning for quantum programs. In QSL, separation is interpreted as disentanglement, and the frame rule brings a notion of entanglement-local specification (one that only talks about the qubits entangled with those acted upon by the program). In this paper, we identify two notions of locality unique to the quantum domain, and we construct a novel quantum separation logic, RapunSL, which is able to soundly reduce reasoning about superposition states to reasoning about pure states (basis-locality), and reasoning about mixed states arising from measurement to reasoning about pure states (outcome-locality). To do so, we introduce two connectives, linear combination and mixing, which together with separation provide a dramatic improvement in the scalability of reasoning, as we demonstrate on a series of challenging case studies.</p>

            <p>Quantum synchronisation has recently been proposed as a mechanism for electronic excitation energy transfer in light-harvesting complexes, yet its robustness in driven-dissipative settings remains under active investigation. Here, we revisit this mechanism in cryptophyte photosynthetic antennae using an exciton--vibrational dimer model. By comparing the full open quantum dynamics with semi-classical rate equations for electronic density-matrix elements and vibrational observables, we demonstrate that quantum correlations between electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom, beyond the semi-classical factorised limit, underpin the emergence of quantum synchronisation. Furthermore, we introduce an environment-assisted transfer mechanism arising as a nonlinear, non-Condon correction to the dipole--dipole interaction. This mechanism enables long-lived quantum coherence and continuous, synchronisation-enhanced energy transfer in a driven-dissipative regime, thereby suggesting new avenues for investigating photosynthetic energy-transfer dynamics.</p>

The {\it mixed Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (mGOE)} forms a pedagogically accessible family of systems in simulating {\it Many-Body Localization (MBL)} transitions. It can be tuned from chaotic to localized and heavy-tailed localized phases in a continuous fashion, providing an opportunity to explore new phases. We numerically study how the spectral properties of mGOE evolve during these transitions. Characterization of transition to quantum chaos is computed and analyzed via empirical spectral density, nearest-neighbor spacing, and adjacent gap ratios with statistical uncertainty quantifications that strengthens the robustness of evidence of transitions.

            <h2>Bell-Inequality Violation for Continuous, Non-Projective Measurements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shalender Singh, Santosh Kumar</p>
            <p>Many solid-state quantum platforms do not permit sharp, projective measurements but instead yield continuous voltage or field traces under weak, non-demolition readout. In such systems, standard Bell tests based on dichotomic projective measurements are not directly applicable, raising the question of how quantum nonlocality can be certified from continuous time-series data. Here we develop a general theoretical framework showing that Bell-CHSH inequality violation can be extracted from continuous, non-projective measurements without assuming any specific collapse model or phase distribution. We show that sufficiently long continuous measurements of a single entangled pair sample its internal phase-probability structure, enabling effective dichotomic observables to be constructed through phase-sensitive projections and coarse-graining. The resulting Bell correlator is governed by two experimentally accessible resources: intrinsic single-qubit phase spread and nonlocal phase locking between qubits. We benchmark the resulting estimator against conventional projective-measurement CHSH tests implemented via quantum-circuit simulations using Qiskit, finding quantitative agreement in the Bell-violating regime without parameter fitting. Classical deterministic correlations cannot violate the CHSH bound, whereas quantum phase-locked systems recover the nonlinear angular dependence characteristic of entanglement. Our results provide a practical route to demonstrating Bell nonlocality in platforms where measurements are inherently continuous and weak.</p>

            <h2>Partial Collapse and Ensemble Invariance under Continuous Quantum Measurement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shalender Singh, Santosh Kumar</p>
            <p>Wavefunction collapse is often regarded as an unavoidable consequence of quantum measurement. Here we show that in driven-dissipative quantum systems, continuous measurement can extract information without disturbing the physical steady-state ensemble. Using the stochastic master equation formalism, we identify measurement-invariant steady states whose unconditional density matrix remains unchanged under continuous monitoring, despite the presence of measurement-induced collapse at the level of individual quantum trajectories. This separation between conditional collapse and ensemble invariance leads to a regime of partial collapse, in which measurement-induced localization is transient and continuously counteracted by dissipation and drive. We establish a necessary and sufficient condition for steady-state invariance under continuous measurement and show-that it holds over a finite range of measurement strengths. Our results clarify how information gain and measurement backaction can be dynamically decoupled in open quantum systems, with implications for continuous quantum sensing and the foundations of nonprojective measurement.</p>

            <h2>The Lieb-Robinson correlation function for long disordered transverse-field Ising chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Brendan J. Mahoney, Craig S. Lent</p>
            <p>The transverse-field Ising model is useful for studying interacting qubit arrays. The Lieb--Robinson correlation function can be used to characterize the propagation of quantum information in Ising chains. Considerable work has been done to establish bounds on this correlation function in various circumstances. To actually calculate the value of the correlation function directly typically requires a state space which grows exponentially with system size, and so is intractable for all but relatively small systems. We employ a recently-developed method that enables direct calculation of the value of the Lieb--Robinson correlation function and which scales linearly with system size. This enables the computation for systems with many hundreds of qubits, revealing the propagation of quantum information down the chain. We extend this technique to the problem of Ising chains with randomly disordered coupling strengths. Increasing disorder causes localization of the quantum correlations and halts propagation of quantum information.</p>

            <h2>Measuring out-of-time-order correlators on a quantum computer based on an irreversibility-susceptibility method</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haruki Emori, Hiroyasu Tajima</p>
            <p>The out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) is a powerful tool for probing quantum information scrambling, a fundamental process by which local information spreads irreversibly throughout a quantum many-body system. Experimentally measuring the OTOC, however, is notoriously challenging due to the need for time-reversed evolution. Here, we present an experimental evaluation of the OTOC on a quantum computer, using three distinct protocols to address this challenge: the rewinding time method (RTM), the weak-measurement method (WMM), and the irreversibility-susceptibility method (ISM). Our experiments investigate the quantum dynamics of an XXZ spin-1/2 chain prepared in a thermal Gibbs state. As a key contribution, we provide the first experimental demonstration of the ISM, using the numerical emulator of the trapped-ion quantum computer, reimei. We also conduct a detailed comparative analysis of all three methods, revealing method-dependent behaviors in the measured OTOC. This work not only validates these protocols as practical tools for exploring quantum chaos on near-term hardware but also offers crucial insights into their respective advantages and limitations, providing a practical framework for future experimental investigations.</p>

Lett. {\bf 85}, 2208 (2000)] that is modified to enable high fidelity operation without requiring a strong Rydberg interaction. The gate retains the $\pi-2\pi-\pi$ structure with an additional detuning added to the $2\pi$ pulse on the target qubit. The protocol reaches within a factor of 2.39 (1.68) of the fundamental fidelity limit set by Rydberg lifetime for equal (asymmetric) Rabi frequencies on the control and target qubits. We generalize the gate protocol to arbitrary controlled phases. We design optimal target-qubit phase waveforms to generalize the gate across a range of interaction strengths and we find that, within this family of gates, the constant-phase protocol is time-optimal for a fixed laser Rabi frequency and tunable interaction strength. Robust control methods are used to design gates that are robust against variations in Rydberg Rabi frequency or interaction strength.</p>

            <h2>Symmetry-Preserving Variational Quantum Simulation of the Heisenberg Spin Chain on Noisy Quantum Hardware</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rudraksh Sharma</p>
            <p>Variational quantum algorithms are among the most promising approaches for simulating interacting quantum many-body systems on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. However, the practical success of variational quantum eigensolvers (VQE) critically depends on the structure of the chosen variational ansatz. In this work, we investigate the ground-state properties of the one-dimensional antiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin-1/2 chain using both generic hardware-efficient ansatz and physics-informed, symmetry-preserving variational circuits. We benchmark variational results against exact diagonalization and noiseless simulations, and subsequently validate the approach on real IQM Garnet quantum hardware. Our results demonstrate that incorporating physical symmetries into the circuit design leads to significantly improved energy estimates, enhanced robustness against hardware noise, and clearer convergence behavior when compared to hardware-efficient ansatz under identical resource constraints. These findings highlight the importance of problem specific ansatz construction for reliable quantum simulations in the NISQ era.</p>

            <h2>Emergence of nonclassical radiation in strongly laser-driven quantum systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ivan Gonoskov, Christian Hünecke, Stefanie Gräfe</p>
            <p>Nonclassical light sources are central to emerging quantum technologies, yet current platforms offer limited tunability and typically operate at low photon numbers. In parallel, strong-field physics provides widely tunable, bright coherent radiation through high-order harmonic generation (HHG), but its quantum optical character has remained largely unexplained. While recent experiments have revealed signatures of entanglement, squeezing, and quantum-state modification in both the driving and generated fields, a unified theoretical framework capable of identifying the origin and controllability of these effects has been missing. Here we introduce a fully quantum, analytically tractable theory of intense light-matter interaction that rigorously captures the emergence of nonclassicality in HHG. Our approach employs a parametric factorization of the coupled electron-field system into a driven electronic state and a dynamically perturbed quantum optical field, derived directly from the time-dependent Schrödinger equation without requiring conditioning, homodyne detection, or mode-selection techniques. We show how quantum correlations, squeezing, and Wigner-function negativity arise intrinsically from the interaction dynamics, and we identify the precise conditions under which specific nonclassical features are amplified or suppressed. The theory enables predictive design of bright, high-photon-number quantum states at tunable frequencies, and we demonstrate its utility by outlining realistic conditions for generating bright nonclassical ultraviolet light. Our results establish a comprehensive foundation for strong-field quantum optics and open new avenues toward tabletop quantum light sources for sensing, communication, and photonic quantum information processing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xingjian He, Aoqian Shi, Jianjun Liu, Jiangbin Gong</p>
            <p>Criticality-based quantum sensing exploits hypersensitive response to system parameters near phase transition points. This work uncovers two metrological advantages offered by topological phase transitions when the probe is prepared as topological edge states. Firstly, the order of topological band touching is found to determine how the metrology sensitivity scales with the system size. Engineering a topological phase transition with higher-order band touching is hence advocated, with the associated quantum Fisher information scaling as $ \mathcal{F}_Q \sim L^{2p}$, with $L$ the lattice size in one dimension, and $p$ the order of band touching. Secondly, with a topological lattice accommodating degenerate edge modes (such as multiple zero modes), preparing an $N$-particle entangled state at the edge and then adiabatically tuning the system to the phase transition point grows quantum entanglement to macroscopic sizes, yielding $\mathcal{F}_Q \sim N^2 L^{2p}$. This work hence paves a possible topological phase transition-based route to harness entanglement, large lattice size, and high-order band touching for quantum metrology.</p>

            <p>We investigated experimentally and theoretically a cavity-free microwave field that couples the two ground states of a {\Lambda}-type atomic system, thereby forming a closed {\Delta} configuration. In this regime, the absence of cavity-imposed phase matching leads to a strong sensitivity of the ground-state coherence to the microwave field parameters. We observe that the coherent population trapping (CPT) resonance exhibits a pronounced dependence on the microwave power and detuning, resulting in measurable changes in resonance contrast, linewidth, and center frequency. To explain these effects, we develop a numerical density-matrix model in which the ground-state coherence explicitly incorporates the microwave coupling strength, capturing the essential physics of this no-phase-matching {\Delta} system. The excellent agreement between theory and experiment establishes a simple and robust framework for microwave control of cavity-free {\Delta}-type atomic systems, with direct implications for compact atomic clocks and quantum-enhanced quantum sensing platforms.</p>

This reformulation is particularly advantageous for higher-order calculations required in the long-distance regime, where retardation effects become important. Our approach provides a unified framework that connects both limiting cases while offering a clear conceptual picture suitable for advanced quantum mechanics courses.</p>

The inequality is valid for all states on the Poincaré-Bloch sphere, but few laboratory studies have investigated violations with the full sphere. In this article, we explore the experimental verifications of the predicted violations of the CHSH inequality with Bell and non-Bell states with same and different linear and elliptically polarized basis states for each photon. We find that Bell states violate CHSH when using the same basis for both photons, regardless of their ellipticity, whereas they show no violations for photon projections in different bases. We found non-Bell maximally-entangled states for which the converse is true.</p>

            <p>The study of quantum correlations within relativistic spacetimes, and the consequences of relativistic causality on information processing using such correlations, has gained much attention in recent years. In this paper, we establish a unified framework in the form of operational no-signalling constraints to study both nonlocal and temporal correlations within general relativistic spacetimes. We explore several intriguing consequences arising from our framework. Firstly, we show that the violation of the operational no-signalling constraints in Minkowski spacetime implies either a logical paradox or an operational infringement of Poincaré symmetry. We thereby examine and subvert recent claims in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 110401 (2022)] on the possibility of witnessing operationally detectable causal loops in Minkowski spacetime. Secondly, we explore the possibility of jamming of nonlocal correlations, controverting a recent claim in [Nat. Comm. 16, 269 (2025)] that a physical mechanism for jamming would necessarily lead to superluminal signalling. Finally, we show that in black hole spacetimes certain nonlocal correlations under and across the event horizon can be jammed by any agent without spoiling the operational no-signalling constraints.</p>

            <p>Divalent atoms have emerged as powerful alternatives to alkalis in ultracold atom platforms, offering unique advantages arising from their two-electron structure. Among these species, ytterbium (Yb) is especially promising, yet its anionic properties and its Rydberg spectrum remain comparatively unexplored. In this work, we perform a first and comprehensive experimental and theoretical investigation of ultralong-range Rydberg molecules (ULRMs) of $^{174}$Yb in $6sns\,^1S_0$ Rydberg states across nearly two decades in principal quantum number $n$ and three orders of magnitude in molecular binding energy. Using the Coulomb Green's function formalism, we compute Born-Oppenheimer molecular potentials describing the Rydberg atom in the presence of a ground-state perturber and achieve quantitative agreement with high-resolution molecular spectra. This enables the extraction of low-energy electron-Yb scattering phase shifts, including the zero-energy $s$-wave scattering length and the positions of two spin-orbit split $p$-wave shape resonances. Our results provide strong evidence that the Yb$^{-}$ anion exists only as a metastable resonance. We additionally show the sensitivity of ULRM spectra to the atomic quantum defects, using this to refine the value for the $6s23f\, ^1F_3$ quantum defect. Together, these findings establish Yb ULRMs as a powerful probe of electron-Yb interactions and lay essential groundwork for future Rydberg experiments with divalent atoms.</p>

The MOT contains 230(40) molecules, limited by beam source characteristics and predissociative loss of CaH. The temperature of the MOT is below one millikelvin. The predissociative loss mechanism could, in turn, facilitate controlled dissociation of the molecule, offering a possible route to optical trapping of hydrogen atoms for precision spectroscopy.</p>

            <h2>Determinism and Indeterminism as Model Artefacts: Toward a Model-Invariant Ontology of Physics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Nolland</p>
            <p>This paper argues that the traditional opposition between determinism and indeterminism in physics is representational rather than ontological. Deterministic--stochastic dualities are available in principle, and arise in a non-contrived way in many scientifically important models. When dynamical systems admit mathematically equivalent deterministic and stochastic formulations, their observable predictions depend only on the induced structure of correlations between preparations and measurement outcomes. I use this model-equivalence to motivate a model-invariance criterion for ontological commitment, according to which only structural features that remain stable across empirically equivalent representations, and whose physical effects are invariant under such reformulations, are candidates for realism. This yields a fallibilist form of structural realism grounded in modal robustness rather than in the specifics of any given mathematical representation. Features such as conservation laws, symmetries, and causal or metric structure satisfy this criterion and can be encoded in observable relations in mathematically intelligible ways. By contrast, the localisation of modal selection -- whether in initial conditions, stochastic outcomes, or informational collapse mechanisms -- is not invariant under empirically equivalent reformulations and is therefore best understood as a gauge choice rather than an ontological feature. The resulting framework explains how certain long-standing problems in the foundations of physics, including the measurement problem and the perceived conflict between physical determinism and free agency, arise from the reification of representational artefacts. By distinguishing model-invariant structure from modelling conventions, I offer a realist ontology for modern physics that combines empirical openness with resistance to metaphysical overreach.</p>

            <p>A massless scalar field in two spacetime dimensions splits into two independent sectors of left and right-moving modes on the light cone. At the quantum level, these two sectors carry a representation of the group of affine transformations of the real line, with translations corresponding to transformations generated by light-cone momenta and dilations given by light-cone Rindler momenta formed by a linear combination of generators of boosts and dilations. One-particle states for inertial observers are eigenvectors of translation generators belonging to irreducible representations of the affine group. Rindler one-particle states are related to eigenfunctions of the generator of dilations. We show that simple manipulations connecting these two representations involving the Mellin transform can be used to derive the thermal spectrum of Rindler particles observed by an accelerated observer. Beyond providing a representation-theoretic basis for vacuum thermal effects, our results suggest that analogous phenomena may arise in any quantum system admitting realizations of translation and dilation eigenstates.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we introduce "the Schrödinger plate." This is an infinite two-dimensional linear micro-polar elastic medium, with out-of-plane degrees of freedom, lying on a linear elastic foundation of a special kind. Any free motion of the plate can be corresponded to a solution of the two-dimensional Schrödinger equation for a single particle in the external potential field $V$. The specific dependence of the potential $V$ on the position is taken into account in the properties of the plate elastic foundation. The governing equations of the plate are derived as equations of the two-dimensional constraint Cosserat continuum using the direct approach. The plate dynamics can be described by the classical Germain-Lagrange equation for a plate, but the strain energy is different from the one used in the classical Kirchhoff-Love plate theory. Namely, the Schrödinger plate cannot be imagined as a thin elastic body composed of an isotropic linear material. The main property of the Schrödinger plate is as follows: the mechanical energy propagates in the plate exactly in the same way as the probability density propagates according to the corresponding Schrödinger equation.</p>

            <p>We introduce generalisations of von Neumann entanglement entropy that are invariant with respect to certain scale transformations. These constructions are based on Unit-Invariant Singular Value Decomposition (UISVD) with its right-, left-, and bi-invariant incarnations, which itself are variations of the standard Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) that remain invariant under (appropriate set of) diagonal transformations. These measures are naturally defined for non-Hermitian or rectangular operators and remain useful when the input and output spaces possess different dimensions or metric weights. We apply the UISVD entropy and discuss its advantages in the physically interesting framework of Biorthogonal Quantum Mechanics, whose important aspect is indeed the behavior under scale transformations. Further, we illustrate features of UISVD-based entropies in other representative settings, from simple quantum mechanical bipartite states to random matrices relevant to quantum chaos and holography, and in the context of Chern-Simons theory. In all cases, the UISVD yields stable, physically meaningful entropic spectra that are invariant under rescalings and normalisations.</p>

            <p>In the present study, we apply shortcut to adiabaticity pulses (time-dependent Rabi frequency and detuning) for the efficient population transfer from the ground to the exciton state in a GaAs/InGaAs quantum dot with phonon-induced dephasing.

We explain these results using a Bloch-like equation derived from a generalized Lindblad equation, which adequately describes system dynamics at lower temperatures. For higher temperatures, the transfer efficiency is significantly reduced except for subpicosecond pulses, where the shortcut Rabi frequency reduces to a delta pulse attaining a fast population inversion. The present work is expected to find application in quantum technologies which exploit quantum dots for single-photon generation on demand.</p>

            <p>We introduce a conceptual reformulation of the Mott-Berezinskiĭ (MB) theory of low-frequency AC conductivity in disordered systems based on localization landscape theory. Instead of assuming uniform localization and fixed hopping distances, transport is described through an effective potential whose geometry encodes the spatial organization and energy-dependent localization of quantum states. Using the associated Agmon metric, we define a generalized Mott scale that replaces the classical hopping length with a geometric criterion set by the disorder landscape. This framework naturally incorporates strong spatial inhomogeneity and yields the AC conductivity directly from the effective potential. The standard MB result is recovered as a limiting case. Our approach extends the conceptual foundation of MB theory to arbitrary disordered media and energies approaching the mobility edge, providing a unified description of AC transport in complex quantum materials.</p>

            <p>Hybrid semiconductor-superconductor qubits have recently emerged as a promising alternative to traditional platforms, combining material advantages with device-level tunability. A defining feature is their gate-tunable Josephson coupling, enabling superconducting qubit architectures with full electric-field control and offering a path toward scalable, low-crosstalk quantum processors. This approach seeks to merge benefits of superconducting and semiconductor qubits, for instance by encoding quantum information in the spin of a quasiparticle occupying an Andreev bound state, thus combining long coherence times with fast, flexible control. Progress has accelerated through bottom-up engineering of Andreev states in coupled quantum dot arrays, leading to architectures such as minimal Kitaev chains hosting Majorana zero modes. In parallel, Hamiltonian-protected designs aim to enhance resilience against local noise and decoherence by exploiting superconducting phase dynamics and discrete charge or flux degrees of freedom. This article reviews recent theoretical and experimental advances in hybrid qubits, providing an overview of physical mechanisms, device implementations, and emerging architectures, with emphasis on their potential for (topologically) protected quantum information processing. While many designs remain at proof-of-concept stage, rapid progress suggests practical demonstrations may soon be achievable.</p>

            <p>Adiabatic topological pumping promises robust transport of energy and information, but its speed is fundamentally limited by the instantaneous adiabatic condition, which demands prohibitively slow parameter variations. Here we develop a paradigm shift from instantaneous to global adiabaticity. We derive a global adiabatic criterion (GAC), which sets an absolute fidelity bound by controlling the root-mean-square value of nonadiabaticity factor. We further introduce a fluctuation-suppression acceleration criterion, which minimizes spatial inhomogeneity and allows us to safely increase the mean nonadiabaticity. Experimentally, we implement this principle in femtosecond-laser-written photonic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger waveguide arrays via scalable power-law coupling modulation. Our accelerated topological pumping achieves >0.95 fidelity over a fivefold reduced device length compared to the conventional scheme, exhibits the predicted linear scaling with the system size, and maintains robust performance across a >400 nm bandwidth. This principle of GAC provides a universal design rule for fast, compact, and robust adiabatic devices across quantum and classical topological platforms.</p>

            <h2>Ge hole spin control using acoustic waves</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chun-Yang Yuan, Tzu-Kan Hsiao</p>
            <p>Germanium hole spin qubits based on strained Ge/SiGe quantum well have attracted much research attention due to the strong spin-orbit coupling. In particular, the strain dependence of the heavy-hole--light-hole mixing and thus the $g$-tensor anisotropy offer unique opportunities for acoustic driving and spin-phonon coupling. In this work we numerically simulate the coherent control of a Ge hole spin using surface acoustic waves. The periodic strain dynamically modulates the $g$-tensor matrix and causes fast spin rotation under a small acoustic amplitude. Moreover, we show a strong anisotropy and confinement dependence of the Rabi frequency coming from the phase-shifted longitudinal and shear strain components. Our work lays the foundations for acoustic-driven spin control and spin-phonon coupling using Ge hole spin qubits.</p>

            <h2>Non-Invertible Interfaces Between Symmetry-Enriched Critical Phases</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saranesh Prembabu, Shu-Heng Shao, Ruben Verresen</p>
            <p>Gapless quantum phases can become distinct when internal symmetries are enforced, in analogy with gapped symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. However, this distinction does not always lead to protected edge modes, raising the question of how the bulk-boundary correspondence is generalized to gapless cases. We propose that the spatial interface between gapless phases -- rather than their boundaries -- provides a more robust fingerprint. We show that whenever two 1+1d conformal field theories (CFTs) differ in symmetry charge assignments of local operators or twisted sectors, any symmetry-preserving spatial interface between the theories must flow to a non-invertible defect. We illustrate this general result for different versions of the Ising CFT with $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2^T$ symmetry, obtaining a complete classification of allowed conformal interfaces. When the Ising CFTs differ by nonlocal operator charges, the interface hosts 0+1d symmetry-breaking phases with finite-size splittings scaling as $1/L^3$, as well as continuous phase transitions between them. For general gapless phases differing by an SPT entangler, the interfaces between them can be mapped to conformal defects with a certain defect 't Hooft anomaly. This classification also gives implications for higher-dimensional examples, including symmetry-enriched variants of the 2+1d Ising CFT. Our results establish a physical indicator for symmetry-enriched criticality through symmetry-protected interfaces, giving a new handle on the interplay between topology and gapless phases.</p>

            <h2>Modified Fermi's golden rule rate expressions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seogjoo J. Jang, Young Min Rhee</p>
            <p>Fermi's golden rule (FGR) serves as the basis for many expressions of spectroscopic observables and quantum transition rates. The utility of FGR has been demonstrated through decades of experimental confirmation. However, there still remain important cases where the evaluation of a FGR rate is ambiguous or ill-defined. Examples are cases where the rate has divergent terms due to the sparsity in the density of final states or time dependent fluctuations of system Hamiltonians. Strictly speaking, assumptions of FGR are no longer valid for such cases. However, it is still possible to define modified FGR rate expressions that are useful as effective rates. The resulting modified FGR rate expressions resolve a long standing ambiguity often encountered in using FGR and offer more reliable ways to model general rate processes. Simple model calculations illustrate the utility and implications of new rate expressions.</p>

            <h2>Error and Disturbance as Irreversibility with Applications: Unified Definition, Wigner--Araki--Yanase Theorem and Out-of-Time-Order Correlator</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haruki Emori, Hiroyasu Tajima</p>
            <p>Defining an error of measurement has long been a foundational problem in science: even in classical experiments, data are statistical and admit no single universally optimal definition of error. In quantum mechanics, the challenge deepens: observed entities often lack preexisting definite values, and the act of measurement unavoidably disturbs the system of interest. Consequently, both error and disturbance must be quantified, and various definitions have been proposed to date. However, a unified perspective for understanding the differences and similarities among these diverse definitions of error and disturbance, and an operational framework for distinguishing between them, remain elusive. In this Letter, we propose a novel framework for defining error and disturbance using irreversibility. Our framework converts the error and disturbance of a quantum measurement of a system under consideration into the irreversibility of an ancillary qubit system, using a quantum comb composed of loss and recovery processes. The mechanism enables us to make the operational distinction that error uses the classical outputs, while disturbance uses the quantum outputs of the measurement in the recovery process. Furthermore, our framework yields several key consequences: (i) it encompasses existing definitions, (ii) it establishes a universal constraint on error and disturbance defined by any measure of an arbitrary quantum process under a conservation law, and (iii) it reveals an operational connection between irreversibility and the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC), a metric of quantum chaos. It also provides a constraint on the OTOC under a conservation law and a method for its experimental evaluation, which is demonstrated on a quantum processor.</p>

            <h2>Floquet control of interactions and edge states in a programmable quantum simulator</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Or Katz, Lei Feng, Diego Porras, Christopher Monroe</p>
            <p>Quantum simulators based on trapped ions enable the study of spin systems and models with rich dynamical phenomena. The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model for fermions in one dimension is a canonical example that can support a topological insulator phase when couplings between sites are dimerized, featuring long-lived edge states. Here, we experimentally implement a spin-based variant of the SSH model using one-dimensional trapped-ion chains with tunable interaction range, realized in crystals containing up to 22 interacting spins. Using an array of individually focused laser beams, we apply site-specific, time-dependent Floquet fields to induce controlled bond dimerization. Under conditions that preserve inversion symmetry, we observe edge-state dynamics consistent with SSH-like behavior. We study the propagation and localization of spin excitations, as well as the evolution of highly excited configurations across different interaction regimes. These results demonstrate how precision Floquet engineering enables the exploration of complex spin models and dynamics, laying the groundwork for future preparation and characterization of topological and exotic phases of matter.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Taner M. Ture, Changbong Hyeon, Seogjoo J. Jang</p>
            <p>A simple 4th order propagator [Ture and Jang, {\it J. Phys. Chem. A.} {\bf 128}, 2871 (2024)] based on the Magnus expansion (ME) is extended to the Liouville space for both closed-system and Lindbladian open-system quantum dynamics. For both dynamics, commutator free versions of 4th order propagators are provided as well. These propagators are then applied to the dynamics of a driven $\Lambda$-system, where Lindblad terms represent the effect of a photonic bath. For both dynamics, the accuracy of the rotating wave approximation (RWA) for the matter-radiation interaction is assessed. We confirmed reasonable performance of RWA for weak and resonant fields. However, small errors appear for moderate fields and substantial errors can be found for strong fields where coherent population trapping can still be expected. We also found that the presence of bath for open system quantum dynamics consistently reduces the errors of the RWA. These results provide a quantitative information on how the RWA breaks down beyond weak field or for non-resonant cases. Major results are benchmarked against results of our 6th order ME-based propagator. We also provide numerical comparison of our algorithms with other 4th order algorithms for the $\Lambda$-system. These confirm reasonable performance of our simple propagators and the improvement gained through commutator-free expressions.</p>

            <p>The Learning-With-Errors (LWE) problem is a fundamental computational challenge with implications for post-quantum cryptography and computational learning theory. Here we propose a quantum-classical hybrid algorithm with Ising model to address LWE, transforming it into the Shortest Vector Problem and using variable qubits to encode lattice vectors into an Ising Hamiltonian. By identifying low-energy Hamiltonian levels, the solution is extracted, making the method suitable for noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. The required number of qubits is less than $m(m+1)$, where $m$ is the number of samples. Our heuristic algorithm's time complexity depends on the specific quantum eigensolver used to find low-energy levels, and the performance when using the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm is investigated. We validate the algorithm by solving a $2$-dimensional LWE problem on a $5$-qubit quantum device, demonstrating its potential for solving meaningful LWE instances on near-term quantum devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Feiyi Liu, Min Guo, Mingyang Liu, Ruanjing Zhang, Yang Wang</p>
            <p>In this paper, we study excitations and dissipation in two infinite parallel metallic plates undergoing relative motion. The degrees of freedom of the electrons in both plates are modeled using the 1+2 dimensional Dirac field, and a nonlocal potential is selected to describe the interaction between the two plates. The internal relative motion is introduced via a Galilean boost, with one plate assumed to slide relative to the other. We then calculate the effective action of the system and derive the vacuum occupation number in momentum space using a perturbative method. Numerical plots reveal that the vacuum occupation number, as a function of momentum, is isotropic for a motion speed $v = 0$ and anisotropic for nonzero $v$. The relative motion induces energy transfer between the plates, leading to on-shell excitations in a manner analogous to the dissipative process of the Schwinger effect. Consequently, we study the motion-induced dissipation effects and the dissipative forces through the quantum action. Numerical results demonstrate that both the imaginary part of the quantum action due to the motion boost and the dissipative force exhibit a threshold as functions of $v$, and both are positively correlated with $v$.</p>

            <h2>Nearly query-optimal classical shadow estimation of unitary channels</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zihao Li, Changhao Yi, You Zhou, Huangjun Zhu</p>
            <p>Classical shadow estimation (CSE) is a powerful tool for learning the properties of quantum states and quantum processes. Here we consider the CSE task for quantum unitary channels. By querying an unknown unitary channel $\mathcal{U}$ multiple times in quantum experiments, the goal is to learn a classical description from which one can accurately predict many different linear properties of the channel, i.e., the expectation values of arbitrary observables measured on the output of $\mathcal{U}$ upon arbitrary input states. Based on collective measurements on multiple systems, we propose a query efficient protocol for this task, whose query complexity has a quadratic advantage over the previous best approach for this problem, and almost saturates the information-theoretic lower bound. To further enhance practicality, we also present a variant protocol using only single-copy measurements, which still offers much better query performance than previous protocols that do not use quantum memory, and can serve as a key subroutine for learning an arbitrary unknown Hamiltonian from dynamics. In addition to linear properties of unitary channels, our protocol can also be applied to simultaneously predict many non-linear properties, such as out-of-time-ordered correlators.</p>

            <p>We systematically investigate the interplay of disorder and time-homogeneous collisional noise in shaping the transport dynamics of an anisotropic XXZ spin chain. Using stochastic collision models to simulate interaction with the environment, we explore the localization-delocalization transitions across regimes with single and multiple excitations. We find that space-homogeneous and low-rate collisions can shape regions where localization sets in the form of subsequent plateaus. The localization process has universal features for the plateaus duration and the delocalization time. Interactions among the excitations favor this process even for tiniest disorder levels. Our findings can be applied to design stroboscopic protocols where sequences of transport and localization can be tailored. We establish relevant connections to noise-engineering of quantum devices in noisy intermediate-scale quantum simulators platforms, and to realistic biological systems where noise and disorder coexist.</p>

            <p>Complex quantum networks are powerful tools in the modeling of transport phenomena, particularly for biological systems, and enable the study of emergent phenomena in many-body quantum systems. High connectivity and long-range interactions induce strong constraints on the system dynamics. Here, we study the transport properties of a quantum network described by the paradigmatic XXZ Hamiltonian, with non-trivial graph connectivity and topology, and long-range interactions. We show how long-range interactions induce memory preserving effects and strongly affect the spreading of the excitations due to cooperative shielding. We describe the memory-preserving effect in all-to-all connected regular networks with distance-independent couplings. Indeed, the memory of the number of initially injected excitations is preserved over long times, encoded in the number of frequencies present in the dynamics. Interestingly, we find that memory-preserving effects occur also in less regular graphs, such as quantum networks with either power-law node connectivity or complex, small-world type, architectures. We discuss the implications of these properties in biology-related problems, such as an application to Weber's law in neuroscience, and their implementation in specific quantum technologies via biomimicry. We also show how the presence of long-range interaction strongly affects the dynamics of the excitations in small-world networks and power law all-to-all coupled networks. Indeed, because of cooperative shielding blue, as the connectivity or the range of interaction increases, the initial excitation spreads more slowly among the network and becomes strongly dependent on the initial conditions.</p>

            <p>Preparing Gibbs states, which describe systems in equilibrium at finite temperature, is of great importance, particularly at low temperatures. In this work, we propose a new method-- TEPID-ADAPT-- that prepares the thermal Gibbs state of a given Hamiltonian at low temperatures using a variational method that is partially adaptive and uses a purification with a minimal number of ancillary qubits. We also present an alternative implementation without ancillary qubits. A key technical innovation here is to use a mixed-state ansatz where the entropy can be efficiently calculated, with no computational overhead. Our algorithm uses a truncated, parametrized eigenspectrum of the Hamiltonian. Beyond preparing Gibbs states, this approach also straightforwardly gives us access to the truncated low-energy eigenspectrum of the Hamiltonian, making it also a method that prepares excited states simultaneously. As a result of this, we are also able to prepare thermal states at any lower temperature of the same Hamiltonian without further optimization.</p>

            <p>We propose that the quantum conditional mutual information (QCMI), computed with a suitably chosen partition of the system, serves as a powerful probe for detecting measurement-induced entanglement phase transitions in monitored quantum circuits. To demonstrate this, we investigate monitored variable-range Clifford circuits and identify the phase boundary between volume-law and area-law entanglement phases by performing finite-size scaling analyses of the QCMI. Assuming that the entanglement entropy exhibits a logarithmic dependence on system size at criticality in short-range interacting cases, we further show that the QCMI allows for the simultaneous determination of both the critical point and the universal coefficient of the logarithmic term in the entanglement entropy via a crossing-point analysis. For the shortest-range interacting case studied, we obtain the thermodynamic-limit value of the coefficient as $\tilde{c}=1.519(3)$, which is significantly smaller than values reported in previous studies.</p>

            <p>The energy cost of erasing quantum states depends on our knowledge of the states. We show that learning algorithms can acquire such knowledge to erase many copies of an unknown state at the optimal energy cost. This is proved by showing that learning can be made fully reversible and has no fundamental energy cost itself. With simple counting arguments, we relate the energy cost of erasing quantum states to their complexity, entanglement, and magic. We further show that the constructed erasure protocol is computationally efficient when learning is efficient. Conversely, under standard cryptographic assumptions, we prove that the optimal energy cost cannot be achieved efficiently in general. These results also enable efficient work extraction based on learning. Together, our results establish a concrete connection between quantum learning theory and thermodynamics, highlighting the physical significance of learning processes and enabling provably-efficient learning-based protocols for thermodynamic tasks.</p>

            <p>The $n$-time correlation function is pivotal for establishing connections between theoretical predictions and experimental observations of a quantum system. Conventional methods for computing $n$-time correlation functions on quantum computers, such as the Hadamard test, generally require an ancilla qubit that controls the entire system -- an approach that poses challenges for digital quantum devices with limited qubit connectivity, as well as for analog quantum platforms lacking controlled operations. Here, we introduce a method to compute $n$-time correlation functions using only unitary evolutions on the system of interest, thereby eliminating the need for ancillas and the control operations. This approach substantially relaxes hardware connectivity requirements for digital processors and enables more practical measurements of $n$-time correlation functions on analog platforms. We demonstrate our protocol on IBM quantum hardware up to 12 qubits to measure the single-particle spectrum of the Schwinger model and the out-of-time-order correlator in the transverse-field Ising model. In the demonstration, we further introduce an error mitigation procedure based on signal processing that integrates signal filtering and correlation analysis, and successfully reproduces the noiseless simulation results from the noisy hardware. Our work highlights a route to exploring complex quantum many-body correlation functions in practice, even in the presence of realistic hardware limitations and noise.</p>

            <p>We introduce the notion of the mixed state projected ensemble (MSPE), a collection of mixed states describing a local region of a quantum many-body system, conditioned upon measurements of the complementary region which are incomplete. This constitutes a generalization of the pure state projected ensemble in which measurements are assumed ideal and complete, and which has been shown to tend towards limiting pure state distributions depending only on symmetries of the system, thus representing a new kind of universality in quantum equilibration dubbed deep thermalization. We study the MSPE generated by solvable (1+1)d dual-unitary quantum circuit evolution, and identify the limiting mixed state distributions which emerge at late times depending on the size of the incomplete measurement, which we assume to be lossy, finding that they correspond to certain random density matrix ensembles known in the literature. We also derive the rate of the emergence of such universality. Furthermore, we investigate the quantum information properties of the states composing the ensemble, specifically their capacity to teleport quantum information between the ends of the system. The teleportation fidelity is upper bounded by the quantum conditional entropy, which we find exhibits a sharp transition from zero to maximal when the number of measurements lost matches of that the number of degrees of freedom to be teleported. Our results initiate the first investigation of deep thermalization for mixed state ensembles, which are relevant for present-day quantum simulation experiments wherein measurements are typically not perfect, and also amount to a physical and natural way of sampling from hitherto abstract random density matrix ensembles.</p>

            <p>In circuit-based quantum state preparation, qubit loss and coherent errors are circuit imperfections that imperil the formation of long-range entanglement beyond a certain threshold. The critical theory at the threshold is a continuous entanglement transition known to be described by a (2+0)-dimensional non-unitary conformal field theory which, for the two types of imperfections of certain circuits, is described by either percolation or Nishimori criticality, respectively. Here we study the threshold behavior when the two types of errors simultaneously occur and show that, when moving away from the Clifford-regime of projective stabilizer measurements, the percolation critical point becomes unstable and the critical theory flows to Nishimori universality. We track this critical renormalization group (RG) crossover flow by mapping out the entanglement phase diagrams, parametrized by the probability and strength of random weak measurements, of two dual protocols preparing surface code or GHZ-class cat states from a parent cluster state via constant-depth circuits. Extensive numerical simulations, using hybrid Gaussian fermion and tensor network / Monte Carlo sampling techniques on systems with more than a million qubits, demonstrate that an infinitesimal deviation from the Clifford regime leads to a sudden, strongly non-monotonic entanglement growth at the incipient non-unitary RG flow. We argue that spectra of scaling dimensions of both the percolation and Nishimori fixed points exhibit multifractality. For percolation, we provide the exact (non-quadratic) multifractal spectrum of exponents, while for the Nishimori fixed point we show high-precision numerical results for five leading exponents characterizing multifractality.</p>

Emission in the low loss C band minimizes transmission losses, making them ideal for long distance quantum communication. In this work, we present a demonstration of both Stark tuning and charge state control of individual InAs/InP QDs operating within the telecom C-band. These QDs are grown by droplet epitaxy and embedded in an InP based n++-i-n+ heterostructure fabricated using MOVPE. The gated architecture enables the tuning of emission energy via the quantum confined Stark effect, with a tuning range exceeding 2.4 nm. It also allows for control over the QD charge occupancy, enabling access to multiple discrete excitonic states. Electrical tuning of the fine structure splitting is further demonstrated, opening a route to entangled photon pair generation at telecom wavelengths. The single photon character is confirmed via second order correlation measurements.

Incorporating the Dzyaloshinskii Moriya interaction into the charging Hamiltonian is found to enhance the ergotropy in the XXZ model, particularly for the supercube configuration, thereby improving quantum battery performance. To explore the role of structural variations, we extend our study to c regular graphs with system sizes ranging from 3 to 12 qubits, including highly symmetric geometries such as the tetrahedron, octahedron, and icosahedron. These analyzes reveal that such symmetric structures retain ideal sinusoidal charging discharging behavior when DMI is tuned appropriately, establishing symmetry and coordination as key principles for scalable quantum battery architectures.</p>

            <p>Quantifying the complexity of quantum states that possess intrinsic structure, such as symmetry or encoding, in a fair manner constitutes a core challenge in the benchmarking of quantum technologies. This paper introduces the Reference-Contingent Complexity (RCC), an information-theoretic measure calibrated by the available quantum operations. The core idea is to leverage the quantum relative entropy to quantify the deviation of a quantum state from its "structured vacuum"-namely, the maximum entropy state within its constrained subspace-thereby only pricing the process of creating non-trivial information. Our central result is a key theorem that rigorously proves the RCC serves as a lower bound for the complexity of any universal quantum circuit. This lower bound is comprised of a linear dominant term, a universal logarithmic correction, and a precise physical correction term that accounts for non-uniformity in the spectral distribution. Crucially, we establish a set of operational protocols, grounded in tasks like quantum hypothesis testing, which make this theoretical lower bound experimentally "auditable." This work provides a "ruler" for quantum technology that is structure-fair and enables cross-platform comparison, thereby establishing a strictly verifiable constraint between the computational cost of the process and the structured information of the final state.</p>

            <h2>Measurement-only circuit of perturbed toric code on triangular lattice: Topological entanglement, 1-form symmetry and logical qubits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Keisuke Kataoka, Yoshihito Kuno, Takahiro Orito, Ikuo Ichinose</p>
            <p>Measurement-only (quantum) circuit (MoC) gives possibility to realize the states with rich entanglements, topological orders and quantum memories. This work studies the MoC, in which the projective-measurement operators consist of stabilizers of the toric code and competitive local Pauli operators. The former correspond to terms of the toric code on a triangular lattice and the later to external magnetic and electric fields. We employ efficient numerical stabilizer algorithm to trace evolving states undergoing phase transitions. We elucidate the phase diagram of the MoC system with the observables such as, topological entanglement entropy (TEE), disorder parameters of 1-form symmetries and emergent logical operators. We clarify the locations of the phase transitions through the observation of the above quantities and obtain precise critical exponents to examine if the observables exhibit the critical behavior simultaneously under the MoC and transitions belong to the same universality class. In contrast to the TC Hamiltonian system and toric code MoC on a square lattice, the system on the triangular lattice is not self-dual nor bipartite, and then, coincidence by symmetries, such as critical behaviors across the TC and Higgs/confined phase, does not takes place. Then, the toric code MoC on the triangular lattice provides us a suitable playground to clarify the mutual relationship between the TEE, spontaneous symmetry breaking of the 1-form symmetries, and emergence of logical operators. Obtained results indicate that toric code MoC on the triangular lattice exhibits a few distinct phase transitions with different location and critical exponents, and some of them are closely related with the two-dimensional percolation transition.</p>

            <h2>Quantum State Preparation with Resolution Refinement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Scott Bogner, Heiko Hergert, Morten Hjorth-Jensen, Ryan LaRose, Dean Lee, Matthew Patkowski</p>
            <p>We introduce a method called resolution refinement that allows one to bootstrap eigenstate preparation on a quantum computer. We first prepare an eigenstate of a low-resolution Hamiltonian using any method of choice. The eigenstate is then lifted to higher resolution and adiabatically evolved to produce the corresponding eigenstate of a higher-fidelity Hamiltonian. We give examples of resolution refinement applied to both single-particle basis states as well as a spatial lattice grid. For basis refinement, we compute few-body ground states of the Busch model for interacting particles in a harmonic trap in one dimension. For lattice refinement, we compute Hartree-Fock nuclear states for a central Woods-Saxon potential in three dimensions, and we compute bound states and continuum states in a multi-species Hubbard model of fermions in one dimension. In all cases, the method is efficient and requires an adiabatic evolution time that scales with the inverse of the energy gap times the square root of the system size. We show that this very favorable scaling arises from the fact that resolution refinement does not make large changes to the structure or energies of the low-energy eigenstates.</p>

            <h2>Beyond Single-Device Constraints: A System-Level Theoretical Framework for High-Performance Single-Photon Detection at Room Temperature</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hao Shu</p>
            <p>Photon detection, a fundamental quantum technology, is traditionally treated as a fixed device-level operation governed by intrinsic properties of single-photon detectors (SPDs). High-performance detection has therefore largely relied on superconducting technologies whose requirement for cryogenic operation imposes substantial infrastructure constraints, limiting scalable deployments. Here, the enhanced single-photon detection (ESPD) framework is presented as a system-level theoretical paradigm that shifts photon detection from device-centric optimization to an integrated quantum-information-processing task, by reformulating it as an iteratively enhanced process integrating state-preparation, controlled operations, projective measurements, and multi-copy analysis. ESPD enables systematic performance enhancement through architectural design rather than material modification, thereby circumventing superconducting components, allowing high-performance detection using exclusively room-temperature hardware. Numerical simulations grounded in physically motivated parameters indicate that the ESPD framework can upgrade a conventional room-temperature SPD to effective DE exceeding 93\% and DCR below $10^{-9}$, which are comparable to state-of-the-art superconducting SPDs and can significantly relax the minimal tolerable channel transmission rate in quantum communications. While physical realization would require further component integration, this work establishes a rigorous theoretical framework for enhancing detection performance through architectural quantum-information principles, providing a general blueprint for transcending device-level constraints and guiding the development of next-generation room-temperature quantum technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hikaru Wakaura</p>
            <p>Kolmogorov Arnold Networks is a novel multilayer neuromorphic network that can exhibit higher accuracy than a neural network. It can learn and predict more accurately than neural networks with a smaller number of parameters, and many research groups worldwide have adopted it. As a result, many types of applications have been proposed. This network can be used as a generator solely or with a Generative Adversarial Network; however, KAN has a slower speed of learning than neural networks for the number of parameters. Hence,it has not been researched as a generator. Therefore, we propose a novel Generative Adversarial Network called Generative Adversarial Variational Quantum KAN that uses Variational Quantum KAN as a generator. This method enables efficient learning with significantly fewer parameters by leveraging the computational advantages of quantum circuits and their output distributions. We performed the training and generation task on MNIST and CIFAR10, and revealed that our method can achieve higher accuracy than neural networks and Quantum Generative Adversarial Network with less data.</p>

            <h2>Universal Quantum Random Access Memory: A Data-Independent Unitary Construction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Leonardo Bohac</p>
            <p>We present a construction for Quantum Random Access Memory (QRAM) that achieves a single, data-independent unitary operator. Unlike routing-based approaches or circuit methods that yield data-dependent unitaries, our Universal QRAM encodes data in memory qubits that act as quantum control signals within a block-diagonal permutation structure. The key insight is that memory qubits serve as control signals, enabling coherent lookup when addresses are in superposition. For N addresses with K-bit data words, the construction requires $\log_2 N + K + NK$ qubits and decomposes into exactly $NK$ multi-controlled gates. We verify the construction for $N \in \{2, 4, 8, 16\}$ and $K \in \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$, confirming that the resulting unitary is a pure permutation matrix with zero error across all data configurations. This approach simplifies QRAM implementation by separating fixed circuit structure from variable data encoding.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S. Di Matteo, C. Mazzoli</p>
            <p>Recently, Sharoglazova et al. claimed to have proven a violation of the basic tenet of Bohmian mechanics, namely the phase-speed relation $\vec{v}(\vec{r},t)=\frac{\hbar}{m}\vec{\nabla}S(\vec{r},t)$. Here, $S(\vec{r},t)$ is the (real) phase of the wave function $\psi(\vec{r},t)=\rho^{\frac{1}{2}}(\vec{r},t)e^{iS(\vec{r},t)}$. In a nutshell, they have measured the speed of a claimed evanescent wave, which is real and therefore must have $\vec{\nabla}S=\vec{0}$. However, Fig. 2 clearly shows a density motion from one waveguide to the other, implying a nonzero density current, $\vec{j}(\vec{r},t)=\frac{\hbar}{m}\Im(\psi^*\vec{\nabla}\psi)$. If we combine this evidence with the mathematical identity $\vec{\nabla}S=\frac{m}{\rho}\vec{j}$, we should instead conclude that $\vec{\nabla}S\neq\vec{0}$. So, where does this apparent inconsistency come from?</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohd Shoaib Qureshi, Tabish Qureshi</p>
            <p>Quantum decoherence refers to the phenomenon when the interaction of a quantum system with its environment results in the degradation of quantum coherence. Decoherence is considered to be the most popular mechanism responsible for the emergence of classicality from quantum mechanics. The issue of formulating a measure of decoherence is addressed here. The approach taken here is that decoherence results from the entanglement of a quantum system with certain environment degrees of freedom, and quantifying this entanglement should yield the most natural measure of decoherence. A simple measure of decoherence is presented based on this notion, and it is examined for various example systems. The measure proves to be effective and is relatively straightforward to compute. In addition, a method has been proposed to measure decoherence in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer.</p>

            <p>We study finite two-dimensional disordered systems with periodic confinement. At low energies, eigenstates exhibit strong Anderson localization, while at higher energies a subset of states forms variational scars with anisotropic intensity patterns that violate random wave expectations. Scaling theory predicts that all states localize in two dimensions, yet energy-dependent localization lengths and finite system size allow these regimes to coexist. We demonstrate that this coexistence produces distinct, robust signatures in both spatial intensity patterns and spectral statistics that are directly observable in mesoscopic electronic, photonic, and cold atom systems.</p>

            <p>This article traces the development of fluctuation theory and its deep connection to irreversibility, from equilibrium to near-equilibrium, and finally to far-from-equilibrium systems. Classical fluctuation theorems, which capture the statistical behaviour of thermodynamic systems far from equilibrium, are now well established. Their quantum counterparts, however, remain an active area of research. In this review, we highlight recent advances by linking quantum fluctuation theorems with linear response theory, offering new insights into the nature of quantum fluctuations and irreversibility in the near-equilibrium regime. Particular emphasis is placed on dissipated work in quantum systems as a pathway to observing non-classical effects in quantum thermodynamics. Understanding quantum fluctuations is not only essential for clarifying the foundations of irreversibility but also crucial for the development of novel quantum technologies, including quantum computers, sensors, and metrological devices.</p>

            <h2>Contraction 2.0 Natural Metrics in Contraction Analysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Winfried Lohmiller, Jean-Jacques Slotine</p>
            <p>Contraction analysis establishes exponential incremental convergence of a nonlinear system by solving a linear matrix inequality for a contraction metric, and has become a standard resource for solving problems in nonlinear control and estimation. This paper shows that, for a general nonlinear time-varying system, a contraction metric can be systematically derived by rewriting the system dynamics as a complex natural gradient dynamics. In this form, the variational dynamics can be modally decomposed with geodesic coordinates, and exact exponential convergence rates can be computed. The results are extended to systems with nonlinear inequality constraints. All derivations are tensor-based, and the computed eigenvalues themselves are coordinate-invariant, i.e., the contraction rates are independent of the chosen coordinate system. Simple examples including a gravity pendulum, gradient descent with non-convex cost, Schuler dynamics, and a two-link manipulator, illustrate that the computation of the decomposed convergence rates is straightforward. The role of inequality constraints is illustrated for a controller confined to an operational envelope.</p>

            <h2>Sequential learning on a Tensor Network Born machine with Trainable Token Embedding</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wanda Hou, Miao Li, Yi-Zhuang You</p>
            <p>Generative models aim to learn the probability distributions underlying data, enabling the generation of new, realistic samples. Quantum inspired generative models, such as Born machines based on the matrix product state framework, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in unsupervised learning tasks. This study advances the Born machine paradigm by introducing trainable token embeddings through positive operator valued measurements, replacing the traditional approach of static tensor indices. Key technical innovations include encoding tokens as quantum measurement operators with trainable parameters and leveraging QR decomposition to adjust the physical dimensions of the MPS. This approach maximizes the utilization of operator space and enhances the model's expressiveness. Empirical results on RNA data demonstrate that the proposed method significantly reduces negative log likelihood compared to one hot embeddings, with higher physical dimensions further enhancing single site probabilities and multi site correlations. The model also outperforms GPT2 in single site estimation and achieves competitive correlation modeling, showcasing the potential of trainable POVM embeddings for complex data correlations in quantum inspired sequence modeling.</p>

            <h2>Tensor network approximation of Koopman operators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dimitrios Giannakis, Mohammad Javad Latifi Jebelli, Michael Montgomery, Philipp Pfeffer, Jörg Schumacher, Joanna Slawinska</p>
            <p>We propose a tensor network framework for approximating the evolution of observables of measure-preserving ergodic systems. Our approach is based on a spectrally-convergent approximation of the skew-adjoint Koopman generator by a diagonalizable, skew-adjoint operator $W_\tau$ that acts on a reproducing kernel Hilbert space $\mathcal H_\tau$ with coalgebra structure and Banach algebra structure under the pointwise product of functions. Leveraging this structure, we lift the unitary evolution operators $e^{t W_\tau}$ (which can be thought of as regularized Koopman operators) to a unitary evolution group on the Fock space $F(\mathcal H_\tau)$ generated by $\mathcal H_\tau$ that acts multiplicatively with respect to the tensor product. Our scheme also employs a representation of classical observables ($L^\infty$ functions of the state) by quantum observables (self-adjoint operators) acting on the Fock space, and a representation of probability densities in $L^1$ by quantum states. Combining these constructions leads to an approximation of the Koopman evolution of observables that is representable as evaluation of a tree tensor network built on a tensor product subspace $\mathcal H_\tau^{\otimes n} \subset F(\mathcal H_\tau)$ of arbitrarily high grading $n \in \mathbb N$. A key feature of this quantum-inspired approximation is that it captures information from a tensor product space of dimension $(2d+1)^n$, generated from a collection of $2d + 1$ eigenfunctions of $W_\tau$. Furthermore, the approximation is positivity preserving. The paper contains a theoretical convergence analysis of the method and numerical applications to two dynamical systems on the 2-torus: an ergodic torus rotation as an example with pure point Koopman spectrum and a Stepanoff flow as an example with topological weak mixing.</p>

            <h2>Introduction of Additive Particle Theory for Path Integral Approaches</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ken-ichi Amano</p>
            <p>Path integral approaches have been used for boson and fermion systems. The path integral approach has been successful in the many-boson system. However, in the many-fermion system, the path integral approach is not feasible due to the sign problem. In this letter, I introduce additive particle (AP) theory in order to generate an approximation method that avoids the sign problem. The AP theory considers one electron as a string polymer, and virtual particles are added into the system. The AP theory is an approximation, but it is constructed to be able to generate the pair distribution function between free electrons and the density of states of the free electrons at an arbitrary temperature. Hence, when the electrostatic interactions are decreased, the AP theory converges to the free electron system. On the other hand, it deviates from the actual system when the electrostatic interactions are increased.</p>

            <p>A system of several Wannier-Mott excitons interacting with phonons in a bulk material is considered. We show that strong exciton-phonon coupling causes the formation of a coherent two-exciton state -- the exciton pair. Unlike the biexcitons, where the photons play the role of force carrier, the exciton pair is formed via entanglement with the long-living phonon mode: (i) The essentially multi-particle theory requires excitons (cobosons composed of an electron and a hole) to satisfy the mixed Bose-Fermi statistics; (ii) This allows us to formulate a system of non-linear dynamic equations, using the multiconfiguration Hartree method applied to the Frohlich Hamiltonian. The system of equations possesses a stationary solution, which, for the case of a single exciton, describes the excitonic polaron and corresponds to the exciton pair in the two-exciton case. We also compare the fluorescent spectra of exciton polarons and exciton pairs estimated from our theory with those observed in experiments on room-temperature superfluorescence (collective emission of fluorescent light) in hybrid perovskites to give an additional insight into the superfluorescence phenomenon.</p>

            <h2>Generalized $η$-pairing theory and anomalous localization in non-Hermitian systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kai Lieta</p>
            <p>By generalizing the eta-pairing theory to non-Hermitian Hubbard models on arbitrary lattices, we obtain the sufficient and necessary condition for the eta-pairing operator to be an eigenoperator of the Hamiltonian $H$, and find unique eta-pairing phenomena without Hermitian analogs. For instance, the Hermitian conjugate of an eta-pairing eigenoperator may not be an eigenoperator, eta-pairing eigenoperators can be spatially modulated, and the $SU(2)$ pseudospin symmetry may not be possible even if $H$ commutes with the eta-pairing operators. Remarkably, these novel non-Hermitian phenomena are closely related to each other by several theorems we establish and can lead to, for example, new types of eta-pairing operators (e.g., the notion of non-Hermitian angular-momentum operators) and the anomalous localization (e.g., the skin effect) of eta-pairing eigenstates. Some issues on the $SO(4)$ and particle-hole symmetries are clarified. Our general eta-pairing theory also reveals a previously unnoticed unification of these symmetries of the Hubbard model. To exemplify these findings, we first propose the Hatano-Nelson-Hubbard model. In this interacting non-Hermitian system without even the bulk translation invariance, the right and left two-particle eta-pairing eigenstates are exponentially localized at opposite boundaries of the chain. Then, we generalize this model to two dimensions and find that the eta-pairing eigenstates can exhibit the first- or second-order skin effect. Finally, a general two-sublattice model is constructed to realize all of the non-Hermitian eta-pairing phenomena. This work provides a new and rigorous theoretical framework for studying novel physical phenomena (e.g., the skin effect) in interacting non-Hermitian systems, even in arbitrary spatial dimensions and without the bulk translation symmetry.</p>

            <p>We provide a mathematical realization of a conjecture by Kitaev, on the basis of the operator-algebraic formulation of infinite quantum spin systems. Our main results are threefold. First, we construct an $\Omega$-spectrum $\mathit{IP}_*$ whose homotopy groups are isomorphic to the smooth homotopy group of invertible gapped quantum systems on Euclidean spaces. Second, we develop a model for the homology theory associated with the $\Omega$-spectrum $\mathit{IP}_*$, describing it in terms of the space of quantum systems placed on an arbitrary subspace of a Euclidean space. This involves introducing the concept of localization flow, a semi-infinite path of quantum systems with decaying interaction range, inspired by Yu's localization C*-algebra in coarse index theory. Third, we incorporate spatial symmetries given by a crystallographic group $\Gamma $ and define the $\Omega$-spectrum $\mathit{IP}_*^\Gamma$ of $\Gamma$-invariant invertible phases. We propose a strategy for computing the homotopy group $\pi_n(\mathit{IP}_d^\Gamma )$ that uses the Davis--Lück assembly map and its description by invertible gapped localization flow. In particular, we show that the assembly map is split injective, and hence $\pi_n(\mathit{IP}_d^\Gamma)$ contains a computable direct summand.</p>

            <p>A thermodynamic analysis of weakly nonlocal non-relativistic fluids is presented under the assumption that an additional scalar field also contributes to the dynamics. The most general evolution of this field and the constitutive relations for the pressure tensor and energy current density are determined by the Liu procedure. Classical holography of perfect (\ie non-dissipative) fluids is generally proven, according to which the divergence of the pressure tensor can be given by the gradient of a corresponding scalar potential. A consequence of holographic property is vorticity conservation, which opens the way toward wave-function representation of hydrodynamic equations to obtain the Schrödinger equation. Another special case of the derived fluid model is Newtonian gravity, when the internal variable is the gravitational potential itself. Coupled phenomena, such as the Schrödinger--Newton system, are also discussed. The presented thermodynamic framework can shed light on some connections between formulations of classical and quantum physics.</p>

            <p>We consider how the Born rule, a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics, can be tested for particles created on the shortest timescales ($\sim10^{-25}\,\mathrm{s}$) currently accessible at high-energy colliders. We focus on targeted tests of the Born rule for spin or polarisation probabilities, which offer a particularly clean experimental signal, and which can be described by a simple hidden-variables model of two-state systems proposed by Bell. These probabilities test a remarkable feature of the quantum formalism, whereby expectation values for incompatible experiments are linearly related. Born-rule violations can be parameterised by nonlinear expectation values for quantum measurements of spin or polarisation, together with anomalies in ensemble averages, which may then be constrained by experiment. Notable experiments considered here include the recent detection of single photons from top-quark decay, and the indirect measurement of tau-lepton polarisation. Repurposing these experiments as tests of the Born rule, however, presents several challenges, which are discussed in this paper.</p>

            <p>Predicting phenomena that mix few-photon quantum optics with strong field nonlinear optics is hindered by the use of separate theoretical formalisms for each regime. We close this gap with a unified effective field theory valid for frequencies lower than the material-dependent cutoff set by the band gap, plasma frequency, or similar scale. The action couples the electromagnetic gauge field to vector polarisation modes. An isotropic potential generates the optical susceptibilities, while a higher-dimension axion-like term captures magnetoelectric effects; quantisation on the Schwinger-Keldysh contour with doubled BRST ghosts preserves gauge symmetry in dissipative media. One-loop renormalisation-group equations reproduce the measured dispersion of the third-order susceptibility from terahertz to near-visible frequencies after matching a single datum per material. Real-time dynamics solved with a matrix-product-operator engine yield good agreement with published results for GaAs polariton cavities, epsilon-near-zero indium-tin-oxide films and superconducting quarton circuits. The current formulation is limited to these 1-D geometries and sub-cut-off frequencies; higher-dimensional or above-cut-off phenomena will require additional degrees of freedom or numerical methods.</p>

In this paper, we identify two notions of locality unique to the quantum domain, and we construct a novel quantum separation logic, RapunSL, which is able to soundly reduce reasoning about superposition states to reasoning about pure states (basis-locality), and reasoning about mixed states arising from measurement to reasoning about pure states (outcome-locality). To do so, we introduce two connectives, linear combination and mixing, which together with separation provide a dramatic improvement in the scalability of reasoning, as we demonstrate on a series of challenging case studies.</p>

In this Letter, we demonstrate that the confining boundary of the MIT Bag Model acts as an ``Entropic Skin,'' generating maximal Spin-Position entanglement. We calculate the local reduced density matrix for the confined quark and show that the linear boundary condition, $i \gamma^\mu n_\mu \psi = \psi$, acts as an entangling gate. The surface entropy density reaches a geometric invariant of $\approx 0.918$ bits ($92\%$ of the qubit limit), independent of the bag radius. We discuss the implications of this result for Chiral Symmetry breaking and propose that this boundary entropy is the precursor to the pion cloud in effective field theories.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Correlation and Synchronisation-Enhanced Energy Transfer in Driven-Dissipative Light-Harvesting Dimers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenhao Xu</p>
            <p>Quantum synchronisation has recently been proposed as a mechanism for electronic excitation energy transfer in light-harvesting complexes, yet its robustness in driven-dissipative settings remains under active investigation. Here, we revisit this mechanism in cryptophyte photosynthetic antennae using an exciton--vibrational dimer model. By comparing the full open quantum dynamics with semi-classical rate equations for electronic density-matrix elements and vibrational observables, we demonstrate that quantum correlations between electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom, beyond the semi-classical factorised limit, underpin the emergence of quantum synchronisation. Furthermore, we introduce an environment-assisted transfer mechanism arising as a nonlinear, non-Condon correction to the dipole--dipole interaction. This mechanism enables long-lived quantum coherence and continuous, synchronisation-enhanced energy transfer in a driven-dissipative regime, thereby suggesting new avenues for investigating photosynthetic energy-transfer dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Spin Response of a Magnetic Monopole and Quantum Hall Response in Topological Lattice Models through Local Invariants and Light</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Karyn Le Hur, Andrea Baldanza</p>
            <p>Here, we elaborate on and develop the geometrical approach introduced in K. Le Hur, Physics Reports 1104 1-42 (2025) between the magnetic monopole created from a radial field, quantum physics and topological lattice models through quantum phase transitions. We introduce an effective magnetic moment for a monopole when applying an additional source field along z-direction which also mediates the quantum phase transition. We present its relation with the transverse pumped quantum Hall current. The magnetic susceptibility can be introduced as a measure of the topological invariant i.e. it remains quantized within the topological phase until the transition. We show the relation with two-dimensional topological lattice models such as a honeycomb Haldane model in real space. We develop the theory and present a numerical analysis between local invariants in momentum space introduced from Dirac points, correlation functions and the responses to circularly polarized light. We develop the formalism for coupled-planes materials including the possibility of quantum spin Hall effect and address a relation between the Ramanujan infinite alternating series and an interface in real space with a topological number one-half.</p>

            <p>While quantum simulators promise to explore quantum many-body physics beyond classical computation, their capabilities are limited by the available native interactions in the hardware. On many platforms, accessible Hamiltonians are largely restricted to one- and two-body interactions, limiting access to multi-body Hamiltonians and to systems governed by simultaneous, non-commuting interaction terms that are central to condensed matter, quantum chemistry, and high-energy physics. We introduce and experimentally demonstrate a hybrid digital-analog protocol that overcomes these limitations by embedding analog evolution between shallow entangling-gate layers. This method produces effective Hamiltonians with simultaneous non-commuting three- and four-body interactions that are generated non-perturbatively and without Trotter error -- capabilities not practically attainable on near-term hardware using purely digital or purely analog schemes. We implement our scheme on a trapped-ion quantum processor and use it to realize a topological spin chain exhibiting prethermal strong zero modes persisting at high temperature, as well as models featuring three- and four-body interactions. Our hardware-agnostic and scalable method opens new routes to realizing complex many-body physics across quantum platforms.</p>

            <h2>Geometry and quantum brachistochrone analysis of multiple entangled spin-1/2 particles under all-range Ising interaction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> B. Amghar, M. Yachi, M. Amghar, M. Almousa, A. A. Abd El-Latif, A. Slaoui</p>
            <p>We present a unified geometric and dynamical framework for a physical system consisting of $n$ spin-$1/2$ particles with all-range Ising interaction. Using the Fubini-Study formalism, we derive the metric tensor of the associated quantum state manifold and compute the corresponding Riemann curvature. Our analysis reveals that the system evolves over a smooth, compact, two-dimensional manifold with spherical topology and a dumbbell-like structure shaped by collective spin interactions. We further investigate the influence of the geometry and topology of the resulting state space on the behavior of geometric and topological phases acquired by the system. We explore how this curvature constrains the system's dynamical behavior, including its evolution speed and Fubini-Study distance between the quantum states. Within this geometric framework, we address the quantum brachistochrone problem and derive the minimal time required for optimal evolution, a result useful for time-efficient quantum circuit design. Subsequently, we explore the role of entanglement in shaping the state space geometry, modulating geometric phase, and controlling evolution speed and brachistochrone time. Our results reveal that entanglement enhances dynamics up to a critical threshold, beyond which geometric constraints begin to hinder evolution. Moreover, entanglement induces critical shifts in the geometric phase, making it a sensitive indicator of entanglement levels and a practical tool for steering quantum evolution. This approach offers valuable guidance for developing quantum technologies that require time-efficient control strategies rooted in the geometry of quantum state space.</p>

            <p>Electrons bound to shallow donors in ZnSe quantum wells are promising candidates for optically addressable spin qubits and single-photon sources. However, their optical coherence and indistinguishability are often limited by spectral broadening arising from charge fluctuations in the local environment. Here, we report electrical control of single donor qubits in ZnSe quantum wells. The applied field induces a DC Stark shift that tunes the emission energy over a range exceeding 30 times the inhomogeneous linewidth, effectively compensating for emitter-to-emitter variations. Concurrently, the field stabilizes trap occupancy, yielding a twofold reduction in optical linewidth and the suppression of spectral wandering. A statistical model based on trap dynamics qualitatively reproduces these observations and elucidates the mechanism of field-assisted charge noise suppression. Our results identify electrical control as a versatile pathway to significantly improve optical and spin addressability.</p>

            <p>Quantum repeaters enable the generation of reliable entanglement across long distances despite the underlying channel noise. Nevertheless, realizing quantum repeaters poses a difficult engineering challenge due to various device constraints and design tradeoffs. Herein, we propose and analyze an efficient hybrid quantum repeater design that integrates atom-based quantum processing units, spontaneous parametric down-conversion photon sources, and atomic frequency comb quantum memories. Our design leverages the strong spectro-temporal multiplexing capability of the quantum memory to enable high-rate elementary-link entanglement generation between repeater nodes. Transferring the photonic entanglement into matter-qubit entanglement, together with deterministic quantum operations, further enables reliable long-distance entanglement distribution. We analyze photon-loss channels in the hybrid architecture and propose suitable error-suppression strategies that are natively incorporated into our repeater protocol. Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate the advantages of our hybrid design for end-to-end secret key rates in a linear repeater-chain model. With continued advances in relevant hardware technologies, we envision that the proposed hybrid design is well-suited for large-scale quantum networks.</p>

            <h2>Asymmetric polaron picture for the quantum Rabi model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Feng Qiao, Qiu-Yi Chen, Zu-Jian Ying</p>
            <p>The experimental access to ultra-strong couplings in light-matter interactions has made the quantum phase transition (QPT) in the quantum Rabi model practically relevant, while the physics of the QPT has not yet been fully explored. The polaron picture is a method capable of analyzing in the entire coupling regime and extracting the essential physics behind the QPT. However, the asymmetric deformation of polarons is missing in the current polaron picture. In the present work we propose an improved variational method in asymmetric polaron picture (APP). Our APP not only increases the method accuracy but also reveals more underlying physics concerning the QPT. We find that in the ground state both the polarons and antipolarons are asymmetrically deformed to a large extent, which leads to a richer phase diagram. We also analyze the first excited state in which we unveil an asymmetry direction reversal for the polarons and an attraction/replusion transition differently from the ground state. Finally, we apply the APP in quantum Fisher information analysis and critical coupling extraction, the improvements indicate that the polaron asymmetry makes a considerable contribution to the quantum resource in quantum metrology and plays an unnegligible role in the QPT. Our results and mechanism clarifications expose more subtle energy competitions and abundant physics, and the method potentially might have broader applications in light-matter interactions.</p>

            <h2>Properties of a Three-Level $Λ$-Type Atom Driven by Coherent and Stochastic Fields</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sajad Ahmadi, Mohsen Akbari, Shahpoor Saeidian, Ali Motazedifard</p>
            <p>We present a theoretical investigation of a three-level $\Lambda$-type atom driven by a strong coherent laser and a weak stochastic field exhibiting amplitude and phase fluctuations. The stochastic field is modeled as a complex Gaussian-Markovian random process with finite bandwidth to describe realistic laser noise. Using the Born-Markov and rotating-wave approximations, we derive a Lindblad-form master equation that incorporates spontaneous emission and noise-induced terms, and we solve for the steady-state regime. We examine level populations in both the bare and dressed bases and compute the incoherent resonance-fluorescence spectrum. Our analysis shows that the stochastic drive is not merely a source of decoherence but a versatile control parameter. By detuning the stochastic-field central frequency relative to the coherent drive (especially for narrow bandwidths), we observe pronounced changes in emission characteristics, including selective enhancement or suppression, and reshaping of the multi-peaked fluorescence spectrum when the detuning matches the generalized Rabi frequency. Numerical results reveal nontrivial steady-state modifications distinct from purely coherent driving, enabling precise control of populations and suggesting applications in quantum control, quantum technologies, spectroscopy, and noise-assisted manipulation of atomic systems.</p>

            <p>Interactions between charged particles and light occur in real space and time, yet quantum field theory usually describes them in momentum space. Whereas this approach is well suited for calculating emission probabilities and cross sections, it is insensitive to spatial and temporal phenomena such as, for instance, radiation formation, quantum coherence, and wave packet spreading. These effects are becoming increasingly important for experiments involving electrons, photons, atoms, and ions, particularly with the advent of attosecond spectroscopy and metrology. Here, we propose a general method for describing the emission of photons in phase space via a Wigner function. Several effects for Cherenkov radiation are predicted, absent in classical realm or in quantum theory in momentum space, such as a finite spreading time of the photon, finite duration of the flash and a quantum shift of the photon arrival time. The photon spreading time turns out to be negative near the Cherenkov angle, the flash duration is defined by the electron packet size, and the temporal shift can be both positive and negative. The characteristic time scales of these effects lie in the atto- and femtosecond ranges, thereby illustrating atomic origins of these macroscopic phenomena. The near-field distribution of the photon field resembles the electron packet shape, thus making ``snapshots'' of the emitter wave function. Our approach can easily be generalized to the other types of radiation and extended to scattering, decay, and annihilation processes, bringing tomographic methods of quantum optics to particle physics.</p>

            <h2>Delayed Choice Lorentz Transformations on a Qubit</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lucas Burns, Sacha Greenfield, Justin Dressel</p>
            <p>A continuously monitored quantum bit (qubit) exhibits competition between unitary Hamiltonian dynamics and non-unitary measurement-collapse dynamics, which for diffusive measurements form an enlarged transformation group equivalent to the Lorentz group of spacetime. We leverage this equivalence to develop a four-dimensional generalization of the three-dimensional Bloch ball to visualize the state of a monitored qubit as the four-momentum of an effective classical charge affected by a stochastic electromagnetic force field. Unitary qubit dynamics generated by Hermitian Hamiltonians correspond to elliptic spatial rotations of this effective charge while non-unitary qubit dynamics generated by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians or stochastic measurement collapse correspond to hyperbolic Lorentz boosts. Notably, to faithfully emulate the stochastic qubit dynamics arising from continuous qubit measurement, the stochastic electromagnetic fields must depend on the velocity of the charge they are acting on. Moreover, continuous qubit measurements admit a dynamical delayed choice effect where a future experimental choice can appear to retroactively determine the type of past measurement backaction, so the corresponding point charge dynamics can also exhibit delayed choice Lorentz transformations in which a future experimental choice determines whether stochastic force fields are electric or magnetic in character long after they interact with the particle.</p>

            <h2>A Fundamental Theorem on Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen Steering</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Xuan Zhang, Jing-Ling Chen</p>
            <p>Quantum nonlocality is an essential nonlocality resource in quantum information. It has been classified into three distinct types: quantum entanglement, Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering, and Bell's nonlocality. In 1991, Gisin presented a fundamental theorem on Bell's nonlocality, pointing out all pure entangled states possess Bell's nonloclaity. Many of the core protocols of quantum information science (such as quantum teleportation, quantum key distribution, and certain algorithms in quantum computing) rely on entanglement. Gisin's theorem tells us that as long as we successfully prepare a pure entangled state, we then have a Bell-nonlocality resource that can show the non-classical correlations. Such a resource is not ``virtual'' and can be tested and used through Bell-experiments. Similarly, in this work, we present a Gisin-like fundamental theorem on EPR steering, which indicates all rank-2 (and rank-1) entangled states possess EPR steerability. Thus all rank-2 entangled states can be applicable as EPR-steering resources in quantum information.</p>

            <p>We commence our study with review of dispersion interactions in electrolytes. We then reflect on how background media change atom-atom excited-state systems. To highlight the impact of nonlocal media, such as salt solutions, we predict that a new contribution to the resonance interaction energy emerges in a form $\propto e^{-\kappa_{\rm D} \rho}/\rho$. Here $\kappa_{\rm D}$ is the Debye length and $\rho$ is the distance between the atoms. This contribution vanishes at zero temperature, where a new term proportional to $1/\rho^4$ (similar to free space) occurs. This new term is dampened by the electrolyte at large distances, causing it to decrease much faster, proportional to $1/\rho^7$. The long-range electrolyte-induced resonance interaction at finite temperature may, in addition to the dominating van der Waals attraction (which goes as $1/\rho^6$), take part in the molecular formation of biological fluids.</p>

In a magneto-optical trap, we excite the atoms to the center of a manifold of nearly harmonically spaced clusters of Stark energy levels and then allow them to equilibrate. Comparing the equilibrium state to our thermal prediction across a range of densities, we find that the atoms generally fail to thermalize, though they approach the thermal state at the highest tested density.</p>

            <p>We investigate the statistical physics of quantum error correction in ${\rm U}(1)$ symmetry-enriched topological quantum memories. Starting from a phenomenological error model of charge-conserving noise, we study the optimal decoder assuming the local charges of each anyon can be measured. The error threshold of the optimal decoder corresponds to a continuous phase transition in a disordered two-dimensional integer loop model on the Nishimori line. Using an effective replica field theory analysis and Monte Carlo numerics, we show that the optimal decoding transition exhibits Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless universality with a modified universal jump in winding number variance. We further generalize the model beyond the Nishimori line, which defines a large class of suboptimal decoders. At low nonzero temperatures and strong disorder, we find numerical evidence of a disorder-dominated loop-glass phase which corresponds to a "confidently incorrect" decoder. The zero-temperature limit defines the minimum-cost flow decoder, which serves as the ${\rm U}(1)$ analog of minimum-weight perfect matching in $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological codes. Both the optimal and minimum-cost flow decoders are shown to dramatically outperform the charge-agnostic optimal decoder in symmetry-enriched topological codes.</p>

            <h2>Information Critical Phases under Decoherence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akash Vijay, Jong Yeon Lee</p>
            <p>Quantum critical phases are extended regions of phase space characterized by a diverging correlation length. By analogy, we define an information critical phase as an extended region of a mixed state phase diagram where the Markov length, the characteristic length scale governing the decay of the conditional mutual information (CMI), diverges. We demonstrate that such a phase arises in decohered $\mathbb{Z}_{N}$ Toric codes by assessing both the CMI and the coherent information, the latter quantifying the robustness of the encoded logical qudits. For $N>4$, we find that the system hosts an information critical phase intervening between the decodable and non-decodable phases where the coherent information saturates to a fractional value in the thermodynamic limit, indicating that a finite fraction of logical information is still preserved. We show that the density matrix in this phase can be decomposed into a convex sum of Coulombic pure states, where gapped anyons reorganize into gapless photons. We further consider the ungauged $\mathbb{Z}_{N}$ Toric code and interpret its mixed state phase diagram in the language of strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking. We argue that in the dual model, the information critical phase arises because the spontaneously broken off-diagonal $\mathbb{Z}_{N}$ symmetry gets enhanced to a U(1) symmetry, resulting in a novel superfluid phase whose gapless modes involve coherent excitations of both the system and the environment. Finally, we propose an optimal decoding protocol for the corrupted $\mathbb{Z}_{N}$ Toric code and evaluate its effectiveness in recovering the fractional logical information preserved in the information critical phase. Our findings identify a gapless analog for mixed-state phases that still acts as a fractional topological quantum memory, thereby extending the conventional paradigm of quantum memory phases.</p>

Furthermore, our approach can be generalized to realize a new type of many-body non-Hermitian skin effect, dubbed the hierarchical skin effect, where different subsystem degrees of freedom exhibit boundary accumulation of multiple moments at different orders. Our findings can be readily observed by engineering dissipation in state-of-the-art lattice gauge simulators.</p>

By examining the long-time damping dynamics, we uncover a dynamical duality phenomenon between the weak and strong dissipation region, which exists only in the topologically non-trivial phase, linked to the structure of the Liouvillian spectra,particularly the stripe closest to the steady state. When dissipation is confined to a single boundary, the dynamical duality phenomenon still exists. Under this condition, the Liouvillian gap fulfills an exponential size scaling relation in the topologically non-trivial phase and a power-law size scaling relation in the topologically trivial phase. Within the topologically non-trivial region, we identify the existence of boundary-localized dark states in the thermodynamical limit, which is responsible for the exponential size decay of Liouvillian gap.</p>

It is demonstrated that the adsorption rate can be either enhanced or suppressed relative to the Fermi golden rule rate, in analogy to cavity effects in the spontaneous emission rate in QED. A mesoscopic-sized adsorbent behaves as an acoustic cavity that enhances the adsorption rate when tuned to the adsorption transition frequency and suppresses the rate when detuned.

            <p>What physical mechanism enables quantum catalysis to boost quantum battery (QB) performance in open systems? We investigate an external-field-driven qubit QB coupled to a harmonic oscillator catalyst, revealing a key thermodynamic mechanism: the catalyst induces transient negative heat flow ($J(t)<0$, or energy backflow) into the battery. This backflow actively counters dephasing losses, rapidly pushing the qubit into non-passive states, and results in a drastic enhancement of extractable work (Ergotropy). Leveraging the quantum first law, we precisely quantify this causal link between negative heat flux and QB performance enhancement. Our work uncovers the fundamental role of transient thermodynamic backflow in quantum catalysis, offering a crucial blueprint for high-performance quantum energy storage devices.</p>

            <p>Multipartite entanglement is a key resource for quantum technologies, yet its scalable generation in noisy quantum devices remains challenging. Here, we propose a low-depth quantum neural network architecture with linear scaling with a novel approach to introducing activation functions, used for the task of entanglement engineering. As a testbed to demonstrate the clear advantage unlocked by the introduction of nonlinear activations, we run a Monte Carlo sampling over $10^5$ circuit topologies for pure noiseless states. Supported by the clear edge offered by our approach, we focus our attention on the noisy scenario; we employ the experimentally-accessible Meyer-Wallach global entanglement as a scalable surrogate optimization cost and certify entanglement using bipartite negativity. For mixed states up to ten qubits, the optimized circuits generate substantial entanglement across both symmetric and asymmetric bipartitions. These results established an experimentally motivated and scalable framework for engineering multipartite entanglement on near-term quantum devices, highlighting the combined role of nonlinearity and circuit topology that can achieve up to 20 qubits for very low noisy levels.</p>

            <p>Nondemolition protocols use ancilla qubits to identify the fragile quantum state of a qubit without destroying its encoded information, thus playing a crucial role in nondestructive quantum measurements particularly relevant for quantum error correction. However, the multitude of ancilla preparations, information transfers, and ancilla measurements in these protocols create an intrinsic overhead for information processing. Here we consider an Andreev qubit defined in a quantum-dot Josephson junction and show that the macroscopic time-dependent oscillatory supercurrent arising from the quantum interference of the many-body eigenstates, can be used to probe the qubit itself-arbitrarily close to the nondestructive limit-under currently available experimental capabilities. This readout of arbitrary superposition states of Andreev qubits avoids ancillae altogether and significantly reduces experimental overhead as no repetitive qubit reinitialization is needed. Our prediction of an AC-like Josephson effect without an applied external voltage, which enables the nondestructive qubit readout, is a unique macroscopic manifestation of the microscopic dynamics of the Andreev quantum state. Our findings should have an unprecedented impact on advancing research and applications involving Andreev dots, thus positioning them as promising qubit contenders for quantum processing and technologies.</p>

            <p>Time-dependent electromagnetic drives are fundamental for controlling complex quantum systems, including superconducting Josephson circuits. In these devices, accurate time-dependent Hamiltonian models are imperative for predicting their dynamics and designing high-fidelity quantum operations. Existing numerical methods, such as black-box quantization (BBQ) and energy-participation ratio (EPR), excel at modeling the static Hamiltonians of Josephson circuits. However, these techniques do not fully capture the behavior of driven circuits stimulated by external microwave drives, nor do they include a generalized approach to account for the inevitable noise and dissipation that enter through microwave ports. Here, we introduce novel numerical techniques that leverage classical microwave simulations that can be efficiently executed in finite element solvers, to obtain the time-dependent Hamiltonian of a microwave-driven superconducting circuit with arbitrary geometries. Importantly, our techniques do not rely on a lumped-element description of the superconducting circuit, in contrast to previous approaches to tackling this problem. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach by characterizing the driven properties of realistic circuit devices in complex electromagnetic environments, including coherent dynamics due to charge and flux modulation, as well as drive-induced relaxation and dephasing. Our techniques offer a powerful toolbox for optimizing circuit designs and advancing practical applications in superconducting quantum computing.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Universality in Composite Systems: A Trichotomy of Clifford Resources</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alejandro Borda, Julian Rincon, César Galindo</p>
            <p>The efficient classical simulation of Clifford circuits constitutes a fundamental barrier to quantum advantage, typically overcome by injecting explicit non-Clifford "magic" resources. We demonstrate that for high-dimensional quantum systems (qudits), the resources required to break this barrier are strictly governed by the number-theoretic structure of the Hilbert space dimension $d$. By analyzing the adjoint action of the Clifford group, we establish a classification of single-qudit universality as a trichotomy. (I) For prime dimensions, the Clifford group is a maximal finite subgroup, and universality is robustly achieved by any non-Clifford gate. (II) For prime-power dimensions, the group structure fragments, requiring tailored diagonal non-Clifford gates to restore irreducibility. (III) Most notably, for composite dimensions with coprime factors, we demonstrate that standard entangling operations alone -- specifically, generalized intra-qudit CNOT gates -- generate the necessary non-Clifford resources to guarantee a dense subgroup of $\mathrm{SU}(d)$ without explicit diagonal magic injection. Our proofs rely on a new geometric criterion establishing that a subgroup with irreducible adjoint action is infinite if it contains a non-scalar element with projective distance strictly less than $1/2$ from the identity. These results establish that "coprime architectures" -- hybrid registers combining subsystems with coprime dimensions -- can sustain universal computation using only classical entangling operations, rendering the explicit injection of magic resources algebraically unnecessary.</p>

            <h2>Using bosons to improve resource efficiency of quantum simulation of vibronic molecular dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Henry L. Nourse, Vanessa C. Olaya-Agudelo, Ivan Kassal</p>
            <p>Simulating chemical dynamics is computationally challenging, especially for nonadiabatic dynamics, where numerically exact classical simulations scale exponentially with system size, becoming intractable for even small molecules. On quantum computers, chemical dynamics can be simulated efficiently using either universal, qubit-only devices or specialized mixed-qudit-boson (MQB) simulators, which natively host electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom. Here, we compare the quantum resources required for a qubit-only approach to achieve the same accuracy as an MQB device at simulating nonadiabatic molecular dynamics. We find that MQB simulations require orders-of-magnitude fewer quantum operations than qubit-only simulations, with a one-gate MQB circuit requiring a qubit-equivalent circuit volume of over 400,000 when simulating an isolated molecule, which increases to over ten million when environmental effects are included. These estimates assume perfect qubits and gates, and would increase by additional orders of magnitude if error correction were used for fault tolerance. When errors are small, the advantage of MQB simulators becomes even larger as system size increases. Our results highlight the enormous resource advantages of representing non-qubit chemical degrees of freedom natively, rather than encoding them into qubits.</p>

Here, we simultaneously benchmark the electron and hole g-factors and coherence properties of a droplet epitaxy QD, solely from time and polarization resolved photon correlations. These measurements identify the hole as the preferable qubit for spin-photon entanglement in quantum network nodes. We then perform full state tomography of the confined hole ground state to reveal subtle anisotropies in the spin precession, providing essential diagnostics for minimizing phase errors critical for deterministic multiphoton entanglement generation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Minhyeok Kang, Jaehee Kim, William J. Munro, Seungbeom Chin, Joonsuk Huh</p>
            <p>Entanglement is a fundamental feature of quantum mechanics and a key resource for quantum information processing. Among multipartite entangled states, Dicke states $|D_n^k\rangle$ are distinguished by their permutation symmetry, which provides robustness against particle loss and enables applications for quantum communication and computation. Although Dicke states have been realized in various platforms, most optical implementations rely on postselection, which destroys the state upon detection and prevents its further use. A heralded optical scheme is therefore highly desirable. Here, we present a linear-optical heralded scheme for generating arbitrary Dicke states $|D_n^k\rangle$ with $3n+k$ photons through the framework of the linear quantum graph (LQG) picture. By mapping the scheme design into the graph-finding problem, and exploiting the permutation symmetry of Dicke states, we overcome the structural complexity that has hindered previous approaches. Our results provide a resource-efficient pathway toward practical heralded preparation of Dicke states for quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>Numerical exploration of large-size real biological systems requires computational power far exceeding that of modern classical computers. In computational molecular science, calculation of long-range electrostatic interactions between charged atoms - the strongest interactions in condensed phases, is a major bottleneck. Here, we propose a quantum algorithm for fast yet accurate computation of Coulomb electrostatic energy for a system of point charges. The algorithm employs the Ewald method based decomposition of electrostatic energy E into several energy terms, of which "the Fourier component" of E is computed in the algorithm proposed on a quantum device, utilizing the power of Quantum Fourier Transform. We demonstrate the algorithm's quantum advantage for a range of systems of point charges in the three-dimensional space when the number of charges (system size) N exceeds the number of grid points M, and show that the numerical error is rather small <0.1%. The algorithm can be implemented in running the all-atom Molecular Dynamics simulations on a quantum computer, thereby expanding the scope of applications of QFT methods in computational physics, chemistry, and biology.</p>

The transmon qubit is then introduced as a state-of-the-art application, with a detailed derivation of its Hamiltonian and its interaction with control and readout circuitry. The theoretical formalism is consolidated through a numerical simulation of vacuum Rabi oscillations in a driven transmon-resonator system, a canonical experiment that demonstrates the coherent energy exchange characteristic of the strong coupling regime.

            <p>The capability to control molecular rotation for field-free orientation, which arranges molecules in specific spatial directions without external fields, is crucial in physics, chemistry, and quantum information science. However, conventional methods typically lead to transient orientations characterized by periodic directional reversals and necessitate the generation of coherent superpositions across a broad spectrum of rotational states of ultracold molecules. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework for achieving unidirectional field-free orientation by selectively manipulating two specific rotational states of symmetric top molecules. By leveraging the interplay between coherent superpositions and the precise selection of initial states, we demonstrate that both the maximum achievable orientation and its direction can be effectively controlled. To attain the desired two-state orientation, we present a quantum control strategy that utilizes a single control pulse, significantly simplifying the complexities of conventional multistate or multipulse schemes. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness and feasibility of this approach for methyl iodide (CH$_3$I) molecules, even when accounting for molecular centrifugal this http URL results highlight the critical roles of initial-state selection and quantum coherence in achieving long-lasting, high unidirectional molecular orientation, opening new directions in stereochemistry, precision spectroscopy, and quantum computing.</p>

            <p>Quantum algorithms to integrate nonlinear PDEs governing flow problems are challenging to discover but critical to enhancing the practical usefulness of quantum computing. We present here a near-optimal, robust, and end-to-end quantum algorithm to solve time-dependent, dissipative, and nonlinear PDEs. We embed the PDEs in a truncated, high dimensional linear space on the basis of quantum homotopy analysis. The linearized system is discretized and integrated using finite-difference methods that use a compact quantum algorithm. The present approach can adapt its input to the nature of nonlinearity and underlying physics. The complexity estimates improve existing approaches in terms of scaling of matrix operator norms, condition number, simulation time, and accuracy. We provide a general embedding strategy, bounds on stability criteria, accuracy, gate counts and query complexity. A physically motivated measure of nonlinearity is connected to a parameter that is similar to the flow Reynolds number $Re_{\textrm{H}}$, whose inverse marks the allowed integration window, for given accuracy and complexity. We illustrate the embedding scheme with numerical simulations of a one-dimensional Burgers problem. This work shows the potential of the hybrid quantum algorithm for simulating practical and nonlinear phenomena on near-term and fault-tolerant quantum devices.</p>

            <p>Quantum sensing promises measurement precision beyond classical limits, but its practical realization is often hindered by decoherence and the challenges of generating and stabilizing entanglement in large-scale systems. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a scalable, scrambling-enhanced quantum sensing protocol, referred to as butterfly metrology, implemented on a cross-shaped superconducting quantum processor. By harnessing quantum information scrambling, the protocol converts local interactions into delocalized metrologically useful correlations, enabling robust signal amplification through interference of the scrambled and polarized quantum states. We validate the time-reversal ability via Loschmidt echo measurements and quantify the information scrambling through out-of-time-ordered correlators, establishing the essential quantum resources of our protocol. Our measurements reveal that the sensing sensitivity surpasses the standard quantum limit (SQL) with increasing qubit number, reaching 3.78 in a 9-qubit configuration, compared to the SQL of 3.0. The scheme further exhibits inherent robustness to coherent control errors and probed signal noise. This work demonstrates a readily scalable path toward practical quantum sensing advantages with prevalent experimental platforms.</p>

            <p>Fluxonium qubits demonstrate exceptional potential for quantum processing; yet, realizing scalable architectures using them remains challenging. We propose a fluxonium-based square-grid design with fast $\sim63$~ns controlled-Z (CZ) gates, achieving coherent errors below $10^{-4}$, activated via microwave-driven transmon couplers. A central difficulty in such large-scale systems with all-microwave gates and, therefore, strong static couplings, is suppressing parasitic interactions that extend beyond nearest neighbors to include next-nearest elements. We address this issue by introducing several design strategies: the frequency allocation of both qubits and couplers, the localization of coupler wavefunctions, and a differential oscillator that suppresses residual long-range interactions. In addition, the architecture natively supports fast $\sim70$~ns CZZ gates -- three-qubit operations composed of two CZ gates sharing a common qubit -- which reduce the incoherent error by $\sim 35\%$ compared to performing the corresponding CZs sequentially. Together, these advances establish an interaction-resilient platform for large-scale fluxonium processors and can be adapted to a variety of fluxonium layouts.</p>

By coupling the device to cavities with different resonant frequencies, we access multiple qubit-cavity coupling regimes, enabling the observation of vacuum Rabi splitting and flux-dependent spectral linewidths. In a two-qubit device consisting of a SQUID and a single junction, power-dependent measurements reveal a two-stage dispersive shift. By flux-tuning the cavity frequency at different readout powers, we attribute the first shift to the fixed-qubit and the second to the SQUID-qubit, indicating successful coupling between the two circuits and a single cavity mode. Our study demonstrates the flexible coupling achievable between 2D-material-based superconducting circuits and 3D cavities, and paves the way toward constructing multi-qubit 3D transmon devices from 2D materials.</p>

            <p>We define and study the properties of ``squeezed quantum multiplets''. Ordinary multiplets are sets of $D$-orthonormal quantum states formed by superpositions of states squeezed along $D$ equally spaced directions in quadrature space. More generally, we also discuss superpositions of ``higher-order squeezed states'', including tri-squeezed and quad-squeezed states. All these states involve superpositions of multiples of $p$ photons. We compare states in ordinary ($p=2$) multiplets and higher-order ones ($p>2$) in the most relevant cases, showing that ordinary squeezed multiplets and higher-order ones share some important similarities, as well as some differences. Finally, we present analytical expressions for phase-space distributions (Wigner and characteristic functions) representing ordinary squeezed multiplets. We use this to show that some squeezed multiplets are highly sensitive to perturbations in all phase-space directions, making them interesting for metrological applications.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Origin of Classical Background Fields from Coherent States: A First-Principles Formulation in QED</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Keita Seto</p>
            <p>Classical background electromagnetic fields are routinely employed in quantum electrodynamics to describe a wide range of physical situations, from laser-matter interactions to strong-field phenomena. In this work, we present a first-principles formulation that clarifies the quantum origin of such classical background fields in QED by systematically deriving them from coherent states of the electromagnetic field. Abstract Starting from the operator formulation of QED, we show how scattering amplitudes between coherent states naturally lead to an effective description in terms of background fields, while maintaining a clear separation between the coherent laser mode and other quantized photon degrees of freedom. This framework allows one to consistently incorporate effects beyond the fixed background approximation, such as depletion and backreaction, without assuming any particular field strength or intensity regime. Abstract We further demonstrate how the conventional generating functional with a prescribed background field emerges as a limiting case, corresponding to fixed coherent state boundary conditions. The path integral representation is then obtained as a reformulation of the same underlying Heisenberg picture amplitudes, providing a unified view of operator-based and functional approaches. Abstract Our results establish a general and intensity-independent foundation for QED with coherent background fields, within which the standard formulations of strong-field QED arise as well-defined special cases.</p>

            <p>The $\mathbf{A}^2$ term presents a fundamental challenge to realizing the superradiant phase transition (SPT) in cavity quantum electrodynamics. Here, we propose a hybrid quantum system enabling SPT regardless of the presence of the $\mathbf{A}^2$ term. The system consist of a qubit, a mechanical mode, and an optical cavity, where the qubit and mechanical mode constitute a quantum Rabi model, while the mechanical mode and cavity form an optomechanical system. Crucially, the auxiliary cavity introduces a switchable $\mathbf{A}^2$ term that effectively counteracts or even fully eliminates the original $\mathbf{A}^2$ effect. This allows controllable observation of SPT, diagnosed via the second-order equal-time correlation function $g^{(2)}(0)$ of phonons. Furthermore, the auxiliary cavity exponentially reduces the critical coupling strength, significantly relaxing experimental requirements. In addition, we show that phonons in the normal phase display bunching, but coherent in the superradiant phase. Interestingly, higher-order squeezing is found in both phases, with near-perfect higher-order squeezing achieved at the SPT point, establishing it as a probe for SPT behavior. Our work demonstrates that hybridizing optomechanics and cavity quantum electrodynamics provides a promising route to accessing SPT physics in the presence of the $\mathbf{A}^2$ term.</p>

            <p>Strong and controllable tripartite interactions play a pivotal role in quantum information and nonlinear quantum optics, yet challenging to realize. In this work, we propose a hybrid system consisting of a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center coupled to Kerr magnons (magnons with Kerr nonlinearity) in two yttrium-iron-garnet spheres. By adiabatically eliminating the ground state of the NV qutrit in the dispersive regime, an effective tripartite interaction among magnons and an NV qubit encoded in its excited states is obtained. In the strong driving limit, Kerr magnons can be linearized and give rise to degenerate parametric amplification for squeezing magnons. As a result, both the tripartite interaction and cooperativity are exponentially enhanced twice, which is about $\exp(\xi)$ times than schemes only involving single-squeezing. Hence, our proposal is more experimentally feasible because modest squeezing parameter is sufficient. With this amplified tripartite coupling strength, the system dynamics are greatly accelerated, leading to fast generation of tripartite entanglement. In addition, noise-resilient perfect magnon blockade can be achieved, well predicted by both the analytical approach and numerical simulation with quantum master equation. Our results suggest that the NV center represents a promising interface for engineering many-body interactions in quantum magnonics, offering a versatile platform for exploring fundamental quantum phenomena such as entanglement and correlations.</p>

            <p>This paper investigates a coupled two-qubits heat engine fueled by generalized measurements of the spin components and using a single heat reservoir as sink. Our model extends the proposal of Yi and coworkers [Phys. Rev. E {\bf 96}, 022108 (2017)] where the role of a hot reservoir in a four-stroke cycle was replaced by a quantum measurement apparatus, the other steps being two quantum adiabatic strokes and thermalization with a cold reservoir. We propose a five-stroke cycle, where an ergotropy extracting stroke is introduced following the measurement stroke, and study the effect of measurements of different spin components on the performance of the machine. For measurements along z-z directions, we find two possible occupation distributions that yield an active state and the ergotropic stroke improves the performance of the engine over the four-stroke cycle. Further, the three-stroke engine ( {without the adiabatic strokes}) yields the same performance as the five-stroke engine. For arbitrary working medium and non-selective measurements, we prove that the total work output of a five-stroke engine is equal to the sum of the work outputs of the corresponding four-stroke and three-stroke engines. For measurement directions other than z-z, there may be many possible orderings of the post-measurement probabilities that yield an active state. However, as we illustrate, for specific cases (e.g. x-x), a definite ordering may be obtained with the projective measurements. Thus, we find that the five-stroke engine exploiting ergotropy outperforms both its four-stroke as well as three-stroke counterparts.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruochen Ma, Vedika Khemani, Shengqi Sang</p>
            <p>Quantum phases at zero temperature can be characterized as equivalence classes under local unitary transformations: two ground states within a gapped phase can be transformed into each other via a local unitary circuit. We generalize this circuit-based characterization of phases to systems at finite-temperature thermal equilibrium described by Gibbs states. We construct a channel circuit that approximately transforms one Gibbs state into another provided the two are connected by a path in parameter space along which a certain correlation-decay condition holds. For finite-dimensional systems of linear size $L$ and approximation error $\epsilon$, the locality of the circuit is ${\rm polylog}({\rm poly}(L)/\epsilon)$. The correlation-decay condition, which we specify, is expected to be satisfied in the interior of many noncritical thermal phases, including those displaying discrete symmetry breaking and topological order. As an application, we show that any system in the same thermal phase as a zero-temperature topological code coherently preserves quantum information for a macroscopically long time, establishing self-correction as a universal property of thermal phases. As part of the proof, we provide explicit encoding and decoding channel circuits to encode information into, and decode it from, a system in thermal equilibrium.</p>

            <p>High-dimensional entanglement offers significant advantages over low-dimensional ones in various information-processing tasks. However, to harness these advantages, it is crucial that the quantum channels used to store or transmit the subsystems of an entangled system not only preserve entanglement but also maintain its dimensionality above a certain threshold. The maximum entanglement dimension that a channel can preserve is referred to as its effective dimensionality, since the channel cannot be used to transmit information of dimension greater than that in a single use. In this work, we present a method to certify whether a quantum channel can preserve entanglement dimension above a given threshold. Unlike existing approaches, our method is faithful, i.e., it can be applied to any channel, and avoids common assumptions such as reliable preparation of entangled states, auxiliary side channels, or perfect measurement devices. Moreover, the method can be extended to faithfully certify other classes of non-resource-breaking channels, such as non-NPT-breaking channels. Finally, we discuss possible experimental realizations of our certification scheme through explicit examples.</p>

Trapped-ion architectures, with all-to-all connectivity, long coherence times, and high-fidelity mid-circuit measurement properties, presents itself as a more suitable platform for scalable QMP. We present CircPack, a hardware-aware circuit packing framework designed for modular trapped-ion devices based on the Quantum Charge-Coupled Device (QCCD) architecture. CircPack formulates static circuit scheduling as a two-dimensional packing problem with hardware-specific shuttling constraints. Compared to superconducting-based QMP approaches, CircPack achieves up to 70.72% better fidelity, 62.67% higher utilization, and 32.80% improved layer reduction. This framework is also capable of scalable, balanced scheduling across a cluster of independent QCCD modules, highlighting trapped-ion systems' potential in improving the throughput of quantum cloud computing in the near future.</p>

            <h2>Experimental Observation of Single- and Multisite Matter-Wave Solitons in an Optical Accordion Lattice</h2>

            <p>We report the experimental observation of discrete bright matter-wave solitons with attractive interaction in an optical lattice. Using an accordion lattice with adjustable spacing, we prepare a Bose-Einstein condensate of cesium atoms across a defined number of lattice sites. By quenching the interaction strength and the trapping potential, we generate both single-site and multisite solitons. Our results reveal the existence and characteristics of these solitons across a range of lattice depths and spacings. We identify stable regions of the solitons based on interaction strength and lattice properties, and compare these findings with theoretical predictions. The experimental results qualitatively agree with a Gaussian variational model and match quantitatively with numerical simulations of the three-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation extended with a quintic term to account for the loss of atoms. Our results provide insights into the quench dynamics and collapse mechanisms, paving the way for further studies of transport and dynamical properties of matter-wave solitons in lattices.</p>

            <h2>Adiabatic Electron Transfer in the Barrierless and Marcus-Inverted Regimes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ethan Abraham</p>
            <p>While the Marcus theory of electron transfer defines the reorganization energy as a classical quantity, recent work has shown for the first time that the reorganization energy is actually a quantum mechanical object that depends on the electronic coupling. We extend this picture and show that in the adiabatic limit of condensed-phase electron transfer, the onset of barrierless transition occurs at a lower driving force than predicted by the non-adiabatic Marcus formulation. Furthermore, in the adiabatic limit of the Marcus-inverted region, the standard mechanism of electron transfer becomes topologically forbidden. This behavior arises from a topological change in the mapping between the adiabatic and diabatic electronic surfaces, emerging precisely at the onset of the Marcus-inverted region. In this case, alternative mechanisms such as tunneling and non-radiative decay may dominate the rate, typically orders of magnitude slower than the rate calculated from Marcus theory.</p>

            <p>Time-dependent electromagnetic drives are fundamental for controlling complex quantum systems, including superconducting Josephson circuits. In these devices, accurate time-dependent Hamiltonian models are imperative for predicting their dynamics and designing high-fidelity quantum operations. Existing numerical methods, such as black-box quantization (BBQ) and energy-participation ratio (EPR), excel at modeling the static Hamiltonians of Josephson circuits. However, these techniques do not fully capture the behavior of driven circuits stimulated by external microwave drives, nor do they include a generalized approach to account for the inevitable noise and dissipation that enter through microwave ports. Here, we introduce novel numerical techniques that leverage classical microwave simulations that can be efficiently executed in finite element solvers, to obtain the time-dependent Hamiltonian of a microwave-driven superconducting circuit with arbitrary geometries. Importantly, our techniques do not rely on a lumped-element description of the superconducting circuit, in contrast to previous approaches to tackling this problem. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach by characterizing the driven properties of realistic circuit devices in complex electromagnetic environments, including coherent dynamics due to charge and flux modulation, as well as drive-induced relaxation and dephasing. Our techniques offer a powerful toolbox for optimizing circuit designs and advancing practical applications in superconducting quantum computing.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Universality in Composite Systems: A Trichotomy of Clifford Resources</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alejandro Borda, Julian Rincon, César Galindo</p>
            <p>The efficient classical simulation of Clifford circuits constitutes a fundamental barrier to quantum advantage, typically overcome by injecting explicit non-Clifford "magic" resources. We demonstrate that for high-dimensional quantum systems (qudits), the resources required to break this barrier are strictly governed by the number-theoretic structure of the Hilbert space dimension $d$. By analyzing the adjoint action of the Clifford group, we establish a classification of single-qudit universality as a trichotomy. (I) For prime dimensions, the Clifford group is a maximal finite subgroup, and universality is robustly achieved by any non-Clifford gate. (II) For prime-power dimensions, the group structure fragments, requiring tailored diagonal non-Clifford gates to restore irreducibility. (III) Most notably, for composite dimensions with coprime factors, we demonstrate that standard entangling operations alone -- specifically, generalized intra-qudit CNOT gates -- generate the necessary non-Clifford resources to guarantee a dense subgroup of $\mathrm{SU}(d)$ without explicit diagonal magic injection. Our proofs rely on a new geometric criterion establishing that a subgroup with irreducible adjoint action is infinite if it contains a non-scalar element with projective distance strictly less than $1/2$ from the identity. These results establish that "coprime architectures" -- hybrid registers combining subsystems with coprime dimensions -- can sustain universal computation using only classical entangling operations, rendering the explicit injection of magic resources algebraically unnecessary.</p>

            <h2>Using bosons to improve resource efficiency of quantum simulation of vibronic molecular dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Henry L. Nourse, Vanessa C. Olaya-Agudelo, Ivan Kassal</p>
            <p>Simulating chemical dynamics is computationally challenging, especially for nonadiabatic dynamics, where numerically exact classical simulations scale exponentially with system size, becoming intractable for even small molecules. On quantum computers, chemical dynamics can be simulated efficiently using either universal, qubit-only devices or specialized mixed-qudit-boson (MQB) simulators, which natively host electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom. Here, we compare the quantum resources required for a qubit-only approach to achieve the same accuracy as an MQB device at simulating nonadiabatic molecular dynamics. We find that MQB simulations require orders-of-magnitude fewer quantum operations than qubit-only simulations, with a one-gate MQB circuit requiring a qubit-equivalent circuit volume of over 400,000 when simulating an isolated molecule, which increases to over ten million when environmental effects are included. These estimates assume perfect qubits and gates, and would increase by additional orders of magnitude if error correction were used for fault tolerance. When errors are small, the advantage of MQB simulators becomes even larger as system size increases. Our results highlight the enormous resource advantages of representing non-qubit chemical degrees of freedom natively, rather than encoding them into qubits.</p>

Here, we simultaneously benchmark the electron and hole g-factors and coherence properties of a droplet epitaxy QD, solely from time and polarization resolved photon correlations. These measurements identify the hole as the preferable qubit for spin-photon entanglement in quantum network nodes. We then perform full state tomography of the confined hole ground state to reveal subtle anisotropies in the spin precession, providing essential diagnostics for minimizing phase errors critical for deterministic multiphoton entanglement generation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Minhyeok Kang, Jaehee Kim, William J. Munro, Seungbeom Chin, Joonsuk Huh</p>
            <p>Entanglement is a fundamental feature of quantum mechanics and a key resource for quantum information processing. Among multipartite entangled states, Dicke states $|D_n^k\rangle$ are distinguished by their permutation symmetry, which provides robustness against particle loss and enables applications for quantum communication and computation. Although Dicke states have been realized in various platforms, most optical implementations rely on postselection, which destroys the state upon detection and prevents its further use. A heralded optical scheme is therefore highly desirable. Here, we present a linear-optical heralded scheme for generating arbitrary Dicke states $|D_n^k\rangle$ with $3n+k$ photons through the framework of the linear quantum graph (LQG) picture. By mapping the scheme design into the graph-finding problem, and exploiting the permutation symmetry of Dicke states, we overcome the structural complexity that has hindered previous approaches. Our results provide a resource-efficient pathway toward practical heralded preparation of Dicke states for quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>Numerical exploration of large-size real biological systems requires computational power far exceeding that of modern classical computers. In computational molecular science, calculation of long-range electrostatic interactions between charged atoms - the strongest interactions in condensed phases, is a major bottleneck. Here, we propose a quantum algorithm for fast yet accurate computation of Coulomb electrostatic energy for a system of point charges. The algorithm employs the Ewald method based decomposition of electrostatic energy E into several energy terms, of which "the Fourier component" of E is computed in the algorithm proposed on a quantum device, utilizing the power of Quantum Fourier Transform. We demonstrate the algorithm's quantum advantage for a range of systems of point charges in the three-dimensional space when the number of charges (system size) N exceeds the number of grid points M, and show that the numerical error is rather small <0.1%. The algorithm can be implemented in running the all-atom Molecular Dynamics simulations on a quantum computer, thereby expanding the scope of applications of QFT methods in computational physics, chemistry, and biology.</p>

The transmon qubit is then introduced as a state-of-the-art application, with a detailed derivation of its Hamiltonian and its interaction with control and readout circuitry. The theoretical formalism is consolidated through a numerical simulation of vacuum Rabi oscillations in a driven transmon-resonator system, a canonical experiment that demonstrates the coherent energy exchange characteristic of the strong coupling regime.

            <p>The capability to control molecular rotation for field-free orientation, which arranges molecules in specific spatial directions without external fields, is crucial in physics, chemistry, and quantum information science. However, conventional methods typically lead to transient orientations characterized by periodic directional reversals and necessitate the generation of coherent superpositions across a broad spectrum of rotational states of ultracold molecules. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework for achieving unidirectional field-free orientation by selectively manipulating two specific rotational states of symmetric top molecules. By leveraging the interplay between coherent superpositions and the precise selection of initial states, we demonstrate that both the maximum achievable orientation and its direction can be effectively controlled. To attain the desired two-state orientation, we present a quantum control strategy that utilizes a single control pulse, significantly simplifying the complexities of conventional multistate or multipulse schemes. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness and feasibility of this approach for methyl iodide (CH$_3$I) molecules, even when accounting for molecular centrifugal this http URL results highlight the critical roles of initial-state selection and quantum coherence in achieving long-lasting, high unidirectional molecular orientation, opening new directions in stereochemistry, precision spectroscopy, and quantum computing.</p>

            <p>Quantum sensing promises measurement precision beyond classical limits, but its practical realization is often hindered by decoherence and the challenges of generating and stabilizing entanglement in large-scale systems. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a scalable, scrambling-enhanced quantum sensing protocol, referred to as butterfly metrology, implemented on a cross-shaped superconducting quantum processor. By harnessing quantum information scrambling, the protocol converts local interactions into delocalized metrologically useful correlations, enabling robust signal amplification through interference of the scrambled and polarized quantum states. We validate the time-reversal ability via Loschmidt echo measurements and quantify the information scrambling through out-of-time-ordered correlators, establishing the essential quantum resources of our protocol. Our measurements reveal that the sensing sensitivity surpasses the standard quantum limit (SQL) with increasing qubit number, reaching 3.78 in a 9-qubit configuration, compared to the SQL of 3.0. The scheme further exhibits inherent robustness to coherent control errors and probed signal noise. This work demonstrates a readily scalable path toward practical quantum sensing advantages with prevalent experimental platforms.</p>

            <p>Fluxonium qubits demonstrate exceptional potential for quantum processing; yet, realizing scalable architectures using them remains challenging. We propose a fluxonium-based square-grid design with fast $\sim63$~ns controlled-Z (CZ) gates, achieving coherent errors below $10^{-4}$, activated via microwave-driven transmon couplers. A central difficulty in such large-scale systems with all-microwave gates and, therefore, strong static couplings, is suppressing parasitic interactions that extend beyond nearest neighbors to include next-nearest elements. We address this issue by introducing several design strategies: the frequency allocation of both qubits and couplers, the localization of coupler wavefunctions, and a differential oscillator that suppresses residual long-range interactions. In addition, the architecture natively supports fast $\sim70$~ns CZZ gates -- three-qubit operations composed of two CZ gates sharing a common qubit -- which reduce the incoherent error by $\sim 35\%$ compared to performing the corresponding CZs sequentially. Together, these advances establish an interaction-resilient platform for large-scale fluxonium processors and can be adapted to a variety of fluxonium layouts.</p>

By coupling the device to cavities with different resonant frequencies, we access multiple qubit-cavity coupling regimes, enabling the observation of vacuum Rabi splitting and flux-dependent spectral linewidths. In a two-qubit device consisting of a SQUID and a single junction, power-dependent measurements reveal a two-stage dispersive shift. By flux-tuning the cavity frequency at different readout powers, we attribute the first shift to the fixed-qubit and the second to the SQUID-qubit, indicating successful coupling between the two circuits and a single cavity mode. Our study demonstrates the flexible coupling achievable between 2D-material-based superconducting circuits and 3D cavities, and paves the way toward constructing multi-qubit 3D transmon devices from 2D materials.</p>

            <p>We define and study the properties of ``squeezed quantum multiplets''. Ordinary multiplets are sets of $D$-orthonormal quantum states formed by superpositions of states squeezed along $D$ equally spaced directions in quadrature space.

All these states involve superpositions of multiples of $p$ photons. We compare states in ordinary ($p=2$) multiplets and higher-order ones ($p>2$) in the most relevant cases, showing that ordinary squeezed multiplets and higher-order ones share some important similarities, as well as some differences. Finally, we present analytical expressions for phase-space distributions (Wigner and characteristic functions) representing ordinary squeezed multiplets. We use this to show that some squeezed multiplets are highly sensitive to perturbations in all phase-space directions, making them interesting for metrological applications.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Origin of Classical Background Fields from Coherent States: A First-Principles Formulation in QED</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Keita Seto</p>
            <p>Classical background electromagnetic fields are routinely employed in quantum electrodynamics to describe a wide range of physical situations, from laser-matter interactions to strong-field phenomena. In this work, we present a first-principles formulation that clarifies the quantum origin of such classical background fields in QED by systematically deriving them from coherent states of the electromagnetic field. Abstract Starting from the operator formulation of QED, we show how scattering amplitudes between coherent states naturally lead to an effective description in terms of background fields, while maintaining a clear separation between the coherent laser mode and other quantized photon degrees of freedom. This framework allows one to consistently incorporate effects beyond the fixed background approximation, such as depletion and backreaction, without assuming any particular field strength or intensity regime. Abstract We further demonstrate how the conventional generating functional with a prescribed background field emerges as a limiting case, corresponding to fixed coherent state boundary conditions. The path integral representation is then obtained as a reformulation of the same underlying Heisenberg picture amplitudes, providing a unified view of operator-based and functional approaches. Abstract Our results establish a general and intensity-independent foundation for QED with coherent background fields, within which the standard formulations of strong-field QED arise as well-defined special cases.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gang Liu, Wei Xiong</p>
            <p>The $\mathbf{A}^2$ term presents a fundamental challenge to realizing the superradiant phase transition (SPT) in cavity quantum electrodynamics. Here, we propose a hybrid quantum system enabling SPT regardless of the presence of the $\mathbf{A}^2$ term. The system consist of a qubit, a mechanical mode, and an optical cavity, where the qubit and mechanical mode constitute a quantum Rabi model, while the mechanical mode and cavity form an optomechanical system. Crucially, the auxiliary cavity introduces a switchable $\mathbf{A}^2$ term that effectively counteracts or even fully eliminates the original $\mathbf{A}^2$ effect. This allows controllable observation of SPT, diagnosed via the second-order equal-time correlation function $g^{(2)}(0)$ of phonons. Furthermore, the auxiliary cavity exponentially reduces the critical coupling strength, significantly relaxing experimental requirements. In addition, we show that phonons in the normal phase display bunching, but coherent in the superradiant phase. Interestingly, higher-order squeezing is found in both phases, with near-perfect higher-order squeezing achieved at the SPT point, establishing it as a probe for SPT behavior. Our work demonstrates that hybridizing optomechanics and cavity quantum electrodynamics provides a promising route to accessing SPT physics in the presence of the $\mathbf{A}^2$ term.</p>

            <p>Strong and controllable tripartite interactions play a pivotal role in quantum information and nonlinear quantum optics, yet challenging to realize. In this work, we propose a hybrid system consisting of a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center coupled to Kerr magnons (magnons with Kerr nonlinearity) in two yttrium-iron-garnet spheres. By adiabatically eliminating the ground state of the NV qutrit in the dispersive regime, an effective tripartite interaction among magnons and an NV qubit encoded in its excited states is obtained. In the strong driving limit, Kerr magnons can be linearized and give rise to degenerate parametric amplification for squeezing magnons. As a result, both the tripartite interaction and cooperativity are exponentially enhanced twice, which is about $\exp(\xi)$ times than schemes only involving single-squeezing. Hence, our proposal is more experimentally feasible because modest squeezing parameter is sufficient. With this amplified tripartite coupling strength, the system dynamics are greatly accelerated, leading to fast generation of tripartite entanglement. In addition, noise-resilient perfect magnon blockade can be achieved, well predicted by both the analytical approach and numerical simulation with quantum master equation. Our results suggest that the NV center represents a promising interface for engineering many-body interactions in quantum magnonics, offering a versatile platform for exploring fundamental quantum phenomena such as entanglement and correlations.</p>

            <p>This paper investigates a coupled two-qubits heat engine fueled by generalized measurements of the spin components and using a single heat reservoir as sink. Our model extends the proposal of Yi and coworkers [Phys. Rev. E {\bf 96}, 022108 (2017)] where the role of a hot reservoir in a four-stroke cycle was replaced by a quantum measurement apparatus, the other steps being two quantum adiabatic strokes and thermalization with a cold reservoir. We propose a five-stroke cycle, where an ergotropy extracting stroke is introduced following the measurement stroke, and study the effect of measurements of different spin components on the performance of the machine. For measurements along z-z directions, we find two possible occupation distributions that yield an active state and the ergotropic stroke improves the performance of the engine over the four-stroke cycle. Further, the three-stroke engine ( {without the adiabatic strokes}) yields the same performance as the five-stroke engine. For arbitrary working medium and non-selective measurements, we prove that the total work output of a five-stroke engine is equal to the sum of the work outputs of the corresponding four-stroke and three-stroke engines. For measurement directions other than z-z, there may be many possible orderings of the post-measurement probabilities that yield an active state. However, as we illustrate, for specific cases (e.g. x-x), a definite ordering may be obtained with the projective measurements. Thus, we find that the five-stroke engine exploiting ergotropy outperforms both its four-stroke as well as three-stroke counterparts.</p>

            <p>Critical edge states appear at the bulk gap closing points of topological transitions. Their emergence signify the existence of topologically nontrivial critical points, whose descriptions fall outside the scope of gapped topological matter. In this work, we reveal and characterize topological critical points and critical edge states in non-Hermitian systems. By applying the Cauchy's argument principle to two characteristic functions of a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, we obtain a pair of winding numbers, whose combination yields a complete description of gapped and gapless topological phases in one-dimensional, two-band non-Hermitian systems with sublattice symmetry. Focusing on a broad class of non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains, we demonstrate the applicability of our theory for characterizing gapless symmetry-protected topological phases, topologically distinct critical points, phase transitions along non-Hermitian phase boundaries and their associated topological edge modes. Our findings not only generalize the concepts of topologically nontrivial critical points and critical edge modes to non-Hermitian setups, but also yield additional insights for analyzing topological transitions and bulk-edge correspondence in open systems.</p>

We extend this picture and show that in the adiabatic limit of condensed-phase electron transfer, the onset of barrierless transition occurs at a lower driving force than predicted by the non-adiabatic Marcus formulation. Furthermore, in the adiabatic limit of the Marcus-inverted region, the standard mechanism of electron transfer becomes topologically forbidden. This behavior arises from a topological change in the mapping between the adiabatic and diabatic electronic surfaces, emerging precisely at the onset of the Marcus-inverted region. In this case, alternative mechanisms such as tunneling and non-radiative decay may dominate the rate, typically orders of magnitude slower than the rate calculated from Marcus theory.</p>

            <p>Spin squeezed entanglement enables metrological precision beyond the classical limit. Understood through the lens of continuous symmetry breaking, dipolar spin systems exhibit the remarkable ability to generate spin squeezing via their intrinsic quench dynamics. To date, this understanding has primarily focused on lattice spin systems; in practice however, dipolar spin systems$\unicode{x2014}$ranging from ultracold molecules to nuclear spin ensembles and solid-state color centers$\unicode{x2014}$often exhibit significant amounts of positional disorder. Here, we develop a theory for scalable spin squeezing in a two-dimensional randomly diluted lattice of quantum dipoles, which naturally realize a dipolar XXZ model. Via extensive quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we map out the phase diagram for finite-temperature XY order, and by extension scalable spin squeezing, as a function of both disorder and Ising anisotropy. As the disorder increases, we find that scalable spin squeezing survives only near the Heisenberg point. We show that this behavior is due to the presence of rare tightly-coupled dimers, which effectively heat the system post-quench. In the case of strongly-interacting nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, we demonstrate that an experimentally feasible strategy to decouple the problematic dimers from the dynamics is sufficient to enable scalable spin squeezing.</p>

            <h2>Learning transitions of topological surface codes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Finn Eckstein, Bo Han, Simon Trebst, Guo-Yi Zhu</p>
            <p>For the surface code, topological quantum order allows one to encode logical quantum information in a robust, long-range entangled many-body quantum state. However, if an observer probes this quantum state by performing measurements on the underlying qubits, thereby collecting an ensemble of highly correlated classical snapshots, two closely related questions arise: (i) do measurements decohere the topological order of the quantum state; and (ii) how much of the logical information can one learn from the snapshots? Here we address these questions for measurements in a uniform basis on all qubits. We find that for generic measurement angles, sufficiently far away from the Clifford X, Y, and Z directions (such as the X+Y+Z basis) the logical information is never lost in one of the following two ways: (i) for weak measurement, the topological order is absolutely robust; (ii) for projective measurement, the quantum state inevitably collapses, but the logical quantum information is faithfully transferred from the quantum system to the observer in the form of a tomographically complete classical shadow. At these generic measurement angles and in the projective-measurement limit, the measurement ensemble enforced by Born probabilities can be represented by a 2D tensor network that can be fermionized into a disordered, free-fermion network model in symmetry class DIII, which gives rise to a Majorana "metal" phase. When the measurement angle is biased towards the X or Z limits, a critical angle indicates the threshold of a learning transition beyond which the classical shadow no longer reveals full tomographic information (but reduces to a measurement of the logical X or Z state). This learning transition can be described in the language of the network model as a "metal to insulator" transition...</p>

            <p>Neutral atom arrays have emerged as a powerful platform for quantum computation, simulation, and metrology. Among them, alkaline-earth-like atoms exhibit distinct advantages, including long coherence time and high-fidelity Rydberg gates. However, their scalability has lagged behind that of the alkali atoms. Here, we report 2,400 Ytterbium-174 atoms trapped in an optical tweezer array with enhanced single-atom loading efficiency of 83.5(1)%. Notably, the loading efficiency is largely maintained for array sizes ranging from dozens to thousands, exhibiting excellent scalability. We demonstrate the broad applicability of the enhanced loading method by showing that the enhancement exists robustly across a range of interatomic potentials, suggesting its utility for other atomic species. To establish the capability of the 174Yb arrays toward universal quantum computation, we propose to encode the qubit in the ground-clock state manifold and estimate a 99.9% two-qubit gate fidelity with experimentally feasible parameters. Our work advances the prospects for realizing large-scale quantum computers using alkaline-earth-like atoms.</p>

            <p>This article presents an analysis of the practical challenges and implementation perspectives of point-to-point continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) systems over optical fiber. The study addresses the physical layer, including the design of transmitters, quantum channels, and receivers, with emphasis on impairments such as attenuation, chromatic dispersion, polarization fluctuations, and coexistence with classical channels. We further examine the role of digital signal processing (DSP) as the bridge between quantum state transmission and classical post-processing, highlighting its impact on excess noise mitigation, covariance matrix estimation, and reconciliation efficiency. The post-processing pipeline is detailed with a focus on parameter estimation in the finite-size regime, information reconciliation using LDPC-based codes optimized for low-SNR conditions, and privacy amplification employing large-block universal hashing. From a hardware perspective, we discuss modular digital architectures that integrate dedicated accelerators with programmable processors, supported by a reference software framework (CV-QKD-ModSim) for algorithm validation and hardware co-design. Finally, we outline perspectives for the deployment of CV-QKD in Brazil, starting from metropolitan testbeds and extending toward hybrid fiber/FSO and space-based infrastructures. The work establishes the foundations for the first point-to-point CV-QKD system in Brazil, while providing a roadmap for scalable and interoperable quantum communication networks.</p>

            <h2>Dissipative quantum algorithms for excited-state quantum chemistry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hao-En Li, Lin Lin</p>
            <p>Electronic excited states are central to a vast array of physical and chemical phenomena, yet accurate and efficient methods for preparing them on quantum devices remain challenging and comparatively underexplored. We introduce a general dissipative algorithm for selectively preparing ab initio electronic excited states. The key idea is to recast excited-state preparation as an effective ground-state problem by suitably modifying the underlying Lindblad dynamics so that the target excited state becomes the unique steady state of a designed quantum channel. We develop three complementary strategies, tailored to different types of prior information about the excited state, such as symmetry and approximate energy. We demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of these schemes through numerical simulations of atomic and molecular spectra, including valence excitations in prototypical planar conjugated molecules and transition-metal complexes. Taken together, these results provide a new pathway for advancing quantum simulation methods for realistic strongly correlated electronic systems.</p>

            <h2>Gate-Based Microwave Quantum Repeater Via Grid-State Encoding</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hany Khalifa, Matti Silveri</p>
            <p>In autonomous quantum error correction the lifetime of a logical bosonic qubit can be extended beyond its physical constituents without feedback measurements. Leveraging autonomous error correction, we propose a second-generation gate-based microwave quantum repeater (GBMQR) with encoded bosonic grid states. Each repeater station comprises a transmon and two bosonic resonators: one resonator serving as a stationary quantum memory utilizing autonomous error correction, and the other as an information bus for entanglement generation. Entanglement is generated sequentially through the successful absorption of a microwave photon wavepacket. This method enables deterministic entanglement generation, in contrast to a probabilistic mixing of two heralding signals on a balanced beamsplitter. Furthermore, our GBMQR employs an all-bosonic entanglement swapping Bell-state measurement. This is implemented via a bosonic controlled-Z gate and two separate X-basis projective homodyne measurements on the stationary stored codewords. Our approach circumvents mode-mismatch losses associated with routing and interfering of heralding modes on a beamsplitter, and confines losses to those arising from stationary storage. We evaluate the performance of the proposed quantum repeater by calculating its secret key rate under realistic lab environments. Moreover, we explicitly demonstrate that at stationary damping rate of $\kappa^{-1}_{\text{damp}}=$~\SI{40}{\milli\second}, GBMQR can achieve entanglement generation and swapping success probabilities approx.~$0.75$, and $0.58$ respectively, surpassing the hallmark success probability of $1/2$ set by ideal linear beamsplitter-based Bell-state measurements. The proposed device can be implemented using currently available superconducting microwave technology and is suited for secure chip-to-chip communication and distributed quantum computing.</p>

            <h2>Force Sensing Beyond the Standard Quantum Limit in a Hybrid Optomechanical Platform</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alolika Roy, Amarendra K. Sarma</p>
            <p>We theoretically investigate quantum measurement noise in a hybrid optomechanical system, focusing on radiation pressure back action and its impact on force sensing. The setup consists of an optomechanical cavity with a movable mirror, a fixed semi transparent mirror, an ensemble of quantum dots (QD) coupled to the cavity mode, and an intracavity optical parametric amplifier (OPA). We show how the QD induced response, together with the system nonlinearity, modifies the noise spectral density and thereby improves the force measurement sensitivity. In this setup, coherent quantum noise cancellation (CQNC) can completely remove the back action noise. In addition, increasing the OPA pump gain enables sensitivity beyond the standard quantum limit (SQL) at reduced laser power. These combined effects allow weak force sensing beyond the SQL.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zeyu Kuang, Oliver Diekmann, Lorenz Fischer, Stefan Rotter, Carlos Gonzalez-Ballestero</p>
            <p>High-fidelity state transfer is fundamentally limited by time-reversal symmetry: one qubit emits a photon with a certain temporal pulse shape, whereas a second qubit requires the time-reversed pulse shape to efficiently absorb this photon. This limit is often overcome by introducing active elements. Here, we propose an alternative solution: by tailoring the dispersion relation of a waveguide, the photon pulse emitted by one qubit is passively reshaped into its time-reversed counterpart, thus enabling perfect absorption. We analytically derive the optimal dispersion relations in the limit of small and large qubit-qubit separations, and numerically extend our results to arbitrary separations via multiparameter optimization. We further propose a spatially inhomogeneous waveguide that renders the state transfer robust to variations in qubit separations. In all cases, we obtain near-unity transfer fidelity (>= 98%). Our dispersion-engineered waveguide provides a compact and passive route toward on-chip quantum networks, highlighting engineered dispersion as a powerful resource in waveguide quantum electrodynamics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yong-Xin Zhang, Qing-Hu Chen</p>
            <p>This work studies a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric non-Hermitian spin--boson model, consisting of a non-Hermitian two-level system coupled to a continuous bosonic bath. The static properties of the system are analyzed through a projection method derived from the displacement operator. We find that only a single exceptional point (EP) emerges, in contrast to non-Hermitian spin--boson models with finite modes, which typically exhibit multiple EPs. Notably, only a single real eigenvalue is found before the EP, which differs markedly from typical non-Hermitian systems where a pair of real eigenvalues precedes the EP. The time evolution of observables is further investigated via the Dirac--Frenkel time-dependent variational principle. Compared to its Hermitian counterpart, the non-Hermitian model exhibits distinct dynamical signatures, most notably the emergence of oscillations with periodic amplified amplitude. In the $\mathcal{PT}$-unbroken phase, the system exhibits sustained oscillatory dynamics with suppressed decoherence, whereas in the $\mathcal{PT}$-broken phase, additional dissipative channels accelerate decoherence and drive rapid convergence toward a stable steady state. These results shed light on how $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry protects coherent light--matter interactions in non-Hermitian quantum systems.</p>

            <p>We identify an unconventional form of the non-Hermitian skin effect that occurs not in position space but in many-body Fock space, which we call the Fock space skin effect (FSSE). Using quantum dimer models, we characterize FSSE analytically and numerically, and propose a concrete route toward its realization in Rydberg atom arrays. The dimer constraint is enforced through Rydberg gadgets employing the blockade mechanism, while directional reservoirs generate non-Hermitian flipping amplitudes. We show that FSSE enables the preparation of gapped spin liquid states, and in particular, we demonstrate how a Rydberg geometry realizing a square lattice quantum dimer model with next-nearest neighbor dimers can be driven by non-Hermiticity into an exact spin liquid ground state. Our results establish Fock-space non-Hermiticity as a powerful principle for engineering exotic quantum phases and dynamical state-preparation protocols.</p>

We show that, if the chain is zigzag-shaped, different topological phases can be realized by adjusting the polarization direction. It turns out that long-range dipole-dipole couplings weaken the bulk-boundary correspondence, but on the other hand give rise to higher-order topological phases with four observable edge modes. We also demonstrate how the polarization orientation can be used to define an additional dimension and simulate a synthetic Chern insulator.

            <p>Optical Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) offers the potential for unprecedented angular resolution in both astronomical imaging and precision measurements. Classical approaches, however, face significant limitations due to photon loss, background noise, and the requirements for dynamical delay lines over large distances. This document surveys recent developments in quantum-enabled VLBI, which aim to address these challenges using entanglement-assisted protocols, quantum memory storage, and nonlocal measurement techniques. While its application to astronomy is well known, we also examine how these techniques may be extended to geodesy -- specifically, the monitoring of Earth's rotation. Particular attention is given to quantum-enhanced telescope architectures, including repeater-based long baseline interferometry and quantum error-corrected encoding schemes, which offer a pathway toward high-fidelity optical VLBI. To aid the discussion, we also compare specifications for key enabling technologies to current state-of-the-art experimental components, including switching rates, gate times, entanglement distribution rates, and memory lifetimes. By integrating quantum technologies, future interferometric networks may achieve diffraction-limited imaging at optical and near-infrared wavelengths, surpassing the constraints of classical techniques and enabling new precision tests of astrophysical and fundamental physics phenomena.</p>

            <h2>On the excitability of two-level atoms by spectrally encoded single-photon wave packets in quantum networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hamid Reza Naeij</p>
            <p>We analyze the time-dependent interaction between a two-level atom and a spectrally encoded single-photon wave packet using the Heisenberg-Langevin equations and derive the atomic excitation probability. Spectral phase encoding broadens the photon wave packet in the time domain and reduces its peak intensity, leading to markedly weaker atomic excitation than for an unencoded photon. We formalize this behavior via an overlap bound with the time-reversed spontaneous emission mode and show how excitation depends on code length, bandwidth, and phase errors. Interpreted at the quantum network level, atoms behave as phase-sensitive, and mode-selective receivers whose response scales with a spectral-overlap functional that captures decoding fidelity, detuning, and multiuser interference. From this, we extract design rules and performance bounds for encoded links, quantifying trade-offs among code length, addressability, cross-talk, and identifying tolerances for decoding error. These results clarify how spectrally encoded photons couple to quantum nodes and provide guidelines for efficient, scalable, and secure quantum networking.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hayato Goto, Ryo Hidaka, Kosuke Tatsumura</p>
            <p>Nonlinear dynamical systems with continuous variables can be used for solving combinatorial optimization problems with discrete variables. Numerical simulations of them are also useful as heuristic algorithms with a desirable property, namely, parallelizability, which allows us to execute them in a massively parallel manner, leading to ultrafast performance. However, the dynamical-system approaches with continuous variables are usually less accurate than conventional approaches with discrete variables such as simulated annealing. To improve the solution accuracy of a quantum-inspired algorithm called simulated bifurcation (SB), which was found from classical simulation of a quantum nonlinear oscillator network exhibiting quantum bifurcation, here we generalize it by introducing nonlinear control of individual bifurcation parameters and show that the generalized SB (GSB) can achieve surprisingly high performance, namely, almost 100% success probabilities for some large-scale problems. As a result, the time to solution for a 2,000-variable problem is shortened to 10 ms by a GSB-based machine, which is two orders of magnitude shorter than the best known value, 1.3 s, previously obtained by an SB-based machine. To examine the reason for the ultrahigh performance, we investigated chaos in the GSB changing the nonlinear-control strength and found that the dramatic increase of success probabilities happens near the edge of chaos. That is, the GSB can find a solution with high probability by harnessing the edge of chaos. This finding suggests that dynamical-system approaches to combinatorial optimization will be enhanced by harnessing the edge of chaos, opening a broad possibility to tackle intractable combinatorial optimization problems by physics-inspired approaches.</p>

            <p>Defects in atomically thin van der Waals materials have recently been investigated as sources of spin-photon entanglement with sensitivity to strain tuning. Unlike many two-dimensional materials, quasi-one-dimensional materials such as transition metal trichalcogenides exhibit in-plane anisotropy resulting in axis-dependent responses to compressive and tensile strains. Herein, we characterize the tunable spin and optical properties of intrinsic vacancy defects in titanium trisulfide (TiS3) and niobium trisulfide (NbS3) nanowires. Within our ab initio approach, we show that sulfur vacancies and divacancies (VS and VD , respectively) in TiS3 and NbS3 adopt strain-dependent defect geometries between in-plane strains of -3 % and 3 %. The calculated electronic structures indicate that both VS and VD possess in-gap defect states with optically bright electronic transitions whose position relative to the conduction and valence bands varies with in-plane strain. Further, our calculations predict that VS in TiS3 and VD in NbS3 exhibit transitions in their ground state spins; specifically, a compressive strain of 0.4 % along the direction of nanowire growth causes a shift from a triplet state to a singlet state for the VS defect in TiS3, whereas a tensile strain of 2.9 % along the same direction in NbS3 induces a triplet ground state with a zero-phonon line of 0.83 eV in the VD defect. Our work shows that the anisotropic geometry of TiS3 and NbS3 nanowires offers exceptional tunability of optically active spin defects that can be used in quantum applications.</p>

            <p>We introduce a quantum algorithm to perform the Laplace transform on quantum computers. Already, the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) is the cornerstone of many quantum algorithms, but the Laplace transform or its discrete version has not seen any efficient implementation on quantum computers due to its dissipative nature and hence non-unitary dynamics. However, a recent work has shown an efficient implementation for certain cases on quantum computers using the Taylor series. Unlike previous work, our work provides a completely different algorithm for doing Laplace Transform using Quantum Eigenvalue Transformation and Lap-LCHS, very efficiently at points which form an arithmetic progression. Our algorithm can implement $N \times N$ discrete Laplace transform in gate complexity that grows as $O((log\,N)^3)$, ignoring the state preparation cost, where $N=2^n$ and $n$ is the number of qubits, which is a superpolynomial speedup in number of gates over the best classical counterpart that has complexity $O(N\cdot log\,N)$ for the same cases. Also, the circuit width grows as $O(log\,N)$. Quantum Laplace Transform (QLT) may enable new Quantum algorithms for cases like solving differential equations in the Laplace domain, developing an inverse Laplace transform algorithm on quantum computers, imaginary time evolution in the resolvent domain for calculating ground state energy, and spectral estimation of non-Hermitian matrices.</p>

            <p>Floquet codes have recently emerged as a new family of error-correcting codes, and have drawn significant interest across both theoretical and practical quantum computing. A central open question has been how to implement logical operations on these codes. In this work, we show how two techniques from static quantum error-correcting codes can also be implemented on Floquet codes. First, we present a way of implementing fold-transversal operations on Floquet codes in order to yield logical Hadamard and S gates. And second, we present a way of implementing logical CNOT gates on Floquet codes via Dehn twists. We discuss the requirements for these techniques, and show that they are applicable to a wide family of Floquet codes defined on colour code lattices. Through numerical benchmarking of the logical operations on the CCS Floquet code, we establish a logical-gate threshold of 0.25-0.35% and verify sub-threshold exponential error suppression. Our results show that these logical operations are robust, featuring a performance that is close to the baseline set by a quantum memory benchmark. Finally, we explain in detail how to implement logical gates on Floquet codes by operating on the embedded codes.</p>

Furthermore, we investigate the impact of both the Unruh temperature and the energy levels on three key quantum phenomena: thermodynamic evolution, quantum correlations, and quantum coherence, considering different initial state preparations. The hierarchical structure relating quantum correlations and quantum coherence is determined. We further examine the thermodynamic performance of a quantum heat engine, highlighting the influence of memory effects and classical correlations on heat exchange, work extraction, and efficiency. Our results reveal that non-Markovian dynamics can enhance the preservation of quantum correlations and improve the engine's efficiency compared to purely Markovian regime.

            <p>Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms have begun to leverage quantum devices to efficiently represent many-electron wavefunctions, enabling early demonstrations of molecular simulations on real hardware. A key prerequisite for scalable quantum chemistry, however, is size consistency: the energy of non-interacting subsystems must scale linearly with system size. While many algorithms are theoretically size-consistent, noise on quantum devices may couple nominally independent subsystems and degrade this fundamental property. Here, we systematically evaluate size consistency on quantum hardware by simulating systems composed of increasing numbers of non-interacting H$_{2}$ molecules using optimally shallow unitary circuits. We find that molecular energies remain size-consistent within chemical accuracy for an estimated 118 and 71 H$_{2}$ subsystems for one- and two-qubit unitary designs, respectively, demonstrating that current quantum devices preserve size consistency over chemically relevant system sizes and supporting the feasibility of scalable, noise-resilient simulation of strongly correlated molecules and materials.</p>

            <p>Photonic multidimensional quantum networks (MDQN), where individual subsystems are encoded using multiple degrees of freedom and photons, are an emerging platform for quantum algorithms because they offer high scalability. The distribution of non-classical and non-local correlations between the individual subsystems in an MDQN is of fundamental interest for many quantum protocols. Interestingly in an MDQN, the inseparability of two subsystems underlying entanglement can occur both between multiple distinct photons as well as between individual degrees of freedom associated with a single photon. In this work, we investigate the entanglement transfer enabled by the interplay of both entanglement between two distinct photons as well as inseparability between multiple degrees of freedom. For this purpose, we subject one photon of a polarization entangled two-photon pair to a discrete-time quantum walk introducing the position subsystem of the quantum walk as a third subsystem with qudit encoding. Here we study the resulting transfer of entanglement from the polarization degree of freedom, representing qubit encoding, towards the position degree of freedom, representing quidt encoding, via partial state tomography and correlation measurements.</p>

From a statistical point of view, the probabilistic description of particle motion provides a middle ground for transitioning from classical to quantum mechanics. An action functional obtained by coupling a Fisher information term produces a parametrically equivalent form of the de Broglie Bohm dBB equations. Next, we show that generalized Euler Lagrange equations can provide analytical solutions of dBB equations for certain simple stationary systems. One- and two-dimensional examples are provided to illustrate the similarities and differences between regular QM and the wave functions obtained from our generalization. To retain the generality of the method, we do not use hbar apriori but instead introduce a parametric information-error coupling term, mu.

            <h2>Toward Live Noise Fingerprinting in Quantum Software Engineering</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Avner Bensoussan, Elena Chachkarova, Karine Even-Mendoza, Sophie Fortz, Vasileios Klimis</p>
            <p>Noise is a major bottleneck in today's quantum computing, stemming from decoherence, gate imperfections and other hardware limitations. Accurate noise fingerprints are essential, yet undocumented noise model differences between Quantum Ecosystems undermine core functionality, such as compilation, development and debugging, offering limited transferability and support for quantum software engineering (QSE) tasks. We propose a new research direction: live empirical noise fingerprinting as a lightweight QSE-oriented "noise fingerprinting". Though explored in physics as device-level diagnostics, we reposition them as a QSE paradigm: we propose leveraging classical shadow tomography to enable a new generation of techniques. As a first step, we introduce SimShadow, which prepares reference states, applies shadow-tomography-inspired estimation and constructs deviation fingerprints. Initial experiments uncover systematic discrepancies between platforms (e.g. Frobenius distances up to 7.39) at up to 2.5x10^6 lower cost than traditional methods. SimShadow opens new directions for noise-aware compilation, transpilation, cross-platform validation, error mitigation, and formal methods in QSE.</p>

            <h2>Long-distance quantum communication sending single photons and keeping many</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stefan Häussler, Peter van Loock</p>
            <p>Fiber-based classical communication is all-optical and uses light pulses reamplified and reshaped every 50-100 km in classical repeaters. Most compatible with this would be a quantum communication system which is also all-optical with quantum processing units placed in similar intervals. However, existing all-optical quantum communication protocols either require complicated quantum error correction steps for logical-qubit recoveries at every few kilometers or, over larger quantum repeater segments, they would at least depend on sharing complex multi-photon entangled states. Here we propose an all-optical memory-based quantum repeater for long-distance quantum communication, with quantum memories at each repeater station realized in the form of fiber loops combined with suitable quantum error correction codes for photon-loss protection. By sending only single-photon states through the fibers connecting the stations, such repeaters can operate in the classical infrastructure's long-segment regime. We analyze the performance of our scheme for the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill code, including a concatenation with the Steane code, as well as the single-photon quantum parity code for total distances up to 10000 km.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shuo Liu, Shao-Kai Jian, Shi-Xin Zhang</p>
            <p>Noisy monitored quantum circuits have emerged as a versatile and unifying framework connecting quantum many-body physics, quantum information, and quantum computation. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of recent advances in understanding the dynamics of such circuits, with an emphasis on their entanglement structure, information-protection capabilities, and noise-induced phase transitions. A central theme is the mapping to classical statistical models, which reveals how quantum noise reshapes dominant spin configurations. This framework elucidates universal scaling behaviors, including the characteristic $q^{-1/3}$ entanglement scaling with noise probability $q$ and distinct timescales for information protection. We further highlight a broad range of constructions and applications inspired by noisy monitored circuits, spanning variational quantum algorithms, classical simulation methods, mixed-state phases of matter, and emerging approaches to quantum error mitigation and quantum error correction. These developments collectively establish noisy monitored circuits as a powerful platform for probing and controlling quantum dynamics in realistic, decohering environments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaoting Gao, Yan Zhu, Feng-Xiao Sun, Ya-Dong Wu, Qiongyi He</p>
            <p>Machine learning methods have been used to infer specific properties of limited families of optical quantum states, but a unified model that predicts a broad range of properties for practically relevant-especially multimode non-Gaussian-states without full tomography is still lacking. Here we introduce the first foundation model for the characterization of optical quantum states across a wide range of complexity, defined by three key factors: non-Gaussianity, number of modes, and degree of squeezing. We show that a single model pretrained on low-complexity states can be directly applied to characterize states of higher complexity. With limited fine-tuning, the model adapts to downstream tasks such as predicting quantum fidelity and Wigner negativity over a broad class of experimentally relevant states, including strongly non-Gaussian Schrödinger cat states, multimode systems with up to ten modes, and highly squeezed states with squeezing levels up to 10.4dB. Our results establish a unified framework for characterizing optical quantum states from limited measurement data, enabling efficient certification of quantum states relevant to optical quantum information computation, communication and metrology.</p>

            <p>Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interferometry with entangled photons exhibits distinctive quantum features. By introducing frequency entanglement (discrete-color entangled states) into HOM interference, the characteristic HOM dip is modulated by sinusoidal fringes, which significantly enhance the sensitivity of HOM sensors. The frequency-entangled photon sources demonstrated to date rely on non-resonant parametric down-conversion (PDC), which limits the photon coherence length and, consequently, restricts the sensing dynamic range to the sub-millimeter scale. In this work, we demonstrate narrowband frequency-entangled photon source based on resonant PDC in a crystalline whispering gallery mode resonator. The MHz-level spectral bandwidth of photons enables a meter-scale dynamic range. With highly nondegenerate frequency-entangled photon pairs featuring a 96 THz frequency detuning, we observe high-contrast quantum beating with sub-picosecond resolution in the HOM experiment. Our WGMR-based frequency-entangled photon source has potential applications in quantum metrology and quantum information processing.</p>

            <p>Strong light-matter coupling enables hybrid states in which photonic and electronic degrees of freedom become correlated even in the ground state. While many-body effects in long-range dispersion interactions are known to reshape electronic properties under such conditions, their impact on quantum-optical observables remains largely unexplored. Here, we address this problem using quantum electrodynamical density-functional theory (QEDFT) combined with the recently developed photon-many-body dispersion (pMBD) functional, which can capture higher-order electron-photon correlations and multi-photon processes. We compute ground-state photonic observables including photon number fluctuations, second-order correlations, and quadrature variances, and find squeezing and super-Poissonian photon statistics emerging from light-matter interactions in the strong coupling regime. Our results demonstrate that capturing the full hierarchy of many-body, electron-photon and multi-photon correlations is essential for a consistent description of quantum-optical properties in strongly coupled molecular systems, establishing QEDFT as a first-principles framework for predicting nonclassical photonic features in the ground state of complex systems.</p>

            <h2>What is Stochastic Supervenience?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Youheng Zhang</p>
            <p>Standard formulations of supervenience typically treat higher level properties as point valued facts strictly fixed by underlying base states. However, in many scientific domains, from statistical mechanics to machine learning, basal structures more naturally determine families of probability measures than single outcomes. This paper develops a general framework for stochastic supervenience, in which the dependence of higher level structures on a physical base is represented by Markov kernels that map base states to distributions over macro level configurations. I formulate axioms that secure law like fixation, nondegeneracy, and directional asymmetry, and show that classical deterministic supervenience appears as a limiting Dirac case within the resulting topological space of dependence relations. To connect these metaphysical claims with empirical practice, the framework incorporates information theoretic diagnostics, including normalized mutual information, divergence based spectra, and measures of tail sensitivity. These indices are used to distinguish genuine structural stochasticity from merely epistemic uncertainty, to articulate degrees of distributional multiple realization, and to identify macro level organizations that are salient for intervention. The overall project offers a conservative extension of physicalist dependence that accommodates pervasive structured uncertainty in the special sciences without abandoning the priority of the base level.</p>

            <h2>Post-Newtonian Constraints on Semiclassical Gravity with Quantum Superpositions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hollis Williams</p>
            <p>Semiclassical gravity, in which a classical spacetime is sourced by the quantum expectation value of the stress-energy tensor, is a standard framework for describing the gravitational interaction of quantum matter. In the nonrelativistic limit this approach leads to the Schrödinger-Newton equation, which is often assumed to be consistent at least in the weak-field regime. In this work, we reexamine this assumption for spatial quantum superpositions of massive particles. We show that, when the quantum state is properly normalized, no modification of the Newtonian gravitational potential arises at leading order. However, at first post-Newtonian order the semiclassical coupling generically produces state-dependent contributions involving the mass density and the mass current of the superposition. These terms have a parametric scaling which is different from that of the corresponding relativistic corrections and which does not have Planck mass suppression. Our results therefore impose a strong post-Newtonian consistency constraint on deterministic semiclassical gravity, indicating that sourcing the metric solely by expectation values is insufficient to recover a consistent relativistic weak-field expansion.</p>

These algorithms are parallelizable and can solve megapixel-scale beam shaping problems in tens of seconds on a CPU or seconds on a GPU.</p>

As quantum computing advances, the need to protect the intellectual property contained in quantum circuits continues to grow. Existing methods often provide limited defense against structural and statistical analysis or introduce considerable overhead. In this paper, we propose a novel quantum obfuscation method that uses randomized U3 transformations to conceal circuit structure while preserving functionality. We implement and assess our approach on QASM circuits using Qiskit AER, achieving over 93\% semantic accuracy with minimal runtime overhead. The method demonstrates strong resistance to reverse engineering and structural inference, making it a practical and effective approach for quantum software protection.</p>

            <p>Defects in atomically thin van der Waals materials have recently been investigated as sources of spin-photon entanglement with sensitivity to strain tuning. Unlike many two-dimensional materials, quasi-one-dimensional materials such as transition metal trichalcogenides exhibit in-plane anisotropy resulting in axis-dependent responses to compressive and tensile strains. Herein, we characterize the tunable spin and optical properties of intrinsic vacancy defects in titanium trisulfide (TiS3) and niobium trisulfide (NbS3) nanowires. Within our ab initio approach, we show that sulfur vacancies and divacancies (VS and VD , respectively) in TiS3 and NbS3 adopt strain-dependent defect geometries between in-plane strains of -3 % and 3 %. The calculated electronic structures indicate that both VS and VD possess in-gap defect states with optically bright electronic transitions whose position relative to the conduction and valence bands varies with in-plane strain. Further, our calculations predict that VS in TiS3 and VD in NbS3 exhibit transitions in their ground state spins; specifically, a compressive strain of 0.4 % along the direction of nanowire growth causes a shift from a triplet state to a singlet state for the VS defect in TiS3, whereas a tensile strain of 2.9 % along the same direction in NbS3 induces a triplet ground state with a zero-phonon line of 0.83 eV in the VD defect. Our work shows that the anisotropic geometry of TiS3 and NbS3 nanowires offers exceptional tunability of optically active spin defects that can be used in quantum applications.</p>

            <p>Light polarization plays a crucial role in optical-cavity experiments; however, mirror birefringence presents a significant challenge that must be addressed carefully. In this study, a rigorous, nonperturbative framework is developed to quantify birefringence effects by incorporating variations in reflectance and polarization misalignment. We analyze the impact of this framework on the sensitivity of axion-like particle (ALP) dark-matter searches. The results show that both birefringence and misalignment contribute to sensitivity degradation in the low-mass regime; however, the adverse effects of misalignment can be mitigated by selecting a postselection angle greater than the misalignment angle. Furthermore, birefringence produces an additional resonance peak in the high-mass region, which remains largely unaffected by misalignment and postselection variations. This rigorous framework underscores the importance of considering birefringence in high-precision optical-cavity experiments for ALP detection.</p>

            <h2>Open Quantum Systems as Regular Holonomic $\mathcal{D}$-Modules: The Mixed Hodge Structure of Spectral Singularities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Prasoon Saurabh</p>
            <p>The geometric description of open quantum systems via the Quantum Geometric Tensor (QGT) traditionally relies on the assumption that the physical states form a differentiable vector bundle over the parameter manifold. This framework becomes ill-posed at spectral singularities, such as Exceptional Points, where the eigen-bundle admits no local trivialization due to dimension reduction. In this work, we resolve this obstruction by demonstrating that the family of Liouvillian superoperators $\mathcal{L}(k)$ over a complex parameter manifold $X$ canonically defines a \textbf{regular holonomic $\mathcal{D}_X$-module} $\mathcal{M}$. By identifying the physical coherence order with the Hodge filtration and the decay rate hierarchy with the \textbf{Kashiwara filtration}, we show that the open quantum system underlies a \textbf{Mixed Hodge Module (MHM)} structure in the sense of Saito. This identification allows us to apply the \textbf{Grothendieck six-functor formalism} rigorously to dissipative dynamics. We prove that the divergence corresponds to a non-trivial cohomology class in $\text{Ext}^1_{\mathcal{D}_X}$, thereby regularizing the Quantum Geometric Tensor without ad-hoc cutoffs. Specifically, the ``singular component'' of the Complete QGT arises as the residue of the connection on the \textbf{Brieskorn lattice} associated with the vanishing cycles functor.</p>

            <p>Investigating the interplay of dualities, generalized symmetries, and topological defects beyond theoretical models is an important challenge in condensed matter physics and quantum materials. A simple model exhibiting this physics is the transverse-field Ising model, which can host a topological defect that performs the Kramers-Wannier duality transformation. When acting on one point in space, this duality defect imposes the duality twisted boundary condition and binds a single zero mode. This zero mode is unusual as it lacks a localized partner in the same $\mathbb{Z}_2$ sector and has an infinite lifetime, even in finite systems. Using Floquet driving of a closed Ising chain with a duality defect, we generate this zero mode in a digital quantum computer. We detect the mode by measuring its associated persistent autocorrelation function using an efficient sampling protocol and a compound strategy for error mitigation. We also show that the zero mode resides at the domain wall between two regions related by a Kramers-Wannier duality transformation. Finally, we highlight the robustness of the isolated zero mode to integrability- and symmetry-breaking perturbations. Our findings provide a method for exploring exotic topological defects, associated with noninvertible generalized symmetries, in digitized quantum devices.</p>

            <p>Critical systems near quantum phase transitions were predicted to be useful for improvement of metrological precision, thanks to their ultra-sensitive response to a tiny variation of the control Hamiltonian. Despite the promising perspective, realization of criticality-enhanced quantum metrology is an experimentally challenging task, mainly owing to the extremely long time needed to encode the signal to some physical quantity of a critical system. We here circumvent this problem by making use of the critical behaviors in the Jaynes-Cummings model, comprising a single qubit and a photonic resonator, to which the signal field is coupled. The information about the field amplitude is encoded in the qubit's excitation number in the dark state, which displays a divergent changing rate at the critical point. The most remarkable feature of this critical sensor is that the performance is insensitive to the leakage to bright eigenstates, caused by decoherence and non-adiabatic effects. We demonstrate such a metrological protocol in a superconducting circuit, where an Xmon qubit, interacting with a resonator, is used as a probe for estimating the amplitude of a microwave field coupled to the resonator. The measured quantum Fisher information exhibits a critical quantum enhancement, confirming the potential of this system for quantum metrology.</p>

            <p>Optical parametric amplification generates squeezed light in device-specific sets of time-frequency eigenmodes, and it has been widely accepted that detection and utilization of squeezing must comply with this modal constraint. We show that this constraint can be considerably relaxed under the continuous-wave pump and broadband phase-matching approximation, where the modal decomposition is non-unique. Specifically, any time-frequency mode with "self-conjugated" spectral symmetry can approximate a squeezing eigenmode, and partial homodyne detection can herald squeezing in arbitrary time-frequency modes. We demonstrate this using a high-efficiency, low-loss all-fiber source, measuring 4.38 +- 0.11dB and 0.88 +- 0.09 dB squeezing on partially coherent and chaotic self-conjugated modes. Using a bichromatic self-conjugated mode with reduced local-oscillator noise, we achieve 7.50 +- 0.12dB squeezing, which represents the highest level reported for fully guided-wave squeezing sources based on chi(2) and chi(3) nonlinearities.</p>

            <p>Phase-space versions of quantum mechanics -- from Wigner's original distribution to modern discrete-qudit constructions -- represent some states with negative quasi-probabilities. Conventional Shannon and Rényi entropies become complex-valued in this setting and lose their operational meaning. Building on the axiomatic treatments of Rényi (1961) and Daróczy (1963), we develop a conservative extension that applies to signed finite phase spaces and identify a single admissible entropy family, which we call signed Rényi $\alpha$-entropy (for a free parameter $\alpha \ge 0$). The obvious signed Shannon candidate is ruled out because it violates extensivity. We prove four results that bolster the usefulness of the new measure. (i) It serves as a witness of the presence of cancellation, detecting the coexistence of positive and negative weight in a signed measure. (ii) For $\alpha > 1$, it is Schur-concave, delivering the intuitive property that mixing increases entropy (iii) The same parametric family obeys a quantum H-theorem, namely, that under de-phasing dynamics entropy cannot decrease. (iv) The $2$-entropy is conserved under discrete Moyal-bracket dynamics, mirroring conservation of von Neumann entropy under unitary evolution on Hilbert space. We also comment on interpreting the Rényi order parameter as an inverse temperature. Overall, we believe that our investigation provides good evidence that our axiomatically derived signed Rényi entropy may be a useful addition to existing entropy measures employed in quantum information, foundations, and thermodynamics.</p>

            <p>Quantum sensors offer exceptional sensitivity to nanoscale magnetic fluctuations, where non-stationary effects -- such as spin diffusion -- and non-Markovian dynamics arising from coupling to few environmental degrees of freedom play critical roles. Because fully reconstructing the microscopic structure of realistic spin baths is often infeasible, a practical challenge is to identify the dynamical features that are actually encoded in the sensor's decoherence signal. Here, we demonstrate how quantum sensors can operationally characterize the statistical nature of environmental noise, distinguishing between stationary and non-stationary behaviors, as well as Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics. Using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond as a platform, we develop a physical noise model that captures the essential dynamical features of realistic environments relevant to sensor observables -- independently of the microscopic bath details -- and provides analytical predictions for Ramsey decay across different regimes. These predictions are experimentally validated through controlled noise injection with tunable correlation properties. Our results showcase the capability of quantum sensors to isolate and identify key dynamical properties of complex environments, without requiring full microscopic bath reconstruction. This work clarifies the operational signatures of non-stationarity and non-Markovian behavior at the nanoscale and lays the foundation for strategies that mitigates decoherence while exploiting environmental dynamics for enhanced quantum sensing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Péter E. Frenkel, Milán Mosonyi, Péter Vrana, Mihály Weiner</p>
            <p>The optimal error exponents of binary composite i.i.d. state discrimination are trivially bounded by the worst-case pairwise exponents of discriminating individual elements of the sets representing the two hypotheses, and in the finite-dimensional classical case, these bounds in fact give exact single-copy expressions for the error exponents. In contrast, in the non-commutative case, the optimal exponents are only known to be expressible in terms of regularized divergences, resulting in formulas that, while conceptually relevant, are practically not very useful. In this paper, we develop further an approach initiated in [Mosonyi, Szilágyi, Weiner, IEEE Trans. Inf. Th. 68(2):1032--1067, 2022] to give improved single-copy bounds on the error exponents by comparing not only individual states from the two hypotheses, but also various unnormalized positive semi-definite operators associated to them. Here, we show a number of equivalent characterizations of such operators giving valid bounds, and show that in the commutative case, considering weighted geometric means of the states, and in the case of two states per hypothesis, considering weighted Kubo-Ando geometric means, are optimal for this approach. As a result, we give a new characterization of the weighted Kubo-Ando geometric means as the only $2$-variable operator geometric means that are block additive, tensor multiplicative, and satisfy the arithmetic-geometric mean inequality. We also extend our results to composite quantum channel discrimination, and show an analogous optimality property of the weighted Kubo-Ando geometric means of two quantum channels, a notion that seems to be new. We extend this concept to defining the notion of superoperator perspective function and establish some of its basic properties, which may be of independent interest.</p>

            <p>Shor's algorithm is one of the most prominent quantum algorithms, yet finding efficient implementations remains an active research challenge. While many approaches focus on low-level modular arithmetic optimizations, a broader perspective can provide additional opportunities for improvement. By adopting a mid-level abstraction, we analyze the algorithm as a sequence of computational tasks, enabling systematic identification of idle time and optimization of execution flow. Building on this perspective, we first introduce an alternating design approach to minimize idle time while preserving qubit efficiency in Shor's algorithm. By strategically reordering tasks for simultaneous execution, we achieve a substantial reduction in overall execution time. Extending this approach to distributed implementations, we demonstrate how task rearrangement enhances execution efficiency in the presence of multiple distribution channels. Furthermore, to effectively evaluate the impact of design choices, we employ static timing analysis (STA) -- a technique from classical circuit design -- to analyze circuit delays while accounting for hardware-specific execution characteristics, such as measurement and reset delays in monolithic architectures and ebit generation time in distributed settings. Finally, we validate our approach by integrating modular exponentiation circuits from QRISP and constructing circuits for factoring numbers up to 64 bits. Through an extensive study across neutral atom, superconducting, and ion trap quantum computing platforms, we analyze circuit delays, highlighting trade-offs between qubit efficiency and execution time. Our findings provide a structured framework for optimizing compiled quantum circuits for Shor's algorithm, tailored to specific hardware constraints.</p>

            <p>Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are extensively utilized as quantum sensors for imaging fields at the nanoscale. The ultra-high sensitivity of NV magnetometers has enabled the detection and spectroscopy of individual electron spins, with potentially far-reaching applications in condensed matter physics, spintronics, and molecular biology. However, the surfaces of these diamond sensors naturally contain electron spins, which create a background signal that can be hard to differentiate from the signal of the target spins. In this study, we develop a surface modification approach that eliminates the unwanted signal of these so-called dark electron spins. Our surface passivation technique, based on coating diamond surfaces with a thin titanium oxide (TiO$_2$) layer, reduces the dark spin density. The observed reduction in dark spin density aligns with our findings on the electronic structure of the diamond-TiO$_2$ interface. The reduction, from a typical value of $2,000$~$\mu$m$^{-2}$ to a value below that set by the detection limit of our NV sensors ($200$~$\mu$m$^{-2}$), results in a two-fold increase in Hahn-echo coherence time of near surface NV centers. Furthermore, we derive a comprehensive spin model that connects dark spin relaxation with NV coherence, providing additional insights into the mechanisms behind the observed spin dynamics. Our findings are directly transferable to other quantum platforms, including nanoscale solid state qubits and superconducting qubits.</p>

            <h2>Multimode Entangled Squeezed Light Generation and Propagation in a Coupled-Cavity Photonic Crystal</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dylan van Eeden, Marc M. Dignam</p>
            <p>Entangled multi-mode squeezed states of light have a wide variety of applications in quantum information systems, particularly in the generation of non-Gaussian states of light, which are central to continuous-variable quantum computing. Although theoretical approaches exist to model the nonlinear generation of one- and two-mode entangled states of light in ring resonator systems, these approaches are difficult to implement in modeling more complicated many-cavity systems. In this work, we present an efficient and accurate theoretical approach to modeling the generation and propagation of quantum states of light in lossy coupled-cavity systems containing a two- or three-mode nonlinear resonant structure. Our approach is general and computationally viable even in systems with hundreds of modes. We apply our method to the design and modeling of a multimode photonic crystal coupled-cavity system for the generation of entangled squeezed states of light on-chip. The system consists of a three-mode resonant structure coupled to three coupled-resonator optical waveguides (CROWs) in a square lattice silicon photonic crystal slab. The computational speed of the method allows us to efficiently optimize the system such that the signal and idler light in the two output CROWs remains entangled even after propagating tens of cavities down the CROWs.</p>

            <p>Quantum state preparation lies at the heart of quantum computation and quantum simulations, enabling the investigation of complex manybody systems across physics, chemistry, and data science. While existing methods such as Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) and Adiabatic Preparation (AP) offer viable pathways, both face substantial limitations. Here we introduce a hybrid algorithm that integrates the conceptual strengths of both VQAs and AP, enhanced via the use of group-theoretic structures and classical post-processing to approximate ground and excited states of many-body Hamiltonian models. We validate our approach by applying it to the one-dimensional XYZ Heisenberg model with periodic boundary conditions, evaluating its performance across a broad range of parameters and system sizes. Our results show accurate preparation of low-energy eigenstates, achieved with circuit depths with polynomial scaling versus system size.</p>

            <p>For the solution of partial differential equations (PDEs), we show that the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) can enable the design of quantum circuits that are particularly simple, both conceptually and with regard to hardware requirements. This is shown by explicit circuit constructions for the incompressible advection, heat, isotropic acoustic wave, and Poisson's equations as canonical examples. We utilize quantum singular value transformation to develop circuits that are expected to be of optimal computational complexity. Additionally, we consider approximations suited for smooth initial conditions and describe circuits that make lower demands on hardware. The simple QFT-based circuits are efficient with respect to dimensionality and pave the way for current quantum computers to solve high-dimensional PDEs.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Complexity and Chaos in Many-Qudit Doped Clifford Circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Beatrice Magni, Xhek Turkeshi</p>
            <p>We investigate the emergence of quantum complexity and chaos in doped Clifford circuits acting on qudits of odd prime dimension $d$. Using doped Clifford Weingarten calculus and a replica tensor network formalism, we derive exact results and perform large-scale simulations in regimes challenging for tensor network and Pauli-based methods. We begin by analyzing generalized stabilizer entropies, computable magic monotones in many-qudit systems, and identify a dynamical phase transition in the doping rate, marking the breakdown of classical simulability and the onset of Haar-random behavior. The critical behavior is governed by the qudit dimension and the magic content of the non-Clifford gate. Using the qudit $T$-gate as a benchmark, we show that higher-dimensional qudits converge faster to Haar-typical stabilizer entropies. For qutrits ($d=3$), analytical predictions match numerics on brickwork circuits, showing that locality plays a limited role in magic spreading. We also examine anticoncentration and entanglement growth, showing that $O(\log N)$ non-Clifford gates suffice for approximating Haar expectation values to precision $\varepsilon$, and relate antiflatness measures to stabilizer entropies in qutrit systems. Finally, we analyze out-of-time-order correlators and show that a finite density of non-Clifford gates is needed to induce chaos, with a sharp transition fixed by the local dimension, twice that of the magic transition. Altogether, these results establish a unified framework for diagnosing complexity in doped Clifford circuits and deepen our understanding of resource theories in multiqudit systems.</p>

There exists a set of 3 invariant polynomials that separates equivalence classes of 5-qubit AME states. We also show that every 4-qubit pure code is equivalent to a subspace of the unique ((4,4,2)) and construct an infinite family of 3-uniform n-qubit states for even $n\geq 6$.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hiroto Oka</p>
            <p>In recent years, non-Hermitian quantum systems (NHQS) have been actively studied. In conventional quantum mechanics, Hermiticity is a fundamental property of Hamiltonians. In NHQS, however, states evolve under non-Hermitian Hamiltonians and novel physical phenomena are predicted due to the non-Hermiticity. One difference from Hermitian systems is that the continuity equation (CE) does not hold in NHQS even when the number of particles is conserved. In this study, I extended the definition of current density so that CE holds also in NHQS. The newly defined current density does not only satisfy CE but also has physical meanings in the sense that it affects physical observables in the same manner as conventional current density.</p>

            <h2>Optimal Qubit Purification and Unitary Schur Sampling via Random SWAP Tests</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shrigyan Brahmachari, Austin Hulse, Henry D. Pfister, Iman Marvian</p>
            <p>The goal of qubit purification is to combine multiple noisy copies of an unknown pure quantum state to obtain one or more copies that are closer to the pure state. We show that a simple protocol based solely on random SWAP tests achieves the same fidelity as the Schur transform, which is optimal. This protocol relies only on elementary two-qubit SWAP tests, which project a pair of qubits onto the singlet or triplet subspaces, to identify and isolate singlet pairs, and then proceeds with the remaining qubits. For a system of $n$ qubits, we show that after approximately $T \approx n \ln n$ random SWAP tests, a sharp transition occurs: the probability of detecting any new singlet decreases exponentially with $T$. Similarly, the fidelity of each remaining qubit approaches the optimal value given by the Schur transform, up to an error that is exponentially small in $T$. More broadly, this protocol achieves what is known as weak Schur sampling and unitary Schur sampling with error $\epsilon$, after only $2n \ln(n \epsilon^{-1})$ SWAP tests. That is, it provides a lossless method for extracting any information invariant under permutations of qubits, making it a powerful subroutine for tasks such as quantum state tomography and metrology.</p>

            <h2>Quantum algorithms to detect ODMR-active defects for quantum sensing applications</h2>

            <p>Spin defects in two-dimensional materials are a promising platform for quantum sensing. Simulating the defect's optical response and optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) contrast is key to identifying suitable candidates. However, existing simulation methods are typically unable to supply the required accuracy. Here, we propose two quantum algorithms to detect an imbalance in the triplet-to-singlet intersystem crossing (ISC) rates between excited states with the same and different spin projections -- a necessary condition for nonzero ODMR response. The lowest-cost approach evaluates whether the evolution of an $S=0$ state under the spin-orbit coupling induces ISC to $S=1$, and also whether there is an imbalance in its intensity depending on the final state spin projection. The second approach works by comparing the emission spectrum of a spin defect with and without the spin-orbit coupling operator, inferring ISC intensity for different spin transition channels from spectrum intensity changes. Additionally, we present an improved scheme to evaluate the defect's optical response, building upon previous work. We study these quantum algorithms in the context of the negatively charged boron vacancy in hexagonal boron nitride. We generate an embedded active space of 18 spatial orbitals using quantum defect embedding theory (QDET) and show that the ISC rate imbalance can be detected with as few as 105 logical qubits and $4.41 \times 10^8$ Toffoli gates. By avoiding direct and costly rate calculations, our methods enable faster screening of candidate defects for ODMR activity, advancing the prospect of using quantum simulations to aid the development of high-performing sensing devices.</p>

            <p>We report the first demonstration of multi-photon, dual-state entanglement distribution over a metropolitan-scale commercial fiber network, implemented on the EPB-IonQ Bohr-IV quantum network in Chattanooga, TN, using an all-fiber-optic experimental platform. Employing a spatially degenerate, continuous-wave type-II SPDC bi-photon source and fully fiber-coupled linear optics, we generated a 4-photon entangled state. Through polarization projective measurements on two locally retained photons, we then probabilistically heralded the remaining two photons into either a Bell state (particle-particle entanglement) or a N00N state (mode-mode entanglement), which were then distributed to two spatially separated network nodes. Experimental verification confirmed successful entanglement distribution across the deployed network despite significant channel losses and limited source fidelity. These results highlight the versatility of our polarization-controlled multi-photon entanglement distribution over real-world telecom infrastructure and lay the groundwork for future upgrades, including higher-quality non-degenerate photon sources, White Rabbit timing synchronization for true multi-node entanglement, and active polarization control for enhanced fidelity and long-term stability.</p>

            <h2>Diabatic quantum annealing for training energy-based generative models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gilhan Kim, Ju-Yeon Gyhm, Daniel K. Park</p>
            <p>Energy-based generative models, such as restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs), require unbiased Boltzmann samples for effective training. Classical Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, however, converge slowly and yield correlated samples, making large-scale training difficult. We address this bottleneck by applying the analytic relation between annealing schedules and effective inverse temperature in diabatic quantum annealing. By implementing this prescription on a quantum annealer, we obtain temperature-controlled Boltzmann samples that enable RBM training with faster convergence and lower validation error than classical sampling. We further identify a systematic temperature misalignment intrinsic to analog quantum computers and propose an analytical rescaling method that mitigates this hardware noise, thereby enhancing the practicality of quantum annealers as Boltzmann samplers. In our method, the model's connectivity is set directly by the qubit connectivity, transforming the computational complexity inherent in classical sampling into a requirement on quantum hardware. This shift allows the approach to extend naturally from RBMs to fully connected Boltzmann machines, opening opportunities inaccessible to classical training methods.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement in von Neumann Algebraic Quantum Information Theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lauritz van Luijk</p>
            <p>In quantum systems with infinitely many degrees of freedom, states can be infinitely entangled across a pair of subsystems, but are there different forms of infinite entanglement? To understand entanglement in such systems, we use a framework in which subsystems are described by von Neumann algebras on the full system's Hilbert space. Although this approach has been known for over 50 years, an operational justification has been missing so far. We resolve this by deriving the von Neumann algebraic description of subsystems from operational axioms. This raises the question of how physical properties of the subsystem relate to algebraic properties. Our main result shows a surprisingly strong connection: The type classification of von Neumann algebras (types I, II, III, and their respective subtypes) is in one-to-one correspondence with a family of operational entanglement properties. For instance, Connes' classification of type III factors can be formulated in terms of the smallest achievable error when "embezzling" entanglement from the system. Our findings promote the type classification from algebraic bookkeeping to a classification of infinite quantum systems based on the kind of infinite entanglement that they support.</p>

            <p>We introduce local information flows as a diagnostic tool for characterizing out-of-equilibrium quantum dynamics in lattice gauge theories. We employ the information lattice framework, a local decomposition of total information into spatial- and scale-resolved contributions, to characterize the propagation and buildup of quantum correlations in real-time processes. Focusing on the Schwinger model, a canonical $(1+1)$-dimensional U(1) lattice gauge theory, we apply this framework to two scenarios. First, in the near-threshold scattering of two vector mesons, we demonstrate that the emergence of correlations at a longer length scale in the information lattice marks the production of heavier scalar mesons. Second, in the dynamics of electric field strings, we clearly distinguish between the confining regime, which evolves towards a steady state with a static correlation profile, and the string-breaking sector. The latter is characterized by dynamic correlation patterns that reflect the sequential formation and annihilation of strings. This information-centric approach provides a direct, quantitative, and interpretable visualization of complex many-body phenomena, offering a promising tool for analyzing dynamics in higher-dimensional gauge theories and experiments on quantum hardware.</p>

In the large-\(N\) limit, we derive analytical covariance matrices for these dark states, revealing inter-ensemble entanglement that enhances quantum metrology. The minimum eigenvalue, determined by the curvature of the superradiance potential, corresponds to the optimal multiparameter spin-squeezing coefficient, which is given by the \emph{Rayleigh quotient} of the spin-squeezing matrix, linking metrological sensitivity to the geometric structure of the underlying dynamics. The multiparameter squeezing coefficient provides a variational framework for optimizing metrological performance. These results enable optimal estimation of arbitrary linear combinations of multiple parameters, offering a concrete protocol for distributed quantum sensing and a promising route toward multimode quantum interferometry.</p>

Single particle approximations are often invoked to treat these systems, which can lead to unphysical evolution when combined with master equation approaches.

We demonstrate these constraints for the recently derived unified master equation and universal Lindblad equation, along with the Redfield master equation for cases when positivity issues are not present. For operators that break the constraint, we explore the addition of Pauli factors to recover $N$-representability.

This identifies $\chi^2_\lambda$ as atomic building blocks for quantum $f$-divergences and yields closed-form $w_f$ for canonical choices (relative entropy/KL, Hellinger/Bures, R'{e}nyi). By mapping $\chi^2_\lambda$ into a classical Pearson $\chi^2$, we leverage the Chapman-Robbins variational representation and obtain a tight and universal quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relation: any $f$-divergence is lower bounded by a function of the statistics of quantum observables (mean and variance), reproducing previous and novel results in quantum thermodynamics as applications.</p>

We find that the superradiant burst breaks into a structured train of correlated photons, each intensity peak corresponding to a specific photon number. We quantify the emitter-photon and emitter-emitter entanglement generated during this process and show that the latter emerges in the long-time limit, as part of the excitation becomes trapped within the emitters' singlet subspace. We finally consider the decay of the system's most radiant state, the symmetric Dicke state, and show that time delay can lead to decay rates exceeding those predicted by the Markovian approximation.</p>

            <p>Quantum systems are inherently sensitive to environmental noise and imperfections in external control fields, posing a significant challenge for the practical implementation of quantum technologies. These noise sources degrade the fidelity of quantum gates, making their mitigation a key requirement for realizing reliable quantum computing. In this study, we apply Optimal Control Theory (OCT) within a thermodynamically consistent framework to design and stabilize high-fidelity quantum gates under Markovian noise. Our approach focuses on thermal relaxation and incorporates these effects into the control protocol, wherein external driving fields not only govern the system's unitary evolution but also modulate its interaction with the environment. By leveraging this interplay, we demonstrate that OCT can enable entropy-modifying processes, such as targeted cooling or heating, while maintaining high-fidelity gate performance in noisy environments. To validate our approach, we employ high-precision numerical methods for an open quantum system implementing one- or two-qubit gates embedded in a larger Hilbert space. The results showcase robust gate operation even under significant dissipative influences, offering a concrete path toward fault-tolerant quantum computation under realistic conditions.</p>

            <p>Quantum centric supercomputing (QCSC) framework, such as sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD) holds immense promise toward achieving practical quantum utility to solve challenging problems. QCSC leverages quantum computers to perform the classically intractable task of sampling the dominant fermionic configurations from the Hilbert space that have substantial support to a target state, followed by Hamiltonian diagonalization on a classical processor. However, noisy quantum hardware produces erroneous samples upon measurements, making robust and efficient configuration-recovery strategies essential for a scalable QCSC pipeline. Toward this, in this work, we introduce PIGen-SQD, an efficiently designed QCSC workflow that utilizes the capability of generative machine learning (ML) along with physics-informed configuration screening via implicit low-rank tensor decompositions for accurate fermionic state reconstruction. The physics-informed pruning is based on a class of efficient perturbative measures that, in conjunction with hardware samples, provide a substantial overlap with the target state. This distribution induces an anchoring effect on the generative ML models to stochastically explore only the dominant sector of the Hilbert space for effective identification of additional important configurations in a self-consistent manner. Our numerical experiments performed on IBM Heron R2 quantum processors demonstrate this synergistic workflow produces compact, high-fidelity subspaces that substantially reduce diagonalization cost while maintaining chemical accuracy under strong electronic correlations. By embedding classical many body intuitions directly into the generative ML model, PIGen-SQD advances the robustness and scalability of QCSC algorithms, offering a promising pathway toward chemically reliable quantum simulations on utility-scale quantum hardware.</p>

            <p>We show that a localized quantum system following an arbitrary stationary trajectory and weakly interacting with a stationary thermal bath of a massless scalar field is generically driven into a non-Gibbs steady state by relative motion alone, even without external driving or multiple baths. Relative motion between the system and the bath modifies the standard Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) relation, preventing relaxation to a Gibbs state. The resulting steady states fall into two distinct classes: (i) nonequilibrium steady states (NESS) with persistent probability currents, and (ii) current-free non-Gibbs steady states characterized by a frequency-dependent effective inverse temperature. We then focus on the simplest stationary trajectory, namely uniform relativistic motion with respect to a thermal bath. Using a three-level system as an illustrative example, we demonstrate that the former class can function as noisy stochastic clocks, while the latter possesses finite nonequilibrium free energy, enabling work extraction or storage, highlighting their potential as quantum batteries.</p>

            <p>Practical large-scale quantum computation requires both efficient error correction and robust implementation of logical operations. Three-dimensional (3D) color codes are a promising candidate for fault-tolerant quantum computation due to their transversal non-Clifford gates, but efficient decoding remains challenging. In this work, we extend previous decoders for two-dimensional color codes [1], which are based on the restriction of the decoding problem to a subset of the qubit lattice, to three dimensions. Including boundaries of 3D color codes, we demonstrate that the 3D restriction decoder achieves optimal scaling of the logical error rate and a threshold value of 1.55(6)% for code-capacity bit- and phase-flip noise, which is almost a factor of two higher than previously reported for this family of codes [2, 3]. We furthermore present qCodePlot3D, a Python package for visualizing 2D and 3D color codes, error configurations, and decoding paths, which supports the development and analysis of such decoders. These advancements contribute to making 3D color codes a more practical option for exploring fault-tolerant quantum computation.</p>

            <p>Variational quantum algorithms are leading candidates for near-term advantage, yet their scalability is fundamentally limited by the ``Barren Plateau'' phenomenon. While traditionally attributed to geometric concentration of measure, I propose an information-theoretic origin: a bandwidth bottleneck in the optimization feedback loop. By modeling the optimizer as a coherent Maxwell's Demon, I derive a thermodynamic constitutive relation, $\Delta E \leq \eta I(S:A)$, where work extraction is strictly bounded by the mutual information established via entanglement. I demonstrate that systems with polynomial Dynamical Lie Algebra (DLA) dimension exhibit ``Information Superconductivity'' (sustained $\eta > 0$), whereas systems with exponential DLA dimension undergo an efficiency collapse when the rate of information scrambling exceeds the ancilla's channel capacity. These results reframe quantum trainability as a thermodynamic phase transition governed by the stability of information flow.</p>

            <h2>Wave-packet dynamics in pseudo-Hermitian lattices: Coexistence of Hermitian and non-Hermitian wavefronts</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alon Beck, Moshe Goldstein</p>
            <p>This paper investigates wave-packet dynamics in non-Hermitian lattice systems and reveals a surprising phenomenon: The simultaneous propagation of two distinct wavefronts, one traveling at the non-Hermitian velocity and the other at the Hermitian velocity. We show that this dual-front behavior arises naturally in systems governed by a pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Using the paradigmatic Hatano-Nelson model as our primary example, we demonstrate that this coexistence is essential for understanding a wide array of unconventional dynamical effects, including abrupt ``non-Hermitian reflections'', sudden shifts of Gaussian wave-packets, and disorder-induced emergent packets seeded by the small initial tails. We present analytic predictions that closely match numerical simulations. These results may offer new insight into the topology of non-Hermitian systems and point toward measurable experimental consequences.</p>

            <h2>A random purification channel for arbitrary symmetries with applications to fermions and bosons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michael Walter, Freek Witteveen</p>
            <p>The random purification channel maps n copies of any mixed quantum state to n copies of a random purification of the state. We generalize this construction to arbitrary symmetries: for any group G of unitaries, we construct a quantum channel that maps states contained in the algebra generated by G to random purifications obtained by twirling over G. In addition to giving a surprisingly concise proof of the original random purification theorem, our result implies the existence of fermionic and bosonic Gaussian purification channels. As applications, we obtain the first tomography protocol for fermionic Gaussian states that scales optimally with the number of modes and the error, as well as an improved property test for this class of states.</p>

            <h2>The measured speed in the evanescent regime reflects the spatial decay of the wavefunction, not particle motion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weixiang Ye</p>
            <p>The recent paper by Sharoglazova et al. reports an energy-dependent parameter $\nu$ extracted from the spatial distribution of photons in a coupled-waveguide experiment. The authors interpret $\nu$ as the speed of quantum particles, even in the classically forbidden regime, and claim that its finite value contradicts the Bohmian mechanics prediction of zero particle velocity. This challenge arises from a fundamental misunderstanding of the operational meaning of v within the Bohmian ontological framework. We demonstrate that v quantifies the spatial gradient of the wavefunctions amplitude, a geometric property of the guiding field, not the kinematical velocity of point-like particles. The experiment therefore does not challenge but rather illustrates the clean ontological separation between the wave and particle aspects inherent to Bohmian mechanics.</p>

            <h2>Emergent $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaking of collective modes with topological critical phenomena</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jian-Song Pan, Wei Yi, Jiangbin Gong</p>
            <p>The spontaneous breaking of parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry yields rich critical behavior in non-Hermitian systems, and has stimulated much interest, albeit most previous studies were performed within the single-particle or mean-field framework. Here, by studying the collective excitations of a Fermi superfluid with $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric spin-orbit coupling, we uncover an emergent $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaking in the Anderson-Bogoliubov (AB) collective modes, even as the superfluid ground state retains an unbroken $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry. {The critical point of the transition is marked by a non-analytic kink in the speed of sound, which derives from the coalescence and annihilation of the AB mode and its hole partner, reminiscent of the particle-antiparticle annihilation. The system consequently becomes immune to low-frequency external perturbations at the critical point, a phenomenon associated with the spectral topology of the complex quasiparticle dispersion. This critical phenomenon offers a fascinating route toward perturbation-free quantum states.</p>

            <h2>Absence of nontrivial local conserved quantities in the spin-1 bilinear-biquadratic chain and its anisotropic extensions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akihiro Hokkyo, Mizuki Yamaguchi, Yuuya Chiba</p>
            <p>We provide a complete classification of the integrability and nonintegrability of the spin-1 bilinear-biquadratic model with a uniaxial anisotropic field, which includes the Heisenberg model and the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki model. It is rigorously shown that, within this class, the only integrable systems are those that have been solved by the Bethe ansatz method, and that all other systems are nonintegrable, in the sense that they do not have nontrivial local conserved quantities. Here, "nontrivial" excludes quantities like the Hamiltonian or the total magnetization, and "local" refers to sums of operators that act only on sites within a finite distance. This result establishes the nonintegrability of the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki model and, consequently, demonstrates that the quantum many-body scars observed in this model emerge independently of any conservation laws of local quantities. Furthermore, we extend the proof of nonintegrability to more general spin-1 models that encompass anisotropic extensions of the bilinear-biquadratic Hamiltonian and completely classify the integrability of generic Hamiltonians that possess translational symmetry, $U(1)$ symmetry, time-reversal symmetry, and spin-flip symmetry. Our result accomplishes a breakthrough in nonintegrability proofs by expanding their scope to spin-1 systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonathan J. Heckman, Max Hübner, Chitraang Murdia</p>
            <p>The global symmetry data of a $D$-dimensional absolute quantum field theory can sometimes be packaged in terms of a $(D+1)$-dimensional bulk system obtained by extending along an interval, with a relative QFT$_D$ at one end and suitable gapped / free boundary conditions at the other end. The partition function of the QFT$_D$ can then be interpreted as a wavefunction depending on background fields. However, in some cases, it is not possible or simply cumbersome to fix an absolute form of the symmetry data. Additionally, it is also of interest to consider entangled and mixed states of relative QFTs as well as entangled and mixed states of gapped / free boundary conditions. We argue that Wigner's quasi-probabilistic function on phase space provides a physical interpretation of the symmetry data in all such situations. We illustrate these considerations in the case of string compactifications and holographic systems.</p>

            <h2>On the reconstruction map in JT gravity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chris Akers, Andrew Lucas, Amit Vikram</p>
            <p>An open question in AdS/CFT is how to reconstruct semiclassical bulk operators precisely enough that non-perturbative quantum effects can be computed. We propose a set of physically-motivated requirements for such a reconstruction map, and explicitly construct a map satisfying these requirements in Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity. Our map is found by canonically quantizing "action-angle" variables for JT gravity, which are chosen to ensure that the spectrum of the fundamental quantum theory matches known results from the gravitational path integral. We then study unitary quantum dynamics in this theory, and obtain analytical predictions for the dynamics of the wormhole length, including its quantum fluctuations, leveraging techniques from quantum ergodicity theory. Level repulsion in the non-perturbative JT spectrum implies that the average wormhole length is non-monotonic in time, that fluctuations in wormhole length are non-perturbatively suppressed until nearly the Heisenberg time, and that the late-time-evolved Hartle-Hawking state has a heavy-tailed distribution of lengths. We discuss the implications of our results for the "complexity = volume" conjecture.</p>

            <h2>Universal shape-dependence of quantum entanglement in disordered magnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Natalie Love, István A. Kovács</p>
            <p>Disordered quantum magnets are not only experimentally relevant, but offer efficient computational methodologies to calculate the low energy states as well as various measures of quantum correlations. Here, we present a systematic analysis of quantum entanglement in the paradigmatic random transverse-field Ising model in two dimensions, using an efficient implementation of the asymptotically exact strong disorder renormalization group method. The phase diagram is known to be governed by three distinct infinitely disordered fixed points (IDFPs) that we study here. For square subsystems, it has been recently established that quantum entanglement has a universal logarithmic correction due to the corners of the subsystem at all three IDFPs. This corner contribution has been proposed as an "entanglement susceptibility", a useful tool to locate the phase transition and to measure the correlation length critical exponent. Towards a deeper understanding, we quantify how the corner contribution depends on the shape of the subsystem. While the corner contribution remains universal, the shape-dependence is qualitatively different in each universality class, also confirmed by line segment subsystems, a special case of skeletal entanglement. Therefore, unlike in conformally invariant systems, in general different subsystem shapes are versatile probes to unveil new universal information on the phase transitions in disordered quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>The Sound of an Orbit: A Quantum Spectrum at the ISCO</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Reggie C. Pantig, Ali Övgün</p>
            <p>We investigate the quantum signature of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), a region of profound importance in black hole astrophysics. By modeling an atom as an Unruh-DeWitt detector coupled to a massless scalar field in the Boulware vacuum, we calculate the excitation rate for a detector following a circular geodesic at the ISCO of a Schwarzschild black hole. In stark contrast to the continuous thermal spectra associated with static or infalling observers, our analysis reveals a unique, non-thermal excitation spectrum characterized by a discrete "frequency comb" of sharp, resonant peaks. We show that the locations of these peaks are determined by the orbital frequency at the ISCO, while their intensity increases dramatically as the orbit approaches this final stability boundary. This distinct spectral signature offers a novel theoretical probe of the quantum vacuum in a strong-field gravitational regime and provides a clear distinction between the quantum phenomena experienced by observers on different trajectories. Our findings have potential implications for interpreting the emission spectra from accretion disks and open new avenues for exploring the connection between quantum mechanics and gravity.</p>

            <h2>Near-optimal decomposition of unitary matrices using phase masks and the discrete Fourier transform</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vincent Girouard, Nicolás Quesada</p>
            <p>Universal multiport interferometers (UMIs) have emerged as a key tool for performing arbitrary linear transformations on optical modes, enabling precise control over the state of light in essential applications of classical and quantum information processing such as neural networks and boson sampling. While UMI architectures based on Mach-Zehnder interferometer networks are well established, alternative approaches that involve interleaving fixed multichannel mixing layers and phase masks have recently gained interest due to their high robustness to losses and fabrication errors. However, these approaches currently lack optimal analytical methods to compute design parameters with low optical depth. In this work, we introduce a constructive decomposition of unitary matrices using a sequence of $2N+5$ phase masks interleaved with $2N+4$ discrete Fourier transform matrices. This decomposition can be leveraged to design universal interferometers based on phase masks and multimode interference couplers, implementing a discrete Fourier transform, offering an analytical alternative to conventional numerical optimization-based designs and reducing by a factor of 3 the previous best known analytical methods.</p>

            <h2>Evolution With(out) Time: Relational Holography & BPS Complexity Growth in $\mathcal{N}=2$ Double-Scaled SYK</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sergio E. Aguilar-Gutierrez</p>
            <p>How do we describe non-trivial bulk measurements relative to an observer (i.e. relationally) when both the observer and the system it probes may/may not evolve in time? How can we interpret this holographically; particularly for zero-energy BPS states in supersymmetric theories? We address these questions, in the $\mathcal{N}=2$ double-scaled SYK model and its putative bulk dual by: (i) formulating a holographic procedure in the language of quantum reference frames to gravitationally dress bulk observables to ``clocks'' parametrized by both boundary time and R-charge; and (ii) proposing a \emph{new measure of Krylov complexity} with R-charge in the boundary theory that probes zero-energy BPS states. Holographically, this proposal reproduces a relational bulk observable, a BPS wormhole length. We contrast this to the Krylov complexity for Hartle-Hawking states with non-trivial time flow. The latter reproduces the same observable as for the bosonic DSSYK in the semiclassical limit, while its quantum fluctuations can capture supersymmetric corrections depending on the specific initial state.</p>

            <h2>The Anderson transition -- a view from Krylov space</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. Clayton Peacock, Vadim Oganesyan, Dries Sels</p>
            <p>The Krylov subspace expansion is a workhorse method for sparse numerics that has been increasingly explored as source of physical insight into many-body dynamics in recent years. In this work we revisit the venerable Anderson model of localization in dimensions $d=1, 2, 3, 4$ to construct local integrals of motion (LIOM) in Krylov space. These appear as zero eigenvalue edge states of an effective hopping problem in the Krylov superoperator subspace and can be analytically constructed given the Lanczos coefficients. We exploit this idea, focusing on $d=3$, to study the manifestation of the disorder driven Anderson transition in the anatomy of LIOMs. We find that the increasing complexity of the Krylov operators results in a suppression of the fluctuations of the Lanczos coefficients. As such, one can study the phenomenology of the integrals of motion in the disorder averaged Krylov chain. We find edge states localized on vanishing fraction of Krylov space (of dimension $D_K=V^2$ for cubes of volume $V$), both in localized and extended phases. Importantly, in the localized phase, disorder induces powerlaw decaying dimerization in the (Krylov) hopping problem, producing stretched exponential decay of the LIOMs in Krylov space with a stretching exponent $1/2d$. Metallic LIOMs are completely delocalized albeit across only $\propto \sqrt{D_K}$ states. Critical LIOMs exhibit powerlaw decay with an exponent matching the expected value of $0.29$.</p>

            <h2>Algebraic Obstructions and the Collapse of Elementary Structure in the Kronecker Problem</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Soong Kyum Lee</p>
            <p>While Kronecker coefficients $g(\lambda,\mu,\nu)$ with bounded rows are polynomial-time computable via lattice-point methods, no explicit closed-form formulas have been obtained for genuinely three-row cases in the 87 years since Murnaghan's foundational work. This paper provides such formulas for the first time and identifies a universal structural boundary at parameter value 5 where elementary combinatorial patterns collapse. We analyze two independent families of genuinely three-row coefficients and establish that for $k \leq 4$, the formulas exhibit elementary structure: oscillation bounds follow the triangular-Hogben pattern, and polynomial expressions factor completely over $\mathbb{Z}$. At the critical threshold $k=5$, this structure collapses: the triangular pattern fails, and algebraic obstructions -- irreducible quadratic factors with negative discriminant -- emerge. We develop integer forcing, a proof technique exploiting the tension between continuous asymptotics and discrete integrality. As concrete results, we prove that $g((n,n,1)^3) = 2 - (n \mod 2)$ for all $n \geq 3$ -- the first explicit formula for a genuinely three-row Kronecker coefficient -- derive five explicit polynomial formulas for staircase-hook coefficients, and verify Saxl's conjecture for 132 three-row partitions.</p>

            <h2>Deriving the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis from Eigenstate Typicality and Kinematic Principles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yucheng Wang</p>
            <p>The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) provides a powerful framework for understanding thermalization in isolated quantum many-body systems, yet a complete and conceptually transparent derivation has remained elusive. In this work, we derive the structure of ETH from a minimal dynamical principle, which we term the eigenstate typicality principle (ETP), together with general kinematic ingredients arising from entropy maximization, Hilbert-space geometry, and locality. ETP asserts that in quantum-chaotic systems, energy eigenstates are statistically indistinguishable, with respect to local measurements, from states drawn from the Haar measure on a narrow microcanonical shell. Within this framework, diagonal ETH arises from concentration of measure, provided that eigenstate typicality holds. The structure of off-diagonal matrix elements is then fixed by entropic scaling and the finite-time dynamical correlations of local observables, with ETP serving as the dynamical bridge to energy eigenstates, without invoking random-matrix assumptions. Our results establish ETH as a consequence of entropy, Hilbert-space geometry, and chaos-induced eigenstate typicality, and clarify its regime of validity across generic quantum-chaotic many-body systems, thereby deepening our understanding of quantum thermalization and the emergence of statistical mechanics from unitary many-body dynamics.</p>

Combining a Fisher information-based formalism with simulated experiments, we find homodyne tomography to outperform heterodyne measurements for all non-Gaussian states tested, although the separation between the two modalities proves significantly narrower than suggested by the asymptotic Cramer-Rao lower bound.

            <p>Squeezed light has revolutionized quantum metrology by enhancing interferometry for sensitive applications such as the detection of gravitational waves. Squeezed light has also played a pivotal role in quantum information science with numerous applications in quantum computing and communication. Previously, squeezed light has been primarily generated using nonlinear optical interactions, where control of the degree of squeezing was possible by tuning the nonlinearity of the generating medium using suitable material engineering. Here, we modulate the third-order nonlinear response in dielectrics with strong ultrafast laser fields to control the degree of squeezing on attosecond time scales. We demonstrate the ability to change the ultrafast squeezed light generated in the nonlinear process from amplitude-squeezed to phase-squeezed by controlling the strong-field-driven nonlinear response of the material through a sub-cycle phase delay between the input femtosecond laser pulses. The squeezing of quantum noise is measured using a frequency-resolved balanced homodyne detection scheme capable of extracting the field quadratures in different frequency modes simultaneously. Using this frequency-resolved measurement we extract the complete coherency matrix containing the quantum correlations between field quadratures across different frequency modes of the femtosecond squeezed light pulse. These results have major implications for the development of quantum light sources with unprecedented levels of control over quadrature squeezing, for applications in multimode quantum information processing, and for measuring transient quantum matter correlations via transduction to quantum field correlations in an ultrafast light-matter interaction.</p>

CI calculations for individual fragments are performed using either sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD) for challenging fragments or full configuration interaction (FCI) for trivial fragments. To assess the accuracy of SQD for fragment CI calculations, EWF-(FCI,SQD) results are compared against EWF-MP2 and EWF-CCSD benchmarks.

            <p>High-quality quantum communications that enable important capabilities, such as distributed quantum computing and sensing, will require quantum repeaters for providing high-quality entanglement. To realize high-rate heralded entanglement for quantum repeaters, Chen et al. [Phys. Rev.

Here, we propose a design of ZALM source using time-bin entanglement and spectral shearing. Additionally, we provide an analysis of experimentally relevant spectral-shearing parameters to optimize the spectral multiplexing. Moreover, we experimentally verify the compatibility of time-bin pulses and spectral shearing, as supported by observation of no phase shift when the same shearing is applied to both time bins. These results expand the benefits of applying a ZALM source to time-bin entanglement use cases. Moreover, more fully demonstrating time-bin and spectral shearing compatibility clears a path towards a broader use of spectral shearing that provides a deterministic frequency shift of high utility.</p>

            <p>The realization of scalable quantum networks for distribution of entanglement over long distances hinges on quantum repeaters. To outperform the exponential transmission loss in optical fibers, quantum repeaters must employ multiplexing schemes in the temporal, spectral, or spatial domain.

In this work, we experimentally demonstrate such a memory operating at telecom wavelength using an Er$^{3+}$:Y$_{2}$SiO$_{5}$ crystal. Using single-photon detectors, we record on-demand storage and recall of weak coherent pulses for up to $1$ ms, exceeding that of previously reported quantum memories based on Er$^{3+}$. The memory exhibits an efficiency of 10.36\% at 300 $\mu$s storage time with a signal-to-noise ratio of $10.9$. We further showcase its multimode capacity by storing 20 temporal and 3 spectral modes simultaneously with on-demand and selective recall capabilities, essential for a scalable quantum repeater architecture.</p>

The adaptive nature of the proposed receiver yields significant quantum advantages over classical receivers without relying on complex or fragile quantum resources such as entanglement.

In particular, increasing attention has been devoted to the emergence of non-equilibrium universality classes that have no equilibrium counterparts. A prominent example is the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class realized in dissipative Bose-Einstein condensates. In this Letter, motivated by recent experimental advances, we investigate the universal dynamics of dissipative quantum systems with dipole moment conservation. We develop an effective field theory description, supported by a concrete quantum spin model, to capture the resulting universal behaviors. Our analysis unveils a novel strongly interacting non-equilibrium fixed point that governs the equal-time phase fluctuations in systems with either strong or weak dipole symmetries. Moreover, charge transport becomes subdiffusive in the presence of strong dipole symmetry, while it remains diffusive in the weakly symmetric case. Our results reveal the intricate interplay between kinetic constraints and dissipation in quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <p>Fully connected quantum networks enable simultaneously connecting every user to every other user and are the most versatile and robust networking architecture. However, the scalability of such networks remains great challenge for practical applications. Here we construct a large-scale fully connected quantum network founded on two-photon Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference, where user-to-user security is guaranteed even with untrusted network provider. Using integrated soliton microcomb (SMC) and photonic encoding chips, we realize precise massive parallel frequency generation and locking, high-visibility HOM interferences and measurement-device-independent (MDI) quantum key distribution. The proposed architecture enables a 200-user fully connected quantum network over 200 kilometers with strict information-theoretic security via untrusted network provider. The implemented networking architecture paves the way for realizing large-scale fully connected MDI quantum networks across metropolitan and intercity regions.</p>
