            <h2>Minimalistic and Scalable Quantum Reservoir Computing Enhanced with Feedback</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chuanzhou Zhu, Peter J. Ehlers, Hendra I. Nurdin, Daniel Soh</p>
            <p>Quantum Reservoir Computing (QRC) leverages quantum systems to perform complex computational tasks with exceptional efficiency and reduced energy consumption. We introduce a minimalistic QRC framework utilizing only a few two-level atoms in a single-mode optical cavity, combined with continuous quantum measurements. To achieve high computational expressivity with minimal hardware, we include two critical elements: reservoir feedback and polynomial regression. Reservoir feedback modifies the reservoir's dynamics without altering its hardware, while polynomial regression enhances output resolution by nonlinearly extending expressions. We evaluate QRC's memory retention and nonlinear data processing through two tasks: predicting chaotic time-series data via the Mackey-Glass task and classifying sine-square waveforms. Our results demonstrate significant QRC performance with minimal reservoirs containing as few as five atoms, further enhanced by feedback mechanisms and polynomial regression. This framework fulfills QRC's objectives to minimize hardware size and energy consumption, marking a significant advancement in integrating quantum physics with machine learning technology.</p>

            <h2>Spectroscopic footprints of quantum friction in nonreciprocal and chiral media</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> O. J. Franca, Fabian Spallek, Steffen Giesen, Robert Berger, Kilian Singer, Stefan Aull, Stefan Yoshi Buhmann</p>
            <p>We investigate how the quantum friction experienced by a polarizable atom moving with constant velocity parallel to a planar interface is modified when the latter consists of chiral or nonreciprocal media, with special focus on topological insulators. We use macroscopic quantum electrodynamics to obtain the velocity-dependent Casimir-Polder frequency shift and decay rate. These results are a generalization to matter with time-reversal symmetry breaking. We illustrate our findings by examining the nonretarded and retarded limits for five examples: a perfectly conducting mirror, a perfectly reflecting nonreciprocal mirror, a three-dimensional topological insulator, a perfectly reflecting chiral mirror and an isotropic chiral medium. We find different asymptotic power laws for all these materials. Interestingly, we find two bridges between chirality and nonreciprocity through the frequency shift that arise as a consequence of the magnetoelectric coupling. Namely, the position-dependent Casimir-Polder frequency shift for the nonreciprocal case depend on a geometric magnetic field associated with photoionization of chiral molecules, the Casimir-Polder depending on the velocities for the chiral case have the optical rotatory strength as the atomic response while those for the nonreciprocal case depend on an analog of the optical rotatory strength.</p>

            <h2>Nonlinear semiclassical spectroscopy of ultrafast molecular polariton dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michael Reitz, Arghadip Koner, Joel Yuen-Zhou</p>
            <p>We introduce a theoretical framework that allows for the systematic and efficient description of the ultrafast nonlinear response of molecular polaritons, i.e., hybrid light-matter states, in the collective regime of large numbers of molecules $\mathcal N$ coupled to the cavity photon mode. Our approach is based on a semiclassical, mean-field evolution of the molecular Hamiltonian and the cavity field, which is complemented by a perturbative expansion of both light and matter counterparts in the input fields entering the cavity. In addition, expansion in terms of the pulse phases enables us to disentangle different excitation pathways in Liouville space, thereby distinguishing contributions to the nonlinear response. The formalism extends traditional free-space nonlinear spectroscopy by incorporating the feedback of matter onto the light field via the induced polarization. We demonstrate the utility of the framework by applying it to the calculation of pump-probe polariton spectra and show how, by storing the pulses, the cavity facilitates additional excitation pathways which are not possible in free space. Our method, which does not scale with $\mathcal N$, is broadly applicable and can be extended to a wide range of current experiments investigating the dynamical nonlinear response of hybrid light-matter states.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement and Coherence Dynamics in Photonic Quantum Memristors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alberto Ferrara, Rosario Lo Franco</p>
            <p>Memristive systems exhibit dynamics that depend on their past states, making them useful as memory units. Recently, quantum memristor models have been proposed and notably, a photonic quantum memristor (PQM) has been experimentally proven. In this work, we explore and characterize various quantum properties that emerge from this specific model of PQM. Firstly, we find that a single PQM displays memristive dynamics on its quantum coherence. Secondly, we analytically show that a network made of two independent PQMs can manifest memory effects on the dynamics of both entanglement and coherence of correlated photons traveling through the network, regardless of their distance, in the hypothesis of negligible external disturbances. Additionally, we build and run a circuit-model of the PQM on a real qubit-based quantum computer (IBM-Q), showing that: (i) this system can effectively be used for non-linear quantum computing under specific conditions, and (ii) digital quantum simulations can reproduce the dynamics of a memristive quantum system in a non-Markovian regime.</p>

            <h2>Sensing force gradients with cavity optomechanics while evading backaction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elisabet K. Arvidsson, Ermes Scarano, August K. Roos, Sofia Qvarfort, David B. Haviland</p>
            <p>We study force-gradient sensing with a coherently driven mechanical resonator and phase-sensitive detection of motion through the two-tone backaction evading measurement of cavity optomechanics. The response of the optomechanical system, solved by numerical integration of the classical equations of motion, shows an extended region which is monotonic to changes in force gradient. We use Floquet theory to model the fluctuations, which rise only slightly above that of the usual backaction evading measurement in the presence of the mechanical drive. The monotonic response and minimal backaction are advantageous for applications such as atomic force microscopy.</p>

            <h2>Absolute zeta functions for zeta functions of quantum walks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jirô Akahori, Norio Konno, Rikuki Okamoto, Iwao Sato</p>
            <p>This paper presents a connection between the quantum walk and the absolute mathematics. The quantum walk is a quantum counterpart of the classical random walk. We especially deal with the Grover walk on a graph. The Grover walk is a typical model of quantum walks. The time evolution of the Grover walk is obtained by a unitary matrix that is called the Grover matrix. We define the zeta function determined by the Grover matrix. First we prove that the zeta function of the Grover walk is the absolute automorphic form that constructs the absolute zeta function. Next we calculate the absolute zeta function defined by Grover walks on some graphs. The absolute zeta functions of the Grover walks are expressed by the multiple gamma function. Other types of absolute zeta functions are obtained as an analogue of the multiple gamma function.</p>

            <h2>Causality in relativistic quantum interactions without mediators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eirini C. Telali, T. Rick Perche, Eduardo Martín-Martínez</p>
            <p>We analyse the interaction between two quantum systems in spacetime and we compare two possible models to describe it: 1) a fully quantum field theoretical (QFT) description of the coupling of two quantum systems mediated by a quantum field and 2) a quantum-controlled model (qc-model), which is an effectively relativistic direct-coupling in which the interaction of two quantum systems is not mediated by a field with local quantum degrees of freedom. We show that while there are regimes where the qc-model can approximate QFT arbitrarily well, it can suffer from retrocausal effects. We discuss in what regimes those retrocausal predictions of the qc-model are non-negligible and whether they can be used to argue that gravity induced entanglement experiments can reveal genuinely quantum aspects of the gravitational interaction or not.</p>

            <h2>Easy better quantum process tomography</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robin Blume-Kohout, Timothy Proctor</p>
            <p>Quantum process tomography (QPT), used to estimate the linear map that best describes a quantum operation, is usually performed using a priori assumptions about state preparation and measurement (SPAM), which yield a biased and inconsistent estimator. This estimate can be made more accurate and less biased by incorporating SPAM-calibration data. Unobservable properties of the SPAM operations introduce a small gauge freedom that can be regularized using the a priori SPAM. We give an explicit correction procedure for standard linear-inversion QPT and overcomplete linear-inversion QPT, and describe how to extend it to statistically principled estimators like maximum likelihood estimation.</p>

            <h2>Estimation of the frequency-shift between two photons by time-sampling measurements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luca Maggio, Danilo Triggiani, Paolo Facchi, Vincenzo Tamma</p>
            <p>We present a sensing scheme for estimating the frequency difference of two non-entangled photons. The technique consists of time-resolving sampling measurements at the output of a beam splitter. With this protocol, the frequency shift between two photons can be estimated with the ultimate precision achievable in nature, overcoming the limits in precision and the range of detection of frequency-resolving detectors employed in standard direct measurements of the frequencies. The sensitivity can be increased by increasing the coherence time of the photons. We show that, already with $\sim 1000$ sampling measurements, the Cramér-Rao bound is saturated independently of the value of the difference in frequency.</p>

            <h2>A Versatile Chip-Scale Platform for High-Rate Entanglement Generation using an AlGaAs Microresonator Array</h2>

            <p>Integrated photonic microresonators have become an essential resource for generating photonic qubits for quantum information processing, entanglement distribution and networking, and quantum communications. The pair generation rate is enhanced by reducing the microresonator radius, but this comes at the cost of increasing the frequency mode spacing and reducing the quantum information spectral density. Here, we circumvent this rate-density trade-off in an AlGaAs-on-insulator photonic device by multiplexing an array of 20 small-radius microresonators each producing a 650-GHz-spaced comb of time-energy entangled-photon pairs. The resonators can be independently tuned via integrated thermo-optic heaters, enabling control of the mode spacing from degeneracy up to a full free spectral range. We demonstrate simultaneous pumping of five resonators with up to $50$ GHz relative comb offsets, where each resonator produces pairs exhibiting time-energy entanglement visibilities up to 95$\%$, coincidence-to-accidental ratios exceeding 5,000, and an on-chip pair rate up to 2.6 GHz/mW$^2$ per comb line -- more than 40 times improvement over prior work. As a demonstration, we generate frequency-bin qubits in a maximally entangled two-qubit Bell state with fidelity exceeding 87$\%$ (90$\%$ with background correction) and detected frequency-bin entanglement rates up to 7 kHz ($\sim 70$ MHz on-chip pair rate) using $\sim 250$ $\mu$W pump power. Multiplexing small-radius microresonators combines the key capabilities required for programmable and dense photonic qubit encoding while retaining high pair-generation rates, heralded single-photon purity, and entanglement fidelity.</p>

            <h2>Hybrid of Gradient Descent And Semidefinite Programming for Certifying Multipartite Entanglement Structure</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kai Wu, Zhihua Chen, Zhen-Peng Xu, Zhihao Ma, Shao-Ming Fei</p>
            <p>Multipartite entanglement is a crucial resource for a wide range of quantum information processing tasks, including quantum metrology, quantum computing, and quantum communication. The verification of multipartite entanglement, along with an understanding of its intrinsic structure, is of fundamental importance, both for the foundations of quantum mechanics and for the practical applications of quantum information technologies. Nonetheless, detecting entanglement structures remains a significant challenge, particularly for general states and large-scale quantum systems. To address this issue, we develop an efficient algorithm that combines semidefinite programming with a gradient descent method. This algorithm is designed to explore the entanglement structure by examining the inner polytope of the convex set that encompasses all states sharing the same entanglement properties. Through detailed examples, we demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to many of the best-known methods available today. Our method not only improves entanglement detection but also provides deeper insights into the complex structures of many-body quantum systems, which is essential for advancing quantum technologies</p>

            <h2>Vacuum Rabi Splitting and Quantum Fisher Information of a Non-Hermitian Qubit in a Single-Mode Cavity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi-Cheng Wang, Jiong Li, Li-Wei Duan, Qing-Hu Chen</p>
            <p>A natural extension of the non-Hermitian qubit is to place it in a single-mode cavity. This setup corresponds to the quantum Rabi model (QRM) with a purely imaginary bias on the qubit, exhibiting the parity-time ($\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$) symmetry. In this work, we first solve the $\mathcal{P} \mathcal{T}$ symmetric QRM using the Bogoliubov operator approach. We derive the transcendental function responsible for the exact solution, which can also be used to precisely identify exceptional points. The adiabatic approximation previously used can be easily formulated within this approach by considering transitions between the same manifolds in the space of Bogoliubov operators. By further considering transitions between the nearest-neighboring manifolds, we can analytically obtain more accurate eigen-solutions. Moreover, these simple corrections can capture the main features of the dynamics, where the adiabatic approximation fails. Furthermore, the rich characteristics of the vacuum Rabi splitting in the emission spectrum is predicted. The width of the peaks increases with the coupling strength and the imaginary biases, reflecting the nature of open quantum systems. Additionally, we identify a quantum criticality-enhanced effect by calculating the quantum Fisher information. Near the exceptional points, the quantum Fisher information in the $\mathcal{P} \mathcal{T}$ symmetric QRM is significantly higher than that of the non-Hermitian qubit component. This may open a new avenue for enhancing quantum sensitivity in non-Hermitian systems by incorporating coupling with an additional degree of freedom, enabling more precise parameter estimation.</p>

            <p>High-dimensional encoding for quantum key distribution (QKD) enables increased achievable key rates and robustness as compared to the standard qubit-based systems. However, experimental implementations of such systems are more complicated, expensive, and require complex security analysis. In this work we present a proof of principle high-dimensional time-phase BB84 QKD experiment using only one single-photon detector per measurement basis. We employ the temporal Talbot effect to detect QKD symbols in the control basis, and show experimentally-obtained values for the two-dimensional and four-dimensional case. We present a comparison of the secret key rates obtained from two different security proofs to display security issues stemming from asymmetric detection efficiencies in the two bases. Our results contribute to the discussion of the benefits of high-dimensional encoding and highlight the impact of security analysis on the achievable QKD performance.</p>

            <p>The certification of randomness is essential for both fundamental science and information technologies. Unlike traditional random number generators, randomness obtained from nonlocal correlations is fundamentally guaranteed to be unpredictable. However, it is also highly susceptible to noise. Here, we show that extending the conventional bipartite Bell scenario to hybrid quantum networks -- which incorporate both quantum channels and entanglement sources -- enhances the robustness of certifiable randomness. Our protocol even enables randomness to be certified from Bell-local states, broadening the range of quantum states useful for this task. Through both theoretical analysis and experimental validation in a photonic network, we demonstrate enhanced performance and improved noise resilience.</p>

            <h2>Relaxation of A Thermally Bathed Harmonic Oscillator: A Study Based on the Group-theoretical Formalism</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yan Gu, Jiao Wang</p>
            <p>Quantum dynamics of a damped harmonic oscillator has been extensively studied since the sixties of the last century. Here, with a distinct tool termed the ``group-theoretical characteristic function" (GCF), we investigate analytically how a harmonic oscillator immersed in a thermal environment would relax to its equilibrium state. We assume that the oscillator is at a pure state initially and its evolution is governed by a well-known quantum-optical master equation. By taking advantage of the GCF, the master equation can be transformed into a first-order linear partial differential equation that allows us to write down its solution explicitly. Based on the solution, it is found that, in clear contrast with the monotonic relaxation process of its classical counterpart, the quantum oscillator may demonstrate some intriguing nonmonotonic relaxation characteristics. In particular, when the initial state is a Gaussian state (i.e., a squeezed coherent state), it is found that there is a critical value of the environmental temperature, below which the entropy will first increase to reach its maximum value, then turn down and converge to its equilibrium value from above. For the temperature higher than the critical value, the entropy will converge to its equilibrium value from below monotonically. However, when the initial state is a Fock state, it is found that there is a new phase additional to the previous case, where the time curve of entropy features two extreme points. Namely, the entropy will increase to reach its maximum first, then turn down to reach its minimum, from where it begins to increase and converges to the equilibrium value eventually. Other related issues are discussed as well.</p>

            <h2>Generalized Teleportation Fidelity and Singlet Fraction and their Relation for (In)-distinguishable Particles and Its Applications</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Soumya Das, Goutam Paul, Anindya Banerji</p>
            <p>Quantum teleportation efficiently transfers quantum information between distant locations by utilizing a pre-established composite system. Assessing the effectiveness of teleportation hinges on its fidelity, representing the similarity between input and output states. This fidelity, in turn, relies on a singlet fraction, quantifying the resemblance of the composite system to maximally entangled states. The relation between teleportation fidelity and singlet fraction given by [Horodecki \textit{et al}., Phy. Rev. A \textbf{60}, 1888 (1999)] does not hold for distinguishable particles with multiple degrees of freedom or indistinguishable particles with single or multiple degrees of freedom. In this paper, we propose generalized expressions for teleportation fidelity and singlet fraction and derive their relations, applicable for both distinguishable and indistinguishable particles with single or multiple degrees of freedom. We derive an upper bound for the generalized singlet fraction for distinguishable particles using the monogamy of singlet fraction by [Kay \textit{et al.} Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{103}, 050501 (2009)]. We also show how our relation helps to characterize different types of composite states in terms of their distinguishability, separability, presence of maximally entangled structure, and the number of degrees of freedom. We complement our theory with two practical illustrations. First, we demonstrate two counter-intuitive values of generalized singlet fraction using our optical circuit and the circuit of [Li \textit{et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{120}, 050404 (2018)]. Finally, we show that using an additional degree of freedom as an ancilla instead of a particle can be advantageous in quantum cryptographic protocols.</p>

            <h2>Reduction-induced the Variation of Partial Von Neumann Entropy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jing-Min Zhu</p>
            <p>Whether from theoretical research or from practical research and applications, bipartite mixed-state quantum entanglement (QE) and its measures hold significant theoretical and practical importance. Widely recognized measures such as Entanglement of Formation and Relative Entropy of Entanglement, involve quantifying the minimum QE and reflect the inherently complex nature of their computation. In contrast, Concurrence is applicable only to 2*2 quantum systems, while Negativity is limited to 2*2 and 2*3 quantum systems. In this context, we propose a novel method termed Reduction-induced the Variation of Partial Von Neumann Entropy (RIVPVNE) to quantify QE in bipartite mixed states. The computational complexity associated with this method is minimal. Moreover, it has a wide range of applicability. The intuitive and clear physical representation, combined with straightforward computation, facilitates the exploration of its specific potential applications. Subsequently, we employ this method to investigate the organization and structure of some well-known QEs, analyzing its characteristics through both its physical implication and mathematical structure in comparison to the existing measures for bipartite QE measures, such as Partial Von Neumann Entropy, Concurrence, Negativity, Entanglement of Formation and Relative Entropy of Entanglement.</p>

            <h2>Shadow-Frugal Expectation-Value-Sampling Variational Quantum Generative Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kevin Shen, Andrii Kurkin, Adrián Pérez Salinas, Elvira Shishenina, Vedran Dunjko, Hao Wang</p>
            <p>Expectation Value Samplers (EVSs) are quantum-computer-based generative models that can learn high-dimensional continuous distributions by measuring the expectation values of parameterized quantum circuits regarding selected observables. However, such models may require unaffordable quantum resources for good performance. This work explores the impact of observable choices on the EVS. We introduce an Observable-Tunable Expectation Value Sampler (OT-EVS). The resulting model provides enhanced expressivity as compared to standard EVS. By restricting our selectable observables, it is possible to use the classical shadow measurement scheme to reduce the sample complexity of our algorithm. We further propose an adversarial training method adapted to the needs of OT-EVS. This training prioritizes classical updates of observables, minimizing the more costly updates of quantum circuit parameters. Numerical experiments confirm our model's expressivity and sample efficiency advantages compared to previous designs, using an original simulation technique for correlated shot noise. We envision our proposal to encourage the exploration of continuous generative models running with few quantum resources.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robson Christie, James Trayford</p>
            <p>We explore an unconventional bridge between quantum mechanical density matrices and sound by mapping elements of the density matrix and their phases to auditory signals, thus introducing a framework for Open Quantum Sonification. Employing the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian operator as a basis, each quantum state contributes a frequency proportional to its energy level. The off-diagonal terms, which encode coherence and phase relationships between energy levels, are rendered as binaural signals presented separately to the left and right ears. We illustrate this method within the context of open quantum system dynamics governed by Lindblad equations, presenting first an example of quantum Brownian motion of a particle in a thermal bath, and second, a recoherence process induced by boundary driving that results in spin-helix states. This document serves as a companion to the corresponding audio visual simulations of these models available on the YouTube channel Open Quantum Sonification with the Python Codes on GitHub. The auditory analogy presented here provides an intuitive and experiential means of describing quantum phenomena such as tunnelling, thermalisation, decoherence, and recoherence.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vasileios Evangelakos, Emmanuel Paspalakis, Dionisis Stefanatos</p>
            <p>We consider the problem of maximizing the stored energy for a given charging duration in a quantum battery composed of a pair of spins-$1/2$ with Ising coupling starting from the spin-down state, using bounded transverse field control. We map this problem to an optimal control problem on a single qubit and using optimal control theory we show that, although a single bang pulse can quickly achieve considerable charging levels for relatively large upper control bounds, higher levels of stored energy including complete charging are accomplished by a bang-singular-bang pulse-sequence, where the intermediate singular pulse is an Off pulse. If the control is restricted between zero and a maximum value, the initial and final bang pulses attain the maximum bound but have different durations, while if it is restricted between symmetric negative and positive boundaries, the bang pulses have the same duration but opposite boundary values. For both cases we provide transcendental equations from which the durations of the individual pulses in the optimal pulse-sequence can be calculated. For the case of full charging we surprisingly find that the three ``switching" functions for the equivalent qubit problem become zero while the adjoint ket does not, in consistency with optimal control theory.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Logic Locking (QLL): Safeguarding Intellectual Property for Quantum Circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuntao Liu, Jayden John, Qian Wang</p>
            <p>In recent years, quantum computing has demonstrated superior efficiency to classical computing. In quantum computing, quantum circuits that implement specific quantum functions are crucial for generating correct solutions. Therefore, quantum circuit compilers, which decompose high-level gates into the hardware's native gates and optimize the circuit serve as the bridge from the quantum software stack to the hardware machines. However, untrusted quantum compilers risk stealing original quantum designs (quantum circuits), leading to the theft of sensitive intellectual property (IP). In classical computing, logic locking is a pivotal technique for securing integrated circuits (ICs) against reverse engineering and IP piracy. This technique involves inserting a keyed value into the circuit, ensuring the correct output is achieved only with the correct key. To address similar issues in quantum circuit protection, we propose a method called quantum logic locking, which involves inserting controlled gates to control the function of the quantum circuit. We have expanded on previous work by extending the 1-bit logic key method to a multi-bit key approach, allowing for the use of diverse quantum gates. We have demonstrated the practicality of our method through experiments on a set of benchmark quantum circuits. The effectiveness of quantum logic locking was measured by assessing the divergence distance from the original circuit. Our results demonstrate that quantum logic locking effectively conceals the function of the original quantum circuit, with an average fidelity degradation of less than 1%.</p>

            <h2>Empirical Coordination of Separable Quantum Correlations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hosen Nator, Uzi Pereg</p>
            <p>We introduce the notion of empirical coordination for quantum correlations. Quantum mechanics enables the calculation of probabilities for experimental outcomes, emphasizing statistical averages rather than detailed descriptions of individual events. Empirical coordination is thus a natural framework for quantum systems. Focusing on the cascade network, the optimal coordination rates are established, indicating the minimal resources required to simulate on average a quantum state. As we consider a network with classical communication links, superposition cannot be maintained, hence the quantum correlations are separable (i.e., a convex combination of product states). This precludes entanglement. Providing the users with shared randomness, before communication begins, does not affect the optimal rates for empirical coordination. We begin with a rate characterization for a basic two-node network, and then generalize to a cascade network. The special case of a network with an isolated node is considered as well. The results can be further generalized to other networks as our analysis includes a generic achievability scheme. The optimal rate formula involves optimization over a collection of state extensions. This is a unique feature of the quantum setting, as the classical parallel does not include optimization. As demonstrated through examples, the performance depends heavily on the choice of decomposition. We further discuss the consequences of our results for quantum cooperative games.</p>

            <h2>Dynamic T-decomposition for classical simulation of quantum circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wira Azmoon Ahmad, Matthew Sutcliffe</p>
            <p>It is known that a quantum circuit may be simulated with classical hardware via stabilizer state (T-)decomposition in $O(2^{\alpha t})$ time, given $t$ non-Clifford gates and a decomposition efficiency $\alpha$. The past years have seen a number of papers presenting new decompositions of lower $\alpha$ to reduce this runtime and enable simulation of ever larger circuits. More recently, it has been demonstrated that well placed applications of apparently weaker (higher $\alpha$) decompositions can in fact result in better overall efficiency when paired with the circuit simplification strategies of ZX-calculus. In this work, we take the most generalized T-decomposition (namely vertex cutting), which achieves a poor efficiency of $\alpha=1$, and identify common structures to which applying this can, after simplification via ZX-calculus rewriting, yield very strong effective efficiencies $\alpha_{\text{eff}}\ll1$. By taking into account this broader scope of the ZX-diagram and incorporating the simplification facilitated by the well-motivated cuts, we derive a handful of efficient T-decompositions whose applicabilities are relatively frequent. In benchmarking these new 'dynamic' decompositions against the existing alternatives, we observe a significant reduction in overall $\alpha$ and hence overall runtime for classical simulation, particularly for certain common circuit classes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fumio Uchida, Koichi Miyamoto, Soichiro Yamazaki, Kotaro Fujisawa, Naoki Yoshida</p>
            <p>Fault-tolerant quantum computing is a promising technology to solve linear partial differential equations that are classically demanding to integrate. It is still challenging to solve non-linear equations in fluid dynamics, such as the Burgers equation, using quantum computers. We propose a novel quantum algorithm to solve the Burgers equation. With the Cole-Hopf transformation that maps the fluid velocity field $u$ to a new field $\psi$, we apply a sequence of quantum gates to solve the resulting linear equation and obtain the quantum state $\vert\psi\rangle$ that encodes the solution $\psi$. We also propose an efficient way to extract stochastic properties of $u$, namely the multi-point functions of $u$, from the quantum state of $\vert\psi\rangle$. Our algorithm offers an exponential advantage over the classical finite difference method in terms of the number of spatial grids when a perturbativity condition in the information-extracting step is met.</p>

            <h2>Classical simulability of Clifford+T circuits with Clifford-augmented matrix product states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zejun Liu, Bryan K. Clark</p>
            <p>Generic quantum circuits typically require exponential resources for classical simulation, yet understanding the limits of classical simulability remains a fundamental question. In this work, we investigate the classical simulability of $N$-qubit Clifford circuits doped with $t$ number of $T$-gates by converting the circuits into Clifford-augmented matrix product states (CAMPS). We develop a simple disentangling algorithm to reduce the entanglement of the MPS component in CAMPS using control-Pauli gates, which replaces the standard algorithm relying on heuristic optimization when $t\lesssim N$, ensuring that the entanglement of the MPS component of CAMPS does not increase for $N$ specific $T$-gates. Using a simplified model, we explore in what cases these $N$ $T$-gates happen sufficiently early in the circuit to make classical simulatability of $t$-doped circuits out to $t=N$ possible. We give evidence that in one-dimension where the $T$-gates are uniformly distributed over the qubits and in higher spatial dimensions where the $T$-gates are deep enough we generically expect polynomial or quasi-polynomial simulations when $t \leq N$. We further explore the representability of CAMPS in the regime of $t>N$, uncovering a non-trivial dependence of the MPS entanglement on the distribution of $T$-gates. While it is polynomially efficient to evaluate the expectation of Pauli observable or the quantum magic in CAMPS, we propose algorithms for sampling, probability and amplitude estimation of bitstrings, and evaluation of entanglement Rényi entropy from CAMPS, which, though still having exponential complexity, improve efficiency over the standard MPS simulations. This work establishes a versatile framework based on CAMPS for understanding classical simulatability of $t$-doped circuits and exploring the interplay between quantum entanglement and quantum magic on quantum systems.</p>

            <p>Previous work [Physical Review Letters 114, 213601 (2015)] has shown that thermal light with a blackbody spectrum cannot be decomposed as a mixture of independent localized pulses. We find that thermal light with a flat spectrum, which can occur when spectral filtering is applied, can be decomposed into a direct product of independent localized pulses. Furthermore, we show in the weak-source limit that the first non-vacuum term of thermal light with a flat spectrum is a mixture of independent localized pulses. We quantify the deviation from independent pulses when the spectrum is not flat.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Simulation for Dynamical Transition Rates in Open Quantum Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robson Christie, Kyunghyun Baek, Jeongho Bang, Jaewoo Joo</p>
            <p>Estimating transition rates in open quantum systems is a significant challenge in physics and chemistry due to the exponential increase in computational resources required with the system sizes. Addressing this issue, we introduce a novel and efficient quantum simulation method to compute dynamical transition rates in Markovian open quantum systems. This method reformulates the transition rate expression, represented as the time derivatives of correlation functions, into directly measurable quantities in parametrised mixed-state quantum circuits. This approach allows us to estimate the transition rate more accurately without requiring the computation of the correlation function in a dynamical open quantum system. To validate our approach, we perform quantum simulations experimentally on IBMQ quantum processors for a decohering spin-1/2 model, compared with analytic solutions and quantum numerical simulation. Motivated by quantum chemistry-related applications, we examine our method in one-dimensional Caldeira-Leggett quantum Brownian motion model. Through theoretical and numerical analyses, we address the scalability of our scheme and the promise of significant computational advantages over its classical counterpart. Thus, our new approach holds the potential to surpass the bottlenecks of current quantum chemical research, particularly in accurately predicting molecular reaction rates and designing novel materials on the current and the near-term realisable quantum hardware.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lin Zhang, Bing Xie, Yuanhong Tao</p>
            <p>The study of quantum states frequently examines the connection between non-local effects in quantum mechanics and quantities that remain unchanged under local unitary transformations. Among these concepts, local unitary equivalence, defined through local unitary transformations, holds significant importance in quantum state classification and resource theory. This paper focuses on the fundamental issue of local unitary equivalence for multipartite quantum states within quantum information theory, with the aim of identifying the comprehensive set of invariants that define their local unitary orbits. These invariants are crucial for deriving polynomial invariants and describing physical properties that remain invariant under local unitary transformations. Specifically, the research delves into the characterization of local unitary equivalence and the detection of entanglement using local unitary Bargmann invariants, utilizing the generalized Schur-Weyl duality to analyze tensor product symmetries. Taking the two-qubit system as an example, our study demonstrates the measurability of the invariants that determine local unitary equivalence and establishes a relationship between Makhlin's fundamental invariants (a complete set of 18 local unitary invariants for two-qubit states) and local unitary Bargmann invariants. These Bargmann invariants are related to the trace of density operator products with marginal states and can be measured through a cycle test, an extension of the SWAP this http URL findings offer a practical criterion for entanglement detection based on local unitary Bargmann invariants, contributing to the advancement of quantum information theory and its applications.</p>

            <p>Krylov quantum diagonalization methods for ground state energy estimation have emerged as a compelling use case for quantum computers. However, many existing methods rely on subroutines, in particular the Hadamard test, that are challenging on near-term quantum hardware. Motivated by this problem, we present a quantum Krylov method that uses only time evolutions and recovery probabilities, making it well adapted for current quantum computers. This is supplemented with a classical post-processing derivative estimation algorithm. The method ultimately estimates the eigenvalues of the commutator super-operator $X\to[H,X]$, so we declare it a super-Krylov method. We propose applying this method to estimate the ground-state energy of two classes of Hamiltonians: where either the highest energy is easily computable, or where the lowest and highest energies have the same absolute value. We prove that the resulting ground energy estimate converges in the noise-free regime and provide a classical numerical demonstration of the method in the presence of noise.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Approximate Optimisation Applied to Graph Similarity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicholas J. Pritchard</p>
            <p>Quantum computing promises solutions to classically difficult and new-found problems through controlling the subtleties of quantum computing. The Quantum Approximate Optimisation Algorithm (QAOA) is a recently proposed quantum algorithm designed to tackle difficult combinatorial optimisation problems utilising both quantum and classical computation. The hybrid nature, generality and typically low gate-depth make it a strong candidate for near-term implementation in quantum computing. Finding the practical limits of the algorithm is currently an open problem. Until now, no tools to facilitate the design and validation of probabilistic quantum optimisation algorithms such as the QAOA on a non-trivial scale exist. Graph similarity is a long standing classically difficult problem withstanding decades of research from academia and industry. Determining the maximal edge overlap between all possible node label permutations is an NP-Complete task and provides an apt measure of graph similarity. We introduce a novel quantum optimisation simulation package facilitating investigation of all constituent components of the QAOA from desktop to cluster scale using graph similarity as an example. Our simulation provides flexibility and performance. We investigate eight classical optimisation methods each at six levels of decomposition. Moreover an encoding for permutation based problems such as graph similarity through edge overlap to the QAOA allows for significant quantum memory savings at the cost of additional operations. This compromise extends into the classical portion of the algorithm as the inclusion of infeasible solutions creates a challenging cost-function landscape. We present performance analysis of our simulation and of the QAOA setting a precedent for investigating and validating numerous other difficult problems to the QAOA as we move towards realising practical quantum computation.</p>

            <p>In quantum state discrimination, nonlocality arises when the optimal state discrimination cannot be realized by local operations and classical communication. Recently, it has been found that the postmeasurement information about the subensemble containing the prepared state can annihilate or create nonlocality in quantum state discrimination. Here, we show that annihilation or creation of nonlocality in quantum state discrimination can depend on the choice of subensembles provided by postmeasurement information. We establish sufficient conditions that annihilating or creating nonlocality depends on the choice of subensembles provided by postmeasurement information. We further provide bipartite quantum state ensembles satisfying these conditions to illustrate our results.</p>

            <p>Achieving fast and high-fidelity qubit operations is crucial for unlocking the potential of quantum computers. In particular, reaching low gate errors in two-qubit gates has been a long-standing challenge in the field of superconducting qubits due to their typically long duration relative to coherence times. To realize fast gates, we utilize the hybridization between fixed-frequency superconducting qubits with a strongly interacting coupler mode that is tunable in frequency. To reduce population leakage during required adiabatic passages through avoided level crossings, we employ a sensitivity-adaptive closed-loop optimization method to design complex pulse shapes. We compare the performance of Gaussian-square, Fourier-series, and piecewise-constant-slope (PiCoS) pulse parametrizations and are able to reach 99.9 % controlled-Z gate fidelity using a 64 ns long Fourier-series pulse defined by only seven parameters. These high-fidelity values are achieved by analyzing the optimized pulse shapes to identify and systematically mitigate signal-line distortions in the experiment. To improve the convergence speed of the optimization we implement an adaptive cost function, which continuously maximizes the sensitivity. The demonstrated method can be used for tune-up and recalibration of superconducting quantum processors.</p>

            <p>Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have attracted remarkable interest over the past few years because of their potential computational advantages on near-term quantum devices. They leverage a hybrid approach that integrates classical and quantum computing resources to solve high-dimensional problems that are challenging for classical approaches alone. In the training process of variational circuits, constructing an accurate probability distribution for each epoch is not always necessary, creating opportunities to reduce computational costs through shot reduction. However, existing shot-allocation methods that capitalize on this potential often lack adaptive feedback or are tied to specific classical optimizers, which limits their applicability to common VQAs and broader optimization techniques. Our observations indicate that the information entropy of a quantum circuit's output distribution exhibits an approximately exponential relationship with the number of shots needed to achieve a target Hellinger distance. In this work, we propose a distribution-adaptive dynamic shot (DDS) framework that efficiently adjusts the number of shots per iteration in VQAs using the entropy distribution from the prior training epoch. Our results demonstrate that the DDS framework sustains inference accuracy while achieving a ~50% reduction in average shot count compared to fixed-shot training, and ~60% higher accuracy than recently proposed tiered shot allocation methods. Furthermore, in noisy simulations that reflect the error rates of actual IBM quantum systems, DDS achieves approximately a ~30% reduction in the total number of shots compared to the fixed-shot method with minimal degradation in accuracy, and offers about ~70% higher computational accuracy than tiered shot allocation methods.</p>

            <p>Coupled spins form composite quantum systems which play an important role in many quantum technology applications, with an essential task often being the efficient generation of entanglement between two constituent qubits. The simplest such system is a pair of spins-$1/2$ coupled with Ising interaction, and in previous works various quantum control methods such as adiabatic processes, shortcuts to adiabaticity and optimal control have been employed to quickly generate there one of the maximally entangled Bell states. In this study, we use machine learning and optimization methods to produce maximally entangled states in minimum time, with the Rabi frequency and the detuning used as bounded control functions. We do not target a specific maximally entangled state, like the preceding studies, but rather find the controls which maximize the concurrence, leading thus automatically the system to the closest such state in shorter time. By increasing the bounds of the control functions we observe that the corresponding optimally selected maximally entangled state also changes and the necessary time to reach it is reduced. The present work demonstrates also that machine learning and optimization offer efficient and flexible techniques for the fast generation of entanglement in coupled spin systems, and we plan to extent it to systems involving more spins, for example spin chains.</p>

Such measurement has remained elusive thus far due to the inherent difficulty in measuring the total energy change of a system-bath compound (which is the work) in the open quantum system scenario. We overcome this difficulty by extending the interferometric scheme, originally conceived for closed systems, to the open system case and implement it on a superconducting quantum computer, taking advantage of the relatively high levels of noise on current quantum hardware to realize an open quantum system. We demonstrate that the method can be used as a diagnostic tool to probe physical properties of the system-bath compound, such as its temperature and specific transitions frequencies in its spectrum. Our experiments corroborate that the interferometric scheme is a promising tool to achieve the long-sought experimental validation of the Jarzynski equality for arbitrary open quantum systems.</p>

For heterogeneous structures, however, these effects are not completely characterized. In this article, we train tensor networks with different geometries to encode a random quantum state, and see that densely connected structures achieve better infidelities than more sparse structures, with higher success rates and less time. Additionally, we give some general insight on how to improve memory requirements on these sparse structures and its impact on the trainings. Finally, as we use HPC resources for the calculations, we discuss the requirements for this approach and showcase performance improvements with GPU acceleration on a last-generation supercomputer.</p>

            <p>Understanding how physical systems are influenced by disorder is a fundamental challenge in quantum science. Addressing its effects often involves numerical averaging over a large number of samples, and it is not always easy to gain an analytical handle on exploring the effect of disorder. In this work, we derive exact solutions for disorder-averaged dynamics generated by any Hamiltonian that is a periodic matrix (potentially with non-trivial base, a property also called ($p,q$)-potency). Notably, this approach is independent of the initial state, exact for arbitrary evolution times, and it holds for Hermitian as well as non-Hermitian systems. The ensemble behavior resembles that of an open quantum system, whose decoherence function or rates are determined by the disorder distribution and the periodicity of the Hamiltonian. Depending on the underlying distribution, the dynamics can display non-Markovian characteristics detectable through non-Markovian witnesses. We illustrate the scheme for qubit and qudit systems described by (products of) spin $1/2$, spin $1$, and clock operators. Our methodology offers a framework to leverage disorder-averaged exact dynamics for a range of applications in quantum-information processing and beyond.</p>

Among them, trapped ions offer exceptional performance in sensing electric fields, which has been used in particular to probe these in the proximity of metallic surfaces. However, the flexibility of previous work was limited by the use of radio-frequency trapping fields, which has restricted spatial scanning to linear translations, and calls into question whether observed phenomena are connected to the presence of the radio-frequency fields. Here, using a Penning trap instead, we demonstrate a single ion probe which offers three-dimensional position scanning at distances between $50$ $\mu\mathrm{m}$ and $450$ $\mu\mathrm{m}$ from a metallic surface and above a $200\times200$ $\mu\mathrm{m}^{2}$ area, allowing us to reconstruct static and time-varying electric as well as magnetic fields.

            <p>Scalable quantum networks rely on optical connections between long-lived qubits to distribute entanglement. Tin vacancies in diamond have emerged as promising long-lived qubits, offering extended spin coherence times at liquid helium temperatures and spin-dependent, highly coherent optical transitions for effective photon-based communication. Connecting remote nodes requires quantum interference of indistinguishable photons, which is challenging in an inhomogeneous solid-state environment. Here, we demonstrate a two-node experiment with tin vacancies in diamond, which exhibit a resonant frequency distribution spanning approximately 8 GHz. To overcome the frequency mismatch, we tune the resonant frequencies of one node using the Stark effect. We achieve tunability up to 4 GHz while maintaining optical coherence. As a demonstration, we achieve detuning-dependent remote two-photon interference between separate nodes, obtaining 80(6)% interference visibility without postprocessing when the defects' optical transitions are tuned into resonance, and 63(8)% with detuning up to 20 times their natural linewidths.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Veronika Baumann, Ämin Baumeler, Eleftherios-Ermis Tselentis</p>
            <p>In standard quantum theory, the causal relations between operations are fixed and determined by the spacetime structure. Relaxing this notion of fixed causal order has been studied extensively over the past years. A first departure allows for dynamical arrangements, where operations can influence the causal relations of future operations, as certified by violation of fixed-order inequalities. A second non-causal departure relaxes even these limitations, and is certified by violations of causal inequalities. The quantum switch, which allows a party to coherently control the order in which operations are applied, is known to be incapable of violating causal inequalities. It was therefore believed that a device-independent certification of the causal indefiniteness in the quantum switch requires extended setups incorporating spacelike separation. Here, we show that the quantum switch violates fixed-order inequalities without exploiting its indefinite nature. Concretely, we study the $k$-cycle inequalities and introduce multi-party generalizations of the quantum switch tailored to these fixed-order inequalities. We further show that, when removing the dynamical aspect, $k$-cycle inequalities become novel, facet-defining, causal inequalities. On the one hand, this means that violating $k$-cycle inequalities under this restriction requires non-causal setups. On the other hand, since $k$-cycle inequalities are just one example of fixed-order inequalities, this reopens the possibility for a device-independent certification of the quantum switch in isolation.</p>

We observe that gradient descent becomes permanently trapped in local minima that have been avoided by evolutionary algorithms in all tested datasets, reaching up to a six-fold decrease in prediction error.

            <p>The Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) center in diamond is an intriguing electronic spin system with applications in quantum radiometry, sensing and computation. In those experiments, a bias magnetic field is commonly applied along the NV symmetry axis to eliminate the triplet ground state manifold's degeneracy (S=1). In this configuration, the eigenvectors of the NV spin's projection along its axis are called strong-axial field states. Conversely, in some experiments a weak magnetic field is applied orthogonal to the NV symmetry axis, leading to eigenstates that are balanced linear superpositions of strong-axial field states, referred to as dressed states. The latter are sensitive to environmental magnetic noise at the second order, allowing to perform magnetic field protected measurements while providing increased coherence times. However, if a small axial magnetic field is added in this regime, the linear superposition of strong-axial field states becomes unbalanced. This paper presents a comprehensive study of Free Induction Decay (FID) measurements performed on a NV center ensemble in the presence of strain and weak orthogonal magnetic field, as a function of a small magnetic field applied along the NV symmetry axis. The simultaneous detection of dressed states and unbalanced superpositions of strong-axial field states in a single FID measurement is shown, gaining insight about coherence time, nuclear spin and the interplay between temperature and magnetic field sensitivity. The discussion concludes by describing how the simultaneous presence of magnetically-sensitive and -insensitive states opens up appealing possibilities for both sensing and quantum computation applications.</p>

            <p>Frequency-bin encoding furnishes a compelling pathway for quantum information processing systems compatible with established lightwave infrastructures based on fiber-optic transmission and wavelength-division multiplexing. Yet although significant progress has been realized in proof-of-principle tabletop demonstrations, ranging from arbitrary single-qubit gates to controllable multiphoton interference, challenges in scaling frequency-bin processors to larger systems remain. In this Perspective, we highlight recent advances at the intersection of frequency-bin encoding and integrated photonics that are fundamentally transforming the outlook for scalable frequency-based quantum information. Focusing specifically on results on sources, state manipulation, and hyperentanglement, we envision a possible future in which on-chip frequency-bin circuits fulfill critical roles in quantum information processing, particularly in communications and networking.</p>

            <h2>ShotQC: Reducing Sampling Overhead in Quantum Circuit Cutting</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Po-Hung Chen, Dah-Wei Chiou, Jie-Hong Roland Jiang</p>
            <p>The recent \emph{quantum circuit cutting} technique enables simulating large quantum circuits on distributed smaller devices, significantly extending the capabilities of current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. However, this method incurs substantial classical postprocessing and additional quantum resource demands, as both postprocessing complexity and sampling overhead scale exponentially with the number of cuts introduced. In this work, we propose an enhanced circuit cutting framework \emph{ShotQC} with effective sampling overhead reduction. It effectively reduces sampling overhead through two key optimizations: \emph{shot distribution} and \emph{cut parameterization}. The former employs an adaptive Monte Carlo method to dynamically allocate more quantum resources to subcircuit configurations that contribute more to variance in the final outcome. The latter leverages additional degrees of freedom in postprocessing to further suppress variance. By integrating these optimization methods, ShotQC achieves significant reductions in sampling overhead without increasing classical postprocessing complexity, as demonstrated on a range of benchmark circuits.</p>

            <p>Building upon recent progress in Lindblad engineering for quantum Gibbs state preparation algorithms, we propose a simplified protocol that is shown to be efficient under the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). The ETH reduces circuit overhead of the Lindblad simulation algorithm and ensures a fast convergence toward the target Gibbs state. Moreover, we show that the realized Lindblad dynamics exhibits resilience against depolarizing noise, opening up the path to a first demonstration on quantum computers. We complement our claims with numerical studies of the algorithm's convergence in various regimes of the mixed-field Ising model. In line with our predictions, we observe a mixing time scaling polynomially with system size when the ETH is satisfied. In addition, we assess the impact of algorithmic and hardware-induced errors on the algorithm's performance by carrying out quantum circuit simulations of our Lindblad simulation protocol with realistic noise models. This work bridges the gap between recent theoretical advances in Gibbs state preparation algorithms and their eventual quantum hardware implementation.</p>

The proposed technique allows to disseminate secure and precise TF signals between two fiber-opticconnected locations, on a critical infrastructure, using both QKD and White Rabbit technique. This secure exchange allows the secret sharing of time information between two parties for the synchronization of distant clocks with the highest stability and traceable to the Italian time scale. When encrypted, time signals would reveal to a third party no useful information about the synchronization status, providing a time stability two orders of magnitude worsened.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jacob F.F. Bulmer, Javier Martínez-Cifuentes, Bryn A. Bell, Nicolás Quesada</p>
            <p>To understand quantum optics experiments, we must perform calculations that consider the principal sources of noise, such as losses, spectral impurity and partial distinguishability. In both discrete and continuous variable systems, these can be modeled as mixed Gaussian states over multiple modes. The modes are not all resolved by photon-number measurements and so require calculations on coarse-grained photon-number distribution. Existing methods can lead to a combinatorial explosion in the time complexity, making this task unfeasible for even moderate sized experiments of interest. In this work, we prove that the computation of this type of distributions can be done in exponential time, providing a combinatorial speedup. We develop numerical techniques that allow us to determine coarse-grained photon number distributions of Gaussian states, as well as density matrix elements of heralded non-Gaussian states prepared in the presence of spectral impurity and partial distinguishability. These results offer significant speed-up and accuracy improvements to validation tests of both Fock and Gaussian boson samplers that rely on binned probability distributions. Moreover, they pave the way to a more efficient simulation of realistic photonic circuits, unlocking the ability to perform exact calculations at scales which were previously out of reach. In addition to this, our results, including loop Hafnian master theorems, may be of interest to the fields of combinatorics and graph theory.</p>

            <p>Harnessing the potential computational advantage of quantum computers for machine learning tasks relies on the uploading of classical data onto quantum computers through what are commonly referred to as quantum encodings. The choice of such encodings may vary substantially from one task to another, and there exist only a few cases where structure has provided insight into their design and implementation, such as symmetry in geometric quantum learning. Here, we propose the perspective that category theory offers a natural mathematical framework for analyzing encodings that respect structure inherent in datasets and learning tasks. We illustrate this with pedagogical examples, which include geometric quantum machine learning, quantum metric learning, topological data analysis, and more. Moreover, our perspective provides a language in which to ask meaningful and mathematically precise questions for the design of quantum encodings and circuits for quantum machine learning tasks.</p>

            <h2>Variational Quantum Simulation of Anyonic Chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ananda Roy</p>
            <p>Anyonic chains provide lattice realizations of a rich set of quantum field theories in two space-time dimensions. The latter play a central role in the investigation of generalized symmetries, renormalization group flows and numerous exotic phases of strongly-correlated systems. Here, a variational quantum simulation scheme is presented for the analysis of those anyonic chains which can be mapped to the restricted solid-on-solid~(RSOS) models of Andrews, Baxter and Forrester. An~$L_R$ site RSOS model associated with a Dynkin diagram containing~$p$ nodes is realized with~$L_R\lceil\ln_2 p\rceil$ qubits, where~$\lceil x\rceil$ is the smallest integer~$\geq x$. The scheme is benchmarked by realizing the ground states of RSOS Hamiltonians in the~$A_p$ family for~$4\leq p\leq8$ using a variational quantum-classical algorithm. The latter is based on the Euler-Cartan circuit ansatz. Topological symmetry operators are analyzed for the RSOS models at the quantum-critical points. Measurement of observables acting on~$\lceil\ln_2 p\rceil$ qubits is shown to capture the anyonic nature of the Hilbert space. The described quantum simulation scheme provides a systematic approach to give rise to a large family of quantum field theories which have largely eluded physical realizations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amin Shiraz Gilani, Daochen Wang, Pei Wu, Xingyu Zhou</p>
            <p>The edge list model is arguably the simplest input model for graphs, where the graph is specified by a list of its edges. In this model, we study the quantum query complexity of three variants of the triangle finding problem. The first asks whether there exists a triangle containing a target edge and raises general questions about the hiding of a problem's input among irrelevant data. The second asks whether there exists a triangle containing a target vertex and raises general questions about the shuffling of a problem's input. The third asks for finding a triangle in the input edge list; this problem bridges the $3$-distinctness and $3$-sum problems, which have been extensively studied by both cryptographers and complexity theorists. We provide tight or nearly tight results for all of our problems as well as some first answers to the general questions they raise. In particular, given a graph with low maximum degree, such as a random sparse graph, we prove that the quantum query complexity of triangle finding in its length-$m$ edge list is $m^{5/7 \pm o(1)}$. We prove the lower bound in Zhandry's recording query framework [CRYPTO '19] and the upper bound by adapting Belovs's learning graph algorithm for $3$-distinctness [FOCS '12].</p>

            <h2>Power-optimized amplitude modulation for robust trapped-ion entangling gates: a study of gate-timing errors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luke Ellert-Beck, Wenchao Ge</p>
            <p>Trapped-ion systems are a promising route toward the realization of both near-term and universal quantum computers. However, one of the pressing challenges is improving the fidelity of two-qubit entangling gates. These operations are often implemented by addressing individual ions with laser pulses using the Molmer-Sorensen (MS) protocol. Amplitude modulation (AM) is a well-studied extension of this protocol, where the amplitude of the laser pulses is controlled as a function of time. We present an analytical study of AM, using a Fourier series expansion to maintain the generality of the laser amplitude's functional form. We then apply this general AM method to gate-timing errors by imposing conditions on these Fourier coefficients, producing trade-offs between the laser power and fidelity at a fixed gate time. The conditions derived here are linear and can be used, in principle, to achieve arbitrarily high orders of insensitivity to gate-timing errors. Numerical optimization is then employed to identify the minimum-power pulse satisfying these constraints. Our central result is that the leading order dependence on gate timing errors is improved from $\mathcal{O}(\Delta t^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(\Delta t^6)$ with the addition of one linear constraint on the Fourier coefficients and to $\mathcal{O}(\Delta t^{10})$ with two linear constraints without a significant increase in the average laser power. The increase approaches zero as more Fourier coefficients are included. In further studies, this protocol can be applied to other error sources and used in conjunction with other error-mitigation techniques to improve two-qubit gates.</p>

            <p>Phase transitions are fundamental in nature. A small parameter change near a critical point leads to a qualitative change in system properties. Across a regular phase transition, the system remains in thermal equilibrium and, therefore, experiences a change of static properties, like the emergence of a magnetisation upon cooling a ferromagnet below the Curie temperature. When driving a system far from equilibrium, novel, otherwise inaccessible quantum states of matter may arise. Such states are typically non-Hermitian, that is, their dynamics break time-reversal symmetry, a basic law of equilibrium physics. Phase transitions in non-Hermitian systems are of fundamentally new nature in that the dynamical behaviour rather than static properties may undergo a qualitative change at a critical, here called exceptional point. Here we experimentally realize a non-Hermitian phase transition in a bulk condensed-matter system. Optical excitation creates charge carriers in the ferromagnetic semiconductor EuO. In a temperature-dependent interplay with the Hermitian transition to ferromagnetic order, a non-Hermitian change of the relaxation dynamics occurs, manifesting in our time-resolved reflection data as a transition from bi-exponential real to single-exponential complex decay. Our theory models this behavior and predicts non-Hermitian phase transitions for a large class of condensed-matter systems, where they may be exploited to sensitively control bulk-dynamic properties.</p>

            <p>InAs on Insulator (InAsOI) has recently been demonstrated as a promising platform to develop hybrid semiconducting-superconducting electronics, which features an InAs epilayer grown onto a cryogenic insulating InAlAs metamorphic buffer. The miniaturization of Si microchips has progressed significantly due to the integration of high permittivity (high-k) gate insulators, compared to the conventional thermally-growth SiO2. Here, we investigate the gate-tunable electrical properties of InAsOI-based Josephson Field Effect Transistors (JoFETs) featuring different high-k gate insulators, namely, HfO2 and Al2O3. With both dielectrics, the JoFETs can entirely suppress the switching current and increase the normal state resistance by 10-20 times using negative gate voltages. The HfO2-JoFETs exhibit improved gate-tunable electrical performance compared to those achieved with Al2O3-JoFETs, which is related to the higher permittivity of the insulator. Gate-dependent electrical properties of InAsOI-based JoFETs were evaluated in the temperature range from 50 mK to 1 K. Moreover, under the influence of an out-of-plane magnetic field, JoFETs exhibited an unconventional Fraunhofer diffraction pattern.</p>

We introduce the experimental configuration and report new world-leading constraints on the interactions of sub-MeV dark matter particles with masses as low as 30 keV. The thin-layer geometry of the system provides anisotropy in the interaction rate, enabling directional sensitivity. In addition, we leverage the coupling between phonons and quasiparticles in the detector to simultaneously constrain interactions with both electrons and nucleons.

            <p>The negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center is one of the most significant and widely studied defects in diamond that plays a prominent role in quantum technologies. The precise engineering of the location and concentration of NV centers is of great importance in quantum technology applications. To this end, irradiation techniques such as nitrogen-molecule ion implantation are applied. Recent studies have reported enhanced NV center creation and activation efficiencies introduced by nitrogen molecule ion implantation in doped diamond layers, where the maximum creation efficiency at $\sim75$\% has been achieved in sulfur-doped layers. However, the microscopic mechanisms behind these observations and the limits of the efficiencies are far from understood. In this study, we employ hybrid density functional theory calculations to compute the formation energies, charge transition levels, and the magneto-optical properties of various sulfur defects in diamond where we also consider the interaction of sulfur and hydrogen in chemical vapor-deposited diamond layers. Our results imply that the competition between the donor substitutional sulfur and the hyper-deep acceptor sulfur-vacancy complex is an important limiting factor on the creation efficiency of the NV center in diamond. However, both species are able to trap interstitial hydrogen from diamond, which favorably mediates the creation of NV centers in chemical vapor-deposited diamond layers.</p>

            <p>Rydberg sensors offer a unique approach to radio frequency (RF) detection, leveraging the high sensitivity and quantum properties of highly-excited atomic states to achieve performance levels beyond classical technologies. Non-linear responses and distortion behavior in Rydberg atom receivers are critical to evaluating and establishing performance metrics and capabilities such as spur-free dynamic range and tolerance to unwanted interfering signals. We report here on the measurement and characterization of non-linear behavior and spurious response of a Rydberg atomic heterodyne receiver. Single-tone and two-tone testing procedures are developed and implemented for measurement of harmonic and inter-modulation distortion in Rydberg atomic receivers based on multi-photon Rydberg spectroscopy and radio-frequency heterodyne signal detection and demodulation in an atomic vapor. For a predetermined set of atomic receiver parameters and RF carrier wave in the SHF band near-resonant to a cesium Rydberg transition, we measure and characterize atomic receiver selectivity, bandwidth, roll-off, compression point (P1dB), second-order (IP2) and third-order (IP3) intercepts, and spur-free dynamic range. Receiver intermodulation distortion is characterized for the case of an interfering signal wave applied at two frequency offsets relative to the near-resonant reference local oscillator, $\Delta F/F= 10^{-4}$ at 6dB and $10^{-6}$ at 22dB single-tone bandwidths, respectively. We observe that under suitable operating conditions the atomic receiver can exhibit a suppression of harmonic and inter-modulation distortion relative to that of classical receiver mixer amplifiers. Finally, we describe how the non-linear behaviors of atomic receivers can provide unique, controllable RF signatures inaccessible by classical counterparts and propose their use to realize secure communication modalities and applications.</p>

            <p>The accurate treatment of non-covalent interactions is necessary to model a wide range of applications, from molecular crystals to surface catalysts to aqueous solutions and many more. Quantum diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) and coupled cluster theory with single, double and perturbative triple excitations [CCSD(T)] are considered two widely-trusted methods for treating non-covalent interactions. However, while they have been well-validated for small molecules, recent work has indicated that these two methods can disagree by more than $7.5\,$kcal/mol for larger systems. The origin of this discrepancy remains unknown. Moreover, the lack of systematic comparisons, particularly for medium-sized complexes, has made it difficult to identify which systems may be prone to such disagreements and the potential scale of these differences. In this work, we leverage the latest developments in DMC to compute interaction energies for the entire S66 dataset, containing 66 medium-sized complexes with a balanced representation of dispersion and electrostatic interactions. Comparison to previous CCSD(T) references reveals systematic trends, with DMC predicting stronger binding than CCSD(T) for electrostatic-dominated systems, while the binding becomes weaker for dispersion-dominated systems. We show that the relative strength of this discrepancy is correlated to the ratio of electrostatic and dispersion interactions, as obtained from energy decomposition analysis methods. Finally, we pinpoint systems in the S66 dataset where these discrepancies are particularly prominent, offering cost-effective benchmarks to guide future developments in DMC, CCSD(T) as well as the wider electronic structure theory community.</p>

            <p>In quantum many-body systems, time-evolved states typically remain confined to a smaller region of the Hilbert space known as the $\textit{Krylov subspace}$. The time evolution can be mapped onto a one-dimensional problem of a particle moving on a chain, where the average position $\langle n \rangle$ defines Krylov state complexity or spread complexity. Generalized spread complexities, associated with higher-order moments $\langle n^p \rangle$ for $p>1$, provide finer insights into the dynamics. We investigate the time evolution of generalized spread complexities following a quantum quench in random matrix theory. The quench is implemented by transitioning from an initial random Hamiltonian to a post-quench Hamiltonian obtained by dividing it into four blocks and flipping the sign of the off-diagonal blocks. This setup captures universal features of chaotic quantum quenches. When the initial state is the thermofield double state of the post-quench Hamiltonian, a peak in spread complexity preceding equilibration signals level repulsion, a hallmark of quantum chaos. We examine the robustness of this peak for other initial states, such as the ground state or the thermofield double state of the pre-quench Hamiltonian. To quantify this behavior, we introduce a measure based on the peak height relative to the late-time saturation value. In the continuous limit, higher-order complexities show increased sensitivity to the peak, supported by numerical simulations for finite-size random matrices.</p>

            <p>In this paper we consider the effect of quantum entanglement and coherence on the radiated intensity from a gas and its absorption capacity at thermal equilibrium or, more generally, under conditions where no population inversion exists. As was shown by Dicke (1954), although entangled states and coherence can lead to superradiance for specific modes of radiation, they can also bring subradiance through significant energy trapping in slow and dark states. While a finite separation between the atoms composing the gas will cause leaking of the trapped energy, we show how the combination of thermal equilibrium and quantum coherence mitigates this effect and leads to significantly reduced radiation intensity from the gas, rendering it dark and collision-less. Furthermore, we show how under the same conditions absorption of a radiation field incident on the gas can lead to higher attenuation levels than those predicted with Beer's law. Beer's law is recovered in the limit of complete decoherence. We apply our analysis to the atomic hydrogen 21 cm line and, considering the gas densities expected in Dark Matter halos, we find that quantum entanglement and coherence can potentially account for some of the Dark Matter known exist in these environments.</p>

            <h2>Long-Time Behavior of Typical Pure States from Thermal Equilibrium Ensembles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cornelia Vogel</p>
            <p>We consider an isolated macroscopic quantum system in a pure state $\psi_t\in\mathcal{H}$ evolving unitarily in a separable Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$. Following von Neumann [46], we assume that different macro states $\nu$ correspond to mutually orthogonal subspaces $\mathcal{H}_\nu\subset\mathcal{H}$. Let $P_\nu$ be the projection to $\mathcal{H}_\nu$. ''Normal typicality'' is the statement (true for some Hamiltonians) that for all initial states $\psi_0\in\mathcal{H}$ and most $t\geq 0$, $\|P_\nu\psi_t\|^2$ is close to $d_\nu/D$, where $d_\nu=\dim\mathcal{H}_\nu$ and $D=\dim\mathcal{H}<\infty$. It can be shown [42] that the statement becomes valid for all Hamiltonians if ''all $\psi_0\in\mathcal{H}$'' is replaced by ''most $\psi_0\in\mathcal{H}_\mu$'' (most w.r.t. the uniform distribution on the sphere of $\mathcal{H}_\mu$) with an arbitrary macro state $\mu$ and $d_\nu/D$ by a $t$- and $\psi_0$-independent quantity $M_{\mu\nu}$. In the present work, we generalize this result from the uniform distribution to a much more general class of measures, so-called GAP measures. Let $\rho$ be a density matrix on $\mathcal{H}$. Then GAP$(\rho)$ is the most spread out distribution on the sphere of $\mathcal{H}$ with density matrix $\rho$. If $\rho$ is a canonical density matrix, GAP$(\rho)$ arises as the thermal equilibrium distribution of wave functions and can be viewed as a quantum analog of the canonical ensemble. We show that also for GAP$(\rho)$-most $\psi_0\in\mathcal{H}$, the superposition weight $\|P_\nu\psi_t\|^2$ is close to a fixed value $M_{\rho P_\nu}$ for most $t\geq0$. Moreover, we prove a similar result for arbitrary bounded operators $B$ instead of $P_\nu$ and for finite times. The main ingredient of the proof is an improvement of bounds on the variance of $\langle\psi|B|\psi\rangle$ w.r.t. GAP$(\rho)$ which were first obtained by Reimann [29] and slightly generalized in [44].</p>

            <p>Contextuality is a distinguishing feature of quantum mechanics and there is growing evidence that it is a necessary condition for quantum advantage. In order to make use of it, researchers have been asking whether similar phenomena arise in other domains. The answer has been yes, e.g. in behavioural sciences. However, one has to move to frameworks that take some degree of signalling into account. Two such frameworks exist: (1) a signalling-corrected sheaf theoretic model, and (2) the Contextuality-by-Default (CbD) framework. This paper provides the first large scale experimental evidence for a yes answer in natural language. We construct a linguistic schema modelled over a contextual quantum scenario, instantiate it in the Simple English Wikipedia and extract probability distributions for the instances using the large language model BERT. This led to the discovery of 77,118 sheaf-contextual and 36,938,948 CbD contextual instances. We proved that the contextual instances came from semantically similar words, by deriving an equation between degrees of contextuality and Euclidean distances of BERT's embedding vectors. A regression model further reveals that Euclidean distance is indeed the best statistical predictor of contextuality. Our linguistic schema is a variant of the co-reference resolution challenge. These results are an indication that quantum methods may be advantageous in language tasks.</p>

The technique is inspired by recent developments in the application of quantum parameter estimation theory to semiclassical imaging problems. We find that the image inversion technique requires special polarization filtering to account for the dipolar nature of the emission. Using an azimuthal polarizer, we obtain improvements in the Fisher information of point-source separation by over an order of magnitude relative to direct imaging. Unlike established super-resolution fluorescence techniques, the method does not require sequential photoswitching/blinking of the fluorophores, and thus could facilitate significant speed-ups for certain biological imaging/tracking tasks.</p>

            <h2>Instanton-Induced Supersymmetry Breaking in Topological Semimetals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> W. B. Rui, Y. X. Zhao, Z. D. Wang</p>
            <p>Supersymmetry (SUSY) proposed as an elementary symmetry for physics beyond the Standard Model has found important applications in various areas outside high-energy physics. Here, we systematically implement supersymmetric quantum mechanics -- exhibiting fundamental SUSY properties in the simple setting of quantum mechanics -- into a wide range of topological semimetals, where the broken translational symmetry, e.g., by a magnetic field, is effectively captured by a SUSY potential. We show that the dynamical SUSY breaking via the instanton effect over the SUSY potential valleys works as the underlying mechanism for the gap opening of the topological semimetallic phases, and the magnitude of the instanton effect is proportional to the energy gap. This instanton mechanism provides a simple criterion for determining whether the energy gap has been opened, without resorting to detailed calculations, i.e., a finite energy gap is opened if and only if the SUSY potential has an even number of zeros. Our theory leads to previously unexpected results: even an infinitesimal magnetic field can open a gap in topologically robust Dirac, Weyl, and nodal-line semimetallic phases due to the dynamical SUSY breaking. Overall, the revealed connection between SUSY quantum mechanics and non-uniform topological semimetals can elucidate previously ambiguous phenomena, provide guidance for future investigations, and open a new avenue for exploring topological semimetals.</p>

            <h2>Projected Entangled Pair States for Lattice Gauge Theories with Dynamical Fermions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ariel Kelman, Umberto Borla, Patrick Emonts, Erez Zohar</p>
            <p>Lattice gauge theory is an important framework for studying gauge theories that arise in the Standard Model and condensed matter physics. Yet many systems (or regimes of those systems) are difficult to study using conventional techniques, such as action-based Monte Carlo sampling. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of gauged Gaussian projected entangled pair states as an ansatz for a lattice gauge theory involving dynamical physical matter. We study a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory on a two dimensional lattice with a single flavor of fermionic matter on each lattice site. Our results show agreement with results computed by exactly diagonalizing the Hamiltonian, and demonstrate that the approach is computationally feasible for larger system sizes where exact results are unavailable. This is a further step on the road to studying higher dimensions and other gauge groups with manageable computational costs while avoiding the sign problem.</p>

            <h2>A tensor network formulation of Lattice Gauge Theories based only on symmetric tensors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Manu Canals, Natalia Chepiga, Luca Tagliacozzo</p>
            <p>The Lattice Gauge Theory Hilbert space is divided into gauge-invariant sectors selected by the background charges. Such a projector can be directly embedded in a tensor network ansatz for gauge-invariant states as originally discussed in [Phys. Rev. B 83, 115127 (2011)] and in [Phys. Rev. X 4, 041024 (2014)] in the context of PEPS. The original ansatz is based on sparse tensors, though parts of them are not explicitly symmetric, and thus their actual implementation in numerical simulations has been hindered by the complexity of developing ad hoc libraries. Here we provide a new PEPS tensor network formulation of gauge-invariant theories purely based on symmetric elementary tensors. The new formulation can be implemented in numerical simulation using available state-of-the-art tensor network libraries but also holds interest from a purely theoretical perspective since it requires embedding the original gauge theory with gauge symmetry G into an enlarged globally symmetric theory with symmetry GxG. By revisiting the original ansatz in the modern landscape of i) duality transformations between gauge and spin systems, ii) finite depth quantum circuits followed by measurements that allow generating topologically ordered states, and iii) Clifford enhanced tensor networks, we show that such a new formulation provides a novel duality transformation between lattice gauge theories and specific sectors of globally invariant systems.</p>

            <h2>Time-reversed Young's experiment: Deterministic, diffractionless second-order interference effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jianming Wen</p>
            <p>The classic Young's double-slit experiment exhibits first-order interference, producing alternating bright and dark fringes modulated by the diffraction effect of the slits. In contrast, here we demonstrate that its time-reversed configuration produces an ideal, deterministic second-order 'ghost' interference pattern devoid of diffraction and first-order effect, with the size dependent on the dimensions of the `effectively extended light source.' Furthermore, the new system enables a range of effects and phenomena not available in traditional double-slit interference studies, including the formation of programmed and digitized interference fringes and the coincidence of the pattern plane and the source plane. Despite the absence of first-order interference, our proposed experiment does not rely on nonclassical correlations or quantum entanglement. The elimination of diffraction through time-reversal symmetry holds promise for advancing superresolution optical imaging and sensing techniques beyond existing capabilities.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chenzhu Xie, Yong Zhang</p>
            <p>To find a suitable incubator for nonlinear crystal optics(NCO), we have revisited linear crystal optics(LCO). At the methodological level, three widely used plane wave bases are compared in terms of eigenanalysis in reciprocal space and light field propagation in real space. Inspired by complex ray tracing, we expand M.V. Berry's 2003 uniform plane wave model to non-uniform Fourier crystal optics(FCO) and ultimately derive the explicit form of its 3$\times$2 transition matrix, bridging the two major branches of crystal optics(CO) in reciprocal space, where either ray direction $\hat{k}$ or spatial frequency $\bar{k}_{\mathrm{\rho}}$ serves as the input variable. Using this model, we create the material-matrix tetrahedral compass(M-M TC) to conduct a detailed analysis of how the four fundamental characteristics of materials (linear/circular birefringence/dichroism) influence the eigensystems of the vector electric field in two-dimensional(2D) spatial frequency $\bar{k}_{\mathrm{\rho}}$ domain and its distribution in three-dimensional(3D) $\bar{r}$ space with a crystal-2f system. Along this journey, we have uncovered new territories in LCO in both real and reciprocal space, such as infinite singularities arranged in disk-, ring-, and heart-like shapes, generalized haunting theorem, double conical refraction, and optical knots it induces. We also present our model's early applications in focal engineering and NCO.</p>

A key highlight of this study is the observation of the influence of interactions on the collisional scattering process. We measure the production of scattering halos at different interaction levels by varying the number of particles and the scattering length, and quantitatively assess the applicability of perturbation theory. To delve into a general theory of scattering halos, we introduce a scattering factor and obtain a universal relation between it and the halo ratio. Furthermore, we simulate the formation of scattering halos under non-perturbative conditions and analyze the discrepancies between simulation results and experiments through a return pulse experiment. This study enhances our understanding of the physical mechanisms underlying scattering processes in many-body systems and provides new perspectives for further theoretical research.</p>

            <p>We investigate the topological properties of multiple exceptional points in non-Hermitian two-level systems, emphasizing vorticity as a topological invariant arising from complex energy structures. We categorize EP pairs as fundamental building blocks of larger EP assemblies, distinguishing two types: type-I pairs with opposite vorticities and type-II pairs with identical vorticities. By analyzing the branch cut formation in a two-dimensional parameter space, we reveal the distinct topological features of each EP pair type. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to configurations with multiple EPs, demonstrating the cumulative vorticity and topological implications. To illustrate these theoretical structures, we model complex energy bands within a two-dimensional photonic crystal composed of lossy materials, identifying various EP pairs and their branch cuts. These findings contribute to the understanding of topological characteristics in non-Hermitian systems.</p>

            <p>Substitutional carbon defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have garnered significant interest as single photon emitters (SPEs) due to their remarkable optical and quantum properties. An intriguing property of these defects is that they can be spin-active ($S\geq 1$), even if weakly interacting. Employing density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate that two monomers of C-based defects of the same species can exhibit a stable triplet spin state at room temperature, even when they are separated $\lesssim 1$ nm, if they reside in different layers. The zero-phonon line (ZPL) energy of C defects in different layers lies within $1.6-2.2$ eV range. Also, we found defects that deviate from the typical phonon replica patterns, potentially explaining the observed phonon replicas in yellow emitters in hBN.</p>

While these ordered phases also appear in the monolayer Kitaev-Heisenberg model, our results further show that a valence bond solid state emerges in a relatively narrow range of parameter space between the AFM and stripy phases, which can be adiabatically connected to isolated Heisenberg dimers. Our results highlight the importance of considering interlayer interactions on the emergence of novel quantum phases in the bilayer Kitaev materials.</p>

Conventional techniques like STM, TEM, and AFM enable atomic-scale observations but face limitations under ambient conditions and surface topographies.

In this study, a nanoscale layer dissection method was developed utilizing NV center technology to analyze water layers with diverse physicochemical properties. It unveiled the presence of a non-evaporating sub-nanometer water layer on a diamond surface under ambient conditions. This layer demonstrated impervious to atmospheric water vapor and exhibited unique electronic transport mediated via hydrogen bonding. These findings provide new perspectives and a platform for studying the structure and behavior of low-dimensional water, as well as the surface properties influenced by adsorbed water under native conditions.</p>

The band structure and its spin dynamics are explored for $^{173}$Yb fermions. We highlight the enhanced sensitivity to the external perturbation of EP3 with cubic-root energy dispersion. Additionally, we investigate the second-order exceptional point (EP2) with square-root energy dispersion in a three-level quantum system with the absence of parity symmetry, which proves that the enhanced sensitivity closely relates to the symmetries of the NH system. Furthermore, we analyze the encircling behavior of EP3 in terms of the adiabatic limit and the nonadiabatic dynamics and discover some different results from that of EP2.</p>

            <p>One of the important open problems in quantum black hole physics is a dual interpretation of holographic complexity proposals.

From the latter we isolate the first quantum correction to the complexity = volume proposal and propose to view it as a complexity of quantum fields in the bulk. Finally, we comment on the switchback effect, whose presence would make the Krylov spread complexity a fully fledged holographic complexity at least in sine-dilaton gravity.</p>

            <p>In strongly correlated materials, interacting electrons are entangled and form collective quantum states, resulting in rich low-temperature phase diagrams. Notable examples include cuprate superconductors, in which superconductivity emerges at low doping out of an unusual ``pseudogap'' metallic state above the critical temperature. The Fermi-Hubbard model, describing a wide range of phenomena associated with strong electron correlations, still offers major computational challenges despite its simple formulation. In this context, ultracold atoms quantum simulators have provided invaluable insights into the microscopic nature of correlated quantum states. Here, we use a quantum gas microscope Fermi-Hubbard simulator to explore a wide range of doping levels and temperatures in a regime where a pseudogap is known to develop. By measuring multi-point correlation functions up to fifth order, we uncover a novel universal behaviour in magnetic and higher-order spin-charge correlations. This behaviour is characterized by a doping-dependent energy scale that governs the exponential growth of the magnetic correlation length upon cooling. Accurate comparisons with determinant Quantum Monte Carlo and Minimally Entangled Typical Thermal States simulations confirm that this energy scale agrees well with the pseudogap temperature $T^{*}$. Our findings establish a qualitative and quantitative understanding of the magnetic origin and physical nature of the pseudogap and pave the way towards the exploration of pairing and collective phenomena among charge carriers expected to emerge at lower temperatures.</p>

            <p>Current superconducting quantum devices impose strict connectivity constraints on quantum circuit execution, necessitating circuit transformation before executing quantum circuits on physical hardware. Numerous quantum circuit transformation (QCT) algorithms have been proposed. To enable faithful evaluation of state-of-the-art QCT algorithms, this paper introduces QKNOB (Qubit mapping Benchmark with Known Near-Optimality), a novel benchmark construction method for QCT. QKNOB circuits have built-in transformations with near-optimal (close to the theoretical optimum) SWAP count and depth overhead. QKNOB provides general and unbiased evaluation of QCT algorithms. Using QKNOB, we demonstrate that SABRE, the default Qiskit compiler, consistently achieves the best performance on the 53-qubit IBM Q Rochester and Google Sycamore devices for both SWAP count and depth objectives. Our results also reveal significant performance gaps relative to the near-optimal transformation costs of QKNOB. Our construction algorithm and benchmarks are open-source.</p>

            <h2>Theory of Quantum Circuits with Abelian Symmetries</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Iman Marvian</p>
            <p>Quantum circuits with gates (local unitaries) respecting a global symmetry have broad applications in quantum information science and related fields, such as condensed matter theory and quantum thermodynamics. However, despite their widespread use, fundamental properties of such circuits are not well-understood. Recently, it was found that generic unitaries respecting a global symmetry cannot be realized, even approximately, using gates that respect the same symmetry. This observation raises important open questions: What unitary transformations can be realized with k-local gates that respect a global symmetry? In other words, in the presence of a global symmetry, how does the locality of interactions constrain the possible time evolution of a composite system? In this work, we address these questions for the case of Abelian (commutative) symmetries and develop constructive methods for synthesizing circuits with such symmetries. Remarkably, as a corollary, we find that, while the locality of interactions still imposes additional constraints on realizable unitaries, certain restrictions observed in the case of non-Abelian symmetries do not apply to circuits with Abelian symmetries. For instance, in circuits with a general non-Abelian symmetry such as SU($d$), the unitary realized in a subspace with one irreducible representation (charge) of the symmetry dictates the realized unitaries in multiple other sectors with inequivalent representations of the symmetry. Furthermore, in certain sectors, rather than all unitaries respecting the symmetry, the realizable unitaries are the symplectic or orthogonal subgroups of this group. We prove that none of these restrictions appears in the case of Abelian symmetries. This result suggests that global non-Abelian symmetries may affect the thermalization of quantum systems in ways not possible under Abelian symmetries.</p>

            <p>Entanglement is a fundamental resource in quantum information processing, yet understanding its manipulation and transformation remains a challenge. Many tasks rely on highly entangled pure states, but obtaining such states is often challenging due to the presence of noise. Typically, entanglement manipulation procedures involving asymptotically many copies of a state are considered to overcome this problem. These procedures allow for distilling highly entangled pure states from noisy states, which enables a wide range of applications, such as quantum teleportation and quantum cryptography. When it comes to manipulating entangled quantum systems on a single copy level, using entangled states as catalysts can significantly broaden the range of achievable transformations. Similar to the concept of catalysis in chemistry, the entangled catalyst is returned unchanged at the end of the state manipulation procedure. Our results demonstrate that despite the apparent conceptual differences between the asymptotic and catalytic settings, they are actually strongly connected and fully equivalent for all distillable states. Our methods rely on the analysis of many-copy entanglement manipulation procedures which may establish correlations between different copies. As an important consequence, we demonstrate that using an entangled catalyst cannot enhance the asymptotic singlet distillation rate of a distillable quantum state. Our findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the capabilities and limitations of both catalytic and asymptotic state transformations of entangled states, and highlight the importance of correlations in these processes.</p>

            <p>As a signal recovery algorithm, compressed sensing is particularly useful when the data has low-complexity and samples are rare, which matches perfectly with the task of quantum phase estimation (QPE). In this work we present a new Heisenberg-limited QPE algorithm for early quantum computers based on compressed sensing. More specifically, given many copies of a proper initial state and queries to some unitary operators, our algorithm is able to recover the frequency with a total runtime $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-1}\text{poly}\log(\epsilon^{-1}))$, where $\epsilon$ is the accuracy. Moreover, the maximal runtime satisfies $T_{\max}\epsilon \ll \pi$, which is comparable to the state of art algorithms, and our algorithm is also robust against certain amount of noise from sampling. We also consider the more general quantum eigenvalue estimation problem (QEEP) and show numerically that the off-grid compressed sensing can be a strong candidate for solving the QEEP.</p>

            <h2>The unphysicality of Hilbert spaces</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gabriele Carcassi, Francisco Calderon, Christine A. Aidala</p>
            <p>We argue that Hilbert spaces are not suitable to represent quantum states mathematically, in the sense that they require properties that are untenable by physical entities. We first demonstrate that the requirements posited by complex inner product spaces are physically justified. We then show that completeness in the infinite-dimensional case requires the inclusion of states with infinite expectations, coordinate transformations that take finite expectations to infinite ones and vice versa, and time evolutions that transform finite expectations to infinite ones in finite time. This means we should be wary of using Hilbert spaces to represent quantum states as they turn a potential infinity into an actual infinity. The main point of the paper, then, is to raise awareness that results that rely on the completeness of Hilbert spaces may not be physically significant. While we do not claim to know what a physically more appropriate closure should be, we note that Schwartz spaces, among other things, guarantee that the expectations of all polynomials of position and momentum are finite, their elements are uniquely identified by these expectations, and they are closed under Fourier transform.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kyrylo Simonov, Marcello Caleffi, Jessica Illiano, Jacquiline Romero, Angela Sara Cacciapuoti</p>
            <p>Superposed orders of quantum channels have already been proved - both theoretically and experimentally - to enable unparalleled opportunities in the quantum communication domain. As a matter of fact, superposition of orders can be exploited within the quantum computing domain as well, by relaxing the (traditional) assumption underlying quantum computation about applying gates in a well-defined causal order. In this context, we address a fundamental question arising with quantum computing: whether superposed orders of single-qubit gates can enable universal quantum computation. As shown in this paper, the answer to this key question is a definitive "yes". Indeed, we prove that any two-qubit controlled quantum gate can be deterministically realized, including the so-called Barenco gate that alone enables universal quantum computation.</p>

            <p>Split Cayley hexagons of order two are distinguished finite geometries living in the three-qubit symplectic polar space in two different forms, called classical and skew. Although neither of the two yields observable-based contextual configurations of their own, {\it classically}-embedded copies are found to fully encode contextuality properties of the most prominent three-qubit contextual configurations in the following sense: for each set of unsatisfiable contexts of such a contextual configuration there exists some classically-embedded hexagon sharing with the configuration exactly this set of contexts and nothing else. We demonstrate this fascinating property first on the configuration comprising all 315 contexts of the space and then on doilies, both types of quadrics as well as on complements of skew-embedded hexagons. In connection with the last-mentioned case and elliptic quadrics we also conducted some experimental tests on a Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) computer to substantiate our theoretical findings.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chansreynich Huot, Kimleang Kea, Tae-Kyung Kim, Youngsun Han</p>
            <p>Portfolio optimization is a primary component of the decision-making process in finance, aiming to tactfully allocate assets to achieve optimal returns while considering various constraints. Herein, we proposed a method that uses the knapsack-based portfolio optimization problem and incorporates the quantum computing capabilities of the quantum walk mixer with the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) to address the challenges presented by the NP-hard problem. Additionally, we present the sequential procedure of our suggested approach and demonstrate empirical proof to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in finding the optimal asset allocations across various constraints and asset choices. Moreover, we discuss the effectiveness of the QAOA components in relation to our proposed method. Consequently, our study successfully achieves the approximate ratio of the portfolio optimization technique using a circuit layer of p>=3, compared to the classical best-known solution of the knapsack problem. Our proposed methods potentially contribute to the growing field of quantum finance by offering insights into the potential benefits of employing quantum algorithms for complex optimization tasks in financial portfolio management.</p>

            <h2>Arbitrary Polynomial Separations in Trainable Quantum Machine Learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eric R. Anschuetz, Xun Gao</p>
            <p>Recent theoretical results in quantum machine learning have demonstrated a general trade-off between the expressive power of quantum neural networks (QNNs) and their trainability; as a corollary of these results, practical exponential separations in expressive power over classical machine learning models are believed to be infeasible as such QNNs take a time to train that is exponential in the model size. We here circumvent these negative results by constructing a hierarchy of efficiently trainable QNNs that exhibit unconditionally provable, polynomial memory separations of arbitrary constant degree over classical neural networks -- including state-of-the-art models, such as Transformers -- in performing a classical sequence modeling task. This construction is also computationally efficient, as each unit cell of the introduced class of QNNs only has constant gate complexity. We show that contextuality -- informally, a quantitative notion of semantic ambiguity -- is the source of the expressivity separation, suggesting that other learning tasks with this property may be a natural setting for the use of quantum learning algorithms.</p>

            <p>Quantum sensors have notably advanced high-sensitivity magnetic field detection. Here, we report quantum sensors constructed from polarized spin-triplet electrons in photoexcited organic chromophores, specifically focusing on pentacene-doped para-terphenyl (${\approx}$0.1%). We demonstrate essential quantum sensing properties at room temperature: electronic optical polarization and state-dependent fluorescence contrast, by leveraging differential pumping and relaxation rates between triplet and ground states. We measure high optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) contrast ${\approx}16.8\%$ of the triplet states at room temperature, along with long coherence times under spin echo and CPMG sequences, $T_2{=}2.7\mu$s and $T_2^{DD}{=}18.4\mu$s respectively, limited only by the triplet lifetimes. The material offers several advantages for quantum sensing, including the ability to grow large ($cm$-scale) crystals at low cost, the absence of paramagnetic impurities, and the diamagnetism of electronic states used for sensing when not optically illuminated. Utilizing pentacene as a representative of a broader class of spin triplet-polarizable organic molecules, this study highlights new potential for quantum sensing in chemical systems.</p>

            <p>For almost 75 years, the general solution for the Schrödinger equation was assumed to be generated by an exponential or a time-ordered exponential known as the Dyson series. We study the unitarity of a solution in the case of a singular Hamiltonian and provide a new methodology that is not based on the assumption that the underlying space is $L^{2}(\mathbb{R})$. Then, an alternative operator for generating the time evolution that is manifestly unitary is suggested, regardless of the choice of Hamiltonian. The new construction involves an additional positive operator that normalizes the wave function locally and allows us to preserve unitarity, even when dealing with infinite dimensional or non-normed spaces. Our considerations show that Schrödinger and Liouville equations are, in fact, two sides of the same coin and together they provide a unified description for unbounded quantum systems.</p>

Reviewing the theory from [W.D.

I generalize the terms of [Entropy 25, 564 (2023)] for non-pure spin models and check if they also satisfy the constraints, concluding with a negative answer.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> José A. Almanza-Marrero, Gonzalo Manzano</p>
            <p>Quantum coherence has been shown to impact the operational capabilities of quantum systems performing thermodynamic tasks in a significant way, and yet the possibility and conditions for genuine coherence-enhanced thermodynamic operation remain unclear. We show that for steady-state quantum thermal machines -- both autonomous and externally driven -- that interact weakly with thermal reservoirs and work sources, the presence of coherence induced by perturbations in the machine Hamiltonian guarantees a genuine thermodynamic advantage. Such advantage applies both for the cases in which the induced coherence is between levels with different energies or between degenerate levels. On the other hand, we show that engines subjected to noise-induced coherence, can be outperformed by classical stochastic engines using exactly the same set of (incoherent) resources. We illustrate our results with three prototypical models of heat engines and refrigerators and employ multi-objective optimization techniques to characterize quantum-enhanced regimes in connection with the thermodynamic uncertainty relation and beyond it.</p>

Our simulations make use of a recent quantum algorithm that maps the dynamics of a singly excited open Tavis-Cummings model containing N atoms coupled to a lossy cavity. We report the results of executing this algorithm on two noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers: a superconducting processor and a trapped ion processor, to simulate the population dynamics of an open CQED system featuring N = 3 atoms. By applying technology-specific transpilation and error mitigation techniques, we minimize the impact of gate errors, noise, and decoherence in each hardware platform, obtaining results which agree closely with the exact solution of the system. These results can be used as a recipe for efficient and platform-specific quantum simulation of cavity-emitter systems on contemporary and future quantum computers.</p>

            <h2>Overcoming the fundamental limit of quantum transduction via intraband entanglement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haowei Shi, Quntao Zhuang</p>
            <p>A quantum transducer converts an input signal to an output probe at a distant frequency band while maintaining the quantum information with high fidelity, which is crucial for quantum networking and distributed quantum sensing and computing. In terms of microwave-optical quantum transduction, the state-of-the-art quantum transducers suffer low transduction efficiency from weak nonlinear coupling, wherein increasing pump power to enhance efficiency inevitably leads to thermal noise from heating. Moreover, we reveal that the efficiency-bandwidth product of a cavity electro-optical or electro-optomechanical transducer is fundamentally limited by pump power and nonlinear coupling coefficient, irrespective of cavity engineering efforts. To overcome this fundamental limit, we propose to noiselessly boost the transduction efficiency by consuming intraband entanglement (e.g., microwave-microwave or optical-optical entanglement in the case of microwave-optical transduction). Via a squeezer-coupler-antisqueezer sandwich structure, the protocol enhances the transduction efficiency to unity in the ideal lossless case, given an arbitrarily weak pump and nonlinear coupling. In practical cavity systems, our entanglement-assisted protocol surpasses the non-assisted fundamental limit of the efficiency-bandwidth product and reduces the threshold cooperativity for positive quantum capacity by a factor proportional to two-mode squeezing gain. Given a fixed cooperativity, our approach increases the broadband quantum capacity by orders of magnitude. The entanglement-assisted advantage is robust to ancilla loss and cavity detuning.</p>

            <p>We present a hierarchical test, average randomness, that verifies the compatibility of a set of quantum states $S$ with the $t$-moments of the Haar-random distribution. To check such compatibility, we consider the expectation values of states in $S$ with respect to a chosen observable, with focus on their statistical moments. Our first result is a connection between Haar-randomness and the Dirichlet distribution, providing a closed-form expression for the expectation values, as well as and their statistical moments, including simple bounds for the latter. The average randomness metric compares the measured statistical properties of $S$ with those arising from Dirichlet distribution. When it vanishes, $S$ is compatible with being a $t$-design, as seen through the observable $\Obs$, defined as $\Obs$-shadowed $t$-designs. By permutation- and unitary-equivalent randomization of observable, we are able to extend the analysis of average randomness to statistically verify the compatibility of $S$ with $t$-designs. We envision the use of average randomness verification as a practical test for the randomness sets of states with no prior information available.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hendra I. Nurdin</p>
            <p>Quantum parameter estimation theory is an important component of quantum information theory and provides the statistical foundation that underpins important topics such as quantum system identification and quantum waveform estimation. When there is more than one parameter the ultimate precision in the mean square error given by the quantum Cramér-Rao bound is not necessarily achievable. For non-full rank quantum states, it was not known when this bound can be saturated (achieved) when only a single copy of the quantum state encoding the unknown parameters is available. This single-copy scenario is important because of its experimental/practical tractability. Recently, necessary and sufficient conditions for saturability of the quantum Cramér-Rao bound in the multiparameter single-copy scenario have been established in terms of i) the commutativity of a set of projected symmetric logarithmic derivatives and ii) the existence of a unitary solution to a system of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations. New sufficient conditions were also obtained that only depend on properties of the symmetric logarithmic derivatives. In this paper, key structural properties of optimal measurements that saturate the quantum Cramér-Rao bound are illuminated. These properties are exploited to i) show that the sufficient conditions are in fact necessary and sufficient for an optimal measurement to be projective, ii) give an alternative proof of previously established necessary conditions, and iii) describe general POVMs, not necessarily projective, that saturate the multiparameter QCRB. Examples are given where a unitary solution to the system of nonlinear partial differential equations can be explicitly calculated when the required conditions are fulfilled.</p>

            <h2>On computing quantum waves and spin from classical action</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Winfried Lohmiller, Jean-Jacques Slotine</p>
            <p>We show that the Schrödinger equation of quantum physics can be solved analytically using a generalized form of the classical Hamilton-Jacobi least action equation, extending a key result of Feynman. This suggests a smooth transition between physics across scales, and builds on two developments. The first is incorporating geometric constraints directly in the classical local least action problem. This leads to multi-valued least action solutions, where each local action is its own set element. For instance, in the double slit experiment or for a particle in a box, spatial inequality constraints create impulsive constraint forces, which lead to multiple paths and create multiple least action branches. Multi-valued least actions may also stem from singularities in the Hamiltonian, as for a particle in a Coulomb potential, or from a closed configuration manifold, as for a spinning particle. Second, approximate mappings from action $\Phi$ to wave function $\Psi$ have been suggested since Dirac and even Schrödinger. We show that an exact mapping can be constructed by combining the multi-valued least actions with the fluid density $\rho$ of the classical position dynamics, computed from $\Phi$ along each least action branch. Quantum wave collapse corresponds to transitions between multi-valued least action branches at the branch point (position measurement), or to a measurement of the branch index (momentum measurement). These coordinate-invariant results provide a simpler computing alternative to Feynman path integrals, as they use only a discrete set of classical paths and avoid zig-zag paths and time-slicing altogether. They extend to the relativistic Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations.</p>

            <p>Tensor network contractions are widely used in statistical physics, quantum computing, and computer science. We introduce a method to efficiently approximate tensor network contractions using low-rank approximations, where each intermediate tensor generated during the contractions is approximated as a low-rank binary tree tensor network. The proposed algorithm has the flexibility to incorporate a large portion of the environment when performing low-rank approximations, which can lead to high accuracy for a given rank. Here, the environment refers to the remaining set of tensors in the network, and low-rank approximations with larger environments can generally provide higher accuracy. For contracting tensor networks defined on lattices, the proposed algorithm can be viewed as a generalization of the standard boundary-based algorithms. In addition, the algorithm includes a cost-efficient density matrix algorithm for approximating a tensor network with a general graph structure into a tree structure, whose computational cost is asymptotically upper-bounded by that of the standard algorithm that uses canonicalization. Experimental results indicate that the proposed technique outperforms previously proposed approximate tensor network contraction algorithms for multiple problems in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Detection of Recurrent Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michael H. Freedman</p>
            <p>Quantum dynamics that explore an unexpectedly small fraction of Hilbert space is inherently interesting. Integrable systems, quantum scars, MBL, hidden tensor structures, and systems with gauge symmetries are examples. Beyond dimension and volume, spectral features such as an $O(1)$-density of periodic eigenvalues, or other spectral features, can also imply observable recurrence. Low volume dynamics will recur near its initial state $| \psi_0\rangle$ more rapidly, i.e. $\lVert\mathrm{U}^k | \psi_0\rangle - | \psi_0\rangle \rVert < \epsilon$, is more likely to occur for modest values of $k$, when the (forward) orbit $\operatorname{closure}(\{\mathrm{U}^k\}_{k=1,2,\dots})$ is of relatively low dimension $d$ and relatively small $d$-volume. We describe simple quantum algorithms to detect such approximate recurrence. Applications include detection of certain cases of hidden tensor factorizations $\mathrm{U} \cong V^\dagger(\mathrm{U}_1\otimes \cdots \otimes \mathrm{U}_n)V$. "Hidden" refers to an unknown conjugation, e.g. $\mathrm{U}_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathrm{U}_v \rightarrow V^\dagger(\mathrm{U}_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathrm{U}_n)V$, which will obscure the low-volume nature of the dynamics. Hidden tensor structures have been observed to emerge both in a high energy context of operator-level spontaneous symmetry breaking [FSZ21a, FSZ21b, FSZ21c, SZBF23], and at the opposite end of the intellectual world in linguistics [Smo09, MLDS19]. We collect some observations on the computational difficulty of locating these structures and detecting related spectral information. A technical result, Appendix A, is that the language describing unitary circuits with no spectral gap (NUSG) around 1 is QMA-complete. Appendix B connects the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem to hidden tensor structures.</p>

            <h2>Optimizing entanglement in two-qubit systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Salvio Luna-Hernandez, Claudia Quintana, Oscar Rosas-Ortiz</p>
            <p>We investigate entanglement in two-qubit systems using a geometric representation based on the minimum of essential parameters. The latter is achieved by requiring subsystems with the same entropy, regardless of whether the state of the entire system is pure or mixed. The geometric framework is provided by a convex set S that forms a right-triangle, whose points are linked to just two of the coherences of the system under study. As a result, we find that optimized states of two qubits are X-shaped and host pairs of identical populations while reducing the number of coherences involved. A geometric L-measure of entanglement is introduced as the distance between the points in S that represent entangled states and the closest point that defines separable states. It is shown that L reproduces the results of the Hill-Wootters concurrence C, so that C can be interpreted as a distance-like entanglement measure. However, unlike C, the measure L also distinguishes the rank of states. The universality of the two-qubit X-states ensures the utility of our geometric model for studying entanglement of two-qubit states in any configuration. To show the applicability of our approach far beyond time-independent cases, we construct a time-dependent two-qubit state, traced out over the complementary components of a pure tetra-partite system, and find that its one-qubit states share the same entropy. The entanglement measure results bounded from above by the envelope of the minima of such entropy.</p>

            <p>Quantum interconnects facilitate entanglement distribution between non-local computational nodes. For superconducting processors, microwave photons are a natural means to mediate this distribution. However, many existing architectures limit node connectivity and directionality. In this work, we construct a chiral quantum interconnect between two nominally identical modules in separate microwave packages. We leverage quantum interference to emit and absorb microwave photons on demand and in a chosen direction between these modules. We optimize the protocol using model-free reinforcement learning to maximize absorption efficiency. By halting the emission process halfway through its duration, we generate remote entanglement between modules in the form of a four-qubit W state with 62.4 +/- 1.6% (leftward photon propagation) and 62.1 +/- 1.2% (rightward) fidelity, limited mainly by propagation loss. A chiral quantum network comprising many modules provides a platform for the exploration of novel many-body physics and quantum simulation. This quantum network architecture enables all-to-all connectivity between non-local processors for modular and extensible quantum computation.</p>

            <p>We theoretically investigate the steady-state bipartite entanglements, mechanical ground-state cooling, and mechanical quadrature squeezing in a hybrid electro-optomechanical system where a moving membrane is linearly coupled to the microwave field mode of an LC circuit, while it simultaneously interacts both linearly and quadratically with the radiation pressure of a single-mode optical cavity. We show that by choosing a suitable sign and amplitude for the quadratic optomechanical coupling (QOC), one can achieve enhanced and thermally robust stationary bipartite entanglement between the subsystems, improved mechanical ground-state cooling, and Q-quadrature squeezing of the mechanical mode beyond the 3-dB limit of squeezing. In particular, we find that in the presence of QOC with negative sign and in the resolved sideband regime the bipartite optical-mechanical entanglement can be increased by about 2 order of magnitude around the temperature of 1mK, and it can be preserved against thermal noise up to the ambient temperature of 0.1K. Furthermore, the QOC with positive sign can give rise to the enhancement of the mechanical ground-state cooling by about 1 order of magnitude in the optical and microwave red-detuned regime. We also find that for the positive sign of QOC and near the microwave resonance frequency the squeezing degree of the Q-quadrature of the mechanical mode can be amplified up to 15 dB. Such a hybrid electro-optomechanical system can serve as a promising platform to engineer an improved entangled source for quantum sensing as well as quantum information processing.</p>

In the presence of a linear external field, we employ the non-Hermitian Floquet method and find that the energy levels are sensitive to the field. The system exhibits two distinct dynamic behaviors separated by an exceptional point: one in the $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetrical region associated with two real Wannier-Stark ladders, and another in the $\mathcal{PT}$\ symmetry-breaking region associated with complex conjugate ladders. As the boundary between the two regions, two ladders coalesce into a single ladder. In the case of a non-linear field, these two distinct regions appear alternately along the chain, exhibiting dynamic Moiré-like patterns.</p>

            <h2>Absolute dimensionality of quantum ensembles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander Bernal, Gabriele Cobucci, Martin J. Renner, Armin Tavakoli</p>
            <p>The dimension of a quantum state is traditionally seen as the number of superposed distinguishable states in a given basis. We propose an absolute, i.e.~basis-independent, notion of dimensionality for ensembles of quantum states. It is based on whether a quantum ensemble can be simulated with states confined to arbitrary lower-dimensional subspaces and classical postprocessing. In order to determine the absolute dimension of quantum ensembles, we develop both analytical witness criteria and a semidefinite programming criterion based on the ensemble's information capacity. Furthermore, we construct explicit simulation models for arbitrary ensembles of pure quantum states subject to white noise, and in natural cases we prove their optimality. Also, efficient numerical methods are provided for simulating generic ensembles. Finally, we discuss the role of absolute dimensionality in high-dimensional quantum information processing.</p>

            <p>Transporting and connecting quantum states are key capabilities for larger-scale quantum information processing. Concrete challenges are the coherent shuttling and the manipulation of distant quantum states in an optical lattice. Here, we create spin singlet pairs of two magnetic states of fermionic potassium-40 atoms in an optical lattice and use a bi-directional topological Thouless pump to transport, coherently split, and separate the pairs, as well as to demonstrate interaction between them via tuneable $($swap$)^\alpha$-gate operations. We achieve pair pumping with a single-shift fidelity of 99.78(3)% over 50 lattice sites and split the pairs within a decoherence-free subspace. Gates are implemented by superexchange interaction, allowing us to produce interwoven spin singlets. For read-out, we apply a magnetic field gradient, resulting in single- and multi-frequency singlet-triplet oscillations. Our work shows avenues to create complex patterns of entanglement and new approaches to quantum processing, sensing, and atom interferometry.</p>

            <p>Quantum key distribution (QKD) can secure cryptographic communication between two distant users, as guaranteed by the laws of quantum mechanics rather than computational assumptions. The twin-field scheme, which employs counter-propagated weak coherent light pulses, doubles the secure distance of standard QKD without using quantum repeaters. Here, we study a method to extend the twin-field key distribution protocol to a scheme for multi-party quantum key agreement. We study our protocol's security using a minimum error discrimination analysis and derive the asymptotic key rate based on the entanglement-based source-replacement scheme. We also simulate it on the ANSYS Interconnect platform with optical components to study the protocol's performance in certain practical situations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amanda Gefter</p>
            <p>This paper began as a set of notes introducing quantum physicists of the QBist persuasion to enactive theory. Unlike mainstream cognitive science, which views cognition as computations on internal representations of the external world (and thus the mind as in the head), the enactive approach sees cognition as adaptive, embodied action. Enaction can ground concepts of experience, agency, knowledge, and normativity - which play key roles in QBist quantum mechanics - in terms consistent with QBism's participatory approach. That's because QBism and enaction both reject an absolute, pregiven subject-object split: for QBism, quantum measurement is the enactment of the subject-object divide; for enaction, cognition is the enactment of that divide. Indeed, each appears to be half of the same story. QBism is a theory of how the world is created and recreated through interactions with an agent, while enaction is a theory of how agents are created and recreated through interactions with the world. Through conversations with QBists and enactivists, these notes evolved into a larger project aimed at unifying QBist physics with enactive cognitive science. Taken together, they offer the possibility of a unified metaphysics - one that brings subject and object, mind and world, back together again.</p>

            <h2>Processing and Decoding Rydberg Leakage Error with MBQC</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cheng-Cheng Yu, Zi-Han Chen, Yu-Hao Deng, Ming-Cheng Chen, Chao-Yang Lu, Jian-Wei Pan</p>
            <p>Neutral atom array has emerged as a promising platform for quantum computation due to its high-fidelity two-qubit gate, arbitrary connectivity and remarkable scalability. However, achieving fault-tolerant quantum computing with neutral atom necessitates careful consideration of the errors inherent to these systems. One typical error is the leakage from Rydberg states during the implementation of multi-qubit gates, which induces two-qubit error chain and degrades the error distance. To address this, researchers have proposed an erasure conversion protocol that employs fast leakage detection and continuous atomic replacement to convert leakage errors into benign erasure errors. While this method achieves a favorable error distance de = d, its applicability is restricted to certain atom species. In this work, we present a novel approach to manage Rydberg leakage errors in measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC). From a hardware perspective, we utilize practical experimental techniques along with an adaptation of the Pauli twirling approximation (PTA) to mitigate the impacts of leakage errors, which propagate similarly to Pauli errors without degrading the error distance. From a decoding perspective, we leverage the inherent structure of topological cluster states and final leakage detection information to locate propagated errors from Rydberg leakage. This approach eliminates the need for mid-circuit leakage detection, while maintaining an error distance de = d and achieving a high threshold of 3.4% per CZ gate for pure leakage errors under perfect final leakage detection. Furthermore, in the presence of additional Pauli errors, our protocol demonstrates comparable logical error rates to the erasure conversion method within a reasonable range of physical errors.</p>

            <p>Designs, structures connected to averaging with respect to a given measure using finite sets of points, have proven themselves as invaluable tools across the field of quantum information, finding their uses in state and process tomography, key distribution and others. In this work, we introduce a new concept of pushforward designs, which allows us to obtain new structures from already existing ones by mapping them between the spaces, with specific examples including simplex designs and mixed state designs from complex projective designs. Based on the general concept, we put forward a structure called channel $[t,k]$-design, allowing for averaging over space of quantum channels for systems in contact with an environment of dimension $k$. Based on this notion, we introduce the concept of effective environment dimensionality $k^*$, which we estimate for the IBM Kyoto quantum computer to be below $2.2$ for times up to $350\mu\text{s}$.</p>

            <p>Competition among repetitive measurements of noncommuting observables and unitary dynamics can give rise to a rich variety of entanglement phases. We here characterize topological phases in monitored quantum systems by their spectrum and many-body topological invariants. We analyze (1+1)-dimensional monitored circuits for Majorana fermions, which have topological and trivial area-law entangled phases and a critical phase with sub-volume-law entanglement, through the Lyapunov spectrum. We uncover the presence (absence) of edge-localized zero modes inside the bulk gap in the topological (trivial) area-law phase and a bulk gapless spectrum in the critical phase. Furthermore, by suitably exploiting the fermion parity with twisted measurement outcomes at the boundary, we construct a topological invariant that sharply distinguishes the two area-law phases and dynamically characterizes the critical phase. Our work thus paves the way to extend the bulk-edge correspondence for topological phases from equilibrium to monitored quantum dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Assessing fault-tolerant quantum advantage for $k$-SAT with structure</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martijn Brehm, Jordi Weggemans</p>
            <p>For many problems, quantum algorithms promise speedups over their classical counterparts. However, these results predominantly rely on asymptotic worst-case analysis, which overlooks significant overheads due to error correction and the fact that real-world instances often contain exploitable structure. In this work, we employ the hybrid benchmarking method to evaluate the potential of quantum Backtracking and Grover's algorithm against the 2023 SAT competition main track winner in solving random $k$-SAT instances with tunable structure, designed to represent industry-like scenarios, using both $T$-depth and $T$-count as cost metrics to estimate quantum run times. Our findings reproduce the results of Campbell, Khurana, and Montanaro (Quantum '19) in the unstructured case using hybrid benchmarking. However, we offer a more sobering perspective in practically relevant regimes: almost all quantum speedups vanish, even asymptotically, when minimal structure is introduced or when $T$-count is considered instead of $T$-depth. Moreover, when the requirement is for the algorithm to find a solution within a single day, we find that only Grover's algorithm has the potential to outperform classical algorithms, but only in a very limited regime and only when using $T$-depth. We also discuss how more sophisticated heuristics could restore the asymptotic scaling advantage for quantum backtracking, but our findings suggest that the potential for practical quantum speedups in more structured $k$-SAT solving will remain limited.</p>

            <h2>Topological phases of unitary dynamics: Classification in Clifford category</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jeongwan Haah</p>
            <p>A quantum cellular automaton (QCA) or a causal unitary is by definition an automorphism of local operator algebra, by which local operators are mapped to local operators. Quantum circuits of small depth, local Hamiltonian evolutions for short time, and translations (shifts) are examples. A Clifford QCA is one that maps any Pauli operator to a finite tensor product of Pauli operators. Here, we obtain a complete table of groups $\mathfrak C(\mathsf d,p)$ of translation invariant Clifford QCA in any spatial dimension $\mathsf d \ge 0$ modulo Clifford quantum circuits and shifts over prime $p$-dimensional qudits, where the circuits and shifts are allowed to obey only coarser translation invariance. The group $\mathfrak C(\mathsf d,p)$ is nonzero only for $\mathsf d = 2k+3$ if $p=2$ and $\mathsf d = 4k+3$ if $p$ is odd where~$k \ge 0$ is any integer, in which case $\mathfrak C(\mathsf d,p) \cong \widetilde{\mathfrak W}(\mathbb F_p)$, the classical Witt group of nonsingular quadratic forms over the finite field $\mathbb F_p$. It is well known that $\widetilde{\mathfrak W}(\mathbb F_2) \cong \mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z$, $\widetilde{\mathfrak W}(\mathbb F_p) \cong \mathbb Z/4\mathbb Z$ if $p = 3 \bmod 4$, and $\widetilde{\mathfrak W}(\mathbb F_p)\cong \mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z \oplus \mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z$ if $p = 1 \bmod 4$. The classification is achieved by a dimensional descent, which is a reduction of Laurent extension theorems for algebraic $L$-groups of surgery theory in topology.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sudip Kumar Haldar, Anal Bhowmik</p>
            <p>In standard bosonic Josephson junctions (BJJs), particles tunnel between two single-well potentials linked by a finite barrier. The dynamics of standard BJJs have been extensively studied, both at the many-body and mean-field levels of theory. In the present work, we introduce the concept of a composite BJJ. In a composite BJJ, particles tunnel between two double-well potentials linked by a finite potential barrier between them. We focus on many-body facets of quantum dynamics and investigate how the complex structure of the junction influences tunneling. Employing the multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree for bosons method, highly-accurate many-boson wave-functions are obtained from which properties are computed. We analyze the dynamics using the survival probability, the degree of fragmentation of the junction, and the fluctuations of observables, and discuss how many-boson tunneling behaves, and how it may be controlled, using the composite nature of the junction. A central result of this work relates to the degree of fragmentation of composite BJJs with different numbers of bosons. We provide strong evidence that a universal degree of fragmentation into multiple time-dependent modes takes place. Further applications are briefly discussed.</p>

Three-photon spectroscopy on the $^{1}S_{0}$$\leftrightarrow$$^{3}P_{0}$ clock transition, using only laser frequencies nearly resonant with the $^{1}S_{0}$$\leftrightarrow$$^{3}P_{0}$ and $^{1}S_{0}$$\leftrightarrow$$^{3}P_{1}$ transitions, enables a reduction in Doppler broadening by two orders of magnitude and a corresponding $\sim470$Hz linewidth without a confining potential.</p>

            <p>Quantum machine learning is a new research field combining quantum information science and machine learning. Quantum computing technologies appear to be particularly well-suited for addressing problems in the health sector efficiently. They have the potential to handle large datasets more effectively than classical models and offer greater transparency and interpretability for clinicians. Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative brain disorder that mostly affects elderly people, causing important cognitive impairments. It is the most common cause of dementia and it has an effect on memory, thought, learning abilities and movement control. This type of disease has no cure, consequently an early diagnosis is fundamental for reducing its impact. The analysis of handwriting can be effective for diagnosing, as many researches have conjectured. The DARWIN (Diagnosis AlzheimeR WIth haNdwriting) dataset contains handwriting samples from people affected by Alzheimer's disease and a group of healthy people. Here we apply quantum AI to this use-case. In particular, we use this dataset to test classical methods for classification and compare their performances with the ones obtained via quantum machine learning methods. We find that quantum methods generally perform better than classical methods. Our results pave the way for future new quantum machine learning applications in early-screening diagnostics in the healthcare domain.</p>

Instead, it is sufficient to have a latent rotation symmetry, which may be revealed upon performing an isospectral reduction on the system. We introduce the concept of a filling anomaly for latent crystalline symmetric systems, and propose modified topological invariants. The notion of higher-order topology in two dimensions protected by Cn symmetry is thus generalized to a protection by latent symmetry. Our claims are corroborated by concrete examples of models that show non-trivial corner charge in the absence of Cn-symmetry. This work extends the classification of topological crystalline insulators to include latent symmetries.</p>

            <p>In the zoo of emergent symmetries in quantum many-body physics, the previously unrealized emergent spacetime supersymmetry (SUSY) is particularly intriguing. Although it was known that spacetime SUSY could emerge at the (1+1)d tricritical Ising transition, an experimental realization is still absent. In this work, we propose to realize emergent spacetime SUSY using reconfigurable Rydberg atom arrays featuring two distinct sets of Rydberg excitations, tailored for implementation on dual-species platforms. In such systems, the spacetime SUSY manifests itself in the respective correlation functions of a bosonic mode and its fermionic partner. However, the correlation function of the fermionic mode inevitably involves a string operator, making direct measurement challenging in the conventional setting. Here, we leverage the hybrid analog-digital nature of the Rydberg atom arrays, which allows for the simulation of a physical Hamiltonian and the execution of a digital quantum circuit on the same platform. This hybrid protocol offers a new perspective for uncovering the hidden structure of emergent spacetime SUSY.</p>

Superradiance is a typical example in which the decay rate of the system is enhanced via a collective system-bath coupling that respects permutation symmetry. Such model has also been applied to heat engines. However, a generic framework that addresses the impact of symmetry in finite-time thermodynamics is not well established. Here, we show a symmetry-based framework that describes the fundamental limit of collective enhancement in finite-time thermodynamics. Specifically, we derive a general upper bound on the average jump rate, which quantifies the fundamental speed set by thermodynamic speed limits and trade-off relations. We identify the symmetry condition which achieves the obtained bound, and explicitly construct an open quantum system model that goes beyond the enhancement realized by the conventional superradiance model.</p>

Through systematic experimental characterization, we find that the periodically poled TFLN waveguide retains its high conversion efficiency at both cryogenic and room temperatures for both classical second-harmonic generation and quantum photon-pair generation processes. Particularly, the photon-pair source at cryogenic condition shows high brightness and broad bandwidth.

            <p>Active wave-particle entities (WPEs) emerge as self-propelled oil droplets on the free surface of a vibrating oil bath. The particle (droplet) periodically imprints decaying waves on the liquid surface which in turn guide the particle motion, resulting in a two-way coupling between the particle and its self-generated waves. Such WPEs have been shown to exhibit hydrodynamic analogs of various quantum features. In this work, we theoretically and numerically explore a dynamical analog of tunneling by considering a simple setup of a one-dimensional WPE incident on an isolated Gaussian potential barrier. Our idealized model takes the form of a perturbed Lorenz system which we use to explore the dynamics and statistics of barrier crossing as a function of initial conditions and system parameters. Our work highlights that velocity fluctuations of the WPE at high memories that are rooted in non-equilibrium features of the Lorenz system, such as spiraling motion towards equilibrium points and transient chaos, give rise to - (i) sensitivity and unpredictability in barrier crossing, (ii) smooth variations in transmission probability as a function of system parameters, and (iii) wave-like features in the transmitted and reflected probability density profiles.</p>

            <p>We highlight the structure and properties of an abstract approach to quantum cosmology and gravity, dubbed $SU(\infty)$-QGR. Beginning from the concept of the Universe as an isolated quantum system, the main axiom of is the existence of an infinite number of mutually commuting observables. Consequently, the Hilbert space of the Universe represents $SU(\infty)$ symmetry. This Universe as a whole is static and topological. Nonetheless, quantum fluctuations induce local clustering in its quantum state and divide it into approximately isolated subsystems representing $G \times SU(\infty)$, where $G$ is a generic finite-rank internal symmetry. Due to the global $SU(\infty)$ subsystems are entangled to the rest of the Universe. In addition to parameters characterizing the representation of $G$, their quantum states depend on four continuous parameters: two of them characterize the representation of $SU(\infty)$, a dimensionful parameter arises from the possibility of comparing representations of $SU(\infty)$ by different subsystems; the fourth parameter is a measurable used as time registered by an arbitrary subsystem chosen as a clock. It introduces a relative dynamics for subsystems, formulated by a symmetry-invariant effective Lagrangian defined on the (3+1)D space of the continuous parameters. At lowest quantum order, the Lagrangian is a Yang--Mills field theory for both $SU(\infty)$ and internal symmetries. We identify the common $SU(\infty)$ symmetry and its interaction with gravity. Consequently, $SU(\infty)$-QGR predicts a spin-1 mediator for quantum gravity (QGR). Apparently, this is in contradiction with classical gravity. Nonetheless, we show that an observer who is unable to detect the quantumness of gravity perceives its effect as curvature of the space of average values of the continuous parameters. We demonstrate Lorentzian geometry of this emergent classical spacetime.</p>

Because periodically driven (Floquet) systems host unusually intricate topological phase boundaries, topological edge states can be prolific at such Floquet quantum criticality.

We also identify a general bulk-edge correspondence formula to predict and understand the emergence of topological edge modes at Floquet quantum criticality. Of direct interest to quantum simulation experiments, our results break new grounds for studies of nonequilibrium topological phases of matter undergoing topological phase transitions.</p>

We present key device features and fabrication details, as well as qubit characterization results confirming device functionality. These results corroborate our fabrication methods and are a crucial step towards scaling of extensible 2D qubit array schemes.</p>

            <h2>Diagnosing electronic phases of matter using photonic correlation functions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gautam Nambiar, Andrey Grankin, Mohammad Hafezi</p>
            <p>In the past couple of decades, there have been significant advances in measuring quantum properties of light, such as quadratures of squeezed light and single-photon counting. Here, we explore whether such tools can be leveraged to probe electronic correlations in the many-body quantum regime. Specifically, we show that it is possible to probe certain spin, charge, and topological orders in an electronic system by measuring the correlation functions of scattered photons. We construct a mapping from the correlators of the scattered photons to those of a correlated insulator, particularly for Mott insulators described by a single-band Fermi-Hubbard model at half-filling. We show that frequency filtering before photodetection plays a crucial role in determining this mapping. We find that if the ground state of the insulator is a gapped spin liquid, a photon-pair correlation function, i.e., $G^{(2)}$, can detect the presence of anyonic excitations with fractional mutual statistics. Moreover, we show that correlations between electromagnetic quadratures can be used to detect expectation values of static spin chirality operators on both the kagome and triangular lattices, thus being useful in detecting chiral spin liquids. More generally, we show that a series of hitherto unmeasured spin-spin and spin-charge correlation functions of the material can be extracted from photonic correlations. This work opens up access to probe correlated materials, beyond the linear response paradigm, by detecting quantum properties of scattered light.</p>

            <h2>Chaos in hyperscaling violating Lifshitz theories</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nikesh Lilani</p>
            <p>We holographically study quantum chaos in hyperscaling-violating Lifshitz (HVL) theories (with charge). Specifically, we present a detailed computation of the out-of-time ordered correlator (OTOC) via shockwave analysis in the bulk HVL geometry with a planar horizon topology. We also compute the butterfly velocity ($v_{B}$) using the entanglement wedge reconstruction and find that it matches the result obtained from the shockwave analysis. Using a recently developed thermodynamic dictionary for HVL theories, we express $v_B$ purely in terms of boundary thermodynamic variables. Furthermore, we analyze in detail the behavior of $v_{B}$ with respect to the dynamical critical exponent ($z$), hyperscaling-violating parameter ($\theta$), entropy (more precisely, the ratio of entropy to the central charge, $\tilde{S}$), and charge (more precisely, the ratio of charge to the central charge, $\tilde{Q}$). Interestingly, $v_B$ varies non-monotonically with $z$ for $\tilde{S} < 1$, whereas it increases monotonically with $z$ for $\tilde{S} \geq 1$. Additionally, $v_B$ varies non-monotonically with $\theta$ for non-zero charge. Moreover, $v_B$ monotonically increases with $\tilde{S}$ and decreases with $\tilde{Q}$ for all allowed values of $z$ and $\theta$. All these features are reported for combinations /{$z$, $\theta$, $\tilde{S}$, $\tilde{Q}$/} for which the temperature is positive, the null energy condition is satisfied, and $v_B$ is not superluminal. Unpacking the non-monotonicities in $v_B$ can offer interesting insights into these theories.</p>

            <h2>Cryptographic tests of the python's lunch conjecture</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alex May, Sabrina Pasterski, Chris Waddell, Michelle Xu</p>
            <p>In the AdS/CFT correspondence, a subregion of the CFT allows for the recovery of a corresponding subregion of the bulk known as its entanglement wedge. In some cases, an entanglement wedge contains a locally but not globally minimal surface homologous to the CFT subregion, in which case it is said to contain a python's lunch. It has been proposed that python's lunch geometries should be modelled by tensor networks that feature projective operations where the wedge narrows. This model leads to the python's lunch (PL) conjecture, which asserts that reconstructing information from past the locally minimal surface is computationally difficult. In this work, we invoke cryptographic tools pertaining to a primitive known as the Conditional Disclosure of Secrets (CDS) to develop consequences of the projective tensor network model that can be checked directly in AdS/CFT. We argue from the tensor network picture that the mutual information between appropriate CFT subregions is lower bounded linearly by an area difference associated with the geometry of the lunch. Recalling that the mutual information is also computed by bulk extremal surfaces, this gives a checkable geometrical consequence of the tensor network model. We prove weakened versions of this geometrical statement in asymptotically AdS$_{2+1}$ spacetimes satisfying the null energy condition, and confirm it in some example geometries, supporting the tensor network model and by proxy the PL conjecture. On the other hand, we point out a tension between the PL conjecture and a plausible cryptographically inspired lower bound on the mutual information involving the complexity of reconstructing operators inside the lunch; this suggests the existence of protocols for computationally secure CDS requiring unexpectedly small entanglement.</p>

            <h2>Generalised second law beyond the semiclassical regime</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Josh Kirklin</p>
            <p>We prove that the generalised second law (GSL), with an appropriate modification, holds in perturbative gravity to all orders beyond the semiclassical limit and without a UV cutoff imposed on the fields. Our proof uses algebraic techniques and builds on the recent work of Faulkner and Speranza, which combined Wall's proof of the GSL with the identification of generalised entropy as the von Neumann entropy of a boost-invariant crossed product algebra. The key additional step in our approach is to further impose invariance under null translations. Doing so requires one to describe horizon exterior regions in a relational manner, so we introduce `dynamical cuts': quantum reference frames which give the location of a cut of the horizon. We use idealised dynamical cuts, but expect that our methods can be generalised to more realistic models. The modified GSL that we prove says that the difference in generalised entropies of the regions outside two dynamical cuts is bounded below by the free energy of the degrees of freedom giving the location of the later cut. If one takes a semiclassical limit, imposes a UV cutoff, and requires the cuts to obey certain energy conditions, then our result reduces to the standard GSL.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Javier M. Magan, Martin Sasieta, Brian Swingle</p>
            <p>In this paper, we present a quantitative holographic relation between a microscopic measure of randomness and the geometric length of the wormhole in the black hole interior. To this end, we perturb an AdS black hole with Brownian semiclassical sources, implementing the continuous version of a random quantum circuit for the black hole. We use the random circuit to prepare ensembles of states of the black hole whose semiclassical duals contain Einstein-Rosen (ER) caterpillars: long cylindrical wormholes with large numbers of matter inhomogeneities, of linearly growing length with the circuit time. In this setup, we show semiclassically that the ensemble of ER caterpillars of average length $k\ell_{\Delta}$ and matter correlation scale $\ell_{\Delta}$ forms an approximate quantum state $k$-design of the black hole. At exponentially long circuit times, the ensemble of ER caterpillars becomes polynomial-copy indistinguishable from a collection of random states of the black hole. We comment on the implications of these results for holographic circuit complexity and for the holographic description of the black hole interior.</p>

            <h2>Automatically Refining Assertions for Efficient Debugging of Quantum Programs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Damian Rovara, Lukas Burgholzer, Robert Wille</p>
            <p>As new advancements in the field of quantum computing lead to the development of increasingly complex programs, approaches to validate and debug these programs are becoming more important. To this end, methods employed in classical debugging, such as assertions for testing specific properties of a program's state, have been adapted for quantum programs. However, to efficiently debug quantum programs, it is key to properly place these assertions. This usually requires a deep understanding of the program's underlying mathematical properties, constituting a time-consuming manual task for developers. To address this problem, this work proposes methods for automatically refining assertions in quantum programs by moving them to more favorable positions in the program or by placing new assertions that help to further narrow down potential error locations. This allows developers to take advantage of rich and expressive assertions that greatly improve the debugging experience without requiring them to place these assertions manually in an otherwise tedious manner. An open-source implementation of the proposed methods is available at this https URL.</p>

            <p>Quantum error correction is essential for bridging the gap between the error rates of physical devices and the extremely low logical error rates required for quantum algorithms. Recent error-correction demonstrations on superconducting processors have focused primarily on the surface code, which offers a high error threshold but poses limitations for logical operations. In contrast, the color code enables much more efficient logic, although it requires more complex stabilizer measurements and decoding techniques. Measuring these stabilizers in planar architectures such as superconducting qubits is challenging, and so far, realizations of color codes have not addressed performance scaling with code size on any platform. Here, we present a comprehensive demonstration of the color code on a superconducting processor, achieving logical error suppression and performing logical operations. Scaling the code distance from three to five suppresses logical errors by a factor of $\Lambda_{3/5}$ = 1.56(4). Simulations indicate this performance is below the threshold of the color code, and furthermore that the color code may be more efficient than the surface code with modest device improvements. Using logical randomized benchmarking, we find that transversal Clifford gates add an error of only 0.0027(3), which is substantially less than the error of an idling error correction cycle. We inject magic states, a key resource for universal computation, achieving fidelities exceeding 99% with post-selection (retaining about 75% of the data). Finally, we successfully teleport logical states between distance-three color codes using lattice surgery, with teleported state fidelities between 86.5(1)% and 90.7(1)%. This work establishes the color code as a compelling research direction to realize fault-tolerant quantum computation on superconducting processors in the near future.</p>

            <p>We explore the dissipative phase transition of the two-photon Dicke model, a topic that has garnered significant attention recently. Our analysis reveals that while single-photon loss does not stabilize the intrinsic instability in the model, the inclusion of two-photon loss restores stability, leading to the emergence of superradiant states which coexist with the normal vacuum states. Using a second-order cumulant expansion for the photons, we derive an analytical description of the system in the thermodynamic limit which agrees well with the exact calculation results. Additionally, we present the Wigner function for the system, shedding light on the breaking of the Z4-symmetry inherent in the model. These findings offer valuable insights into stabilization mechanisms in open quantum systems and pave the way for exploring complex nonlinear dynamics in two-photon Dicke models.</p>

Here, we demonstrate the simultaneous generation of all four Bell states by exploiting the HOM interference of VMs. The resulting Bell states exhibit spatially tailored distributions that are determined by the input modes. These results represent a significant step in manipulating HOM interference within structured photons, offering promising avenues for high-dimensional quantum information processing and in particular high-dimensional quantum communication, quantum sensing, and advanced photonic technologies reliant on tailored quantum states of light.</p>

            <p>The Dicke-Ising model, one of the few paradigmatic models of matter-light interaction, exhibits a superradiant quantum phase transition above a critical coupling strength. However, in natural optical systems, its experimental validation is hindered by a "no-go theorem''. Here, we propose a digital-analog quantum simulator for this model based on an ensemble of interacting qubits coupled to a single-mode photonic resonator. We analyze the system's free energy landscape using field-theoretical methods and develop a digital-analog quantum algorithm that disentangles qubit and photon degrees of freedom through a parity-measurement protocol. This disentangling enables the emulation of a photonic Schrödinger cat state, which is a hallmark of the superradiant ground state in finite-size systems and can be unambiguously probed through the Wigner tomography of the resonator's field.</p>

            <h2>Multi-user QKD using quotient graph states derived from continuous-variable dual-rail cluster states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akash nag Oruganti</p>
            <p>Multipartite entangled states are fundamental resources for multi-user quantum cryptographic tasks. Despite significant advancements in generating large-scale continuous-variable (CV) cluster states, particularly the dual-rail cluster state because of its utility in measurement-based quantum computation, its application in quantum cryptography has remained largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce a novel protocol for generating three user conference keys using a CV dual-rail cluster state. We develop the concept of a quotient graph state by applying a node coloring scheme to the infinite dual-rail graph, resulting in a six-mode pure graph state suitable for cryptographic applications. Our results demonstrate that the proposed protocol achieves performance close to that of GHZ-based protocols for quantum conference key agreement (QCKA), with GHZ states performing slightly better. However, a key advantage of our protocol lies in its ability to generate bipartite keys post-QCKA, a feature not achievable with GHZ states. Additionally, compared to a downstream access network using two-mode squeezed vacuum states, our protocol achieves superior performance in generating bipartite keys. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to the finite-size regime and consider the impact of using impure squeezed states for generating the multipartite entangled states, reflecting experimental imperfections. Our findings indicate that even with finite resources and non-ideal state preparation, the proposed protocol maintains its advantages. We also introduce a more accurate method to estimate the capacity of a protocol to generate bipartite keys in a quantum network.</p>

            <p>Discrete-step walks describe the dynamics of particles in a lattice subject to hopping or splitting events at discrete times. Despite being of primordial interest to the physics of quantum walks, the topological properties arising from their discrete-step nature have been hardly explored. Here we report the observation of topological phases unique to discrete-step walks. We use light pulses in a double-fibre ring setup whose dynamics maps into a two-dimensional lattice subject to discrete splitting events. We show that the number of edge states is not simply described by the bulk invariants of the lattice (i.e., the Chern number and the Floquet winding number) as would be the case in static lattices and in lattices subject to smooth modulations. The number of edge states is also determined by a topological invariant associated to the discrete-step unitary operators acting at the edges of the lattice. This situation goes beyond the usual bulk-edge correspondence and allows manipulating the number of edge states without the need to go through a gap closing transition. Our work opens new perspectives for the engineering of topological modes for particles subject to quantum walks.</p>

Starting from semi-classical rate equations and making a simple hypothesis for the phase of the laser field, a simple stochastic model for the laser quantum noise is suggested. The model is shown to agree quantitatively with quantum master equations for microscopic lasers with a small number of emitters and with classical Langevin equations for macroscopic systems. In contrast, neither quantum master equations nor classical Langevin equations adequately address the mesoscopic regime. The stochastic approach is used to calculate the linewidth throughout the transition to lasing, where the linewidth changes from being dominated by the particle-like nature of photons below threshold to the wave-like nature above threshold, where it is strongly influenced by index fluctuations enhancing the linewidth.</p>

            <p>A remarkable characteristic of quantum computing is the potential for reliable computation despite faulty qubits. This can be achieved through quantum error correction, which is typically implemented by repeatedly applying static syndrome checks, permitting correction of logical information. Recently, the development of time-dynamic approaches to error correction has uncovered new codes and new code implementations. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate three time-dynamic implementations of the surface code, each offering a unique solution to hardware design challenges and introducing flexibility in surface code realization. First, we embed the surface code on a hexagonal lattice, reducing the necessary couplings per qubit from four to three. Second, we walk a surface code, swapping the role of data and measure qubits each round, achieving error correction with built-in removal of accumulated non-computational errors. Finally, we realize the surface code using iSWAP gates instead of the traditional CNOT, extending the set of viable gates for error correction without additional overhead. We measure the error suppression factor when scaling from distance-3 to distance-5 codes of $\Lambda_{35,\text{hex}} = 2.15(2)$, $\Lambda_{35,\text{walk}} = 1.69(6)$, and $\Lambda_{35,\text{iSWAP}} = 1.56(2)$, achieving state-of-the-art error suppression for each. With detailed error budgeting, we explore their performance trade-offs and implications for hardware design. This work demonstrates that dynamic circuit approaches satisfy the demands for fault-tolerance and opens new alternative avenues for scalable hardware design.</p>

            <p>Machine learning has been revolutionizing our world over the last few years and is also increasingly exploited in several areas of physics, including quantum dynamics and this http URL need for a framework that brings together machine learning models and quantum simulation methods has been quite high within the quantum control field, with the ultimate goal of exploiting these powerful computational methods for the efficient implementation of modern quantum technologies. The existing frameworks for quantum system simulations, such as QuTip and this http URL, even though they are very successful in simulating quantum dynamics, cannot be easily incorporated into the platforms used for the development of machine learning models, like for example PyTorch. The TorchQC framework introduced in the present work comes exactly to fill this gap. It is a new library written entirely in Python and based on the PyTorch deep learning library. PyTorch and other deep learning frameworks are based on tensors, a structure that is also used in quantum mechanics. This is the common ground that TorchQC utilizes to combine quantum physics simulations and deep learning this http URL exploits PyTorch and its tensor mechanism to represent quantum states and operators as tensors, while it also incorporates all the tools needed to simulate quantum system dynamics. All necessary operations are internal in the PyTorch library, thus TorchQC programs can be executed in GPUs, substantially reducing the simulation time. We believe that the proposed TorchQC library has the potential to accelerate the development of deep learning models directly incorporating quantum simulations, enabling the easier integration of these powerful techniques in modern quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>Optical Schrödinger cat states are non-Gaussian states with applications in quantum technologies, such as for building error-correcting states in quantum computing. Yet the efficient generation of high-fidelity optical Schrödinger cat states is an outstanding problem in quantum optics. Here, we propose using squeezed superpositions of zero and two photons, $|\theta\rangle = \cos{(\theta/2)}|0\rangle + \sin{(\theta/2)}|2\rangle$, as ingredients for protocols to efficiently generate high-fidelity cat states. We present a protocol using linear optics with success probability $P\gtrsim 50\%$ that can generate cat states of size $|\alpha|^2=5$ with fidelity $F>0.99$. The protocol relies only on detecting single photons and is remarkably tolerant of loss, with $2\%$ detection loss still achieving $F>0.98$ for cats with $|\alpha|^2=5$. We also show that squeezed $\theta$ states are ideal candidates for nonlinear photon subtraction using a two-level system with near deterministic success probability and fidelity $F>0.98$ for cat states of size $|\alpha|^2=5$. Schemes for generating $\theta$ states using quantum emitters are also presented. Our protocols can be implemented with current state-of-the-art quantum optics experiments.</p>

            <p>Hardware efficient methods for high fidelity quantum state measurements are crucial for superconducting qubit experiments, as qubit numbers grow and feedback and state reset begin to be employed for quantum error correction. We present a 3D re-entrant cavity filter designed for frequency-multiplexed readout of superconducting qubits. The cavity filter is situated out of the plane of the qubit circuit and capacitively couples to an array of on-chip readout resonators in a manner that can scale to large qubit arrays. The re-entrant cavity functions as a large-linewidth bandpass filter with intrinsic Purcell filtering. We demonstrate the concept with a four-qubit multiplexed device.</p>

            <p>Light-matter interaction with squeezed vacuum has received much interest for the ability to enhance the native interaction strength between an atom and a photon with a reservoir assumed to have an infinite bandwidth. Here, we study a model of parametrically driven cavity quantum electrodynamics (cavity QED) for enhancing light-matter interaction while subjected to a finite-bandwidth squeezed vacuum drive. Our method is capable of unveiling the effect of relative bandwidth as well as squeezing required to observe the anticipated anti-crossing spectrum and enhanced cooperativity without the ideal squeezed bath assumption. Furthermore, we analyze the practicality of said models when including intrinsic photon loss due to resonators imperfection. With these results, we outline the requirements for experimentally implementing an effectively squeezed bath in solid-state platforms such as InAs quantum dot cavity QED such that \textit{in situ} control and enhancement of light-matter interaction could be realized.</p>

            <p>Realizing universal fault-tolerant quantum computation is a key goal in quantum information science. By encoding quantum information into logical qubits utilizing quantum error correcting codes, physical errors can be detected and corrected, enabling substantial reduction in logical error rates. However, the set of logical operations that can be easily implemented on such encoded qubits is often constrained, necessitating the use of special resource states known as 'magic states' to implement universal, classically hard circuits. A key method to prepare high-fidelity magic states is to perform 'distillation', creating them from multiple lower fidelity inputs. Here we present the experimental realization of magic state distillation with logical qubits on a neutral-atom quantum computer. Our approach makes use of a dynamically reconfigurable architecture to encode and perform quantum operations on many logical qubits in parallel. We demonstrate the distillation of magic states encoded in d=3 and d=5 color codes, observing improvements of the logical fidelity of the output magic states compared to the input logical magic states. These experiments demonstrate a key building block of universal fault-tolerant quantum computation, and represent an important step towards large-scale logical quantum processors.</p>

            <h2>Universal quantum computation via scalable measurement-free error correction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stefano Veroni, Alexandru Paler, Giacomo Giudice</p>
            <p>We show that universal quantum computation can be made fault-tolerant in a scenario where the error-correction is implemented without mid-circuit measurements. To this end, we introduce a measurement-free deformation protocol of the Bacon-Shor code to realize a logical $\mathit{CCZ}$ gate, enabling a universal set of fault-tolerant operations. Independently, we demonstrate that certain stabilizer codes can be concatenated in a measurement-free way without having to rely on a universal logical gate set. This is achieved by means of the disposable Toffoli gadget, which realizes the feedback operation in a resource-efficient way. For the purpose of benchmarking the proposed protocols with circuit-level noise, we implement an efficient method to simulate non-Clifford circuits consisting of few Hadamard gates. In particular, our findings support that below-breakeven logical performance is achievable with a circuit-level error rate below $10^{-3}$. Altogether, the deformation protocol and the Toffoli gadget provide a blueprint for a fully fault-tolerant architecture without any feed-forward operation, which is particularly suited for state-of-the-art neutral-atom platforms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Henry Bloss, Brandon Kriesten, T. J. Hobbs</p>
            <p>Deeply inelastic scattering (DIS) is an essential process for exploring the structure of visible matter and testing the standard model. At the same time, the theoretical interpretation of DIS measurements depends on QCD factorization theorems whose validity deteriorates at the lower values of $Q^2$ and $W^2$ typical of neutrino DIS in accelerator-based oscillation searches. For this reason, progress in understanding the origin and limits of QCD factorization is invaluable to the accuracy and precision of predictions for these upcoming neutrino experiments. In these short proceedings, we introduce a novel approach based on the quantum entropy associated with continuous distributions in QCD, using it to characterize the limits of factorization theorems relevant for the description of neutrino DIS. This work suggests an additional avenue for dissecting factorization-breaking dynamics through the quantum entropy, which could also play a role in quantum simulations of related systems.</p>

            <p>The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model is a cornerstone in the study of quantum chaos and holographic quantum matter. Real-world implementations, however, deviate from the idealized all-to-all connectivity, raising questions about the robustness of its chaotic properties. In this work, we investigate a quadratic SYK model with distance-dependent interactions governed by a power-law decay. By analytically and numerically studying the spectral form factor (SFF), we uncover how the single particle transitions manifest in the many-body system. While the SFF demonstrates robustness under slightly reduced interaction ranges, further suppression leads to a breakdown of perturbation theory and new spectral regimes, marked by a higher dip and the emergence of a secondary plateau. Our results highlight the interplay between single-particle criticality and many-body dynamics, offering new insights into the quantum chaos-to-localization transition and its reflection in spectral statistics.</p>

            <h2>Massive graviton dark matter searches with long-baseline atom interferometers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Diego Blas, John Carlton, Christopher McCabe</p>
            <p>Atom interferometers offer exceptional sensitivity to ultra-light dark matter (ULDM) through their precise measurement of phenomena acting on atoms. While previous work has established their capability to detect scalar and vector ULDM, their potential for detecting spin-2 ULDM remains unexplored. This work investigates the sensitivity of atom interferometers to spin-2 ULDM by considering several frameworks for massive gravity: a Lorentz-invariant Fierz-Pauli case and two Lorentz-violating scenarios. We find that coherent oscillations of the spin-2 ULDM field induce a measurable phase shift through three distinct channels: coupling of the scalar mode to atomic energy levels, and vector and tensor effects that modify the propagation of atoms and light. Atom interferometers uniquely probe all of these effects, while providing sensitivity to a different mass range from laser interferometers. Our results demonstrate the potential of atom interferometers to advance the search for spin-2 dark matter through accessing unexplored parameter space and uncovering new interactions between ULDM and atoms.</p>

            <p>The density-density response in optimally doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ has recently been shown to exhibit conformal symmetry. Using, the experimentally inferred conformal dynamic susceptibility, we compute the resultant quantum Fisher information (QFI), a witness to multi-partite entanglement. In contrast to a Fermi liquid in which the QFI is approximately temperature independent much below the Fermi energy scale, we find that the QFI increases as a power law at low temperatures but ultimately extrapolates to a constant at $T=0$. The constant is of the form, $\omega_g^{2\Delta}$, where $\Delta$ is the conformal dimension and $\omega_g$ is the UV cutoff which is on the order of the pseudogap. As this constant {depends on both UV and IR properties}, it illustrates that multipartite entanglement in a strange metal exhibits UV-IR mixing, a benchmark feature of doped Mott insulators as exemplified by dynamical spectral weight transfer. We conclude with a discussion of the implication of our results for low-energy reductions of the Hubbard model.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abdul Wahab, Muqaddar Abbas, Xiaosen Yang, Yuee Xie, Yuanping Chen</p>
            <p>In this research, we investigate second-order sideband generation (SSG) and slow-fast light using a hybrid system comprised of two coupled opto- and magnomechanical microspheres, namely a YIG sphere and a silica sphere. The YIG sphere hosts a magnon mode and a vibration mode induced by magnetostriction, whereas the silica sphere has an optical whispering gallery mode and a mechanical mode coupled via optomechanical interaction. The mechanical modes of both spheres are close in frequency and are coherently coupled by the straightway physical contact between the two microspheres. We use a perturbation approach to solve the Heisenberg-Langevin equations, offering an analytical framework for transmission rate and SSG. Using experimentally feasible settings, we demonstrate that the transmission rate and SSG are strongly dependent on the magnomechanical, optomechanical, and mechanics mechanics coupling strengths (MMCS) between the two microspheres. The numerical results show that increasing the MMCS can enhance both the transmission rate and SSG efficiency, resulting in gain within our system. Our findings, in particular, reveal that the efficiency of the SSG can be effectively controlled by cavity detuning, decay rate, and pump power. Notably, our findings suggest that modifying the system parameters can alter the group delay, thereby regulating the transition between fast and slow light propagation, and vice versa. Our protocol provides guidelines for manipulating nonlinear optical properties and controlling light propagation, with applications including optical switching, information storage, and precise measurement of weak signals.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sudin Ganguly, S. K. Maiti</p>
            <p>Non-reciprocal hopping induces a synthetic magnetic flux which leads to the non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm effect. Since non-Hermitian Hamiltonians possess both real and imaginary eigenvalues, this effect allows the observation of real and imaginary persistent currents in a ring threaded by the synthetic flux~\cite{nrh8}. Motivated by this, we investigate the behavior of persistent currents in a disordered Hatano-Nelson ring with anti-Hermitian intradimer hopping. The disorder is diagonal and we explore three distinct models, namely the Aubry-André-Harper model, the Fibonacci model, both representing correlated disorder, and an uncorrelated (random) model. We conduct a detailed analysis of the energy spectrum and examine the real and imaginary parts of the persistent current under various conditions such as different ring sizes and filling factors. Interestingly, we find that real and imaginary persistent currents exhibit amplification in the presence of correlated disorder. This amplification is also observed in certain individual random configurations but vanishes after configuration averaging. Additionally, we observe both diamagnetic and paramagnetic responses in the current behavior and investigate aspects of persistent currents in the absence of disorder that have not been previously explored. Interestingly, we find that the intradimer bonds host only imaginary currents, while the interdimer bonds carry only real currents.</p>

            <h2>Quantum chaos, localization and phase transitions in random graphs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ioannis Kleftogiannis, Ilias Amanatidis</p>
            <p>The energy level statistics of uniform random graphs are studied, by treating the graphs as random tight-binding lattices. The inherent random geometry of the graphs and their dynamical spatial dimensionality, leads to various quantum chaotic and localized phases and transitions between them. Essentially the random geometry acts as disorder, whose strength is characterized by the ratio of edges over vertices R in the graphs. For dense graphs, with large ratio R, the spacing between successive energy levels follows the Wigner-Dyson distribution, leading to a quantum chaotic behavior and a metallic phase, characterized by level repulsion. For ratios near R=0.5, where a large dominating component in the graph appears, the level spacing follows the Poisson distribution with level crossings and a localized phase for the respective wavefunctions lying on the graph. For intermediate ratios R we observe a phase transition between the quantum chaotic and localized phases characterized by a semi-Poisson distribution. The values R of the critical regime where the phase transition occurs depend on the energy of the system. Our analysis shows that physical systems with random geometry, for example ones with a fluctuating/dynamical spatial dimension, contain novel universal phase transition properties, similar to those occuring in more traditional phase transitions based on symmetry breaking mechanisms, whose universal properties are strongly determined by the dimensionality of the system.</p>

            <p>Neutral resonant states of molecules play a very important role in the dissociation dynamics and other electronic processes that occur via intermediate capture into these states. With the goal of identifying resonant states, and their corresponding widths, of the imidogen molecule NH as a function of internuclear distance, we have performed detailed R-matrix calculations on the e + NH+ system. In a previous work, we had identified bound states of NH and Feshbach resonances in the e + NH+ system at a single geometry, namely the NH+ equilibrium Re = 2.0205 a0 . Here we present a much more detailed work by repeating the calculation on over 60 internuclear distances to obtain the corresponding potential energy curves. The bound states for nine symmetries have been detailed many of which, particularly the singlet states, were never studied before. Several resonant states of different symmetries, which were unknown until now, have been systematically identified and their widths calculated in the present work, which proved much more challenging due to presence of many avoided crossings. It is hoped that the bound and the new resonant states obtained here will open up other molecular dynamics studies, since for several dissociative processes, although experimental data existed for more than a decade, these are still uncorroborated due to absence of molecular data, and hence subsequent theoretical calculations.</p>

By employing single-atom detection of Rb and Cs, we observe molecule formation via correlated loss of both species and study the formation dynamics with single-particle resolution. We control the interatomic distances by manipulating the relative wavefunction of atom pairs using the tweezer intensity, optimizing the coupling to molecular states and exploring the effect of the tweezer on these states. Additionally, we demonstrate molecule association with atoms trapped in separate tweezers, paving the way for state-selective assembly of polyatomic molecules. The observed binding energies, molecular alignment, and bond lengths are in good agreement with theory. Our approach is broadly applicable to Rydberg tweezer platforms, expanding the range of available molecular systems and enabling the integration of Rydberg molecules into existing quantum science platforms.</p>

Starting from a double-holographic model of eternal two-sided asymptotically AdS$_d$ ($d>2$) black hole each coupled to a flat $d$-dimensional bath, we show that the entanglement dynamics in the late-time, large-subregion limit is described by entanglement membrane, thereby establishing a quantitative equivalence between a semi-classical gravity and a chaotic quantum many-body system calculation of the Page curve.</p>

            <p>A core challenge for superconducting quantum computers is to scale up the number of qubits in each processor without increasing noise or cross-talk. Distributed quantum computing across small qubit arrays, known as chiplets, can address these challenges in a scalable manner. We propose a chiplet architecture over microwave links with potential to exceed monolithic performance on near-term hardware. Our methods of modeling and evaluating the chiplet architecture bridge the physical and network layers in these processors. We find evidence that distributing computation across chiplets may reduce the overall error rates associated with moving data across the device, despite higher error figures for transfers across links. Preliminary analyses suggest that latency is not substantially impacted, and that at least some applications and architectures may avoid bottlenecks around chiplet boundaries. In the long-term, short-range networks may underlie quantum computers just as local area networks underlie classical datacenters and supercomputers today.</p>

            <p>Understanding the influence of measurements on the properties of many-body systems is a fundamental problem in quantum mechanics and for quantum technologies. This paper explores how a finite density of stochastic local measurement modifies a given state's entanglement structure. Considering various measurement protocols, we explore the typical quantum correlations of their associated projected ensembles arising from the ground state of the quantum Ising model. Using large-scale numerical simulations, we demonstrate substantial differences among inequivalent measurement protocols. Surprisingly, we observe that forced on-site measurements can enhance both bipartite and multipartite entanglement. We present a phenomenological toy model and perturbative calculations to analytically support these results. Furthermore, we extend these considerations to the non-Hermitian Ising model, naturally arising in optically monitored systems, and we show that its qualitative entanglement features are not altered by a finite density of projective measurements. Overall, these results reveal a complex phenomenology where local quantum measurements do not simply disentangle degrees of freedom, but may actually strengthen the entanglement in the system.</p>

            <p>Quantum networks (QNs) exhibit stronger connectivity than predicted by classical percolation, yet the origin of this phenomenon remains unexplored. Here, we apply a statistical physics model -- concurrence percolation -- to uncover the origin of stronger connectivity on hierarchical scale-free networks, the ($U,V$) flowers. These networks allow full analytical control over path connectivity through two adjustable path-length parameters, $U \leq V$. This precise control enables us to determine critical exponents well beyond current simulation limits, revealing that classical and concurrence percolations, while both satisfying the hyperscaling relation, fall into distinct universality classes. This distinction arises from how they "superpose" parallel, non-shortest path contributions into overall connectivity. Concurrence percolation, unlike its classical counterpart, is sensitive to non-shortest paths and shows higher resilience to detours as these paths lengthen. This enhanced resilience is also observed in real-world hierarchical, scale-free Internet networks. Our findings highlight a crucial principle for QN design: when non-shortest paths are abundant, they notably enhance QN connectivity beyond what is achievable with classical percolation.</p>

The system can also support standard two-particle Bloch oscillations under certain conditions. We propose two types of dimerized non-Hermitian systems to demonstrate our results. In addition, we also propose a scheme to demonstrate the results of electron-pair dynamics in a single-particle 2D $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric square lattice.</p>

Encoding key information in continuous variables (CV), such as the values of quadrature components of coherent states of light, brings implementations much closer to standard optical communication systems, but this comes at the price of significant complexity in the digital signal processing techniques required for operation at low signal-to-noise ratios. In this work, we wish to lower the barriers to entry for CV-QKD experiments associated to this difficulty by providing a highly modular, open source software that is in principle hardware agnostic and can be used in multiple configurations. We benchmarked this software, called QOSST, using an experimental setup with a locally generated local oscillator, frequency multiplexed pilots and RF-heterodyne detection, and obtained state-of-the-art secret key rates of the order of Mbit/s over metropolitan distances at the asymptotic limit. We hope that QOSST can be used to stimulate further experimental advances in CV-QKD and be improved and extended by the community to achieve high performance in a wide variety of configurations.</p>

            <h2>On the applicability of Kolmogorov's theory of probability to the description of quantum phenomena. Part I: Foundations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maik Reddiger</p>
            <p>It is a common view that von Neumann laid the foundations of a "quantum probability theory" with his axiomatization of quantum mechanics (QM). As such, it is regarded a generalization of the "classical probability theory" due to Kolmogorov. Outside of quantum physics, however, Kolmogorov's axioms enjoy universal applicability. This raises the question of whether quantum physics indeed requires such a generalization of our conception of probability or if von Neumann's axiomatization of QM was contingent on the absence of a general theory of probability in the 1920s. In this work I argue in favor of the latter position. In particular, I show that for non-relativistic $N$-body quantum systems subject to a time-independent scalar potential, it is possible to construct a mathematically rigorous theory based on Kolmogorov's axioms and physically natural random variables, which reproduces central predictions of QM. The respective theories are distinct, so that an empirical comparison may be possible. Moreover, the approach can in principle be adapted to other classes of quantum-mechanical models. Part II of this series discusses the empirical violation of Bell inequalities in the context of this approach. Part III addresses the projection postulate and the question of measurement.</p>

            <p>Continuous variables (CV) offer a promising platform for the development of various applications, such as quantum communication, computing, and sensing, and CV graph states represent a family of powerful entangled resource states for all these areas. In many of these protocols, a crucial aspect is the certification of the quantum state subsequently used. While numerous protocols exist, most rely on assumptions unrealistic for physical continuous variable states, such as infinite precision in quadrature measurement or the use of states requiring infinite squeezing. In this work, we adapt existing protocols to deal with these unavoidable considerations, and use them to certify their application for different quantum information tasks. More specifically, we show how CV graph states can be efficiently verified and certified even in a noisy and imperfect setting. We then discuss how our findings impact the usability of states obtained after the protocol for different applications, including quantum teleportation, computing, and sensing.</p>

            <p>Multipartite entanglement, linking multiple nodes simultaneously, is a higher-order correlation that offers advantages over pairwise connections in quantum networks (QNs). Creating reliable, large-scale multipartite entanglement requires entanglement routing, a process that combines local, short-distance connections into a long-distance connection, which can be considered as a transformation of network topology. Here, we address the question of whether a QN can be topologically transformed into another via entanglement routing. Our key result is an exact mapping from multipartite entanglement routing to Nash-Williams's graph immersion problem, extended to hypergraphs. This generalized hypergraph immersion problem introduces a partial order between QN topologies, permitting certain topological transformations while precluding others, offering discerning insights into the design and manipulation of higher-order network topologies in QNs.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Curriculum Learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Quoc Hoan Tran, Yasuhiro Endo, Hirotaka Oshima</p>
            <p>Quantum machine learning (QML) requires significant quantum resources to address practical real-world problems. When the underlying quantum information exhibits hierarchical structures in the data, limitations persist in training complexity and generalization. Research should prioritize both the efficient design of quantum architectures and the development of learning strategies to optimize resource usage. We propose a framework called quantum curriculum learning (Q-CurL) for quantum data, where the curriculum introduces simpler tasks or data to the learning model before progressing to more challenging ones. Q-CurL exhibits robustness to noise and data limitations, which is particularly relevant for current and near-term noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. We achieve this through a curriculum design based on quantum data density ratios and a dynamic learning schedule that prioritizes the most informative quantum data. Empirical evidence shows that Q-CurL significantly enhances training convergence and generalization for unitary learning and improves the robustness of quantum phase recognition tasks. Q-CurL is effective with broad physical learning applications in condensed matter physics and quantum chemistry.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonas Stein, Jonas Blenninger, David Bucher, Peter J. Eder, Elif Çetiner, Maximilian Zorn, Claudia Linnhoff-Popien</p>
            <p>The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a prominent quantum algorithm designed to find approximate solutions to combinatorial optimization problems, which are challenging for classical computers. In the current era, where quantum hardware is constrained by noise and limited qubit availability, simulating the QAOA remains essential for research. However, existing state-of-the-art simulation frameworks suffer from long execution times or lack comprehensive functionality, usability, and versatility, often requiring users to implement essential features themselves. Additionally, these frameworks are primarily restricted to Python, limiting their use in safer and faster languages like Rust, which offer, e.g., advanced parallelization capabilities. In this paper, we develop a GPU accelerated QAOA simulation framework utilizing the NVIDIA CUDA toolkit. This framework offers a complete interface for QAOA simulations, enabling the calculation of (exact) expectation values, direct access to the statevector, fast sampling, and high-performance optimization methods using an advanced state-of-the-art gradient calculation technique. The framework is designed for use in Python and Rust, providing flexibility for integration into a wide range of applications, including those requiring fast algorithm implementations leveraging QAOA at its core. The new framework's performance is rigorously benchmarked on the MaxCut problem and compared against the current state-of-the-art general-purpose quantum circuit simulation frameworks Qiskit and Pennylane as well as the specialized QAOA simulation tool QOKit. Our evaluation shows that our approach outperforms the existing state-of-the-art solutions in terms of runtime up to multiple orders of magnitude. Our implementation is publicly available at this https URL and Zenodo.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Calculus of Fibonacci Divisors and Fermion-Boson Entanglement for Infinite Hierarchy of N = 2 Supersymmetric Golden Oscillators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oktay K. Pashaev</p>
            <p>The quantum calculus with two bases, as powers of the Golden and the Silver ratio, relates Fibonacci divisor derivative with Binet formula of Fibonacci divisor number operator, acting in Fock space of quantum this http URL provides a tool to study the hierarchy of Golden oscillators with energy spectrum in form of Fibonacci divisor numbers. We generalize this model to supersymmetric number operator and corresponding Binet formula for supersymmetric Fibonacci divisor number operator. The operator determines the Hamiltonian of hierarchy of supersymmetric Golden oscillators, acting in fermion-boson Hilbert space and belonging to N=2 supersymmetric algebra. The eigenstates of the super Fibonacci divisor number operator are double degenerate and can be characterized by a point on the super-Bloch sphere. By the supersymmetric Fibonacci divisor annihilation operator, we construct the hierarchy of supersymmetric coherent states as eigenstates of this operator. Entanglement of fermions with bosons in these states is calculated by the concurrence, represented by the Gram determinant and hierarchy of Golden exponential functions. We show that the reference states and corresponding von Neumann entropy, measuring fermion-boson entanglement, are characterized completely by the powers of the Golden ratio. The simple geometrical classification of entangled states by the Frobenius ball and meaning of the concurrence as double area of parallelogram in Hilbert space are given.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anne Matthies, Nicolas Dannenfeld, Silvia Pappalardi, Achim Rosch</p>
            <p>We systematically investigate whether classical hydrodynamic field theories can predict the long-time dynamics of many-particle quantum systems. As an example, we investigate numerically and analytically the time evolution of a chain of spins (or qubits) subject to a stroboscopic dynamics. The time evolution is implemented by a sequence of local and nearest-neighbor gates which conserve the total magnetization. The long-time dynamics of such a system is believed to be describable by a hydrodynamics field theory, which, importantly, includes the effect of noise. Based on a field theoretical analysis and symmetry arguments, we map each operator in the spin model to corresponding fields in hydrodynamics. This allows us to predict which expectation values decay exponentially, and which of them decay with a hydrodynamics long-time tail. We illustrate these findings by studying the time evolution of all 255 Hermitian operators which can be defined on four neighboring sites. We show that all operators not protected by hydrodynamics decay exponentially and investigate a selected set of slowly decaying operators.</p>

            <h2>Quantum machine learning for multiclass classification beyond kernel methods</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chao Ding, Shi Wang, Yaonan Wang, Weibo Gao</p>
            <p>Quantum machine learning is considered one of the current research fields with immense potential. In recent years, Havlíček et al. [Nature 567, 209-212 (2019)] have proposed a quantum machine learning algorithm with quantum-enhanced feature spaces, which effectively addressed a binary classification problem on a superconducting processor and offered a potential pathway to achieving quantum advantage. However, a straightforward binary classification algorithm falls short in solving multiclass classification problems. In this paper, we propose a quantum algorithm that rigorously demonstrates that quantum kernel methods enhance the efficiency of multiclass classification in real-world applications, providing quantum advantage. To demonstrate quantum advantage, we design six distinct quantum kernels within the quantum algorithm to map input data into quantum state spaces and estimate the corresponding quantum kernel matrices. The results from quantum simulations reveal that the quantum algorithm outperforms its classical counterpart in handling six real-world multiclass classification problems. Furthermore, we leverage a variety of performance metrics to comprehensively evaluate the classification and generalization performance of the quantum algorithm. The results demonstrate that the quantum algorithm achieves superior classification and better generalization performance relative to classical counterparts.</p>

            <h2>Universal graph representation of stabilizer codes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrey Boris Khesin, Jonathan Z. Lu, Peter W. Shor</p>
            <p>We introduce a representation of $[[n, k]]$ stabilizer codes as semi-bipartite graphs wherein $k$ ``input'' nodes map to $n$ ``output'' nodes, such that output nodes may connect to each other but input nodes may not. We prove that this graph representation is in bijection with tableaus and give an efficient compilation algorithm that transforms tableaus into graphs. We then show that this map is efficiently invertible, which gives a new universal recipe for code construction by way of finding graphs with sufficiently nice properties. The graph representation gives insight into both code construction and algorithms. To the former, we argue that graphs provide a flexible platform for building codes particularly at smaller (non-asymptotic) scales. We construct as examples constant-size codes, e.g. a $[[54, 6, 5]]$ code and a family of roughly $[[n, \frac{n}{\log n}, \log n]]$ codes. We also leverage graphs in a probabilistic analysis to extend the quantum Gilbert-Varshamov bound into a three-way distance-rate-weight tradeoff. To the latter, we show that key coding algorithms -- distance approximation, weight reduction, and decoding -- are unified as instances of a single optimization game on a graph. Moreover, key code properties such as distance, weight, and encoding circuit depth, are all controlled by the graph degree. We give efficient algorithms for producing simple encoding circuits whose depths scale as twice the degree and for implementing logical diagonal and certain Clifford gates with non-constant but reduced depth. Finally, we construct a simple efficient decoding algorithm and prove a performance guarantee for a certain class of graphs, including the roughly $[[n, \frac{n}{\log n}, \log n]]$ code. These results give evidence that graphs are generically useful for the study of stabilizer codes and their practical implementations.</p>

            <h2>Ultimate precision limit of quantum thermal machines</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yoshihiko Hasegawa</p>
            <p>Enhancing the precision of a thermodynamic process inevitably necessitates a thermodynamic cost, a principle formulated as the thermodynamic uncertainty relation. The thermodynamic uncertainty relation states that the relative variance of thermodynamic currents, calculated as the variance divided by the squared mean, decreases as entropy production increases. This means that if entropy production were allowed to become infinitely large, the relative variance could approach zero. However, it is evident that realizing infinitely large entropy production is infeasible in reality. In this Letter, we establish the ultimate limits of precision for open quantum thermal machines operating within a finite-dimensional system and environment. We derive bounds on the relative variance and the expectation of observables, applicable to any unitary evolution of the composite system. These bounds are governed by the \textit{minimum eigenvalue factor}, which serves as a maximal entropy production attainable by the quantum dynamics and parallels the concept of dynamical activity in classical stochastic thermodynamic. Additionally, we investigate how quantum coherence in the initial environmental state affects these fundamental bounds, showing that the presence of coherence can actually improve the ultimate precision limits. Our findings provide insights into fundamental limits on the precision of quantum thermal machines and the role of quantum effects in thermodynamic processes.</p>

            <h2>Parastatistics and a secret communication challenge</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiyuan Wang</p>
            <p>One of the most unconventional features of topological phases of matter is the emergence of quasiparticles with exotic statistics, such as non-Abelian anyons in two dimensional systems. Recently, a different type of exotic particle statistics that is consistently defined in any dimension, called parastatistics, is also shown to be possible in a special family of topological phases. However, the physical significance of emergent parastatistics still remains elusive. Here we demonstrate a distinctive physical consequence of parastatistics by proposing a challenge game that can only be won using physical systems hosting paraparticles, as passing the challenge requires the two participating players to secretly communicate in an indirect way by exploiting the nontrivial exchange statistics of the quasiparticles. The winning strategy using emergent paraparticles is robust against noise, as well as the most relevant class of eavesdropping via local measurements. This provides both an operational definition and an experimental identity test for paraparticles, alongside a potential application in secret communication.</p>

            <p>Yttrium iron garnet (YIG) magnonics has garnered significant research interest because of the unique properties of magnons (quasiparticles of collective spin excitation) for signal processing. In particular, hybrid systems based on YIG magnonics show great promise for quantum information science due to their broad frequency tunability and strong compatibility with other platforms. However, their broad applications have been severely constrained by substantial microwave loss in the gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) substrate at cryogenic temperatures. In this study, we demonstrate that YIG thin films can be spalled from YIG/GGG samples. Our approach is validated by measuring hybrid devices comprising superconducting resonators and spalled YIG films, which exhibits anti-crossing features that indicate strong coupling between magnons and microwave photons. Such new capability of separating YIG thin films from GGG substrates via spalling, and the integrated superconductor-YIG devices represent a significant advancement for integrated magnonic devices, paving the way for advanced magnon-based coherent information processing.</p>

In this review, after presenting definitions, tools and basic results that are necessary for understanding these developments, we summarize the main findings -- as published by the beginning of year 2024 -- including analyses of experimental data in $B$ meson decays and top-quark pair production. We include a detailed discussion of the results for both qubit and qutrits systems, that is, final states containing spin one-half and spin one particles. Entanglement has also been proposed as a new tool to constrain new particles and fields beyond the Standard Model and we introduce the reader to this promising feature as well.</p>

            <p>Levitated ferromagnets act as ultraprecise magnetometers, which can exhibit high quality factors due to their excellent isolation from the environment. These instruments can be utilized in searches for ultralight dark matter candidates, such as axionlike dark matter or dark-photon dark matter. In addition to being sensitive to an axion-photon coupling or kinetic mixing, which produce physical magnetic fields, ferromagnets are also sensitive to the effective magnetic field (or "axion wind") produced by an axion-electron coupling. While the dynamics of a levitated ferromagnet in response to a DC magnetic field have been well studied, all of these couplings would produce AC fields. In this work, we study the response of a ferromagnet to an applied AC magnetic field and use these results to project their sensitivity to axion and dark-photon dark matter. We pay special attention to the direction of motion induced by an applied AC field, in particular, whether it precesses around the applied field (similar to an electron spin) or librates in the plane of the field (similar to a compass needle). We show that existing levitated ferromagnet setups can already have comparable sensitivity to an axion-electron coupling as comagnetometer or torsion balance experiments. In addition, future setups can become sensitive probes of axion-electron coupling, dark-photon kinetic mixing, and axion-photon coupling, for ultralight dark matter masses $m_\mathrm{DM}\lesssim\mathrm{feV}$.</p>

            <p>Quantum scars correspond to enhanced probability densities along unstable classical periodic orbits. In recent years, research on quantum scars has extended to various systems including the many-body regime. In this work we focus on the formation, prevalence, and stability of linear "bouncing-ball" (BB) scars in two-dimensional (2D) quantum wells. These scars have relevance as effective and controllable channels in quantum transport. We utilize imaginary time propagation to solve the 2D Schrödinger equation within an arbitrary external confining potential, specifically the quantum well model with external perturbations. We show how BB scars begin to emerge with a single perturbative peak, such as a repulsive bump or attractive dip that simulates the effect of a charged nanotip in the system. We then identify the optimal size of the perturbative peak to maximize the prevalence of these scars. Finally, we investigate the stability of BB scars against external noise and find that some of them are remarkably robust. This suggests promising opportunities for further applications of BB scars in quantum transport.</p>

            <p>Non-Hermitian phenomena, such as exceptional points, non-Hermitian skin effects, and topologically nontrivial phases, have attracted continued attention. In this work, we reveal how interactions and nonreciprocal hopping could collectively influence the behavior of two interacting bosons on quasiperiodic lattices. Focusing on the Bose-Hubbard model with Aubry-André-Harper quasiperiodic modulations and hopping asymmetry, we discover that the interaction could enlarge the localization transition point of the noninteracting system into a critical phase, in which localized doublons formed by bosonic pairs can coexist with delocalized states. Under the open boundary condition, the bosonic doublons could further show non-Hermitian skin effects, realizing doublon condensation at the edges, and their direction of skin-localization can be flexibly tuned by the hopping parameters. A framework is developed to characterize the spectral, localization, and topological transitions accompanying these phenomena. Our work advances the understanding of localization and topological phases in non-Hermitian systems, particularly in relation to multiparticle interactions.</p>

            <p>As new advancements in the field of quantum computing lead to the development of increasingly complex programs, approaches to validate and debug these programs are becoming more important. To this end, methods employed in classical debugging, such as assertions for testing specific properties of a program's state, have been adapted for quantum programs. However, to efficiently debug quantum programs, it is key to properly place these assertions. This usually requires a deep understanding of the program's underlying mathematical properties, constituting a time-consuming manual task for developers. To address this problem, this work proposes methods for automatically refining assertions in quantum programs by moving them to more favorable positions in the program or by placing new assertions that help to further narrow down potential error locations. This allows developers to take advantage of rich and expressive assertions that greatly improve the debugging experience without requiring them to place these assertions manually in an otherwise tedious manner.

            <p>Quantum error correction is essential for bridging the gap between the error rates of physical devices and the extremely low logical error rates required for quantum algorithms. Recent error-correction demonstrations on superconducting processors have focused primarily on the surface code, which offers a high error threshold but poses limitations for logical operations. In contrast, the color code enables much more efficient logic, although it requires more complex stabilizer measurements and decoding techniques. Measuring these stabilizers in planar architectures such as superconducting qubits is challenging, and so far, realizations of color codes have not addressed performance scaling with code size on any platform. Here, we present a comprehensive demonstration of the color code on a superconducting processor, achieving logical error suppression and performing logical operations. Scaling the code distance from three to five suppresses logical errors by a factor of $\Lambda_{3/5}$ = 1.56(4). Simulations indicate this performance is below the threshold of the color code, and furthermore that the color code may be more efficient than the surface code with modest device improvements. Using logical randomized benchmarking, we find that transversal Clifford gates add an error of only 0.0027(3), which is substantially less than the error of an idling error correction cycle. We inject magic states, a key resource for universal computation, achieving fidelities exceeding 99% with post-selection (retaining about 75% of the data). Finally, we successfully teleport logical states between distance-three color codes using lattice surgery, with teleported state fidelities between 86.5(1)% and 90.7(1)%. This work establishes the color code as a compelling research direction to realize fault-tolerant quantum computation on superconducting processors in the near future.</p>

Our analysis reveals that while single-photon loss does not stabilize the intrinsic instability in the model, the inclusion of two-photon loss restores stability, leading to the emergence of superradiant states which coexist with the normal vacuum states. Using a second-order cumulant expansion for the photons, we derive an analytical description of the system in the thermodynamic limit which agrees well with the exact calculation results. Additionally, we present the Wigner function for the system, shedding light on the breaking of the Z4-symmetry inherent in the model. These findings offer valuable insights into stabilization mechanisms in open quantum systems and pave the way for exploring complex nonlinear dynamics in two-photon Dicke models.</p>

We analyze the system's free energy landscape using field-theoretical methods and develop a digital-analog quantum algorithm that disentangles qubit and photon degrees of freedom through a parity-measurement protocol. This disentangling enables the emulation of a photonic Schrödinger cat state, which is a hallmark of the superradiant ground state in finite-size systems and can be unambiguously probed through the Wigner tomography of the resonator's field.</p>

            <h2>Multi-user QKD using quotient graph states derived from continuous-variable dual-rail cluster states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akash nag Oruganti</p>
            <p>Multipartite entangled states are fundamental resources for multi-user quantum cryptographic tasks. Despite significant advancements in generating large-scale continuous-variable (CV) cluster states, particularly the dual-rail cluster state because of its utility in measurement-based quantum computation, its application in quantum cryptography has remained largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce a novel protocol for generating three user conference keys using a CV dual-rail cluster state. We develop the concept of a quotient graph state by applying a node coloring scheme to the infinite dual-rail graph, resulting in a six-mode pure graph state suitable for cryptographic applications. Our results demonstrate that the proposed protocol achieves performance close to that of GHZ-based protocols for quantum conference key agreement (QCKA), with GHZ states performing slightly better. However, a key advantage of our protocol lies in its ability to generate bipartite keys post-QCKA, a feature not achievable with GHZ states. Additionally, compared to a downstream access network using two-mode squeezed vacuum states, our protocol achieves superior performance in generating bipartite keys. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to the finite-size regime and consider the impact of using impure squeezed states for generating the multipartite entangled states, reflecting experimental imperfections. Our findings indicate that even with finite resources and non-ideal state preparation, the proposed protocol maintains its advantages. We also introduce a more accurate method to estimate the capacity of a protocol to generate bipartite keys in a quantum network.</p>

            <p>Discrete-step walks describe the dynamics of particles in a lattice subject to hopping or splitting events at discrete times. Despite being of primordial interest to the physics of quantum walks, the topological properties arising from their discrete-step nature have been hardly explored. Here we report the observation of topological phases unique to discrete-step walks. We use light pulses in a double-fibre ring setup whose dynamics maps into a two-dimensional lattice subject to discrete splitting events. We show that the number of edge states is not simply described by the bulk invariants of the lattice (i.e., the Chern number and the Floquet winding number) as would be the case in static lattices and in lattices subject to smooth modulations. The number of edge states is also determined by a topological invariant associated to the discrete-step unitary operators acting at the edges of the lattice. This situation goes beyond the usual bulk-edge correspondence and allows manipulating the number of edge states without the need to go through a gap closing transition. Our work opens new perspectives for the engineering of topological modes for particles subject to quantum walks.</p>

            <h2>A simple yet accurate stochastic approach to the quantum phase noise of nanolasers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matias Bundgaard-Nielsen, Marco Saldutti, Benjamin Falkenberg Gøtzsche, Emil Grovn, Jesper Mørk</p>
            <p>Nanolasers operating at low power levels are strongly affected by intrinsic quantum noise, affecting both intensity fluctuations and laser coherence. Starting from semi-classical rate equations and making a simple hypothesis for the phase of the laser field, a simple stochastic model for the laser quantum noise is suggested. The model is shown to agree quantitatively with quantum master equations for microscopic lasers with a small number of emitters and with classical Langevin equations for macroscopic systems. In contrast, neither quantum master equations nor classical Langevin equations adequately address the mesoscopic regime. The stochastic approach is used to calculate the linewidth throughout the transition to lasing, where the linewidth changes from being dominated by the particle-like nature of photons below threshold to the wave-like nature above threshold, where it is strongly influenced by index fluctuations enhancing the linewidth.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jaromír Fiurášek</p>
            <p>The stellar hierarchy of quantum states of light classifies the states according to the Fock-state resources that are required for their generation together with unitary Gaussian operations. States with stellar rank n can be also equivalently referred to as genuinely n-photon quantum non-Gaussian states. Here we present an efficient method for construction of general witnesses of the stellar rank. The number of parameters that need to be optimized in order to determine the witness does not depend on the stellar rank and it scales quadratically with the number of modes. We illustrate the procedure by constructing stellar rank witnesses based on pairs of Fock state probabilities and also based on pairs of fidelities with superpositions of coherent states.</p>

            <p>A remarkable characteristic of quantum computing is the potential for reliable computation despite faulty qubits. This can be achieved through quantum error correction, which is typically implemented by repeatedly applying static syndrome checks, permitting correction of logical information. Recently, the development of time-dynamic approaches to error correction has uncovered new codes and new code implementations. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate three time-dynamic implementations of the surface code, each offering a unique solution to hardware design challenges and introducing flexibility in surface code realization. First, we embed the surface code on a hexagonal lattice, reducing the necessary couplings per qubit from four to three. Second, we walk a surface code, swapping the role of data and measure qubits each round, achieving error correction with built-in removal of accumulated non-computational errors. Finally, we realize the surface code using iSWAP gates instead of the traditional CNOT, extending the set of viable gates for error correction without additional overhead. We measure the error suppression factor when scaling from distance-3 to distance-5 codes of $\Lambda_{35,\text{hex}} = 2.15(2)$, $\Lambda_{35,\text{walk}} = 1.69(6)$, and $\Lambda_{35,\text{iSWAP}} = 1.56(2)$, achieving state-of-the-art error suppression for each. With detailed error budgeting, we explore their performance trade-offs and implications for hardware design. This work demonstrates that dynamic circuit approaches satisfy the demands for fault-tolerance and opens new alternative avenues for scalable hardware design.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dimitris Koutromanos, Dionisis Stefanatos, Emmanuel Paspalakis</p>
            <p>Machine learning has been revolutionizing our world over the last few years and is also increasingly exploited in several areas of physics, including quantum dynamics and this http URL need for a framework that brings together machine learning models and quantum simulation methods has been quite high within the quantum control field, with the ultimate goal of exploiting these powerful computational methods for the efficient implementation of modern quantum technologies. The existing frameworks for quantum system simulations, such as QuTip and this http URL, even though they are very successful in simulating quantum dynamics, cannot be easily incorporated into the platforms used for the development of machine learning models, like for example PyTorch. The TorchQC framework introduced in the present work comes exactly to fill this gap. It is a new library written entirely in Python and based on the PyTorch deep learning library. PyTorch and other deep learning frameworks are based on tensors, a structure that is also used in quantum mechanics. This is the common ground that TorchQC utilizes to combine quantum physics simulations and deep learning this http URL exploits PyTorch and its tensor mechanism to represent quantum states and operators as tensors, while it also incorporates all the tools needed to simulate quantum system dynamics. All necessary operations are internal in the PyTorch library, thus TorchQC programs can be executed in GPUs, substantially reducing the simulation time. We believe that the proposed TorchQC library has the potential to accelerate the development of deep learning models directly incorporating quantum simulations, enabling the easier integration of these powerful techniques in modern quantum technologies.</p>

The AI model calculates the holograms for real-time atom rearrangement. With precise controls over both position and phase, a high-speed spatial light modulator moves all the atoms simultaneously.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> He Zhang, Tong Liu, Zhongcheng Xiang, Kai Xu, Heng Fan, Dongning Zheng</p>
            <p>Non-Hermitian systems exhibit a variety of unique features rooted in the presence of exceptional points (EP). The distinct topological structure in the proximity of an EP gives rise to counterintuitive behaviors absent in Hermitian systems, which emerge after encircling the EP either quasistatically or dynamically. However, experimental exploration of EP encirclement in quantum systems, particularly those involving high-order EPs, remains challenging due to the difficulty of coherently controlling more degrees of freedom. In this work, we experimentally investigate the eigenvalues braiding and state transfer arising from the encirclement of EP in a three-dimensional non-Hermitian quantum system using superconducting circuits. We characterize the second- and third-order EPs through the coalescence of eigenvalues. Then we reveal the topological structure near the EP3 by quasistatically encircling it along various paths with three independent parameters, which yields the eigenvalues braiding described by the braid group $B_3$. Additionally, we observe chiral state transfer between three eigenstates under a fast driving scheme when no EPs are enclosed, while time-symmetric behavior occurs when at least one EP is encircled. Our findings offer insights into understanding non-Hermitian topological structures and the manipulation of quantum states through dynamic operations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haoyuan Luo, Sahand Mahmoodian</p>
            <p>Optical Schrödinger cat states are non-Gaussian states with applications in quantum technologies, such as for building error-correcting states in quantum computing. Yet the efficient generation of high-fidelity optical Schrödinger cat states is an outstanding problem in quantum optics. Here, we propose using squeezed superpositions of zero and two photons, $|\theta\rangle = \cos{(\theta/2)}|0\rangle + \sin{(\theta/2)}|2\rangle$, as ingredients for protocols to efficiently generate high-fidelity cat states. We present a protocol using linear optics with success probability $P\gtrsim 50\%$ that can generate cat states of size $|\alpha|^2=5$ with fidelity $F>0.99$. The protocol relies only on detecting single photons and is remarkably tolerant of loss, with $2\%$ detection loss still achieving $F>0.98$ for cats with $|\alpha|^2=5$. We also show that squeezed $\theta$ states are ideal candidates for nonlinear photon subtraction using a two-level system with near deterministic success probability and fidelity $F>0.98$ for cat states of size $|\alpha|^2=5$. Schemes for generating $\theta$ states using quantum emitters are also presented. Our protocols can be implemented with current state-of-the-art quantum optics experiments.</p>

Our method is capable of unveiling the effect of relative bandwidth as well as squeezing required to observe the anticipated anti-crossing spectrum and enhanced cooperativity without the ideal squeezed bath assumption. Furthermore, we analyze the practicality of said models when including intrinsic photon loss due to resonators imperfection. With these results, we outline the requirements for experimentally implementing an effectively squeezed bath in solid-state platforms such as InAs quantum dot cavity QED such that \textit{in situ} control and enhancement of light-matter interaction could be realized.</p>

            <p>Realizing universal fault-tolerant quantum computation is a key goal in quantum information science. By encoding quantum information into logical qubits utilizing quantum error correcting codes, physical errors can be detected and corrected, enabling substantial reduction in logical error rates. However, the set of logical operations that can be easily implemented on such encoded qubits is often constrained, necessitating the use of special resource states known as 'magic states' to implement universal, classically hard circuits. A key method to prepare high-fidelity magic states is to perform 'distillation', creating them from multiple lower fidelity inputs. Here we present the experimental realization of magic state distillation with logical qubits on a neutral-atom quantum computer. Our approach makes use of a dynamically reconfigurable architecture to encode and perform quantum operations on many logical qubits in parallel. We demonstrate the distillation of magic states encoded in d=3 and d=5 color codes, observing improvements of the logical fidelity of the output magic states compared to the input logical magic states. These experiments demonstrate a key building block of universal fault-tolerant quantum computation, and represent an important step towards large-scale logical quantum processors.</p>

            <p>We show that universal quantum computation can be made fault-tolerant in a scenario where the error-correction is implemented without mid-circuit measurements. To this end, we introduce a measurement-free deformation protocol of the Bacon-Shor code to realize a logical $\mathit{CCZ}$ gate, enabling a universal set of fault-tolerant operations. Independently, we demonstrate that certain stabilizer codes can be concatenated in a measurement-free way without having to rely on a universal logical gate set. This is achieved by means of the disposable Toffoli gadget, which realizes the feedback operation in a resource-efficient way. For the purpose of benchmarking the proposed protocols with circuit-level noise, we implement an efficient method to simulate non-Clifford circuits consisting of few Hadamard gates. In particular, our findings support that below-breakeven logical performance is achievable with a circuit-level error rate below $10^{-3}$. Altogether, the deformation protocol and the Toffoli gadget provide a blueprint for a fully fault-tolerant architecture without any feed-forward operation, which is particularly suited for state-of-the-art neutral-atom platforms.</p>

            <p>Quantum Frequency Conversion (QFC) is a widely used technique to interface atomic systems with the telecom band in order to facilitate propagation over longer distances in fiber. Here we demonstrate the difference-frequency conversion from 606 nm to 1552 nm of microsecond-long weak coherent pulses at the single photon level compatible with Pr$^{3+}$:Y$_2$SiO$_5\,$ quantum memories, with high-signal to noise ratio. We use a single step difference frequency generation process with a continuous-wave pump at 994 nm in a MgO:ppLN-waveguide and ultra-narrow spectral filtering down to a bandwidth of 12.5 MHz. With this setup, we achieve the conversion of weak coherent pulses of duration up to 13.6 $\mu s$ with a device efficiency of about 25% and a signal-to-noise ratio >460 for 10 $\mu s$-long pulses containing one photon on average. This signal-to-noise ratio is large enough to enable a high-fidelity conversion of qubits emitted from an emissive quantum memory based on Pr$^{3+}$:Y$_2$SiO$_5\,$ and to realize an interface with quantum processing nodes based on narrow-linewidth cavity-enhanced trapped ions.</p>

            <p>With the development of any quantum technology comes a need for precise control of quantum systems. Here, we evaluate the impact of control noise on a quantum Otto cycle. Whilst it is postulated that noiseless quantum engines can approach maximal Otto efficiency in finite times, the existence of white noise on the controls is shown to negatively affect average engine performance. Two methods of quantum enhancement, counterdiabatic driving and quantum lubrication, are implemented and found to improve the performance of the noisy cycle only in specified parameter regimes. To gain insight into performance fluctuations, projective energy measurements are used to construct a noise-averaged probability distribution without assuming full thermalisation or adiabaticity. From this, the variances in thermodynamic currents are observed to increase as average power and efficiency improve, and are also shown to be consistent with known bounds from thermodynamic uncertainty relations. Lastly, by comparing the average functioning of the unmonitored engine to a projectively-measured engine cycle, the role of coherence in work extraction for this quantum engine model is investigated.</p>

            <p>Deeply inelastic scattering (DIS) is an essential process for exploring the structure of visible matter and testing the standard model. At the same time, the theoretical interpretation of DIS measurements depends on QCD factorization theorems whose validity deteriorates at the lower values of $Q^2$ and $W^2$ typical of neutrino DIS in accelerator-based oscillation searches. For this reason, progress in understanding the origin and limits of QCD factorization is invaluable to the accuracy and precision of predictions for these upcoming neutrino experiments. In these short proceedings, we introduce a novel approach based on the quantum entropy associated with continuous distributions in QCD, using it to characterize the limits of factorization theorems relevant for the description of neutrino DIS. This work suggests an additional avenue for dissecting factorization-breaking dynamics through the quantum entropy, which could also play a role in quantum simulations of related systems.</p>

Real-world implementations, however, deviate from the idealized all-to-all connectivity, raising questions about the robustness of its chaotic properties. In this work, we investigate a quadratic SYK model with distance-dependent interactions governed by a power-law decay. By analytically and numerically studying the spectral form factor (SFF), we uncover how the single particle transitions manifest in the many-body system. While the SFF demonstrates robustness under slightly reduced interaction ranges, further suppression leads to a breakdown of perturbation theory and new spectral regimes, marked by a higher dip and the emergence of a secondary plateau. Our results highlight the interplay between single-particle criticality and many-body dynamics, offering new insights into the quantum chaos-to-localization transition and its reflection in spectral statistics.</p>

            <p>Atom interferometers offer exceptional sensitivity to ultra-light dark matter (ULDM) through their precise measurement of phenomena acting on atoms. While previous work has established their capability to detect scalar and vector ULDM, their potential for detecting spin-2 ULDM remains unexplored. This work investigates the sensitivity of atom interferometers to spin-2 ULDM by considering several frameworks for massive gravity: a Lorentz-invariant Fierz-Pauli case and two Lorentz-violating scenarios. We find that coherent oscillations of the spin-2 ULDM field induce a measurable phase shift through three distinct channels: coupling of the scalar mode to atomic energy levels, and vector and tensor effects that modify the propagation of atoms and light. Atom interferometers uniquely probe all of these effects, while providing sensitivity to a different mass range from laser interferometers. Our results demonstrate the potential of atom interferometers to advance the search for spin-2 dark matter through accessing unexplored parameter space and uncovering new interactions between ULDM and atoms.</p>

            <p>The density-density response in optimally doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ has recently been shown to exhibit conformal symmetry. Using, the experimentally inferred conformal dynamic susceptibility, we compute the resultant quantum Fisher information (QFI), a witness to multi-partite entanglement. In contrast to a Fermi liquid in which the QFI is approximately temperature independent much below the Fermi energy scale, we find that the QFI increases as a power law at low temperatures but ultimately extrapolates to a constant at $T=0$. The constant is of the form, $\omega_g^{2\Delta}$, where $\Delta$ is the conformal dimension and $\omega_g$ is the UV cutoff which is on the order of the pseudogap. As this constant {depends on both UV and IR properties}, it illustrates that multipartite entanglement in a strange metal exhibits UV-IR mixing, a benchmark feature of doped Mott insulators as exemplified by dynamical spectral weight transfer. We conclude with a discussion of the implication of our results for low-energy reductions of the Hubbard model.</p>

The mechanical modes of both spheres are close in frequency and are coherently coupled by the straightway physical contact between the two microspheres. We use a perturbation approach to solve the Heisenberg-Langevin equations, offering an analytical framework for transmission rate and SSG. Using experimentally feasible settings, we demonstrate that the transmission rate and SSG are strongly dependent on the magnomechanical, optomechanical, and mechanics mechanics coupling strengths (MMCS) between the two microspheres. The numerical results show that increasing the MMCS can enhance both the transmission rate and SSG efficiency, resulting in gain within our system. Our findings, in particular, reveal that the efficiency of the SSG can be effectively controlled by cavity detuning, decay rate, and pump power. Notably, our findings suggest that modifying the system parameters can alter the group delay, thereby regulating the transition between fast and slow light propagation, and vice versa. Our protocol provides guidelines for manipulating nonlinear optical properties and controlling light propagation, with applications including optical switching, information storage, and precise measurement of weak signals.</p>

            <h2>Persistent current in a non-Hermitian Hatano-Nelson ring: Disorder-induced amplification</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sudin Ganguly, S. K. Maiti</p>
            <p>Non-reciprocal hopping induces a synthetic magnetic flux which leads to the non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm effect. Since non-Hermitian Hamiltonians possess both real and imaginary eigenvalues, this effect allows the observation of real and imaginary persistent currents in a ring threaded by the synthetic flux~\cite{nrh8}. Motivated by this, we investigate the behavior of persistent currents in a disordered Hatano-Nelson ring with anti-Hermitian intradimer hopping. The disorder is diagonal and we explore three distinct models, namely the Aubry-André-Harper model, the Fibonacci model, both representing correlated disorder, and an uncorrelated (random) model. We conduct a detailed analysis of the energy spectrum and examine the real and imaginary parts of the persistent current under various conditions such as different ring sizes and filling factors. Interestingly, we find that real and imaginary persistent currents exhibit amplification in the presence of correlated disorder. This amplification is also observed in certain individual random configurations but vanishes after configuration averaging. Additionally, we observe both diamagnetic and paramagnetic responses in the current behavior and investigate aspects of persistent currents in the absence of disorder that have not been previously explored. Interestingly, we find that the intradimer bonds host only imaginary currents, while the interdimer bonds carry only real currents.</p>

            <h2>Quantum chaos, localization and phase transitions in random graphs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ioannis Kleftogiannis, Ilias Amanatidis</p>
            <p>The energy level statistics of uniform random graphs are studied, by treating the graphs as random tight-binding lattices. The inherent random geometry of the graphs and their dynamical spatial dimensionality, leads to various quantum chaotic and localized phases and transitions between them. Essentially the random geometry acts as disorder, whose strength is characterized by the ratio of edges over vertices R in the graphs. For dense graphs, with large ratio R, the spacing between successive energy levels follows the Wigner-Dyson distribution, leading to a quantum chaotic behavior and a metallic phase, characterized by level repulsion. For ratios near R=0.5, where a large dominating component in the graph appears, the level spacing follows the Poisson distribution with level crossings and a localized phase for the respective wavefunctions lying on the graph. For intermediate ratios R we observe a phase transition between the quantum chaotic and localized phases characterized by a semi-Poisson distribution. The values R of the critical regime where the phase transition occurs depend on the energy of the system. Our analysis shows that physical systems with random geometry, for example ones with a fluctuating/dynamical spatial dimension, contain novel universal phase transition properties, similar to those occuring in more traditional phase transitions based on symmetry breaking mechanisms, whose universal properties are strongly determined by the dimensionality of the system.</p>

            <p>Neutral resonant states of molecules play a very important role in the dissociation dynamics and other electronic processes that occur via intermediate capture into these states. With the goal of identifying resonant states, and their corresponding widths, of the imidogen molecule NH as a function of internuclear distance, we have performed detailed R-matrix calculations on the e + NH+ system. In a previous work, we had identified bound states of NH and Feshbach resonances in the e + NH+ system at a single geometry, namely the NH+ equilibrium Re = 2.0205 a0 . Here we present a much more detailed work by repeating the calculation on over 60 internuclear distances to obtain the corresponding potential energy curves. The bound states for nine symmetries have been detailed many of which, particularly the singlet states, were never studied before. Several resonant states of different symmetries, which were unknown until now, have been systematically identified and their widths calculated in the present work, which proved much more challenging due to presence of many avoided crossings. It is hoped that the bound and the new resonant states obtained here will open up other molecular dynamics studies, since for several dissociative processes, although experimental data existed for more than a decade, these are still uncorroborated due to absence of molecular data, and hence subsequent theoretical calculations.</p>

            <p>We present a new approach to investigating Rydberg molecules by demonstrating the formation and characterization of individual Rb$^{*}$Cs Rydberg molecules using optical tweezers. By employing single-atom detection of Rb and Cs, we observe molecule formation via correlated loss of both species and study the formation dynamics with single-particle resolution. We control the interatomic distances by manipulating the relative wavefunction of atom pairs using the tweezer intensity, optimizing the coupling to molecular states and exploring the effect of the tweezer on these states. Additionally, we demonstrate molecule association with atoms trapped in separate tweezers, paving the way for state-selective assembly of polyatomic molecules. The observed binding energies, molecular alignment, and bond lengths are in good agreement with theory. Our approach is broadly applicable to Rydberg tweezer platforms, expanding the range of available molecular systems and enabling the integration of Rydberg molecules into existing quantum science platforms.</p>

Starting from a double-holographic model of eternal two-sided asymptotically AdS$_d$ ($d>2$) black hole each coupled to a flat $d$-dimensional bath, we show that the entanglement dynamics in the late-time, large-subregion limit is described by entanglement membrane, thereby establishing a quantitative equivalence between a semi-classical gravity and a chaotic quantum many-body system calculation of the Page curve.</p>

            <p>A core challenge for superconducting quantum computers is to scale up the number of qubits in each processor without increasing noise or cross-talk. Distributed quantum computing across small qubit arrays, known as chiplets, can address these challenges in a scalable manner. We propose a chiplet architecture over microwave links with potential to exceed monolithic performance on near-term hardware. Our methods of modeling and evaluating the chiplet architecture bridge the physical and network layers in these processors. We find evidence that distributing computation across chiplets may reduce the overall error rates associated with moving data across the device, despite higher error figures for transfers across links. Preliminary analyses suggest that latency is not substantially impacted, and that at least some applications and architectures may avoid bottlenecks around chiplet boundaries. In the long-term, short-range networks may underlie quantum computers just as local area networks underlie classical datacenters and supercomputers today.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sam Powers, Guangpeng Xu, Herbert Fotso, Tim Thomay, Dejan Stojkovic</p>
            <p>The most irreducible way to represent information is a sequence of two symbols. In this paper, we construct quantum states using this basic building block. Specifically, we show that the probabilities that arise in quantum theory can be reduced to counting more fundamental ontic states, which we interpret as event networks and model using sequences of 0's and 1's. A completely self contained formalism is developed for the purpose of organizing and counting these ontic states, which employs the finite cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}_2 = \{0, 1\}$, basic set theory, and combinatorics. This formalism is then used to calculate probability distributions associated with particles of arbitrary spin interacting with sequences of two rotated Stern-Gerlach detectors. These calculations are compared with the predictions of non-relativistic quantum mechanics and shown to deviate slightly. This deviation can be made arbitrarily small and does not lead to violations of relevant no-go theorems, such as Bell's inequalities, the Kochen-Specker theorem, or the PBR theorem. The proposed model is then extended to an optical system involving photon number states passing through a beam splitter. Leveraging recent advancements in high precision experiments on these systems, we then propose a means of testing the new model using a tabletop experiment.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessio Paviglianiti, Xhek Turkeshi, Marco Schirò, Alessandro Silva</p>
            <p>Understanding the influence of measurements on the properties of many-body systems is a fundamental problem in quantum mechanics and for quantum technologies. This paper explores how a finite density of stochastic local measurement modifies a given state's entanglement structure. Considering various measurement protocols, we explore the typical quantum correlations of their associated projected ensembles arising from the ground state of the quantum Ising model. Using large-scale numerical simulations, we demonstrate substantial differences among inequivalent measurement protocols. Surprisingly, we observe that forced on-site measurements can enhance both bipartite and multipartite entanglement. We present a phenomenological toy model and perturbative calculations to analytically support these results. Furthermore, we extend these considerations to the non-Hermitian Ising model, naturally arising in optically monitored systems, and we show that its qualitative entanglement features are not altered by a finite density of projective measurements. Overall, these results reveal a complex phenomenology where local quantum measurements do not simply disentangle degrees of freedom, but may actually strengthen the entanglement in the system.</p>

            <p>Quantum networks (QNs) exhibit stronger connectivity than predicted by classical percolation, yet the origin of this phenomenon remains unexplored. Here, we apply a statistical physics model -- concurrence percolation -- to uncover the origin of stronger connectivity on hierarchical scale-free networks, the ($U,V$) flowers. These networks allow full analytical control over path connectivity through two adjustable path-length parameters, $U \leq V$. This precise control enables us to determine critical exponents well beyond current simulation limits, revealing that classical and concurrence percolations, while both satisfying the hyperscaling relation, fall into distinct universality classes. This distinction arises from how they "superpose" parallel, non-shortest path contributions into overall connectivity. Concurrence percolation, unlike its classical counterpart, is sensitive to non-shortest paths and shows higher resilience to detours as these paths lengthen. This enhanced resilience is also observed in real-world hierarchical, scale-free Internet networks. Our findings highlight a crucial principle for QN design: when non-shortest paths are abundant, they notably enhance QN connectivity beyond what is achievable with classical percolation.</p>

One of the main problems of variational methods lies in the phenomenon of Barren Plateaus, present in the optimization of variational parameters. Adding geometric inductive bias to the quantum models has been proposed as a potential solution to mitigate this problem, leading to a new field called Geometric Quantum Machine Learning. In this work, an equivariant architecture for variational quantum classifiers is introduced to create a label-invariant model for image classification with $C_4$ rotational label symmetry. The equivariant circuit is benchmarked against two different architectures, and it is experimentally observed that the geometric approach boosts the model's performance. Finally, a classical equivariant convolution operation is proposed to extend the quantum model for the processing of larger images, employing the resources available in NISQ devices.</p>

In this work, we extend this concept to the complex regime for a periodic non-Hermitian system under a linear potential.

The system can also support standard two-particle Bloch oscillations under certain conditions. We propose two types of dimerized non-Hermitian systems to demonstrate our results. In addition, we also propose a scheme to demonstrate the results of electron-pair dynamics in a single-particle 2D $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric square lattice.</p>

            <p>A (target) quantum system is often measured through observations performed on a second (meter) system to which the target is coupled. In the presence of global conservation laws holding on the joint meter-target system, the Wigner-Araki-Yanase theorem and its generalizations predict a lower-bound on the measurement's error (Ozawa's bound). While practically negligible for macroscopic meters, it becomes relevant for microscopic ones. Here, we propose a simple interferometric setup, arguably within reach of present technology, in which a flying particle (a microscopic quantum meter) is used to measure a qubit by interacting with it in one arm of the interferometer. In this scenario, the globally conserved quantity is the total energy of particle and qubit. We show how the measurement error, $\varepsilon$, is linked to the non-stationary nature of the measured observable and the finite duration of the target-meter interaction while Ozawa's bound, $\varepsilon_{\mathrm B}$, only depends on the momentum uncertainty of the meter's wavepacket. When considering short wavepackets with respect to the evolution time of the qubit, we show that $\varepsilon/\varepsilon_{\mathrm B}$ is strictly tied to the position-momentum uncertainty of the meter's wavepacket and $\varepsilon/\varepsilon_{\mathrm B} \rightarrow 1$ only when employing Gaussian wavepackets. On the contrary, long wavepackets of any shape lead to $\varepsilon/\varepsilon_{\mathrm B} \rightarrow \sqrt{2}$. In addition to their fundamental relevance, our findings have important practical consequences for optimal resource management in quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) enables secret key exchange between two remote parties with information-theoretic security rooted in the laws of quantum physics. Encoding key information in continuous variables (CV), such as the values of quadrature components of coherent states of light, brings implementations much closer to standard optical communication systems, but this comes at the price of significant complexity in the digital signal processing techniques required for operation at low signal-to-noise ratios. In this work, we wish to lower the barriers to entry for CV-QKD experiments associated to this difficulty by providing a highly modular, open source software that is in principle hardware agnostic and can be used in multiple configurations. We benchmarked this software, called QOSST, using an experimental setup with a locally generated local oscillator, frequency multiplexed pilots and RF-heterodyne detection, and obtained state-of-the-art secret key rates of the order of Mbit/s over metropolitan distances at the asymptotic limit. We hope that QOSST can be used to stimulate further experimental advances in CV-QKD and be improved and extended by the community to achieve high performance in a wide variety of configurations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Edward J. Gillis</p>
            <p>The changes that quantum states undergo during measurement are both probabilistic and nonlocal. These two characteristics complement one another to insure compatibility with relativity and maintain conservation laws. Nonlocal entanglement relations provide a means to enforce conservation laws in a probabilistic theory, while the probabilistic nature of nonlocal effects prevents the superluminal transmission of information. In order to explain these measurement-induced changes in terms of fundamental physical processes it is necessary to take these two key characteristics into account. One way to do this is to modify the Schroedinger equation by adding stochastic, nonlinear terms. A number of such proposals have been made over the past few decades. A recently proposed equation based on the assumption that wave function collapse is induced by a sequence of correlating interactions of the kind that constitute measurements has been shown to maintain strict adherence to conservation laws in individual instances, and has also eliminated the need to introduce any new, ad hoc physical constants. In this work it is shown that this modified Schroedinger equation is naturally Lorentz invariant. It is further argued that the additional spacetime structure that it requires provides a way to implement the assumption that spacelike-separated operators (and measurements) commute, and that this assumption of local commutativity should be regarded as a third postulate of relativity.</p>

            <h2>On the applicability of Kolmogorov's theory of probability to the description of quantum phenomena. Part I: Foundations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maik Reddiger</p>
            <p>It is a common view that von Neumann laid the foundations of a "quantum probability theory" with his axiomatization of quantum mechanics (QM). As such, it is regarded a generalization of the "classical probability theory" due to Kolmogorov. Outside of quantum physics, however, Kolmogorov's axioms enjoy universal applicability. This raises the question of whether quantum physics indeed requires such a generalization of our conception of probability or if von Neumann's axiomatization of QM was contingent on the absence of a general theory of probability in the 1920s. In this work I argue in favor of the latter position. In particular, I show that for non-relativistic $N$-body quantum systems subject to a time-independent scalar potential, it is possible to construct a mathematically rigorous theory based on Kolmogorov's axioms and physically natural random variables, which reproduces central predictions of QM. The respective theories are distinct, so that an empirical comparison may be possible. Moreover, the approach can in principle be adapted to other classes of quantum-mechanical models. Part II of this series discusses the empirical violation of Bell inequalities in the context of this approach. Part III addresses the projection postulate and the question of measurement.</p>

            <p>Potential wells are employed to constrain quantum particles into forming discrete energy levels, acting as artificial few-level systems. In contrast, an anti-parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetric system can have a single pair of real energy levels, while all the remaining levels are unstable due to the negative imaginary part of the energy. In this work, we investigate the formation of bound states in a tight-binding chain induced by a harmonic imaginary potential. Exact solutions show that the real parts of energy levels are equidistant, while the imaginary parts are semi-negative definite and equidistant. This allows for the formation of an effective two-level system. For a given initial state with a wide range of profiles, the evolved state always converges to a superposition of two stable eigenstates. In addition, these two states are orthogonal under the Dirac inner product and can be mutually switched by applying a $\pi$ pulse of a linear field. Our finding provides an alternative method for fabricating quantum devices through dissipation.</p>

While numerous protocols exist, most rely on assumptions unrealistic for physical continuous variable states, such as infinite precision in quadrature measurement or the use of states requiring infinite squeezing. In this work, we adapt existing protocols to deal with these unavoidable considerations, and use them to certify their application for different quantum information tasks. More specifically, we show how CV graph states can be efficiently verified and certified even in a noisy and imperfect setting. We then discuss how our findings impact the usability of states obtained after the protocol for different applications, including quantum teleportation, computing, and sensing.</p>

            <p>Multipartite entanglement, linking multiple nodes simultaneously, is a higher-order correlation that offers advantages over pairwise connections in quantum networks (QNs). Creating reliable, large-scale multipartite entanglement requires entanglement routing, a process that combines local, short-distance connections into a long-distance connection, which can be considered as a transformation of network topology. Here, we address the question of whether a QN can be topologically transformed into another via entanglement routing. Our key result is an exact mapping from multipartite entanglement routing to Nash-Williams's graph immersion problem, extended to hypergraphs. This generalized hypergraph immersion problem introduces a partial order between QN topologies, permitting certain topological transformations while precluding others, offering discerning insights into the design and manipulation of higher-order network topologies in QNs.</p>

            <p>Quantum machine learning (QML) requires significant quantum resources to address practical real-world problems. When the underlying quantum information exhibits hierarchical structures in the data, limitations persist in training complexity and generalization. Research should prioritize both the efficient design of quantum architectures and the development of learning strategies to optimize resource usage. We propose a framework called quantum curriculum learning (Q-CurL) for quantum data, where the curriculum introduces simpler tasks or data to the learning model before progressing to more challenging ones. Q-CurL exhibits robustness to noise and data limitations, which is particularly relevant for current and near-term noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. We achieve this through a curriculum design based on quantum data density ratios and a dynamic learning schedule that prioritizes the most informative quantum data. Empirical evidence shows that Q-CurL significantly enhances training convergence and generalization for unitary learning and improves the robustness of quantum phase recognition tasks. Q-CurL is effective with broad physical learning applications in condensed matter physics and quantum chemistry.</p>

            <p>Quantum data centres (QDCs) could overcome the scalability challenges of modern quantum computers. Single-processor monolithic quantum computers are affected by increased cross talk and difficulty of implementing gates when the number of qubits is increased. In a QDC, multiple quantum processing units (QPUs) are linked together over short distances, allowing the total number of computational qubits to be increased without increasing the number of qubits on any one processor. In doing so, the error incurred by operations at each QPU can be kept small, however additional noise will be added to the system due to the latency cost and errors incurred during inter-QPU entanglement distribution. We investigate the relative impact of these different types of noise using a classically simulated QDC with two QPUs and compare the robustness to noise of the two main ways of implementing remote gates, cat-comm and TP-comm. We find that considering the quantity of gates or inter-QPU entangled links is often inadequate to predict the output fidelity from a quantum circuit and infer that an improved understanding of error propagation during distributed quantum circuits may represent a significant optimisation opportunity for compilation.</p>

            <p>The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a prominent quantum algorithm designed to find approximate solutions to combinatorial optimization problems, which are challenging for classical computers. In the current era, where quantum hardware is constrained by noise and limited qubit availability, simulating the QAOA remains essential for research. However, existing state-of-the-art simulation frameworks suffer from long execution times or lack comprehensive functionality, usability, and versatility, often requiring users to implement essential features themselves. Additionally, these frameworks are primarily restricted to Python, limiting their use in safer and faster languages like Rust, which offer, e.g., advanced parallelization capabilities. In this paper, we develop a GPU accelerated QAOA simulation framework utilizing the NVIDIA CUDA toolkit. This framework offers a complete interface for QAOA simulations, enabling the calculation of (exact) expectation values, direct access to the statevector, fast sampling, and high-performance optimization methods using an advanced state-of-the-art gradient calculation technique. The framework is designed for use in Python and Rust, providing flexibility for integration into a wide range of applications, including those requiring fast algorithm implementations leveraging QAOA at its core. The new framework's performance is rigorously benchmarked on the MaxCut problem and compared against the current state-of-the-art general-purpose quantum circuit simulation frameworks Qiskit and Pennylane as well as the specialized QAOA simulation tool QOKit. Our evaluation shows that our approach outperforms the existing state-of-the-art solutions in terms of runtime up to multiple orders of magnitude.

            <h2>Characterizing the Multipartite Entanglement Structure of Non-Gaussian Continuous-Variable States with a Single Evolution Operator</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mingsheng Tian, Xiaoting Gao, Boxuan Jing, Feng-Xiao Sun, Matteo Fadel, Manuel Gessner, Qiongyi He</p>
            <p>Multipartite entanglement is an essential resource for quantum information tasks, but characterizing entanglement structures in continuous variable systems remains challenging, especially in multimode non-Gaussian scenarios. In this work, we introduce an efficient method for detecting multipartite entanglement structures in continuous-variable states. Based on the quantum Fisher information, we propose a systematic approach to identify an optimal encoding operator that can capture the quantum correlations in multimode non-Gaussian states. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on over $10^5$ randomly generated multimode-entangled quantum states, achieving a very high success rate in entanglement detection. Additionally, the robustness of our method can be considerably enhanced against losses by expanding the set of accessible operators. This work provides a general framework for characterizing entanglement structures in diverse continuous variable systems, enabling a number of experimentally relevant applications.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Calculus of Fibonacci Divisors and Fermion-Boson Entanglement for Infinite Hierarchy of N = 2 Supersymmetric Golden Oscillators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oktay K. Pashaev</p>
            <p>The quantum calculus with two bases, as powers of the Golden and the Silver ratio, relates Fibonacci divisor derivative with Binet formula of Fibonacci divisor number operator, acting in Fock space of quantum this http URL provides a tool to study the hierarchy of Golden oscillators with energy spectrum in form of Fibonacci divisor numbers. We generalize this model to supersymmetric number operator and corresponding Binet formula for supersymmetric Fibonacci divisor number operator. The operator determines the Hamiltonian of hierarchy of supersymmetric Golden oscillators, acting in fermion-boson Hilbert space and belonging to N=2 supersymmetric algebra. The eigenstates of the super Fibonacci divisor number operator are double degenerate and can be characterized by a point on the super-Bloch sphere. By the supersymmetric Fibonacci divisor annihilation operator, we construct the hierarchy of supersymmetric coherent states as eigenstates of this operator. Entanglement of fermions with bosons in these states is calculated by the concurrence, represented by the Gram determinant and hierarchy of Golden exponential functions. We show that the reference states and corresponding von Neumann entropy, measuring fermion-boson entanglement, are characterized completely by the powers of the Golden ratio. The simple geometrical classification of entangled states by the Frobenius ball and meaning of the concurrence as double area of parallelogram in Hilbert space are given.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anne Matthies, Nicolas Dannenfeld, Silvia Pappalardi, Achim Rosch</p>
            <p>We systematically investigate whether classical hydrodynamic field theories can predict the long-time dynamics of many-particle quantum systems. As an example, we investigate numerically and analytically the time evolution of a chain of spins (or qubits) subject to a stroboscopic dynamics. The time evolution is implemented by a sequence of local and nearest-neighbor gates which conserve the total magnetization. The long-time dynamics of such a system is believed to be describable by a hydrodynamics field theory, which, importantly, includes the effect of noise. Based on a field theoretical analysis and symmetry arguments, we map each operator in the spin model to corresponding fields in hydrodynamics. This allows us to predict which expectation values decay exponentially, and which of them decay with a hydrodynamics long-time tail. We illustrate these findings by studying the time evolution of all 255 Hermitian operators which can be defined on four neighboring sites. We show that all operators not protected by hydrodynamics decay exponentially and investigate a selected set of slowly decaying operators.</p>

            <h2>Quantum machine learning for multiclass classification beyond kernel methods</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chao Ding, Shi Wang, Yaonan Wang, Weibo Gao</p>
            <p>Quantum machine learning is considered one of the current research fields with immense potential. In recent years, Havlíček et al. [Nature 567, 209-212 (2019)] have proposed a quantum machine learning algorithm with quantum-enhanced feature spaces, which effectively addressed a binary classification problem on a superconducting processor and offered a potential pathway to achieving quantum advantage. However, a straightforward binary classification algorithm falls short in solving multiclass classification problems. In this paper, we propose a quantum algorithm that rigorously demonstrates that quantum kernel methods enhance the efficiency of multiclass classification in real-world applications, providing quantum advantage. To demonstrate quantum advantage, we design six distinct quantum kernels within the quantum algorithm to map input data into quantum state spaces and estimate the corresponding quantum kernel matrices. The results from quantum simulations reveal that the quantum algorithm outperforms its classical counterpart in handling six real-world multiclass classification problems. Furthermore, we leverage a variety of performance metrics to comprehensively evaluate the classification and generalization performance of the quantum algorithm. The results demonstrate that the quantum algorithm achieves superior classification and better generalization performance relative to classical counterparts.</p>

            <h2>Efficient Classical Computation of Single-Qubit Marginal Measurement Probabilities to Simulate Certain Classes of Quantum Algorithms</h2>

            <p>Classical simulations of quantum circuits are essential for verifying and benchmarking quantum algorithms, particularly for large circuits, where computational demands increase exponentially with the number of qubits. Among available methods, the classical simulation of quantum circuits inspired by density functional theory -- the so-called QC-DFT method, shows promise for large circuit simulations as it approximates the quantum circuits using single-qubit reduced density matrices to model multi-qubit systems. However, the QC-DFT method performs very poorly when dealing with multi-qubit gates. In this work, we introduce a novel CNOT "functional" that leverages neural networks to generate unitary transformations, effectively mitigating the simulation errors observed in the original QC-DFT method. For random circuit simulations, our modified QC-DFT enables efficient computation of single-qubit marginal measurement probabilities, or single-qubit probability (SQPs), and achieves lower SQP errors and higher fidelities than the original QC-DFT method. Despite some limitations in capturing full entanglement and joint probability distributions, we find potential applications of SQPs in simulating Shor's and Grover's algorithms for specific solution classes. These findings advance the capabilities of classical simulations for some quantum problems and provide insights into managing entanglement and gate errors in practical quantum computing.</p>

            <h2>Universal graph representation of stabilizer codes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrey Boris Khesin, Jonathan Z. Lu, Peter W. Shor</p>
            <p>We introduce a representation of $[[n, k]]$ stabilizer codes as semi-bipartite graphs wherein $k$ ``input'' nodes map to $n$ ``output'' nodes, such that output nodes may connect to each other but input nodes may not. We prove that this graph representation is in bijection with tableaus and give an efficient compilation algorithm that transforms tableaus into graphs. We then show that this map is efficiently invertible, which gives a new universal recipe for code construction by way of finding graphs with sufficiently nice properties. The graph representation gives insight into both code construction and algorithms. To the former, we argue that graphs provide a flexible platform for building codes particularly at smaller (non-asymptotic) scales. We construct as examples constant-size codes, e.g. a $[[54, 6, 5]]$ code and a family of roughly $[[n, \frac{n}{\log n}, \log n]]$ codes. We also leverage graphs in a probabilistic analysis to extend the quantum Gilbert-Varshamov bound into a three-way distance-rate-weight tradeoff. To the latter, we show that key coding algorithms -- distance approximation, weight reduction, and decoding -- are unified as instances of a single optimization game on a graph. Moreover, key code properties such as distance, weight, and encoding circuit depth, are all controlled by the graph degree. We give efficient algorithms for producing simple encoding circuits whose depths scale as twice the degree and for implementing logical diagonal and certain Clifford gates with non-constant but reduced depth. Finally, we construct a simple efficient decoding algorithm and prove a performance guarantee for a certain class of graphs, including the roughly $[[n, \frac{n}{\log n}, \log n]]$ code. These results give evidence that graphs are generically useful for the study of stabilizer codes and their practical implementations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tista Banerjee, Suchetan Das, K. Sengupta</p>
            <p>We study the dynamics of entanglement asymmetry in periodically driven quantum systems. Using a periodically driven XY chain as a model for a driven integrable quantum system, we provide semi-analytic results for the behavior of the dynamics of the entanglement asymmetry, $\Delta S$, as a function of the drive frequency. Our analysis identifies special drive frequencies at which the driven XY chain exhibits dynamic symmetry restoration and displays quantum Mpemba effect over a long timescale; we identify an emergent approximate symmetry in its Floquet Hamiltonian which plays a crucial role for realization of both these phenomena. We follow these results by numerical computation of $\Delta S$ for the non-integrable driven Rydberg atom chain and obtain similar emergent-symmetry-induced symmetry restoration and quantum Mpemba effect in the prethermal regime for such a system. Finally, we provide an exact analytic computation of the entanglement asymmetry for a periodically driven conformal field theory (CFT) on a strip. Such a driven CFT, depending on the drive amplitude and frequency, exhibits two distinct phases, heating and non-heating, that are separated by a critical line. Our results show that for $m$ cycles of a periodic drive with time period $T$, $\Delta S \sim \ln mT$ [$\ln (\ln mT)$] in the heating phase [on the critical line] for a generic CFT; in contrast, in the non-heating phase, $\Delta S$ displays small amplitude oscillations around it's initial value as a function of $mT$. We provide a phase diagram for the behavior of $\Delta S$ for such driven CFTs as a function of the drive frequency and amplitude.</p>

            <h2>Ultimate precision limit of quantum thermal machines</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yoshihiko Hasegawa</p>
            <p>Enhancing the precision of a thermodynamic process inevitably necessitates a thermodynamic cost, a principle formulated as the thermodynamic uncertainty relation. The thermodynamic uncertainty relation states that the relative variance of thermodynamic currents, calculated as the variance divided by the squared mean, decreases as entropy production increases. This means that if entropy production were allowed to become infinitely large, the relative variance could approach zero. However, it is evident that realizing infinitely large entropy production is infeasible in reality. In this Letter, we establish the ultimate limits of precision for open quantum thermal machines operating within a finite-dimensional system and environment. We derive bounds on the relative variance and the expectation of observables, applicable to any unitary evolution of the composite system. These bounds are governed by the \textit{minimum eigenvalue factor}, which serves as a maximal entropy production attainable by the quantum dynamics and parallels the concept of dynamical activity in classical stochastic thermodynamic. Additionally, we investigate how quantum coherence in the initial environmental state affects these fundamental bounds, showing that the presence of coherence can actually improve the ultimate precision limits. Our findings provide insights into fundamental limits on the precision of quantum thermal machines and the role of quantum effects in thermodynamic processes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander Yosifov, Aditya Iyer, Vlatko Vedral</p>
            <p>Quantum reservoirs have great potential as they utilize the complex real-time dissipative dynamics of quantum systems for information processing and target time-series generation without precise control or fine-tuning of the Hamiltonian parameters. Nonetheless, their realization is challenging as quantum hardware with appropriate dynamics, robustness to noise, and ability to produce target steady states is required. To that end, we propose the disordered quantum homogenizer as an alternative platform, and prove it satisfies the necessary and sufficient conditions - stability and contractivity - of the reservoir dynamics, necessary for solving machine learning tasks with time-series input data streams. The results indicate that the quantum homogenization protocol, physically implementable as either nuclear magnetic resonance ensemble or a photonic system, can potentially function as a reservoir computer.</p>

            <h2>Parastatistics and a secret communication challenge</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiyuan Wang</p>
            <p>One of the most unconventional features of topological phases of matter is the emergence of quasiparticles with exotic statistics, such as non-Abelian anyons in two dimensional systems. Recently, a different type of exotic particle statistics that is consistently defined in any dimension, called parastatistics, is also shown to be possible in a special family of topological phases. However, the physical significance of emergent parastatistics still remains elusive. Here we demonstrate a distinctive physical consequence of parastatistics by proposing a challenge game that can only be won using physical systems hosting paraparticles, as passing the challenge requires the two participating players to secretly communicate in an indirect way by exploiting the nontrivial exchange statistics of the quasiparticles. The winning strategy using emergent paraparticles is robust against noise, as well as the most relevant class of eavesdropping via local measurements. This provides both an operational definition and an experimental identity test for paraparticles, alongside a potential application in secret communication.</p>

            <p>Despite the significant progress in superconducting quantum computation over the past years, quantum state measurement still lags nearly an order of magnitude behind quantum gate operations in speed and fidelity. The main challenge is that the strong coupling and readout signal used to probe the quantum state may also introduce additional channels which may cause qubit state transitions. Here, we design a novel architecture to implement the long-sought longitudinal interaction scheme between qubits and resonators. This architecture not only provides genuine longitudinal interaction by eliminating residual transversal couplings, but also introduces proper nonlinearity to the resonator that can further minimize decay error and measurement-induced excitation error. Our experimental results demonstrate a measurement fidelity of 99.8% in 202 ns without the need for any first-stage amplification. After subtracting the residual preparation errors, the pure measurement fidelity is above 99.9%. Our scheme is compatible with the multiplexing readout scheme and can be used for quantum error correction.</p>

            <p>Yttrium iron garnet (YIG) magnonics has garnered significant research interest because of the unique properties of magnons (quasiparticles of collective spin excitation) for signal processing. In particular, hybrid systems based on YIG magnonics show great promise for quantum information science due to their broad frequency tunability and strong compatibility with other platforms. However, their broad applications have been severely constrained by substantial microwave loss in the gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) substrate at cryogenic temperatures. In this study, we demonstrate that YIG thin films can be spalled from YIG/GGG samples. Our approach is validated by measuring hybrid devices comprising superconducting resonators and spalled YIG films, which exhibits anti-crossing features that indicate strong coupling between magnons and microwave photons. Such new capability of separating YIG thin films from GGG substrates via spalling, and the integrated superconductor-YIG devices represent a significant advancement for integrated magnonic devices, paving the way for advanced magnon-based coherent information processing.</p>

We include a detailed discussion of the results for both qubit and qutrits systems, that is, final states containing spin one-half and spin one particles.

            <p>We develop an operational framework, combining relativistic quantum measurement theory with quantum reference frames (QRFs), in which local measurements of a quantum field on a background with symmetries are performed relative to a QRF. This yields a joint algebra of quantum-field and reference-frame observables that is invariant under the natural action of the group of spacetime isometries. For the appropriate class of quantum reference frames, this algebra is parameterised in terms of crossed products. Provided that the quantum field has good thermal properties (expressed by the existence of a KMS state at some nonzero temperature), one can use modular theory to show that the invariant algebra admits a semifinite trace. If furthermore the quantum reference frame has good thermal behaviour (expressed in terms of the properties of a KMS weight) at the same temperature, this trace is finite. We give precise conditions for the invariant algebra of physical observables to be a type $II_1$ factor. Our results build upon recent work of Chandrasekaran, Longo, Penington and Witten [JHEP $\mathbf{2023}$, 82 (2023)], providing both a significant mathematical generalisation of these findings and a refined operational understanding of their model.</p>

We demonstrate that the Wilsonian momentum-shell renormalization group (RG) theory capturing the infrared scaling should be formulated keeping $\vec{Q}$ as a flowing, scale-dependent quantity. At the quantum critical point, scaling controlled by the dynamical exponent $z=3$ is overshadowed by a broad scaling regime characterized by a lower value of $z \approx 2$. This in particular offers an explanation of the results of quantum Monte Carlo simulations pertinent to the electronic nematic quantum critical point.</p>

            <p>Levitated ferromagnets act as ultraprecise magnetometers, which can exhibit high quality factors due to their excellent isolation from the environment. These instruments can be utilized in searches for ultralight dark matter candidates, such as axionlike dark matter or dark-photon dark matter. In addition to being sensitive to an axion-photon coupling or kinetic mixing, which produce physical magnetic fields, ferromagnets are also sensitive to the effective magnetic field (or "axion wind") produced by an axion-electron coupling. While the dynamics of a levitated ferromagnet in response to a DC magnetic field have been well studied, all of these couplings would produce AC fields. In this work, we study the response of a ferromagnet to an applied AC magnetic field and use these results to project their sensitivity to axion and dark-photon dark matter. We pay special attention to the direction of motion induced by an applied AC field, in particular, whether it precesses around the applied field (similar to an electron spin) or librates in the plane of the field (similar to a compass needle). We show that existing levitated ferromagnet setups can already have comparable sensitivity to an axion-electron coupling as comagnetometer or torsion balance experiments. In addition, future setups can become sensitive probes of axion-electron coupling, dark-photon kinetic mixing, and axion-photon coupling, for ultralight dark matter masses $m_\mathrm{DM}\lesssim\mathrm{feV}$.</p>

This makes these rate coefficients universal functions of the long-range interaction parameters and masses, which was previously exploited to develop a self-defining atomic sensor for ambient pressure. Here, we employ rigorous quantum scattering calculations to examine the response of thermally averaged rate coefficients for atom-atom collisions to changes in the interaction potentials. We perform a comprehensive analysis of the universality, and the boundaries thereof, by treating the quantum scattering observables as probabilistic predictions determined by a distribution of interaction potentials. We show that there is a characteristic change of the resulting distributions of rate coefficients, separating light, few-electron atoms and heavy, polarizable atoms. We produce diagrams that illustrate the boundaries of the thermal collision universality at different temperatures and provide guidance for future experiments seeking to exploit the universality.</p>

            <p>Quantum scars correspond to enhanced probability densities along unstable classical periodic orbits. In recent years, research on quantum scars has extended to various systems including the many-body regime. In this work we focus on the formation, prevalence, and stability of linear "bouncing-ball" (BB) scars in two-dimensional (2D) quantum wells. These scars have relevance as effective and controllable channels in quantum transport. We utilize imaginary time propagation to solve the 2D Schrödinger equation within an arbitrary external confining potential, specifically the quantum well model with external perturbations. We show how BB scars begin to emerge with a single perturbative peak, such as a repulsive bump or attractive dip that simulates the effect of a charged nanotip in the system. We then identify the optimal size of the perturbative peak to maximize the prevalence of these scars. Finally, we investigate the stability of BB scars against external noise and find that some of them are remarkably robust. This suggests promising opportunities for further applications of BB scars in quantum transport.</p>

            <p>In a previous publication [J. Chem.

Here, we generalize these results, showing that Rothe's method can propagate arbitrary numbers of thawed, complex-valued, explicitly correlated Gaussian functions (ECGs) with dense correlation matrices for systems with varying dimensionality. We consider the multidimensional Henon-Heiles potential, and show that the dynamics can be quantitatively reproduced using only 30 Gaussians in 2D, and that accurate spectra can be obtained using 20 Gaussians in 2D and 30 to 40 Gaussians in 3D and 4D. Thus, the relevant multidimensional dynamics can be described at high quality using only a small number of ECGs that give a very compact representation of the wave function. This efficient representation, along with the demonstrated ability of Rothe's method to propagate Gaussian wave packets in strong fields and ECGs in complex potentials, paves the way for accurate molecular dynamics calculations beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation in strong fields.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yalun Zhang, Longwen Zhou</p>
            <p>Non-Hermitian phenomena, such as exceptional points, non-Hermitian skin effects, and topologically nontrivial phases, have attracted continued attention. In this work, we reveal how interactions and nonreciprocal hopping could collectively influence the behavior of two interacting bosons on quasiperiodic lattices. Focusing on the Bose-Hubbard model with Aubry-André-Harper quasiperiodic modulations and hopping asymmetry, we discover that the interaction could enlarge the localization transition point of the noninteracting system into a critical phase, in which localized doublons formed by bosonic pairs can coexist with delocalized states. Under the open boundary condition, the bosonic doublons could further show non-Hermitian skin effects, realizing doublon condensation at the edges, and their direction of skin-localization can be flexibly tuned by the hopping parameters. A framework is developed to characterize the spectral, localization, and topological transitions accompanying these phenomena. Our work advances the understanding of localization and topological phases in non-Hermitian systems, particularly in relation to multiparticle interactions.</p>

            <p>The Weyl-Heisenberg symmetries originate from translation invariances of various manifolds viewed as phase spaces, e.g. Euclidean plane, semi-discrete cylinder, torus, in the two-dimensional case, and higher-dimensional generalisations. In this review we describe, on an elementary level, how this symmetry emerges through displacement operators and standard Fourier analysis, and how their unitary representations are used both in Signal Analysis (time-frequency techniques, Gabor transform) and in quantum formalism (covariant integral quantizations and semi-classical portraits). An example of application of the formalism to the Majorana stellar constellation in the plane is presented.</p>

            <h2>Automatically Refining Assertions for Efficient Debugging of Quantum Programs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Damian Rovara, Lukas Burgholzer, Robert Wille</p>
            <p>As new advancements in the field of quantum computing lead to the development of increasingly complex programs, approaches to validate and debug these programs are becoming more important. To this end, methods employed in classical debugging, such as assertions for testing specific properties of a program's state, have been adapted for quantum programs. However, to efficiently debug quantum programs, it is key to properly place these assertions. This usually requires a deep understanding of the program's underlying mathematical properties, constituting a time-consuming manual task for developers. To address this problem, this work proposes methods for automatically refining assertions in quantum programs by moving them to more favorable positions in the program or by placing new assertions that help to further narrow down potential error locations. This allows developers to take advantage of rich and expressive assertions that greatly improve the debugging experience without requiring them to place these assertions manually in an otherwise tedious manner. An open-source implementation of the proposed methods is available at this https URL.</p>

            <p>Quantum error correction is essential for bridging the gap between the error rates of physical devices and the extremely low logical error rates required for quantum algorithms. Recent error-correction demonstrations on superconducting processors have focused primarily on the surface code, which offers a high error threshold but poses limitations for logical operations. In contrast, the color code enables much more efficient logic, although it requires more complex stabilizer measurements and decoding techniques. Measuring these stabilizers in planar architectures such as superconducting qubits is challenging, and so far, realizations of color codes have not addressed performance scaling with code size on any platform. Here, we present a comprehensive demonstration of the color code on a superconducting processor, achieving logical error suppression and performing logical operations. Scaling the code distance from three to five suppresses logical errors by a factor of $\Lambda_{3/5}$ = 1.56(4). Simulations indicate this performance is below the threshold of the color code, and furthermore that the color code may be more efficient than the surface code with modest device improvements. Using logical randomized benchmarking, we find that transversal Clifford gates add an error of only 0.0027(3), which is substantially less than the error of an idling error correction cycle. We inject magic states, a key resource for universal computation, achieving fidelities exceeding 99% with post-selection (retaining about 75% of the data). Finally, we successfully teleport logical states between distance-three color codes using lattice surgery, with teleported state fidelities between 86.5(1)% and 90.7(1)%. This work establishes the color code as a compelling research direction to realize fault-tolerant quantum computation on superconducting processors in the near future.</p>

            <p>We explore the dissipative phase transition of the two-photon Dicke model, a topic that has garnered significant attention recently. Our analysis reveals that while single-photon loss does not stabilize the intrinsic instability in the model, the inclusion of two-photon loss restores stability, leading to the emergence of superradiant states which coexist with the normal vacuum states. Using a second-order cumulant expansion for the photons, we derive an analytical description of the system in the thermodynamic limit which agrees well with the exact calculation results. Additionally, we present the Wigner function for the system, shedding light on the breaking of the Z4-symmetry inherent in the model. These findings offer valuable insights into stabilization mechanisms in open quantum systems and pave the way for exploring complex nonlinear dynamics in two-photon Dicke models.</p>

            <p>Optical vector modes (VMs), characterized by spatially varying polarization distributions, have become essential tools across microscopy, metrology, optical trapping, nanophotonics, and optical communications. The Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) effect, a fundamental two-photon interference phenomenon in quantum optics, offers significant potential to extend the applications of VMs beyond the classical regime. Here, we demonstrate the simultaneous generation of all four Bell states by exploiting the HOM interference of VMs. The resulting Bell states exhibit spatially tailored distributions that are determined by the input modes. These results represent a significant step in manipulating HOM interference within structured photons, offering promising avenues for high-dimensional quantum information processing and in particular high-dimensional quantum communication, quantum sensing, and advanced photonic technologies reliant on tailored quantum states of light.</p>

            <p>The Dicke-Ising model, one of the few paradigmatic models of matter-light interaction, exhibits a superradiant quantum phase transition above a critical coupling strength. However, in natural optical systems, its experimental validation is hindered by a "no-go theorem''. Here, we propose a digital-analog quantum simulator for this model based on an ensemble of interacting qubits coupled to a single-mode photonic resonator. We analyze the system's free energy landscape using field-theoretical methods and develop a digital-analog quantum algorithm that disentangles qubit and photon degrees of freedom through a parity-measurement protocol. This disentangling enables the emulation of a photonic Schrödinger cat state, which is a hallmark of the superradiant ground state in finite-size systems and can be unambiguously probed through the Wigner tomography of the resonator's field.</p>

            <h2>Multi-user QKD using quotient graph states derived from continuous-variable dual-rail cluster states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akash nag Oruganti</p>
            <p>Multipartite entangled states are fundamental resources for multi-user quantum cryptographic tasks. Despite significant advancements in generating large-scale continuous-variable (CV) cluster states, particularly the dual-rail cluster state because of its utility in measurement-based quantum computation, its application in quantum cryptography has remained largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce a novel protocol for generating three user conference keys using a CV dual-rail cluster state. We develop the concept of a quotient graph state by applying a node coloring scheme to the infinite dual-rail graph, resulting in a six-mode pure graph state suitable for cryptographic applications. Our results demonstrate that the proposed protocol achieves performance close to that of GHZ-based protocols for quantum conference key agreement (QCKA), with GHZ states performing slightly better. However, a key advantage of our protocol lies in its ability to generate bipartite keys post-QCKA, a feature not achievable with GHZ states. Additionally, compared to a downstream access network using two-mode squeezed vacuum states, our protocol achieves superior performance in generating bipartite keys. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to the finite-size regime and consider the impact of using impure squeezed states for generating the multipartite entangled states, reflecting experimental imperfections. Our findings indicate that even with finite resources and non-ideal state preparation, the proposed protocol maintains its advantages. We also introduce a more accurate method to estimate the capacity of a protocol to generate bipartite keys in a quantum network.</p>

            <p>Discrete-step walks describe the dynamics of particles in a lattice subject to hopping or splitting events at discrete times. Despite being of primordial interest to the physics of quantum walks, the topological properties arising from their discrete-step nature have been hardly explored. Here we report the observation of topological phases unique to discrete-step walks. We use light pulses in a double-fibre ring setup whose dynamics maps into a two-dimensional lattice subject to discrete splitting events. We show that the number of edge states is not simply described by the bulk invariants of the lattice (i.e., the Chern number and the Floquet winding number) as would be the case in static lattices and in lattices subject to smooth modulations. The number of edge states is also determined by a topological invariant associated to the discrete-step unitary operators acting at the edges of the lattice. This situation goes beyond the usual bulk-edge correspondence and allows manipulating the number of edge states without the need to go through a gap closing transition. Our work opens new perspectives for the engineering of topological modes for particles subject to quantum walks.</p>

            <h2>A simple yet accurate stochastic approach to the quantum phase noise of nanolasers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matias Bundgaard-Nielsen, Marco Saldutti, Benjamin Falkenberg Gøtzsche, Emil Grovn, Jesper Mørk</p>
            <p>Nanolasers operating at low power levels are strongly affected by intrinsic quantum noise, affecting both intensity fluctuations and laser coherence. Starting from semi-classical rate equations and making a simple hypothesis for the phase of the laser field, a simple stochastic model for the laser quantum noise is suggested. The model is shown to agree quantitatively with quantum master equations for microscopic lasers with a small number of emitters and with classical Langevin equations for macroscopic systems. In contrast, neither quantum master equations nor classical Langevin equations adequately address the mesoscopic regime. The stochastic approach is used to calculate the linewidth throughout the transition to lasing, where the linewidth changes from being dominated by the particle-like nature of photons below threshold to the wave-like nature above threshold, where it is strongly influenced by index fluctuations enhancing the linewidth.</p>

States with stellar rank n can be also equivalently referred to as genuinely n-photon quantum non-Gaussian states. Here we present an efficient method for construction of general witnesses of the stellar rank. The number of parameters that need to be optimized in order to determine the witness does not depend on the stellar rank and it scales quadratically with the number of modes. We illustrate the procedure by constructing stellar rank witnesses based on pairs of Fock state probabilities and also based on pairs of fidelities with superpositions of coherent states.</p>

            <p>A remarkable characteristic of quantum computing is the potential for reliable computation despite faulty qubits. This can be achieved through quantum error correction, which is typically implemented by repeatedly applying static syndrome checks, permitting correction of logical information. Recently, the development of time-dynamic approaches to error correction has uncovered new codes and new code implementations. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate three time-dynamic implementations of the surface code, each offering a unique solution to hardware design challenges and introducing flexibility in surface code realization. First, we embed the surface code on a hexagonal lattice, reducing the necessary couplings per qubit from four to three. Second, we walk a surface code, swapping the role of data and measure qubits each round, achieving error correction with built-in removal of accumulated non-computational errors. Finally, we realize the surface code using iSWAP gates instead of the traditional CNOT, extending the set of viable gates for error correction without additional overhead. We measure the error suppression factor when scaling from distance-3 to distance-5 codes of $\Lambda_{35,\text{hex}} = 2.15(2)$, $\Lambda_{35,\text{walk}} = 1.69(6)$, and $\Lambda_{35,\text{iSWAP}} = 1.56(2)$, achieving state-of-the-art error suppression for each. With detailed error budgeting, we explore their performance trade-offs and implications for hardware design. This work demonstrates that dynamic circuit approaches satisfy the demands for fault-tolerance and opens new alternative avenues for scalable hardware design.</p>

            <p>Machine learning has been revolutionizing our world over the last few years and is also increasingly exploited in several areas of physics, including quantum dynamics and this http URL need for a framework that brings together machine learning models and quantum simulation methods has been quite high within the quantum control field, with the ultimate goal of exploiting these powerful computational methods for the efficient implementation of modern quantum technologies. The existing frameworks for quantum system simulations, such as QuTip and this http URL, even though they are very successful in simulating quantum dynamics, cannot be easily incorporated into the platforms used for the development of machine learning models, like for example PyTorch. The TorchQC framework introduced in the present work comes exactly to fill this gap. It is a new library written entirely in Python and based on the PyTorch deep learning library. PyTorch and other deep learning frameworks are based on tensors, a structure that is also used in quantum mechanics. This is the common ground that TorchQC utilizes to combine quantum physics simulations and deep learning this http URL exploits PyTorch and its tensor mechanism to represent quantum states and operators as tensors, while it also incorporates all the tools needed to simulate quantum system dynamics. All necessary operations are internal in the PyTorch library, thus TorchQC programs can be executed in GPUs, substantially reducing the simulation time. We believe that the proposed TorchQC library has the potential to accelerate the development of deep learning models directly incorporating quantum simulations, enabling the easier integration of these powerful techniques in modern quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>Non-Hermitian systems exhibit a variety of unique features rooted in the presence of exceptional points (EP). The distinct topological structure in the proximity of an EP gives rise to counterintuitive behaviors absent in Hermitian systems, which emerge after encircling the EP either quasistatically or dynamically. However, experimental exploration of EP encirclement in quantum systems, particularly those involving high-order EPs, remains challenging due to the difficulty of coherently controlling more degrees of freedom. In this work, we experimentally investigate the eigenvalues braiding and state transfer arising from the encirclement of EP in a three-dimensional non-Hermitian quantum system using superconducting circuits. We characterize the second- and third-order EPs through the coalescence of eigenvalues. Then we reveal the topological structure near the EP3 by quasistatically encircling it along various paths with three independent parameters, which yields the eigenvalues braiding described by the braid group $B_3$. Additionally, we observe chiral state transfer between three eigenstates under a fast driving scheme when no EPs are enclosed, while time-symmetric behavior occurs when at least one EP is encircled. Our findings offer insights into understanding non-Hermitian topological structures and the manipulation of quantum states through dynamic operations.</p>

            <p>Optical Schrödinger cat states are non-Gaussian states with applications in quantum technologies, such as for building error-correcting states in quantum computing. Yet the efficient generation of high-fidelity optical Schrödinger cat states is an outstanding problem in quantum optics. Here, we propose using squeezed superpositions of zero and two photons, $|\theta\rangle = \cos{(\theta/2)}|0\rangle + \sin{(\theta/2)}|2\rangle$, as ingredients for protocols to efficiently generate high-fidelity cat states. We present a protocol using linear optics with success probability $P\gtrsim 50\%$ that can generate cat states of size $|\alpha|^2=5$ with fidelity $F>0.99$. The protocol relies only on detecting single photons and is remarkably tolerant of loss, with $2\%$ detection loss still achieving $F>0.98$ for cats with $|\alpha|^2=5$. We also show that squeezed $\theta$ states are ideal candidates for nonlinear photon subtraction using a two-level system with near deterministic success probability and fidelity $F>0.98$ for cat states of size $|\alpha|^2=5$. Schemes for generating $\theta$ states using quantum emitters are also presented. Our protocols can be implemented with current state-of-the-art quantum optics experiments.</p>

Our method is capable of unveiling the effect of relative bandwidth as well as squeezing required to observe the anticipated anti-crossing spectrum and enhanced cooperativity without the ideal squeezed bath assumption.

            <p>Realizing universal fault-tolerant quantum computation is a key goal in quantum information science. By encoding quantum information into logical qubits utilizing quantum error correcting codes, physical errors can be detected and corrected, enabling substantial reduction in logical error rates. However, the set of logical operations that can be easily implemented on such encoded qubits is often constrained, necessitating the use of special resource states known as 'magic states' to implement universal, classically hard circuits. A key method to prepare high-fidelity magic states is to perform 'distillation', creating them from multiple lower fidelity inputs. Here we present the experimental realization of magic state distillation with logical qubits on a neutral-atom quantum computer. Our approach makes use of a dynamically reconfigurable architecture to encode and perform quantum operations on many logical qubits in parallel. We demonstrate the distillation of magic states encoded in d=3 and d=5 color codes, observing improvements of the logical fidelity of the output magic states compared to the input logical magic states. These experiments demonstrate a key building block of universal fault-tolerant quantum computation, and represent an important step towards large-scale logical quantum processors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stefano Veroni, Alexandru Paler, Giacomo Giudice</p>
            <p>We show that universal quantum computation can be made fault-tolerant in a scenario where the error-correction is implemented without mid-circuit measurements. To this end, we introduce a measurement-free deformation protocol of the Bacon-Shor code to realize a logical $\mathit{CCZ}$ gate, enabling a universal set of fault-tolerant operations. Independently, we demonstrate that certain stabilizer codes can be concatenated in a measurement-free way without having to rely on a universal logical gate set. This is achieved by means of the disposable Toffoli gadget, which realizes the feedback operation in a resource-efficient way. For the purpose of benchmarking the proposed protocols with circuit-level noise, we implement an efficient method to simulate non-Clifford circuits consisting of few Hadamard gates. In particular, our findings support that below-breakeven logical performance is achievable with a circuit-level error rate below $10^{-3}$. Altogether, the deformation protocol and the Toffoli gadget provide a blueprint for a fully fault-tolerant architecture without any feed-forward operation, which is particularly suited for state-of-the-art neutral-atom platforms.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Frequency Conversion of $\mu s$-long Photons from the Visible to the Telecom-C-Band</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Soeren Wengerowsky, Stefano Duranti, Lukas Heller, Hugues de Riedmatten</p>
            <p>Quantum Frequency Conversion (QFC) is a widely used technique to interface atomic systems with the telecom band in order to facilitate propagation over longer distances in fiber. Here we demonstrate the difference-frequency conversion from 606 nm to 1552 nm of microsecond-long weak coherent pulses at the single photon level compatible with Pr$^{3+}$:Y$_2$SiO$_5\,$ quantum memories, with high-signal to noise ratio. We use a single step difference frequency generation process with a continuous-wave pump at 994 nm in a MgO:ppLN-waveguide and ultra-narrow spectral filtering down to a bandwidth of 12.5 MHz. With this setup, we achieve the conversion of weak coherent pulses of duration up to 13.6 $\mu s$ with a device efficiency of about 25% and a signal-to-noise ratio >460 for 10 $\mu s$-long pulses containing one photon on average. This signal-to-noise ratio is large enough to enable a high-fidelity conversion of qubits emitted from an emissive quantum memory based on Pr$^{3+}$:Y$_2$SiO$_5\,$ and to realize an interface with quantum processing nodes based on narrow-linewidth cavity-enhanced trapped ions.</p>

            <h2>A Finite-Time Quantum Otto Engine subject to Control Noise and Enhancement Techniques</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Theodore McKeever, Owen Diba, Ahsan Nazir</p>
            <p>With the development of any quantum technology comes a need for precise control of quantum systems. Here, we evaluate the impact of control noise on a quantum Otto cycle. Whilst it is postulated that noiseless quantum engines can approach maximal Otto efficiency in finite times, the existence of white noise on the controls is shown to negatively affect average engine performance. Two methods of quantum enhancement, counterdiabatic driving and quantum lubrication, are implemented and found to improve the performance of the noisy cycle only in specified parameter regimes. To gain insight into performance fluctuations, projective energy measurements are used to construct a noise-averaged probability distribution without assuming full thermalisation or adiabaticity. From this, the variances in thermodynamic currents are observed to increase as average power and efficiency improve, and are also shown to be consistent with known bounds from thermodynamic uncertainty relations. Lastly, by comparing the average functioning of the unmonitored engine to a projectively-measured engine cycle, the role of coherence in work extraction for this quantum engine model is investigated.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Henry Bloss, Brandon Kriesten, T. J. Hobbs</p>
            <p>Deeply inelastic scattering (DIS) is an essential process for exploring the structure of visible matter and testing the standard model. At the same time, the theoretical interpretation of DIS measurements depends on QCD factorization theorems whose validity deteriorates at the lower values of $Q^2$ and $W^2$ typical of neutrino DIS in accelerator-based oscillation searches. For this reason, progress in understanding the origin and limits of QCD factorization is invaluable to the accuracy and precision of predictions for these upcoming neutrino experiments. In these short proceedings, we introduce a novel approach based on the quantum entropy associated with continuous distributions in QCD, using it to characterize the limits of factorization theorems relevant for the description of neutrino DIS. This work suggests an additional avenue for dissecting factorization-breaking dynamics through the quantum entropy, which could also play a role in quantum simulations of related systems.</p>

            <p>The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model is a cornerstone in the study of quantum chaos and holographic quantum matter. Real-world implementations, however, deviate from the idealized all-to-all connectivity, raising questions about the robustness of its chaotic properties. In this work, we investigate a quadratic SYK model with distance-dependent interactions governed by a power-law decay. By analytically and numerically studying the spectral form factor (SFF), we uncover how the single particle transitions manifest in the many-body system. While the SFF demonstrates robustness under slightly reduced interaction ranges, further suppression leads to a breakdown of perturbation theory and new spectral regimes, marked by a higher dip and the emergence of a secondary plateau. Our results highlight the interplay between single-particle criticality and many-body dynamics, offering new insights into the quantum chaos-to-localization transition and its reflection in spectral statistics.</p>

            <h2>Massive graviton dark matter searches with long-baseline atom interferometers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Diego Blas, John Carlton, Christopher McCabe</p>
            <p>Atom interferometers offer exceptional sensitivity to ultra-light dark matter (ULDM) through their precise measurement of phenomena acting on atoms. While previous work has established their capability to detect scalar and vector ULDM, their potential for detecting spin-2 ULDM remains unexplored. This work investigates the sensitivity of atom interferometers to spin-2 ULDM by considering several frameworks for massive gravity: a Lorentz-invariant Fierz-Pauli case and two Lorentz-violating scenarios. We find that coherent oscillations of the spin-2 ULDM field induce a measurable phase shift through three distinct channels: coupling of the scalar mode to atomic energy levels, and vector and tensor effects that modify the propagation of atoms and light. Atom interferometers uniquely probe all of these effects, while providing sensitivity to a different mass range from laser interferometers. Our results demonstrate the potential of atom interferometers to advance the search for spin-2 dark matter through accessing unexplored parameter space and uncovering new interactions between ULDM and atoms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Bałut, Xuefei Guo, Niels de Vries, Dipanjan Chaudhuri, Barry Bradlyn, Peter Abbamonte, Philip W. Phillips</p>
            <p>The density-density response in optimally doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ has recently been shown to exhibit conformal symmetry. Using, the experimentally inferred conformal dynamic susceptibility, we compute the resultant quantum Fisher information (QFI), a witness to multi-partite entanglement. In contrast to a Fermi liquid in which the QFI is approximately temperature independent much below the Fermi energy scale, we find that the QFI increases as a power law at low temperatures but ultimately extrapolates to a constant at $T=0$. The constant is of the form, $\omega_g^{2\Delta}$, where $\Delta$ is the conformal dimension and $\omega_g$ is the UV cutoff which is on the order of the pseudogap. As this constant {depends on both UV and IR properties}, it illustrates that multipartite entanglement in a strange metal exhibits UV-IR mixing, a benchmark feature of doped Mott insulators as exemplified by dynamical spectral weight transfer. We conclude with a discussion of the implication of our results for low-energy reductions of the Hubbard model.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abdul Wahab, Muqaddar Abbas, Xiaosen Yang, Yuee Xie, Yuanping Chen</p>
            <p>In this research, we investigate second-order sideband generation (SSG) and slow-fast light using a hybrid system comprised of two coupled opto- and magnomechanical microspheres, namely a YIG sphere and a silica sphere. The YIG sphere hosts a magnon mode and a vibration mode induced by magnetostriction, whereas the silica sphere has an optical whispering gallery mode and a mechanical mode coupled via optomechanical interaction. The mechanical modes of both spheres are close in frequency and are coherently coupled by the straightway physical contact between the two microspheres. We use a perturbation approach to solve the Heisenberg-Langevin equations, offering an analytical framework for transmission rate and SSG. Using experimentally feasible settings, we demonstrate that the transmission rate and SSG are strongly dependent on the magnomechanical, optomechanical, and mechanics mechanics coupling strengths (MMCS) between the two microspheres. The numerical results show that increasing the MMCS can enhance both the transmission rate and SSG efficiency, resulting in gain within our system. Our findings, in particular, reveal that the efficiency of the SSG can be effectively controlled by cavity detuning, decay rate, and pump power. Notably, our findings suggest that modifying the system parameters can alter the group delay, thereby regulating the transition between fast and slow light propagation, and vice versa. Our protocol provides guidelines for manipulating nonlinear optical properties and controlling light propagation, with applications including optical switching, information storage, and precise measurement of weak signals.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sudin Ganguly, S. K. Maiti</p>
            <p>Non-reciprocal hopping induces a synthetic magnetic flux which leads to the non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm effect. Since non-Hermitian Hamiltonians possess both real and imaginary eigenvalues, this effect allows the observation of real and imaginary persistent currents in a ring threaded by the synthetic flux~\cite{nrh8}. Motivated by this, we investigate the behavior of persistent currents in a disordered Hatano-Nelson ring with anti-Hermitian intradimer hopping. The disorder is diagonal and we explore three distinct models, namely the Aubry-André-Harper model, the Fibonacci model, both representing correlated disorder, and an uncorrelated (random) model. We conduct a detailed analysis of the energy spectrum and examine the real and imaginary parts of the persistent current under various conditions such as different ring sizes and filling factors. Interestingly, we find that real and imaginary persistent currents exhibit amplification in the presence of correlated disorder. This amplification is also observed in certain individual random configurations but vanishes after configuration averaging. Additionally, we observe both diamagnetic and paramagnetic responses in the current behavior and investigate aspects of persistent currents in the absence of disorder that have not been previously explored. Interestingly, we find that the intradimer bonds host only imaginary currents, while the interdimer bonds carry only real currents.</p>

            <h2>Quantum chaos, localization and phase transitions in random graphs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ioannis Kleftogiannis, Ilias Amanatidis</p>
            <p>The energy level statistics of uniform random graphs are studied, by treating the graphs as random tight-binding lattices. The inherent random geometry of the graphs and their dynamical spatial dimensionality, leads to various quantum chaotic and localized phases and transitions between them. Essentially the random geometry acts as disorder, whose strength is characterized by the ratio of edges over vertices R in the graphs. For dense graphs, with large ratio R, the spacing between successive energy levels follows the Wigner-Dyson distribution, leading to a quantum chaotic behavior and a metallic phase, characterized by level repulsion. For ratios near R=0.5, where a large dominating component in the graph appears, the level spacing follows the Poisson distribution with level crossings and a localized phase for the respective wavefunctions lying on the graph. For intermediate ratios R we observe a phase transition between the quantum chaotic and localized phases characterized by a semi-Poisson distribution. The values R of the critical regime where the phase transition occurs depend on the energy of the system. Our analysis shows that physical systems with random geometry, for example ones with a fluctuating/dynamical spatial dimension, contain novel universal phase transition properties, similar to those occuring in more traditional phase transitions based on symmetry breaking mechanisms, whose universal properties are strongly determined by the dimensionality of the system.</p>

            <p>Neutral resonant states of molecules play a very important role in the dissociation dynamics and other electronic processes that occur via intermediate capture into these states. With the goal of identifying resonant states, and their corresponding widths, of the imidogen molecule NH as a function of internuclear distance, we have performed detailed R-matrix calculations on the e + NH+ system. In a previous work, we had identified bound states of NH and Feshbach resonances in the e + NH+ system at a single geometry, namely the NH+ equilibrium Re = 2.0205 a0 . Here we present a much more detailed work by repeating the calculation on over 60 internuclear distances to obtain the corresponding potential energy curves. The bound states for nine symmetries have been detailed many of which, particularly the singlet states, were never studied before. Several resonant states of different symmetries, which were unknown until now, have been systematically identified and their widths calculated in the present work, which proved much more challenging due to presence of many avoided crossings. It is hoped that the bound and the new resonant states obtained here will open up other molecular dynamics studies, since for several dissociative processes, although experimental data existed for more than a decade, these are still uncorroborated due to absence of molecular data, and hence subsequent theoretical calculations.</p>

By employing single-atom detection of Rb and Cs, we observe molecule formation via correlated loss of both species and study the formation dynamics with single-particle resolution. We control the interatomic distances by manipulating the relative wavefunction of atom pairs using the tweezer intensity, optimizing the coupling to molecular states and exploring the effect of the tweezer on these states. Additionally, we demonstrate molecule association with atoms trapped in separate tweezers, paving the way for state-selective assembly of polyatomic molecules. The observed binding energies, molecular alignment, and bond lengths are in good agreement with theory. Our approach is broadly applicable to Rydberg tweezer platforms, expanding the range of available molecular systems and enabling the integration of Rydberg molecules into existing quantum science platforms.</p>

Starting from a double-holographic model of eternal two-sided asymptotically AdS$_d$ ($d>2$) black hole each coupled to a flat $d$-dimensional bath, we show that the entanglement dynamics in the late-time, large-subregion limit is described by entanglement membrane, thereby establishing a quantitative equivalence between a semi-classical gravity and a chaotic quantum many-body system calculation of the Page curve.</p>

            <p>A core challenge for superconducting quantum computers is to scale up the number of qubits in each processor without increasing noise or cross-talk. Distributed quantum computing across small qubit arrays, known as chiplets, can address these challenges in a scalable manner. We propose a chiplet architecture over microwave links with potential to exceed monolithic performance on near-term hardware. Our methods of modeling and evaluating the chiplet architecture bridge the physical and network layers in these processors. We find evidence that distributing computation across chiplets may reduce the overall error rates associated with moving data across the device, despite higher error figures for transfers across links. Preliminary analyses suggest that latency is not substantially impacted, and that at least some applications and architectures may avoid bottlenecks around chiplet boundaries. In the long-term, short-range networks may underlie quantum computers just as local area networks underlie classical datacenters and supercomputers today.</p>

            <p>Understanding the influence of measurements on the properties of many-body systems is a fundamental problem in quantum mechanics and for quantum technologies. This paper explores how a finite density of stochastic local measurement modifies a given state's entanglement structure. Considering various measurement protocols, we explore the typical quantum correlations of their associated projected ensembles arising from the ground state of the quantum Ising model. Using large-scale numerical simulations, we demonstrate substantial differences among inequivalent measurement protocols. Surprisingly, we observe that forced on-site measurements can enhance both bipartite and multipartite entanglement. We present a phenomenological toy model and perturbative calculations to analytically support these results. Furthermore, we extend these considerations to the non-Hermitian Ising model, naturally arising in optically monitored systems, and we show that its qualitative entanglement features are not altered by a finite density of projective measurements. Overall, these results reveal a complex phenomenology where local quantum measurements do not simply disentangle degrees of freedom, but may actually strengthen the entanglement in the system.</p>

            <p>Quantum networks (QNs) exhibit stronger connectivity than predicted by classical percolation, yet the origin of this phenomenon remains unexplored. Here, we apply a statistical physics model -- concurrence percolation -- to uncover the origin of stronger connectivity on hierarchical scale-free networks, the ($U,V$) flowers. These networks allow full analytical control over path connectivity through two adjustable path-length parameters, $U \leq V$. This precise control enables us to determine critical exponents well beyond current simulation limits, revealing that classical and concurrence percolations, while both satisfying the hyperscaling relation, fall into distinct universality classes. This distinction arises from how they "superpose" parallel, non-shortest path contributions into overall connectivity. Concurrence percolation, unlike its classical counterpart, is sensitive to non-shortest paths and shows higher resilience to detours as these paths lengthen. This enhanced resilience is also observed in real-world hierarchical, scale-free Internet networks. Our findings highlight a crucial principle for QN design: when non-shortest paths are abundant, they notably enhance QN connectivity beyond what is achievable with classical percolation.</p>

The system can also support standard two-particle Bloch oscillations under certain conditions. We propose two types of dimerized non-Hermitian systems to demonstrate our results. In addition, we also propose a scheme to demonstrate the results of electron-pair dynamics in a single-particle 2D $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric square lattice.</p>

In this work, we wish to lower the barriers to entry for CV-QKD experiments associated to this difficulty by providing a highly modular, open source software that is in principle hardware agnostic and can be used in multiple configurations. We benchmarked this software, called QOSST, using an experimental setup with a locally generated local oscillator, frequency multiplexed pilots and RF-heterodyne detection, and obtained state-of-the-art secret key rates of the order of Mbit/s over metropolitan distances at the asymptotic limit. We hope that QOSST can be used to stimulate further experimental advances in CV-QKD and be improved and extended by the community to achieve high performance in a wide variety of configurations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maik Reddiger</p>
            <p>It is a common view that von Neumann laid the foundations of a "quantum probability theory" with his axiomatization of quantum mechanics (QM). As such, it is regarded a generalization of the "classical probability theory" due to Kolmogorov. Outside of quantum physics, however, Kolmogorov's axioms enjoy universal applicability. This raises the question of whether quantum physics indeed requires such a generalization of our conception of probability or if von Neumann's axiomatization of QM was contingent on the absence of a general theory of probability in the 1920s. In this work I argue in favor of the latter position. In particular, I show that for non-relativistic $N$-body quantum systems subject to a time-independent scalar potential, it is possible to construct a mathematically rigorous theory based on Kolmogorov's axioms and physically natural random variables, which reproduces central predictions of QM. The respective theories are distinct, so that an empirical comparison may be possible. Moreover, the approach can in principle be adapted to other classes of quantum-mechanical models. Part II of this series discusses the empirical violation of Bell inequalities in the context of this approach. Part III addresses the projection postulate and the question of measurement.</p>

            <p>Continuous variables (CV) offer a promising platform for the development of various applications, such as quantum communication, computing, and sensing, and CV graph states represent a family of powerful entangled resource states for all these areas. In many of these protocols, a crucial aspect is the certification of the quantum state subsequently used. While numerous protocols exist, most rely on assumptions unrealistic for physical continuous variable states, such as infinite precision in quadrature measurement or the use of states requiring infinite squeezing. In this work, we adapt existing protocols to deal with these unavoidable considerations, and use them to certify their application for different quantum information tasks. More specifically, we show how CV graph states can be efficiently verified and certified even in a noisy and imperfect setting. We then discuss how our findings impact the usability of states obtained after the protocol for different applications, including quantum teleportation, computing, and sensing.</p>

            <p>Multipartite entanglement, linking multiple nodes simultaneously, is a higher-order correlation that offers advantages over pairwise connections in quantum networks (QNs). Creating reliable, large-scale multipartite entanglement requires entanglement routing, a process that combines local, short-distance connections into a long-distance connection, which can be considered as a transformation of network topology. Here, we address the question of whether a QN can be topologically transformed into another via entanglement routing. Our key result is an exact mapping from multipartite entanglement routing to Nash-Williams's graph immersion problem, extended to hypergraphs. This generalized hypergraph immersion problem introduces a partial order between QN topologies, permitting certain topological transformations while precluding others, offering discerning insights into the design and manipulation of higher-order network topologies in QNs.</p>

            <p>Quantum machine learning (QML) requires significant quantum resources to address practical real-world problems. When the underlying quantum information exhibits hierarchical structures in the data, limitations persist in training complexity and generalization. Research should prioritize both the efficient design of quantum architectures and the development of learning strategies to optimize resource usage. We propose a framework called quantum curriculum learning (Q-CurL) for quantum data, where the curriculum introduces simpler tasks or data to the learning model before progressing to more challenging ones. Q-CurL exhibits robustness to noise and data limitations, which is particularly relevant for current and near-term noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. We achieve this through a curriculum design based on quantum data density ratios and a dynamic learning schedule that prioritizes the most informative quantum data. Empirical evidence shows that Q-CurL significantly enhances training convergence and generalization for unitary learning and improves the robustness of quantum phase recognition tasks. Q-CurL is effective with broad physical learning applications in condensed matter physics and quantum chemistry.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonas Stein, Jonas Blenninger, David Bucher, Peter J. Eder, Elif Çetiner, Maximilian Zorn, Claudia Linnhoff-Popien</p>
            <p>The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a prominent quantum algorithm designed to find approximate solutions to combinatorial optimization problems, which are challenging for classical computers. In the current era, where quantum hardware is constrained by noise and limited qubit availability, simulating the QAOA remains essential for research. However, existing state-of-the-art simulation frameworks suffer from long execution times or lack comprehensive functionality, usability, and versatility, often requiring users to implement essential features themselves. Additionally, these frameworks are primarily restricted to Python, limiting their use in safer and faster languages like Rust, which offer, e.g., advanced parallelization capabilities. In this paper, we develop a GPU accelerated QAOA simulation framework utilizing the NVIDIA CUDA toolkit. This framework offers a complete interface for QAOA simulations, enabling the calculation of (exact) expectation values, direct access to the statevector, fast sampling, and high-performance optimization methods using an advanced state-of-the-art gradient calculation technique. The framework is designed for use in Python and Rust, providing flexibility for integration into a wide range of applications, including those requiring fast algorithm implementations leveraging QAOA at its core. The new framework's performance is rigorously benchmarked on the MaxCut problem and compared against the current state-of-the-art general-purpose quantum circuit simulation frameworks Qiskit and Pennylane as well as the specialized QAOA simulation tool QOKit. Our evaluation shows that our approach outperforms the existing state-of-the-art solutions in terms of runtime up to multiple orders of magnitude. Our implementation is publicly available at this https URL and Zenodo.</p>

            <h2>Characterizing the Multipartite Entanglement Structure of Non-Gaussian Continuous-Variable States with a Single Evolution Operator</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mingsheng Tian, Xiaoting Gao, Boxuan Jing, Feng-Xiao Sun, Matteo Fadel, Manuel Gessner, Qiongyi He</p>
            <p>Multipartite entanglement is an essential resource for quantum information tasks, but characterizing entanglement structures in continuous variable systems remains challenging, especially in multimode non-Gaussian scenarios. In this work, we introduce an efficient method for detecting multipartite entanglement structures in continuous-variable states. Based on the quantum Fisher information, we propose a systematic approach to identify an optimal encoding operator that can capture the quantum correlations in multimode non-Gaussian states. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on over $10^5$ randomly generated multimode-entangled quantum states, achieving a very high success rate in entanglement detection. Additionally, the robustness of our method can be considerably enhanced against losses by expanding the set of accessible operators. This work provides a general framework for characterizing entanglement structures in diverse continuous variable systems, enabling a number of experimentally relevant applications.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Calculus of Fibonacci Divisors and Fermion-Boson Entanglement for Infinite Hierarchy of N = 2 Supersymmetric Golden Oscillators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oktay K. Pashaev</p>
            <p>The quantum calculus with two bases, as powers of the Golden and the Silver ratio, relates Fibonacci divisor derivative with Binet formula of Fibonacci divisor number operator, acting in Fock space of quantum this http URL provides a tool to study the hierarchy of Golden oscillators with energy spectrum in form of Fibonacci divisor numbers. We generalize this model to supersymmetric number operator and corresponding Binet formula for supersymmetric Fibonacci divisor number operator. The operator determines the Hamiltonian of hierarchy of supersymmetric Golden oscillators, acting in fermion-boson Hilbert space and belonging to N=2 supersymmetric algebra. The eigenstates of the super Fibonacci divisor number operator are double degenerate and can be characterized by a point on the super-Bloch sphere. By the supersymmetric Fibonacci divisor annihilation operator, we construct the hierarchy of supersymmetric coherent states as eigenstates of this operator. Entanglement of fermions with bosons in these states is calculated by the concurrence, represented by the Gram determinant and hierarchy of Golden exponential functions. We show that the reference states and corresponding von Neumann entropy, measuring fermion-boson entanglement, are characterized completely by the powers of the Golden ratio. The simple geometrical classification of entangled states by the Frobenius ball and meaning of the concurrence as double area of parallelogram in Hilbert space are given.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anne Matthies, Nicolas Dannenfeld, Silvia Pappalardi, Achim Rosch</p>
            <p>We systematically investigate whether classical hydrodynamic field theories can predict the long-time dynamics of many-particle quantum systems. As an example, we investigate numerically and analytically the time evolution of a chain of spins (or qubits) subject to a stroboscopic dynamics. The time evolution is implemented by a sequence of local and nearest-neighbor gates which conserve the total magnetization. The long-time dynamics of such a system is believed to be describable by a hydrodynamics field theory, which, importantly, includes the effect of noise. Based on a field theoretical analysis and symmetry arguments, we map each operator in the spin model to corresponding fields in hydrodynamics. This allows us to predict which expectation values decay exponentially, and which of them decay with a hydrodynamics long-time tail. We illustrate these findings by studying the time evolution of all 255 Hermitian operators which can be defined on four neighboring sites. We show that all operators not protected by hydrodynamics decay exponentially and investigate a selected set of slowly decaying operators.</p>

            <h2>Quantum machine learning for multiclass classification beyond kernel methods</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chao Ding, Shi Wang, Yaonan Wang, Weibo Gao</p>
            <p>Quantum machine learning is considered one of the current research fields with immense potential. In recent years, Havlíček et al. [Nature 567, 209-212 (2019)] have proposed a quantum machine learning algorithm with quantum-enhanced feature spaces, which effectively addressed a binary classification problem on a superconducting processor and offered a potential pathway to achieving quantum advantage. However, a straightforward binary classification algorithm falls short in solving multiclass classification problems. In this paper, we propose a quantum algorithm that rigorously demonstrates that quantum kernel methods enhance the efficiency of multiclass classification in real-world applications, providing quantum advantage. To demonstrate quantum advantage, we design six distinct quantum kernels within the quantum algorithm to map input data into quantum state spaces and estimate the corresponding quantum kernel matrices. The results from quantum simulations reveal that the quantum algorithm outperforms its classical counterpart in handling six real-world multiclass classification problems. Furthermore, we leverage a variety of performance metrics to comprehensively evaluate the classification and generalization performance of the quantum algorithm. The results demonstrate that the quantum algorithm achieves superior classification and better generalization performance relative to classical counterparts.</p>

            <h2>Universal graph representation of stabilizer codes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrey Boris Khesin, Jonathan Z. Lu, Peter W. Shor</p>
            <p>We introduce a representation of $[[n, k]]$ stabilizer codes as semi-bipartite graphs wherein $k$ ``input'' nodes map to $n$ ``output'' nodes, such that output nodes may connect to each other but input nodes may not. We prove that this graph representation is in bijection with tableaus and give an efficient compilation algorithm that transforms tableaus into graphs. We then show that this map is efficiently invertible, which gives a new universal recipe for code construction by way of finding graphs with sufficiently nice properties. The graph representation gives insight into both code construction and algorithms. To the former, we argue that graphs provide a flexible platform for building codes particularly at smaller (non-asymptotic) scales. We construct as examples constant-size codes, e.g. a $[[54, 6, 5]]$ code and a family of roughly $[[n, \frac{n}{\log n}, \log n]]$ codes. We also leverage graphs in a probabilistic analysis to extend the quantum Gilbert-Varshamov bound into a three-way distance-rate-weight tradeoff. To the latter, we show that key coding algorithms -- distance approximation, weight reduction, and decoding -- are unified as instances of a single optimization game on a graph. Moreover, key code properties such as distance, weight, and encoding circuit depth, are all controlled by the graph degree. We give efficient algorithms for producing simple encoding circuits whose depths scale as twice the degree and for implementing logical diagonal and certain Clifford gates with non-constant but reduced depth. Finally, we construct a simple efficient decoding algorithm and prove a performance guarantee for a certain class of graphs, including the roughly $[[n, \frac{n}{\log n}, \log n]]$ code. These results give evidence that graphs are generically useful for the study of stabilizer codes and their practical implementations.</p>

            <h2>Ultimate precision limit of quantum thermal machines</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yoshihiko Hasegawa</p>
            <p>Enhancing the precision of a thermodynamic process inevitably necessitates a thermodynamic cost, a principle formulated as the thermodynamic uncertainty relation. The thermodynamic uncertainty relation states that the relative variance of thermodynamic currents, calculated as the variance divided by the squared mean, decreases as entropy production increases. This means that if entropy production were allowed to become infinitely large, the relative variance could approach zero. However, it is evident that realizing infinitely large entropy production is infeasible in reality. In this Letter, we establish the ultimate limits of precision for open quantum thermal machines operating within a finite-dimensional system and environment. We derive bounds on the relative variance and the expectation of observables, applicable to any unitary evolution of the composite system. These bounds are governed by the \textit{minimum eigenvalue factor}, which serves as a maximal entropy production attainable by the quantum dynamics and parallels the concept of dynamical activity in classical stochastic thermodynamic. Additionally, we investigate how quantum coherence in the initial environmental state affects these fundamental bounds, showing that the presence of coherence can actually improve the ultimate precision limits. Our findings provide insights into fundamental limits on the precision of quantum thermal machines and the role of quantum effects in thermodynamic processes.</p>

            <h2>Parastatistics and a secret communication challenge</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiyuan Wang</p>
            <p>One of the most unconventional features of topological phases of matter is the emergence of quasiparticles with exotic statistics, such as non-Abelian anyons in two dimensional systems. Recently, a different type of exotic particle statistics that is consistently defined in any dimension, called parastatistics, is also shown to be possible in a special family of topological phases. However, the physical significance of emergent parastatistics still remains elusive. Here we demonstrate a distinctive physical consequence of parastatistics by proposing a challenge game that can only be won using physical systems hosting paraparticles, as passing the challenge requires the two participating players to secretly communicate in an indirect way by exploiting the nontrivial exchange statistics of the quasiparticles. The winning strategy using emergent paraparticles is robust against noise, as well as the most relevant class of eavesdropping via local measurements. This provides both an operational definition and an experimental identity test for paraparticles, alongside a potential application in secret communication.</p>

            <p>Yttrium iron garnet (YIG) magnonics has garnered significant research interest because of the unique properties of magnons (quasiparticles of collective spin excitation) for signal processing. In particular, hybrid systems based on YIG magnonics show great promise for quantum information science due to their broad frequency tunability and strong compatibility with other platforms. However, their broad applications have been severely constrained by substantial microwave loss in the gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) substrate at cryogenic temperatures. In this study, we demonstrate that YIG thin films can be spalled from YIG/GGG samples. Our approach is validated by measuring hybrid devices comprising superconducting resonators and spalled YIG films, which exhibits anti-crossing features that indicate strong coupling between magnons and microwave photons. Such new capability of separating YIG thin films from GGG substrates via spalling, and the integrated superconductor-YIG devices represent a significant advancement for integrated magnonic devices, paving the way for advanced magnon-based coherent information processing.</p>

It is a new field that is providing important results about the possibility of detecting entanglement and testing Bell inequality at colliders for final states as diverse as top-quark, $\tau$-lepton pairs and $\Lambda$-baryons, massive gauge bosons and vector mesons. In this review, after presenting definitions, tools and basic results that are necessary for understanding these developments, we summarize the main findings -- as published by the beginning of year 2024 -- including analyses of experimental data in $B$ meson decays and top-quark pair production. We include a detailed discussion of the results for both qubit and qutrits systems, that is, final states containing spin one-half and spin one particles. Entanglement has also been proposed as a new tool to constrain new particles and fields beyond the Standard Model and we introduce the reader to this promising feature as well.</p>

            <p>Levitated ferromagnets act as ultraprecise magnetometers, which can exhibit high quality factors due to their excellent isolation from the environment. These instruments can be utilized in searches for ultralight dark matter candidates, such as axionlike dark matter or dark-photon dark matter. In addition to being sensitive to an axion-photon coupling or kinetic mixing, which produce physical magnetic fields, ferromagnets are also sensitive to the effective magnetic field (or "axion wind") produced by an axion-electron coupling. While the dynamics of a levitated ferromagnet in response to a DC magnetic field have been well studied, all of these couplings would produce AC fields. In this work, we study the response of a ferromagnet to an applied AC magnetic field and use these results to project their sensitivity to axion and dark-photon dark matter. We pay special attention to the direction of motion induced by an applied AC field, in particular, whether it precesses around the applied field (similar to an electron spin) or librates in the plane of the field (similar to a compass needle). We show that existing levitated ferromagnet setups can already have comparable sensitivity to an axion-electron coupling as comagnetometer or torsion balance experiments. In addition, future setups can become sensitive probes of axion-electron coupling, dark-photon kinetic mixing, and axion-photon coupling, for ultralight dark matter masses $m_\mathrm{DM}\lesssim\mathrm{feV}$.</p>

            <p>Quantum scars correspond to enhanced probability densities along unstable classical periodic orbits. In recent years, research on quantum scars has extended to various systems including the many-body regime. In this work we focus on the formation, prevalence, and stability of linear "bouncing-ball" (BB) scars in two-dimensional (2D) quantum wells. These scars have relevance as effective and controllable channels in quantum transport. We utilize imaginary time propagation to solve the 2D Schrödinger equation within an arbitrary external confining potential, specifically the quantum well model with external perturbations. We show how BB scars begin to emerge with a single perturbative peak, such as a repulsive bump or attractive dip that simulates the effect of a charged nanotip in the system. We then identify the optimal size of the perturbative peak to maximize the prevalence of these scars. Finally, we investigate the stability of BB scars against external noise and find that some of them are remarkably robust. This suggests promising opportunities for further applications of BB scars in quantum transport.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yalun Zhang, Longwen Zhou</p>
            <p>Non-Hermitian phenomena, such as exceptional points, non-Hermitian skin effects, and topologically nontrivial phases, have attracted continued attention. In this work, we reveal how interactions and nonreciprocal hopping could collectively influence the behavior of two interacting bosons on quasiperiodic lattices. Focusing on the Bose-Hubbard model with Aubry-André-Harper quasiperiodic modulations and hopping asymmetry, we discover that the interaction could enlarge the localization transition point of the noninteracting system into a critical phase, in which localized doublons formed by bosonic pairs can coexist with delocalized states. Under the open boundary condition, the bosonic doublons could further show non-Hermitian skin effects, realizing doublon condensation at the edges, and their direction of skin-localization can be flexibly tuned by the hopping parameters. A framework is developed to characterize the spectral, localization, and topological transitions accompanying these phenomena. Our work advances the understanding of localization and topological phases in non-Hermitian systems, particularly in relation to multiparticle interactions.</p>

            <h2>Resolving the Quantum Measurement Problem through Leveraging the Uncertainty Principle</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kyoung Yeon Kim</p>
            <p>The Schrodinger equation is incomplete, inherently unable to explain the collapse of the wavefunction caused by measurement; a fundamental issue known as the quantum measurement problem. Quantum mechanics is generally constrained by the uncertainty principle and, therefore, cannot interpret definite observations without uncertainty. Here, we resolve this enigma by demonstrating that in phase space quantum mechanics, particularly through the Wigner Moyal equation, uncertainty can be arbitrarily adjusted by tuning the observation window. An observation window much smaller than the uncertainty limit causes substantial nonlocality, rendering the problem ill posed. This suggests that only with sufficient uncertainty does nonlocality become bounded, resulting in a well posed universe. Conversely, in the absence of uncertainty, spacetime is warped beyond recognition, and the system exists as a superposition of numerous possible states. Measurement collapses this superposition into a unique solution, exhibiting timeless nonlocal interactions. Our framework bridges seemingly disparate concepts such as classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, decoherence, and measurement within intrinsic quantum mechanics even without invoking new theory.</p>

We comprehensively characterize the noiselessly amplified coherent states via quantum state tomography and analyze the amplification gain and noise properties of the amplifier. We observe very good agreement between the experiment and theoretical predictions. Our work reveals that sequences of multiple photon additions and subtractions represent an efficient and experimentally feasible alternative to multiplexing that was originally proposed to boost the performance of noiseless quantum amplifiers. Beyond noiseless quantum amplification, our experiment represents a significant step forward towards engineering complex quantum operations on traveling light beams by coherent combinations of various sequences of multiphoton additions and subtractions.</p>

            <p>Ultracold trapped atomic ions excited into highly energetic Rydberg states constitute a promising platform for scalable quantum information processing. Elementary building blocks for such tasks are high-fidelity and sufficiently fast entangling two-qubit gates, which can be achieved via strong dipole-dipole interactions between microwave-dressed Rydberg ions, as recently demonstrated in a breakthrough experiment $[\href{this https URL}{1}]$. We theoretically investigate the performance of three protocols leading to controlled-phase gate operations. Starting from a microscopic description of Rydberg ions in a linear Paul trap, we derive an effective Hamiltonian that faithfully captures the essential dynamics underlying the gate protocols. We then use an optimization scheme to fine-tune experimentally controllable parameters like laser detuning and Rabi frequency to yield maximal gate fidelity under each studied protocol. We show how non-adiabatic transitions resulting from fast laser driving relative to the characteristic time scales of the system detrimentally affect the fidelity. Despite this, we demonstrate that in the realistic scenario of Rydberg ions with finite radiative lifetimes, optimizing the best found gate protocol enables achievement of fidelities as high as $99.25\,\%$ for a gate time of $0.2\,\mu\mathrm{s}$. This considerably undercuts entangling gate durations between ground-state ions, for which gate times are typically limited by the comparably slower time scales of vibrational modes. Overall, this places trapped Rydberg ions into the regime where fast high-accuracy quantum computing and eventually quantum error correction become possible.</p>

            <p>Quantum-selected configuration interaction (QSCI) utilizes an input quantum state on a quantum device to select important bases (electron configurations in quantum chemistry) which define a subspace where we diagonalize a target Hamiltonian, i.e., perform selected configuration interaction, on classical computers. Previous proposals for preparing a good input state, which is crucial for the quality of QSCI, based on optimization of quantum circuits may suffer from optimization difficulty and require many runs of the quantum device. Here we propose using a time-evolved state by the target Hamiltonian (for some initial state) as an input of QSCI. Our proposal is based on the intuition that the time evolution by the Hamiltonian creates electron excitations of various orders when applied to the initial state. We numerically investigate the accuracy of the energy obtained by the proposed method for quantum chemistry Hamiltonians describing electronic states of small molecules. Numerical results reveal that our method can yield sufficiently accurate ground-state energies for the investigated molecules. Our proposal provides a systematic and optimization-free method to prepare the input state of QSCI and could contribute to practical applications of quantum computers to quantum chemistry calculations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mathis Cohen, Laurent Labonté, Romain Dalidet, Sébastien Tanzilli, Anthony Martin</p>
            <p>The interference between two independent photons stands as a crucial aspect of numerous quantum information protocols and technologies. In this work, we leverage fiber-coupled devices, which encompass fibered photon pair-sources and off-the-shelf optics, to demonstrate Hong-Ou-Mandel interference. We employ two distinct single photon sources, namely an heralded single-photon source and a weak coherent laser source, both operating asynchronously in continuous-wave regime. We record two-photon coincidences, showing a state-of-art visibility of 91.9(5)\%. This work, compliant with telecom technology provides realistic backbones for establishing long-range communication based on quantum teleportation in hybrid quantum networks.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Optimization for Energy Management: A Coherent Variational Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Farshad Amani, Amin Kargarian</p>
            <p>This paper presents a quantum-enhanced optimization approach for solving optimal power flow (OPF) by integrating the interior point method (IPM) with a coherent variational quantum linear solver (CVQLS). The objective is to explore the applicability of quantum computing to power systems optimization and address the associated challenges. A comparative analysis of state-of-the-art quantum linear solvers - Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL), variational quantum linear solver (VQLS), and CVQLS - revealed that CVQLS is most suitable for OPF due to its stability with ill-conditioned matrices, such as the Hessian in IPM. To ensure high-quality solutions, prevent suboptimal convergence, and avoid the barren plateau problem, we propose a quantum circuit parameter initialization technique along with a method to guide the IPM along the central path. Moreover, we design an ansatz tailored for OPF, optimizing the expressibility and trainability of the quantum circuit to ensure efficient convergence and robustness in solving quantum OPF. Various optimizers are also tested for quantum circuit parameter optimization, and based on the comparative analysis, the best optimizer is selected. We evaluate our approaches on IEEE 3-, 5-, 118-, and 300-bus systems, demonstrating their effectiveness in providing reliable OPF solutions. Our resource comparison between the power flow and OPF matrices on quantum hardware highlights that OPF needs considerably more resources, making its implementation significantly more challenging than in previous studies. Although promising, the application of CVQLS is currently constrained by the limitations of existing quantum hardware, especially for larger power systems. To address this, we use a quantum noise simulator for testing on larger systems.</p>

            <h2>Hyperbolic Quantum Processor</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Evgenii E. Narimanov, Eugene A. Demler</p>
            <p>Achieving strong coherent interaction between qubits separated by large distances holds the key to many important developments in quantum technology, including new designs of quantum computers, new platforms for quantum simulations and implementation of large scale quantum optical networks. However, the inherent mismatch between the spatial dimensions of a quantum emitter and the photon wavelength fundamentally limits the transmission of quantum entanglement over long distances. Here we demonstrate, that long-range qubit entanglement can be readily achieved when qubit interactions are mediated by optical polariton waves in a hyperbolic material, due to the phenomenon of the Hyperbolic Super-Resonance. We show that in this regime the resulting quantum gate fidelity that exceeds 99%, can be achieved with the use of qubits based on well known deep donors in silicon when their interactions are mediated by polariton fields in the substrate formed by a hyperbolic material (such as e.g. hexagonal boron nitride. At the physical level the proposed system is essentially a silicon-based optoelectronic chip, and it's readily accessible to the existing methods of semiconductor nanofabrication, leading to the integration densities of well over 10^8. qubits/cm^2, and therefore opening the way to scalable and fault-tolerant error correction in quantum computation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, due to the optical time scales that define the duration of the gate operation in the proposed system, and sub-nanosecond time of the decoherence in deep donors in silicon at the liquid nitrogen temperatures, the proposed Hyperbolic Quantum Processor does not require dilution refrigeration and therefore offers a pathway to bring quantum computation to the realm of conventional engineering.</p>

            <p>High quality mechanical resonators are critical for driving advances in quantum information technologies, precision sensing, and optomechanics. However, achieving compact resonator designs that maintain high performance is a key challenge. In this study, we present a new class of compact resonators optimized to operate at higher-order eigenmodes, achieving both high frequencies and enhanced quality factor-frequency (Qf) products. By employing topology optimization to maximize the damping dilution factor, these resonators achieve minimized edge bending losses and enhanced intrinsic damping. Their high-(Qf) performance and compact form factor position these resonators as promising candidates for applications in quantum information transduction, advanced optomechanical systems, and next-generation sensing technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amir Hossein Houshmand Almani, Ali Mortezapour, Alireza Nourmandipour</p>
            <p>In this paper, we delve into the issue of Quantum Synchronization in a driven two-level (qubit) system situated within a structured environment. Our findings have practical implications as we discover that adding a time-dependent periodic modulation to the transition frequency of the qubit can significantly enhance quantum synchronization. We first discovered the phase preference and, consequently, the phase locking conditions in our system using the Husimi Q-function. It is revealed that combining frequency modulation and non-Markovian effects enables us to achieve a stable phase-locking for the system. We show that tuning the amplitude-tofrequency ratio of the modulation process on the zeros of the zeroth-order Bessel function led to phase locking and, thus, surprisingly enhances quantum synchronization in the system. These results provide new insights into efficiently understanding phase dynamics in quantum environments.</p>

            <p>Exploiting quantum effects of mechanical motion, such as backaction evading measurements or squeezing, requires preparation of the oscillator in a high-purity state. The largest state purities in optomechanics to date have relied on cryogenic cooling, combined with coupling to electromagnetic resonators driven with a coherent radiation field. In this work, we cool the mega-hertz-frequency librational mode of an optically levitated silica nanoparticle from room temperature to its quantum ground state. Cooling is realized by coherent scattering into a Fabry-Perot cavity. We use sideband thermometry to infer a phonon population of 0.04 quanta under optimal conditions, corresponding to a state purity of 92%. The purity reached by our room-temperature experiment exceeds the performance offered by mechanically clamped oscillators in a cryogenic environment. Our work establishes a platform for high-purity quantum optomechanics at room temperature.</p>

            <p>Symmetry-resolved entanglement, capturing the refined structure of quantum entanglement in systems with global symmetries, has attracted a lot of attention recently. In this manuscript, introducing the notion of symmetry-resolved generalized entropies, we aim to develop a computational framework suitable for the study of excited state symmetry-resolved entanglement as well as the dynamical evolution of symmetry-resolved entanglement in symmetry-preserving out-of-equilibrium settings. We illustrate our framework using the example of (1+1)-d free massless compact boson theory, and benchmark our results using lattice computation in the XX chain. As a byproduct, our computational framework also provides access to the probability distribution of the symmetry charge contained within a subsystem and the corresponding full counting statistics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sudhanshu Shekhar, Bhabani Prasad Mandal, Anirban Dutta</p>
            <p>In this article, we employ the transfer matrix method to investigate relativistic particles in super-periodic potentials (SPPs) of arbitrary order $n \in I^{+}$. We calculate the reflection and transmission probabilities for spinless Klein particles encountering rectangular potential barriers with super-periodic repetition. It is found that spinless relativistic particles exhibit Klein tunneling and a significantly higher degree of reflection compared to their non-relativistic counterparts. Additionally, we analytically explore the behavior of experimentally realizable massless Dirac electrons as they encounter rectangular potential barriers with a super-periodic pattern in a monolayer of graphene. In this system, the transmission probability, conductance, and Fano factor are evaluated as functions of the number of barriers, the order of super-periodicity, and the angle of incidence. Our findings reveal that the transmission probability shows a series of resonances that depend on the number of barriers and the order of super-periodicity. We extend our analysis to specific cases within the Unified Cantor Potentials (UCPs)-$\gamma$ system ($\gamma$ is a scaling parameter greater than $1$), focusing on the General Cantor fractal system and the General Smith-Volterra-Cantor (GSVC) system. For the General Cantor fractal system, we calculate the tunneling probability, which reveals sharp transmission peaks and progressively thinner unit cell potentials as $G$ increases. In the GSVC system, we analyze the potential segment length and tunneling probability, observing nearly unity tunneling coefficients when $\gamma \approx 1$, as well as saturation behavior in transmission coefficients at higher stages $G$.</p>

            <h2>Generalized Clausius inequalities and entanglement production in holographic two-dimensional CFTs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tanay Kibe, Ayan Mukhopadhyay, Pratik Roy</p>
            <p>Utilizing quantum information theory, it has been shown that irreversible entropy production is bounded from both below and above in physical processes. Both these bounds are positive and generalize the Clausius inequality. Such bounds are, however, obtained from distance measures in the space of states, which are hard to define and compute in quantum field theories. We show that the quantum null energy condition (QNEC) can be utilized to obtain both lower and upper bounds on irreversible entropy production for quenches leading to transitions between thermal states carrying uniform momentum density in two dimensional holographic conformal field theories. We achieve this by refining earlier methods and developing an algebraic procedure for determining HRT surfaces in arbitrary Bañados-Vaidya geometries which are dual to quenches involving transitions between general quantum equilibrium states (e.g. thermal states) where the QNEC is saturated. We also discuss results for the growth and thermalization of entanglement entropy for arbitrary initial and final temperatures and momentum densities. The rate of quadratic growth of entanglement just after the quench depends only on the change in the energy density and is independent of the entangling length. For sufficiently large entangling lengths, the entanglement tsunami phenomenon can be established. Finally, we study recovery of the initial state from the evolving entanglement entropy and argue that the Renyi entropies should give us a refined understanding of scrambling of quantum information.</p>

Exploring such uncertainty relations in pre- and postselected (PPS) systems, where weak measurements on post-selected states have been used as a powerful tool for exploring the foundation of quantum mechanics, has so far eluded experimental effort. In this work, we experimentally investigate the Robertson-Heisenberg-type uncertainty relation for two incompatible observables in a PPS system. Through conducting a von Neumann-type measurement, uncertainty relations between two non-commuting Pauli observables are experimentally unveiled. Such uncertainty relations in the PPS system impose limitations on the joint sharp preparation of pre- and postselected states for two incompatible observables. Our experiments would be useful for the development of amplification techniques for precision measurements.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Srijita Kundu, Ernest Y.-Z. Tan</p>
            <p>Uncloneable encryption, first introduced by Broadbent and Lord (TQC 2020) is a quantum encryption scheme in which a quantum ciphertext cannot be distributed between two non-communicating parties such that, given access to the decryption key, both parties cannot learn the underlying plaintext. In this work, we introduce a variant of uncloneable encryption in which several possible decryption keys can decrypt a particular encryption, and the security requirement is that two parties who receive independently generated decryption keys cannot both learn the underlying ciphertext. We show that this variant of uncloneable encryption can be achieved device-independently, i.e., without trusting the quantum states and measurements used in the scheme, and that this variant works just as well as the original definition in constructing quantum money. Moreover, we show that a simple modification of our scheme yields a single-decryptor encryption scheme, which was a related notion introduced by Georgiou and Zhandry. In particular, the resulting single-decryptor encryption scheme achieves device-independent security with respect to a standard definition of security against random plaintexts. Finally, we derive an "extractor" result for a two-adversary scenario, which in particular yields a single-decryptor encryption scheme for single bit-messages that achieves perfect anti-piracy security without needing the quantum random oracle model.</p>

            <p>Open microcavities offer great potential for the exploration and utilization of efficient spin-photon interfaces with Purcell-enhanced quantum emitters thanks to their large spectral and spatial tunability combined with high versatility of sample integration. However, a major challenge for this platform is the sensitivity to cavity length fluctuations in the cryogenic environment, which leads to cavity resonance frequency variations and thereby a lowered averaged Purcell enhancement. This work presents a closed-cycle cryogenic fiber-based microcavity setup, which is in particular designed for a low passive vibration level, while still providing large tunability and flexibility in fiber and sample integration, and high photon collection efficiency from the cavity mode. At temperatures below 10 Kelvin, a stability level of around 25 picometer is reproducibly achieved in different setup configurations, including the extension with microwave control for manipulating the spin of cavity-coupled quantum emitters, enabling a bright photonic interface with optically active qubits.</p>

            <h2>Bath Dynamical Decoupling with a Quantum Channel</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander Hahn, Kazuya Yuasa, Daniel Burgarth</p>
            <p>Bang-bang dynamical decoupling protects an open quantum system from decoherence due to its interaction with the surrounding bath/environment. In its standard form, this is achieved by strongly kicking the system with cycles of unitary operations, which average out the interaction Hamiltonian. In this paper, we generalize the notion of dynamical decoupling to repeated kicks with a quantum channel, which is applied to the bath. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions on the employed quantum channel and find that bath dynamical decoupling works if and only if the kick is ergodic. Furthermore, we study in which circumstances CPTP kicks on a mono-partite quantum system induce quantum Zeno dynamics with its Hamiltonian cancelled out. This does not require the ergodicity of the kicks, and the absence of decoherence-free subsystems is both necessary and sufficient. While the standard unitary dynamical decoupling is essentially the same as the quantum Zeno dynamics, our investigation implies that this is not true any more in the case of CPTP kicks. To derive our results, we prove some spectral properties of ergodic quantum channels, that might be of independent interest. Our approach establishes an enhanced and unified mathematical understanding of several recent experimental demonstrations and might form the basis of new dynamical decoupling schemes that harness environmental noise degrees of freedom.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vaisakh Mannalath, Víctor Zapatero, Marcos Curty</p>
            <p>The performance of quantum key distribution (QKD) heavily depends on statistical inference. For a broad class of protocols, the central statistical task is a random sampling problem, customarily addressed using exponential tail bounds on the hypergeometric distribution. Here we devise a strikingly simple exponential bound for this task, of unprecedented tightness among QKD security analyses. As a by-product, confidence intervals for the average of non-identical Bernoulli parameters follow too. These naturally fit in statistical analyses of decoy-state QKD and also outperform standard tools. Lastly, we show that, in a vast parameter regime, the use of tail bounds is not enforced because the cumulative mass function of the hypergeometric distribution is accurately computable. This sharply decreases the minimum block sizes necessary for QKD, and reveals the tightness of our simple analytical bounds when moderate-to-large blocks are considered.</p>

            <p>We investigate the tomography of unknown unitary quantum processes within the framework of a finite-dimensional Wigner-type representation. This representation provides a rich visualization of quantum operators by depicting them as shapes assembled as a linear combination of spherical harmonics. These shapes can be experimentally tomographed using a scanning-based phase-space tomography approach. However, so far, this approach was limited to $\textit{known}$ target processes and only provided information about the controlled version of the process rather than the process itself. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a general protocol to extend Wigner tomography to $\textit{unknown}$ unitary processes. This new method enables experimental tomography by combining a set of experiments with classical post-processing algorithms introduced herein to reconstruct the unknown process. We also demonstrate the tomography approach experimentally on IBM quantum devices and present the specific calibration circuits required for quantifying undesired errors in the measurement outcomes of these demonstrations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Younghun Kim, Martin Sevior, Muhammad Usman</p>
            <p>The surface code family is a promising approach to implementing fault-tolerant quantum computations. Universal fault-tolerance requires error-corrected non-Clifford operations, in addition to Clifford gates, and for the former, it is imperative to experimentally demonstrate additional resources known as magic states. Another challenge is to efficiently embed surface codes into quantum hardware with connectivity constraints. This work simultaneously addresses both challenges by employing a qubit-efficient rotated heavy-hexagonal surface code for IBM quantum processors (\texttt{ibm\_fez}) and implementing the magic state injection protocol. Our work reports error thresholds for both logical bit- and phase-flip errors, of $\approx0.37\%$ and $\approx0.31\%$, respectively, which are higher than the threshold values previously reported with traditional embedding. The post-selection-based preparation of logical magic states $|H_L\rangle$ and $|T_L\rangle$ achieve fidelities of $0.8806\pm0.0002$ and $0.8665\pm0.0003$, respectively, which are both above the magic state distillation threshold. Additionally, we report the minimum fidelity among injected arbitrary single logical qubit states as $0.8356\pm0.0003$. Our work demonstrates the potential for realising non-Clifford logical gates by producing high-fidelity logical magic states on IBM quantum devices.</p>

            <p>The conversion of thermal energy into work is usually more efficient in the slow-driving regime, where the power output is vanishingly small. Efficient work extraction for fast driving protocols remains an outstanding challenge at the nanoscale, where fluctuations play a significant role. In this Letter, we use a quantum-dot Szilard engine to extract work from thermal fluctuations with maximum efficiency over two decades of driving speed. We design and implement a family of optimised protocols ranging from the slow- to the fast-driving regime, and measure the engine's efficiency as well as the mean and variance of its power output in each case. These optimised protocols exhibit significant improvements in power and efficiency compared to the naive approach. Our results also show that, when optimising for efficiency, boosting the power output of a Szilard engine inevitably comes at the cost of increased power fluctuations.</p>

            <p>While it has become widely appreciated that defining (higher) gauge theories requires, in addition to ordinary phase space data, also "flux quantization" laws in generalized differential cohomology, there has been little discussion of the general rules, if any, for lifting Poisson-brackets of (flux-)observables and their quantization from traditional phase spaces to the resulting higher moduli stacks of flux-quantized gauge fields. In this short note, we present a systematic analysis of (i) the canonical quantization of flux observables in Yang-Mills theory and (ii) of valid flux quantization laws in abelian Yang-Mills, observing (iii) that the resulting topological quantum observables form the homology Pontrjagin algebra of the loop space of the moduli space of flux-quantized gauge fields. This is remarkable because the homology Ponrjagin algebra on loops of moduli makes immediate sense in broad generality for higher and non-abelian (non-linearly coupled) gauge fields, such as for the C-field in 11d supergravity, where it recovers the quantum effects previously discussed in the context of "Hypothesis H".</p>

The generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ) approach uses the integration of the Berry connection over the GBZ contour in the complex wavevector space. An alternate `pole-zero' approach uses algebraic properties of the off-diagonal matrix elements of the sublattice-symmetric Hamiltonian in off-diagonal form. Both correctly predict the presence or absence of edge states, but there has not been an explicit proof of their equivalence. Here we provide such an explicit proof and moreover we extend the pole-zero approach so that it also applies for sublattice-symmetric models when the Hamiltonian is not in off-diagonal form.

We find combinatorial bases for the eigenspaces of the transtion matrix, and derive a formula for the average vertex mixing matrix $\AMM$. We then find bounds for entries in $\AMM$, and study when these bounds are tight. In particular, the average probabilities between marked vertices are lower bounded by a matrix determined by the induced subgraph $X[S]$, the vertex-deleted subgraph $X\backslash S$, and the edge deleted subgraph $X-E(S)$. We show this bound is achieved if and only if the marked vertices have walk-equitable neighborhoods in the vertex-deleted subgraph. Finally, for quantum walks attaining this bound, we determine when $\AMM[S,S]$ is symmetric, positive semidefinite or uniform.</p>

Remarkably, the ghost-free holographic models impose a universal lower bound of the Casimir effect. We verify the holographic bound by free theories, Ising model, and $O(N)$ model with $N=2,3$ at critical points. Remarkably, the holographic bound is also obeyed by a general class of quantum field theories without conformal symmetries. It is interesting to find a field-theoretical proof or counterexample for the holographic bound of Casimir effect.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Dechant, Liubov Markovich, Vedran Dunjko, Jordi Tura</p>
            <p>A focus of recent research in quantum computing has been on developing quantum algorithms for differential equations solving using variational methods on near-term quantum devices. A promising approach involves variational algorithms, which combine classical Runge-Kutta methods with quantum computations. However, a rigorous error analysis, essential for assessing real-world feasibility, has so far been lacking. In this paper, we provide an extensive analysis of error sources and determine the resource requirements needed to achieve specific target errors. In particular, we derive analytical error and resource estimates for scenarios with and without shot noise, examining shot noise in quantum measurements and truncation errors in Runge-Kutta methods. Our analysis does not take into account representation errors and hardware noise, as these are specific to the instance and the used device. We evaluate the implications of our results by applying them to two scenarios: classically solving a $1$D ordinary differential equation and solving an option pricing linear partial differential equation with the variational algorithm, showing that the most resource-efficient methods are of order 4 and 2, respectively. This work provides a framework for optimizing quantum resources when applying Runge-Kutta methods, enhancing their efficiency and accuracy in both solving differential equations and simulating quantum systems. Further, this work plays a crucial role in assessing the suitability of these variational algorithms for fault-tolerant quantum computing. The results may also be of interest to the numerical analysis community as they involve the accumulation of errors in the function description, a topic that has hardly been explored even in the context of classical differential equation solvers.</p>

            <h2>Coherent information as a mixed-state topological order parameter of fermions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ze-Min Huang, Luis Colmenarez, Markus Müller, Sebastian Diehl</p>
            <p>Quantum error correction protects quantum information against decoherence provided the noise strength remains below a critical threshold. This threshold marks the critical point for the decoding phase transition. Here we connect this transition in the toric code to a topological phase transition in disordered Majorana fermions at high temperatures. A quantum memory in the error correctable phase is captured by the presence of a Majorana zero mode, trapped in vortex defects associated with twisted boundary conditions. These results are established by expressing the coherent information, which measures the amount of recoverable quantum information in a given noisy code, in terms of a mixed-state topological order parameter of fermions. Our work hints at a broader connection of the robustness of quantum information in stabilizer codes and mixed-state topological phase transitions in symmetry protected fermion matter.</p>

            <h2>Selective and noise-resilient wave estimation with quantum sensor networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arne Hamann, Paul Aigner, Pavel Sekatski, Wolfgang Dür</p>
            <p>We consider the selective sensing of planar waves in the presence of noise. We present different methods to control the sensitivity of a quantum sensor network, which allow one to decouple it from arbitrarily selected waves while retaining sensitivity to the signal. Comparing these methods with classical (non-entangled) sensor networks we demonstrate two advantages. First, entanglement increases precision by enabling the Heisenberg scaling. Second, entanglement enables the elimination of correlated noise processes corresponding to waves with different propagation directions, by exploiting decoherence-free subspaces. We then provide a theoretical and numerical analysis of the advantage offered by entangled quantum sensor networks, which is not specific to waves and can be of general interest. We demonstrate an exponential advantage in the regime where the number of sensor locations is comparable to the number of noise sources. Finally, we outline a generalization to other waveforms, e.g., spherical harmonics and general time-dependent fields.</p>

            <p>The efficient detection of light from trapped ions in free space is paramount for most of their applications. We propose a scheme to enhance the photon collection from linear ion strings. It employs the constructive interference of light scattered from ions along the axial direction in linear Paul traps. The coherent enhancement of photon collection is numerically optimized for a range of feasible spatial angles and realistic ion positions in a single harmonic Coulomb potential. Despite the large mutual distance of scatterers on the order of many wavelengths of scattered light, presented experimental tests confirm the feasibility of enhancements by a factor of $3.05 \pm 0.09$ with a crystal of nine $^{40}$Ca$^+$ ions. Further significant improvements using different ion species, which allow for suppression of the sensitivity to the residual thermal motion, are predicted. The proposed collection geometry is intrinsic to diverse linear ion trap designs and the methodology can be directly applied to an observation of scattering from ion crystals prepared in collective electronic excitations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Manas Sajjan, Vinit Singh, Sabre Kais</p>
            <p>Neural-network quantum states (NQS) offer a versatile and expressive alternative to traditional variational ansätze for simulating physical systems. Energy-based frameworks, like Hopfield networks and Restricted Boltzmann Machines, leverage statistical physics to map quantum states onto an energy landscape, functioning as memory descriptors. Here, we show that such models can be efficiently trained using Monte Carlo techniques enhanced by quantum devices. Our algorithm scales linearly with circuit width and depth, requires constant measurements, avoids mid-circuit measurements, and is polynomial in storage, ensuring optimal efficiency. It applies to both phase and amplitude fields, significantly expanding the trial space compared to prior methods. Quantum-assisted sampling accelerates Markov Chain convergence and improves sample fidelity, offering advantages over classical approaches. We validate our method by accurately learning ground states of local spin models and non-local electronic structure Hamiltonians, even in distorted molecular geometries with strong multi-reference correlations. Benchmark comparisons show robust agreement with traditional methods. This work highlights the potential of combining machine learning protocols with near-term quantum devices for quantum state learning, with promising applications in theoretical chemistry and condensed matter physics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> C. D. Rodriguez-Camargo, H. O. Gestsson, C. Nation, A. R. Jones, A. Olaya-Castro</p>
            <p>Using second-order perturbation theory in the light-matter interaction, we derive an analytical approximation for the vibronic populations of a diatomic system excited by ultrabroadband frequency entangled photons and evaluate the population dynamics for different degrees of entanglement between photon pairs. Our analytical approach make the same predictions as previously derived via numerical solutions of the complete Schrödinger equation [H. Oka, Physical Review A 97, 063859 (2018)], with the added advantage of providing clear physical insights into the vibronic selectivity as a function of the degree of photon correlations while requiring significantly reduced computational effort. Specifically, our analytical expression for the probability of vibronic excitation includes a factor which predicts the enhancement of vibrational selectivity as a function of the degree correlation between the entangled photon pairs, the targeted vibrational energy level, and the vibrational molecular structure encoded in the Franck-Condon factors. Our results illustrate the importance of going beyond the usual approximations in second-order perturbation theory to capture the relevance of the vibrational structure of the molecular system of interest in order to gain a deeper understanding of the possible quantum-enhancement provided by the interaction between quantum light and matter.</p>

            <p>Complete characterization of a multimode optical process has paved the way for understanding complex optical phenomena, leading to the development of novel optical technologies. Until now, however, characterizations have mainly focused on a linear-optical process, despite the plethora of multimode nonlinear-optical processes crucial for photonic technologies. Here we report the experimental characterization of multimode nonlinear-optical quantum processes by obtaining the full information needed to describe them while satisfying the necessary physical condition. Specifically, to characterize a second-order nonlinear-optical process of parametric downconversion, we determine the amplification and noise matrices of multimode field quadratures. The full information allows us to factorize the multimode process, leading to the identification of eigenquadratures and their associated amplification and noise properties. Moreover, we demonstrate the broad applicability of our method by characterizing various nonlinear-optical quantum processes, including cluster state generation, mode-dependent loss with nonlinear interaction, and a quantum noise channel. Our method, by providing a versatile technique for characterizing a nonlinear-optical process, will be beneficial for developing scalable photonic technologies.</p>

            <h2>Fully quantum stochastic entropy production</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ge Bai, Francesco Buscemi, Valerio Scarani</p>
            <p>Building on the approach of stochastic thermodynamics, we define entropy production for arbitrary quantum processes, using Bayesian tools to capture the inherent subjective element. First, we show that the classical expression for average entropy production involves only comparisons of statistics at the input or output, and thus can be formally generalized by replacing probability distributions by quantum states. To go beyond the mere average, we construct an entropy production operator, that generalizes the value of entropy to the non-commutative case. The operator is Hermitian; its average is non-negative, so that the Second Law takes its usual form $\langle\Sigma\rangle\geq 0$; it formally satisfies the Jarzynski equality; and recovers the classical expression for classical processes. We also present features whose fully quantum version is not a straightforward translation of the classical one: these may point to the core difference between classical and quantum thermodynamics.</p>

            <p>The capability to measure the state of a quantum system is vital to a practical quantum network, for applications including distributed quantum computing and long-distance quantum communication. As a thriving platform for quantum information technology, single neutral atoms suffer from low achievable photon scattering rate and shallow trapping potential, which limits the fidelity and speed of state readout process. Here, by coupling an single neutral atom with a high-finesse fiber-based Fabry-Pérot microcavity (FFPC) in Purcell regime, we realize strong enhancement of the atomic photoemission rate, which enables ultrafast and high-fidelity discrimination of bright and dark hyperfine states of the atom. The readout fidelity can reach 99.1(2)% within 200 ns and 99.985(8)% within 9 $\mu$s. Furthermore, we demonstrate that state preparation via optical pumping can be efficiently accelerated by real-time decision protocol based on ultrafast state readout.

            <p>Photonics represents one of the most promising approaches to large-scale quantum computation with millions of qubits and billions of gates, owing to the potential for room-temperature operation, high clock speeds, miniaturization of photonic circuits, and repeatable fabrication processes in commercial photonic foundries. We present an end-to-end architecture for fault-tolerant continuous variable (CV) quantum computation using only passive on-chip components that can produce photonic qubits above the fault tolerance threshold with probabilities above 90%, and encodes logical qubits using physical qubits sampled from a distribution around the fault tolerance threshold. By requiring only low photon number resolution, the architecture enables the use of high-bandwidth photodetectors in CV quantum computing. Simulations of our qubit generation and logical encoding processes show a Gaussian cluster squeezing threshold of 12 dB to 13 dB. Additionally, we present a novel magic state generation protocol which requires only 13 dB of cluster squeezing to produce magic states with an order of magnitude higher probability than existing approaches, opening up the path to universal fault-tolerant quantum computation at less than 13 dB of cluster squeezing.</p>

Our findings show that the statistics retrieved from a single Gaussian quantum trajectory exhibits emergent thermal equilibrium governed by an Ising Hamiltonian, encoded in the dissipative coupling between modes. The system's effective temperature is set by the driving strength relative to the oscillation threshold.

            <p>Phononic crystals are a promising platform for the study of quantum acoustodynamics. In a recent experiment, the interaction of a superconducting quantum bit with modes of a phononic crystal has been demonstrated. The field of these modes is localized in a compact area, providing high values of the coupling constant with the qubit. However, the Q-factor of phononic crystal modes is strongly limited (1050) due to a phonon emission from the crystal ends. For further use of phononic crystals in research in the field of quantum acoustodynamics, it is desirable to overcome this limitation in the quality factor. In this work, we have proposed a structure consisting of a phononic crystal placed between the Bragg mirrors. Our simulations predict that the Q-factor in such a structure can reach (100000). We demonstrate experimental results in which this structure has a Q-factor (60,000), which is 60 times higher than that of an acoustic crystal of the same size.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akihiko Sekine, Ryo Murakami, Yoshiyasu Doi</p>
            <p>The quantum transduction, or equivalently quantum frequency conversion, between microwave and optical photons is essential for realizing scalable quantum computers with superconducting qubits. Due to the large frequency difference between microwave and optical ranges, the transduction needs to be done via intermediate bosonic modes or nonlinear processes. Regarding the transduction mediated by magnons, previous studies have so far utilized ferromagnetic magnons in ferromagnets. Here, we formulate a theory for the microwave-to-optical quantum transduction mediated by antiferromagnetic magnons in antiferromagnets. We derive analytical expressions for the transduction efficiency in the cases with and without an optical cavity, where a microwave cavity is used in both cases. In contrast to the case of the quantum transduction using ferromagnets, we find that the quantum transduction can occur even in the absence of an external static magnetic field. We also find that, in the case with an optical cavity the transduction efficiency takes a peak structure with respect to the sample thickness, indicating that there exists an optimal thickness, whereas in the case without an optical cavity the transduction efficiency is a monotonically increasing function of the sample thickness. Our study opens up a way for possible applications of antiferromagnetic materials in future quantum interconnects.</p>

            <p>Potential disorder in 1D leads to Anderson localization of the entire spectrum. Upon sacrificing hermiticity by adding non-reciprocal hopping, the non-Hermitian skin effect competes with localization. We find another route for delocalization, which involves imaginary potential disorder. While an entirely random potential generally still leads to localization, imposing minimal spatial structure to the disorder can protect delocalization: it endows the concomitant transfer matrix with an SU(2) structure, whose compactness in turn translates into an infinite localization length. The fraction of delocalized states can be tuned by the choice of boundary conditions.</p>

            <p>Non-destructive heralded entanglement with photons is a valuable resource for quantum information processing. However, they generally entail ancillary particles and modes that amplify the circuit intricacy. To address this challenge, a recent work (\href{this https URL}{npj Quantum Information 10, 67 (2024)}) introduced a graph approach for creating multipartite entanglements with boson subtractions. Nonetheless, it remains an essential intermediate step toward practical heralded schemes: the proposition of heralded subtraction operators in bosonic linear quantum networks. This research establishes comprehensive translation rules from subtraction operators to linear optical operators, which provides a seamless path to design heralded schemes with single photons. Our method begets enhanced or previously unreported schemes for the $N$-partite GHZ state with $2N$ photons, $N$-partite W state with $2N+1$ photons and superposition of $N=3$ GHZ and W states with 9 photons. Our streamlined approach can straightforwardly design heralded schemes for multipartite entangled states by assembling the operators according to the guidence of sculpting bigraphs, hence significantly simplifies the quantum circuit design process.</p>

            <p>Spin-orbit coupling is of fundamental interest in both quantum optical and condensed matter systems alike. In this work, we show that optically induced electronic excitations in lattices of V-type atoms exhibit an emergent spin-orbit coupling when the geometry is chiral. This spin-orbit coupling arises naturally from the electric dipole interaction between the atomic sites and leads to a nontrivial topology for the lattice band structure. Using a general quantum optical model, we determine analytically the conditions that give rise to spin-orbit coupling and characterize the behavior under various symmetry transformations. We demonstrate that chirality-induced spin-orbit coupling can result from either the chirality of the underlying lattice geometry or the combination of an achiral lattice with a suitably chosen external quantization axis. We then discuss how these results are influenced by dissipation, which breaks time-reversal symmetry and illuminates the distinction between true and false chirality. Our results demonstrate that chiral atom arrays are a robust platform for realizing spin-orbit-coupled topological states of matter.</p>

            <p>Microwave-optics entanglement plays a crucial role in building hybrid quantum networks with quantum nodes working in the microwave and optical frequency bands. However, there are limited efficient ways to produce such entanglement due to the large frequency mismatch between the two regimes. Here, we present a new mechanism to prepare microwave-optics entanglement based on a hybrid system of two coupled opto- and magnomechanical microspheres, i.e., a YIG sphere and a silica sphere. The YIG sphere holds a magnon mode and a vibration mode induced by magnetostriction, while the silica sphere supports an optical whispering-gallery mode and a mechanical mode coupled via an optomechanical interaction. The two mechanical modes are close in frequency and directly coupled via physical contact of the two microspheres. We show that by simultaneously activating the magnomechanical (optomechanical) Stokes (anti-Stokes) scattering, stationary entanglement can be established between the magnon and optical modes via mechanics-mechanics coupling. This leads to stationary microwave-optics entanglement by further coupling the YIG sphere to a microwave cavity and utilizing the magnon-microwave state swapping. Our protocol is within reach of current technology and may become a promising new approach for preparing microwave-optics entanglement, which finds unique applications in hybrid quantum networks and quantum information processing with hybrid quantum systems.</p>

To this end, we develop a 1-milligram torsional pendulum operating at 18 Hz. Laser cooling its motion to an unprecedented 240~microkelvins for this mass range, we boost its quantum delocalization and benchmark a state-of-the-art quantum-gravity figure-of-merit with an unparalleled improvement potential.

Using the multi-entropy of these configurations, we define a black hole multi-entropy curve, which describes how the multi-entropy changes during the black hole evaporation. This black hole multi-entropy curve is a natural generalization of the Page curve since the multi-entropy reduces to the entanglement entropy for the bi-partite case. The multi-entropy curve keeps increasing in the early time. It reaches the maximum value at the multi-entropy time, which is later than the Page time, and starts to decrease. However, it does not decrease to zero at the end of the black hole evaporation. This non-zero value of the multi-entropy represents the secret entanglement between Hawking particles.</p>
