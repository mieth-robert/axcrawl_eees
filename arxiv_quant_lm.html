            <h2>Nonlinear superconducting ring resonator for sensitive measurement of time reversal symmetry broken order</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicolas Dirnegger, Marie Wesson, Arpit Arora, Ioannis Petrides, Jonathan B. Curtis, Emily M. Been, Amir Yacoby, Prineha Narang</p>
            <p>Time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB) has been central to detecting exotic phases of matter, often linked to complex superconducting order parameters or unique magnetic phenomena. Here, we leverage circuit electrodynamics capabilities of superconducting devices to propose a novel scheme based on a multimode superconducting ring resonator for sensitive probing of TRSB in quantum materials. Our device enables strong nonlinear interactions between the modes and we show that these interactions can lead to highly symmetric configurations which are sensitive to TRSB. Using a driven-dissipative model, we explore the nonlinear dynamics of a two-mode superconducting circuit with self- and cross-Kerr nonlinearities under conditions near the bifurcation threshold. When TRSB coupling is introduced, the critical behavior of the system serves as a highly sensitive detection method. Specifically, by mapping out the optimal parameter regimes, we show that even when the photon occupation numbers are subjected to different initial conditions, they can be driven into a symmetric configuration which can be broken even with weak TRSB. Our findings highlight the utility of superconducting microwave resonators other than quantum information processing as a tool for probing exotic states of matter.</p>

            <h2>Designing Fault-Tolerant Blind Quantum Computation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gefen Baranes, Iria W. Wang, Francisco Machado, Aziza Suleymanzade, Pieter-Jan Stas, Yan-Cheng Wei, Susanne F. Yelin, Johannes Borregaard, Mikhail D. Lukin</p>
            <p>Blind quantum computing (BQC) is a computational paradigm that allows a client with limited quantum capabilities to delegate quantum computations to a more powerful server while keeping both the algorithm and data hidden. However, in practice, existing BQC protocols face significant challenges when scaling to large-scale computations due to photon losses, low efficiencies, and high overheads associated with fault-tolerant operations, requiring the client to compile both logical operations and error correction primitives. We use a recently demonstrated hybrid light-matter approach [PRL 132, 150604 (2024); Science 388, 509-513 (2025)] to develop an architecture for scalable fault-tolerant blind quantum computation. By combining high-fidelity local gates on the server's matter qubits with delegated blind rotations using photons, we construct loss-tolerant delegated gates that enable efficient algorithm compilation strategies and a scalable approach for fault-tolerant blind logical algorithms. Our approach improves the error-correction threshold and increases the speed and depth of blind logical circuits. Finally, we outline how this architecture can be implemented on state-of-the-art quantum hardware, including neutral atom arrays and solid-state spin defects. These new capabilities open up new opportunities for deep circuit blind quantum computing.</p>

            <h2>Multi-photon QKD for Practical Quantum Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nitin Jha, Abhishek Parakh, Mahadevan Subramaniam</p>
            <p>Quantum key distribution (QKD) will most likely be an integral part of any practical quantum network in the future. However, not all QKD protocols can be used in today's networks because of the lack of single-photon emitters and noisy intermediate quantum hardware. Attenuated-photon transmission, typically used to simulate single-photon emitters, severely limits the achievable transmission distances and makes the integration of the QKD into existing classical networks, that use tens of thousands of photons per bit of transmission, difficult. Furthermore, it has been found that protocol performance varies with topology. In order to remove the reliance of QKD on single-photon emitters and increase transmission distances, it is worthwhile to explore QKD protocols that do not rely on single-photon transmissions for security, such as the 3-stage QKD protocol, which can tolerate multiple photons in each burst without information leakage. This paper compares and contrasts the 3-stage QKD protocol with conventional QKD protocols and its efficiency in different network topologies and conditions. Furthermore, we establish a mathematical relationship between achievable key rates to increase transmission distances in various topologies.</p>

            <h2>Tripartite Entanglement dynamics: the influence of intrinsic decoherence and decoherence channels</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S. V. Mousavi</p>
            <p>This study examines a system of three coupled qubits, focusing on entanglement measures in the presence of decoherence. It utilizes an XXZ Heisenberg chain with an external magnetic field and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, considering intrinsic decoherence. The results reveal that only the magnetic field strength affects entanglement, while intrinsic decoherence suppresses it, with stronger decoherence leading to greater suppression. Various decoherence channels are analyzed, showing that the $I$-tangle typically decreases with increased decoherence, except for the generalized W state under phase damping channel, where only one qubit is affected. Interestingly, dark periods of $I$-tangle occur for the GHZ state under non-Markovian dephasing, and while steady-state entanglement disappears in this channel, it remains nonzero when starting from a mixture of GHZ and fully separable states. Additionally, under generalized amplitude damping channel, reduced bipartite states of a W state exhibit entanglement sudden death, while the steady-state $I$-tangle for the spectral decomposed state stays nonzero.</p>

            <h2>Interpolation of Quantum Polar Codes and Quantum Reed-Muller Codes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Keita Hidaka, Dina Abdelhadi, Ruediger Urbanke</p>
            <p>Good quantum error-correcting codes that fulfill practical considerations, such as simple encoding circuits and efficient decoders, are essential for functional quantum information processing systems. Quantum polar codes satisfy some of these requirements but lack certain critical features, thereby hindering their widespread use. Existing constructions either require entanglement assistance to produce valid quantum codes, suffer from poor finite-size performance, or fail to tailor polar codes to the underlying channel properties. Meanwhile, quantum Reed-Muller (RM) codes demonstrate strong performance, though no known efficient decoding algorithm exists for them. In this work, we propose strategies to interpolate between quantum polar codes and quantum RM codes, thus addressing the challenges of designing valid quantum polar codes without entanglement assistance and improving finite-size code performance.</p>

            <h2>The dynamics of spontaneous emission</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marcello Baldo</p>
            <p>The spontaneous decay of an excited atom by photon emission is one of the most common and elementary physical process present in nature and in laboratories. The decay is random in time with constant probability density, as it can be inferred by the exponential law observed experimentally. Despite the simplicity of the process, in Quantum Mechanics the decay itself is considered a law of nature which is not further analyzed or explained. However it is legitimate to ask for the reason of its randomness and for the dynamics of the atom around the decay. The decay process of an isolated atom is usually assumed to be instantaneous, the so called Quantum jumps. Particular experimental arrangements can widen the duration of the transition from an excited state to the ground state to a finite time. In general this is due to the quantum back action of the detector. The development of Quantum Optics has enormously enriched the possibilities to study in detail the process, and new illuminating insights have been obtained, but the question is still valid and its answer is still elusive. In this paper we analyze the spontaneous decay within the new prospect introduced by a recent model that complete standard Quantum Mechanics in a formalism which is able to describe the dynamics of measurement and of spontaneous decay. Comparison is made with more phenomenological theories, the Quantum Mechanics of open system and the Stochastic wave function model. In the new model the stochastic photon emission by an excited atom is triggered by the vacuum fluctuations. It is suggested how to re-analyze three types of experiments, already realized in many laboratories, in order to reveal the presence and the effect of these fluctuations.</p>

            <h2>Low Crosstalk in a Scalable Superconducting Quantum Lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammed Alghadeer, Shuxiang Cao, Simone D Fasciati, Michele Piscitelli, Paul C. Gow, James C. Gates, Mustafa Bakr, Peter J. Leek</p>
            <p>Superconducting quantum circuits are a key platform for advancing quantum information processing and simulation. Scaling efforts currently encounter challenges such as Josephson-junction fabrication yield, design frequency targeting, and crosstalk arising both from spurious microwave modes and intrinsic interactions between qubits. We demonstrate a scalable 4x4 square lattice with low crosstalk, comprising 16 fixed-frequency transmon qubits with nearest-neighbor capacitive coupling that is implemented in a tileable, 3D-integrated circuit architecture with off-chip inductive shunting to mitigate spurious enclosure modes. We report on the design and comprehensive characterization, and show that our implementation achieves targeted device parameters with very low frequency spreads and simultaneous single-qubit gate errors across the device. Our results provide a promising pathway toward a scalable, low-crosstalk superconducting lattice topology with high qubit connectivity for quantum error correction and simulation.</p>

            <h2>Quantum engineering of high harmonic generation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Neda Boroumand, Adam Thorpe, Graeme Bart, Lu Wang, David N. Purschke, Giulio Vampa, Thomas Brabec</p>
            <p>In quantum sideband high harmonic generation (QSHHG), high harmonic generation is perturbed by a bright quantum field resulting in harmonic sidebands, with the intent to transfer non-classical properties from the quantum perturbation to the harmonic sidebands. So far, non-classical features have not been found in QSHHG yet. The closed form theory of QSHHG in atoms and solids developed here answers the question under which conditions non-classical features can be realized. QSHHG results in a multi-mode entanglement between harmonic sideband modes and perturbative quantum mode. A projective measurement on either creates a variety of non-classical states commonly used in quantum information science. This opens a pathway towards quantum engineering high harmonic generation as a short wavelength source for quantum information science.</p>

            <h2>A multimode cavity QED Ising spin glass</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Brendan P. Marsh, David Atri Schuller, Yunpeng Ji, Henry S. Hunt, Giulia Z. Socolof, Deven P. Bowman, Jonathan Keeling, Benjamin L. Lev</p>
            <p>We realize a driven-dissipative Ising spin glass using cavity QED in a novel ``4/7" multimode geometry. Gases of ultracold atoms trapped within the cavity by optical tweezers serve as effective spins. They are coupled via randomly signed, all-to-all Ising cavity-mediated interactions. Networks of up to n = 25 spins are holographically imaged via cavity emission. The system is driven through a frustrated transverse-field Ising transition, and we show that the entropy of the spin glass states depends on the rate at which the transition is crossed. Despite being intrinsically nonequilibrium, the system exhibits phenomena associated with Parisi's theory of equilibrium spin glasses, namely replica symmetry breaking (RSB) and ultrametric structure. For system sizes up to n = 16, we measure the Parisi function q(x), Edwards-Anderson overlap q_EA, and ultrametricity K-correlator; all indicate a deeply ordered spin glass under RSB. The system can serve as an associative memory and enable aging and rejuvenation studies in driven-dissipative spin glasses at the microscopic level.</p>

            <h2>Optical Interference Effect in Strong-field Electronic Coherence Spectroscopy</h2>

            <p>We have investigated strong-field-induced electronic coherences in argon and molecular nitrogen ions created by high-intensity, few-cycle infrared laser pulses. This is a step toward the long-sought goal of strong-field coherent control in molecular chemistry. We employed high-intensity, few-cycle infrared laser pulses in a pump-probe setup to investigate a recent prediction that electronic coherences in nitrogen molecules change the ion yields vs. pump-probe delay. [Yuen and Lin, Phys. Rev. A 109, L011101 (2024)]. The predicted coherence signals in molecular nitrogen could not be resolved above the optical interference of the pump and probe pulses; a simultaneous measurement clearly resolved the induced cation fine-structure coherence in strong-field-ionized argon. The results of our comparison with simulations suggest that optical interference effects manifest differently in each ionic species and must be carefully accounted for when interpreting experimental data. We found that nonsequential double ionization in the low-intensity region of the focal volume can reduce the visibility of coherence generated by two-pulse sequential ionization, and we quantify the importance of pulse shape and spectral characteristics for isolating the desired coherence signals.</p>

            <h2>Polarization-dependent topology in quantum emitter chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonathan Sturm, Adriana Pálffy</p>
            <p>The role of polarization in the topology of quantum emitter chains is investigated theoretically, whereby "polarization" refers to the transition dipole moments of the emitters. We show that, if the chain is zigzag-shaped, different topological phases can be realized by adjusting the polarization direction. It turns out that long-range dipole-dipole couplings weaken the bulk-boundary correspondence, but on the other hand give rise to higher-order topological phases with four observable edge modes. We also demonstrate how the polarization orientation can be used to define an additional dimension and simulate a synthetic Chern insulator. Our findings open up a way to actively switch between various topological phases within a single arrangement of quantum emitters.</p>

            <h2>Limits of absolute vector magnetometry with NV centers in diamond</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dennis Lönard, Isabel Cardoso Barbosa, Stefan Johansson, Jonas Gutsche, Artur Widera</p>
            <p>The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond has become a widely used platform for quantum sensing. The four NV axes in mono-crystalline diamond specifically allow for vector magnetometry, with magnetic-field sensitivities reaching down to $\mathrm{fT}/ \sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$. The current literature primarily focuses on improving the precision of NV-based magnetometers. Here, we study the experimental accuracy of determining the magnetic field from measured spin-resonance frequencies via solving the NV Hamiltonian. We derive exact, analytical, and fast-to-compute formulas for calculating resonance frequencies from a known magnetic-field vector, and vice versa, formulas for calculating the magnetic-field vector from measured resonance frequencies. Additionally, the accuracy of often-used approximations is assessed. Finally, we promote using the Voigt profile as a fit model to determine the linewidth of measured resonances accurately. An open-source Python package accompanies our analysis.</p>

            <h2>Effect of noise and topologies on multi-photon quantum protocols</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nitin Jha, Abhishek Parakh, Mahadevan Subramaniam</p>
            <p>Quantum-augmented networks aim to use quantum phenomena to improve detection and protection against malicious actors in a classical communication network. This may include multiplexing quantum signals into classical fiber optical channels and incorporating purely quantum links alongside classical links in the network. In such hybrid networks, quantum protocols based on single photons become a bottleneck for transmission distances and data speeds, thereby reducing entire network performance. Furthermore, many of the security assumptions of the single-photon protocols do not hold up in practice because of the impossibility of manufacturing single-photon emitters. Multi-photon quantum protocols, on the other hand, are designed to operate under practical assumptions and do not require single photon emitters. As a result, they provide higher levels of security guarantees and longer transmission distances. However, the effect of channel and device noise on multiphoton protocols in terms of security, transmission distances, and bit rates has not been investigated. In this paper, we focus on channel noise and present our observations on the effect of various types of noise on multi-photon protocols. We also investigate the effect of topologies such as ring, star, and torus on the noise characteristics of the multi-photon protocols. Our results show the possible advantages of switching to multi-photon protocols and give insights into the repeater placement and topology choice for quantum-augmented networks.</p>

            <h2>Quantum confinement theory of ultra-thin films: electronic, thermal and superconducting properties</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessio Zaccone</p>
            <p>The miniaturization of electronic devices has led to the prominence, in technological applications, of ultra-thin films with a thickness ranging from a few tens of nanometers to just about 1-2 nanometers. While these materials are still effectively 3D in many respects, traditional theories as well as ab initio methods struggle to describe their properties as measured in experiments. In particular, standard approaches to quantum confinement rely on hard-wall boundary conditions, which neglect the unavoidable, ubiquitous, atomic-scale irregularities of the interface. Recently, a unified theoretical approach to quantum confinement has been proposed which is able to effectively take the real nature of the interface into account, and can efficiently be implemented in synergy with microscopic theories. Its predictions for the electronic properties such as electrical conductivity of semiconductor thin films or critical temperature of superconducting thin films, have been successfully verified in comparison with experimental data. The same confinement principles lead to new laws for the phonon density of states and for the heat capacity of thin films, again in agreement with the available experimental data.</p>

            <h2>Predictive Performance of Deep Quantum Data Re-uploading Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xin Wang, Han-Xiao Tao, Re-Bing Wu</p>
            <p>Quantum machine learning models incorporating data re-uploading circuits have garnered significant attention due to their exceptional expressivity and trainability. However, their ability to generate accurate predictions on unseen data, referred to as the predictive performance, remains insufficiently investigated. This study reveals a fundamental limitation in predictive performance when deep encoding layers are employed within the data re-uploading model. Concretely, we theoretically demonstrate that when processing high-dimensional data with limited-qubit data re-uploading models, their predictive performance progressively degenerates to near random-guessing levels as the number of encoding layers increases. In this context, the repeated data uploading cannot mitigate the performance degradation. These findings are validated through experiments on both synthetic linearly separable datasets and real-world datasets. Our results demonstrate that when processing high-dimensional data, the quantum data re-uploading models should be designed with wider circuit architectures rather than deeper and narrower ones.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julian Schuhmacher, Guo-Xian Su, Jesse J. Osborne, Anthony Gandon, Jad C. Halimeh, Ivano Tavernelli</p>
            <p>Scattering experiments are at the heart of high-energy physics (HEP), breaking matter down to its fundamental constituents, probing its formation, and providing deep insight into the inner workings of nature. In the current huge drive to forge quantum computers into complementary venues that are ideally suited to capture snapshots of far-from-equilibrium HEP dynamics, a major goal is to utilize these devices for scattering experiments. A major obstacle in this endeavor has been the hardware overhead required to access the late-time post-collision dynamics while implementing the underlying gauge symmetry. Here, we report on the first quantum simulation of scattering in a lattice gauge theory (LGT), performed on \texttt{IBM}'s \texttt{ibm\_marrakesh} quantum computer. Specifically, we quantum-simulate the collision dynamics of electrons and positrons as well as mesons in a $\mathrm{U}(1)$ LGT representing $1+1$D quantum electrodynamics (QED), uncovering rich post-collision dynamics that we can precisely tune with a topological $\Theta$-term and the fermionic mass. By monitoring the time evolution of the scattering processes, we are able to distinguish between two main regimes in the wake of the collision. The first is characterized by the delocalization of particles when the topological $\Theta$-term is weak, while the second regime shows localized particles with a clear signature when the $\Theta$-term is nontrivial. Furthermore, we show that by quenching to a small mass at the collision point, inelastic scattering occurs with a large production of matter reminiscent of quantum many-body scarring. Our work provides a major step forward in the utility of quantum computers for investigating the real-time quantum dynamics of HEP collisions.</p>

            <p>We present a digital quantum computation of two-hadron scattering in a $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory in 1+1 dimensions. We prepare well-separated single-particle wave packets with desired momentum-space wavefunctions, and simulate their collision through digitized time evolution. Multiple hadronic wave packets can be produced using the efficient, systematically improvable algorithm of this work, achieving high fidelity with the target initial state. Specifically, employing a trapped-ion quantum computer (IonQ Forte), we prepare up to three meson wave packets using 11 and 27 system qubits, and simulate collision dynamics of two meson wave packets for the smaller system. Results for local observables are consistent with numerical simulations at early times, but decoherence effects limit evolution into long times. We demonstrate the critical role of high-fidelity initial states for precision measurements of state-sensitive observables, such as $S$-matrix elements. Our work establishes the potential of quantum computers in simulating hadron-scattering processes in strongly interacting gauge theories.</p>

            <h2>Generating Asymmetric Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen Steering between Two movable Mirrors Exploiting Correlated-Emission Laser</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jamal El Qars, Ismail Essaoudi, Abdelmajid Ainane</p>
            <p>Quantum steering is a form of quantum correlation that exhibits an inherent asymmetry, distinguishing it from entanglement and Bell nonlocality. It is now understood that quantum steering plays a pivotal role in asymmetric quantum information tasks. In this work, we propose a scheme to generate asymmetric steering between two mechanical modes by transferring quantum coherence from a correlated-emission laser. To accomplish this, we derive quantum Langevin equations to describe the optomechanical coupling between two cavity modes and two mechanical modes along with the master equation of two-mode laser. By examining the case where the cavity modes scatter at the anti-Stokes sidebands, we demonstrate that both two-way and one-way steering can be achieved by adjusting the strength of the field driving the gain medium of the laser. Furthermore, we show that the direction of one-way steering can be controlled by varying the temperatures of the mechanical baths or the strengths of the optomechanical couplings. Additionally, we reveal that the directionality of one-way steering depends on the modes fluctuation levels of the modes, with the mode exhibiting larger fluctuations determining the direction. This highly controllable scheme could potentially be realized with current technology, offering a promising platform for implementing one-way quantum information tasks.</p>

            <p>We investigate the spectral properties and quantum criticality of the two-photon Rabi-Stark model. Using the exact solution of this model, we rigorously derive a condition for complete spectral collapse, where all bound states vanish. In this case, the energy gap closes at a critical coupling, signaling a continuous quantum phase transition. The corresponding gap exponent differs from those in both the one-photon Rabi-Stark model and the quantum Rabi model, suggesting a distinct universality class. Furthermore, mapping to an inverse square potential well reveals an infinite number of discrete bound states at high two-level atomic frequencies, with their energies approaching the threshold exponentially. Our results offer new insights into novel spectral phenomena in nonlinear quantum Rabi models, with potential implications for experimental realizations in circuit QED and trapped ion systems.</p>

First, we verify continuous-variable entanglement by measuring an Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen entanglement parameter of 0.0132(7), which is below the threshold of 0.25 for Reid's EPR criterion. Second, we perform a continuous-variable Bell test and find a violation of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality, measuring 2.26(3), which is above the entanglement threshold of 2. We also demonstrate the flexibility of our method by preparing a non-Gaussian entangled oscillator state--a superposition of TMSV states.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> C.-Y. Lee, K.-T. Lin, G.-D. Lin, H. H. Jen</p>
            <p>We theoretically investigate excitation dynamics in one-dimensional arrays of quantum emitters coupled to a waveguide, focusing on localization and long-time population trapping. By combining time-domain simulations with spectral analysis of an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, we identify two distinct mechanisms that give rise to localization: geometry-induced subradiance and disorder-induced Anderson-like confinement. Spatially modulated emitter arrangements--such as single- and double-Gaussian transverse profiles--enable long-lived subradiant modes even in the absence of disorder, with decay rates that can be finely controlled via geometric parameters. In contrast, localization in uniform arrays emerges only when disorder breaks spatial symmetry and suppresses collective emission through interference. We track the crossover between geometric and disorder-induced regimes, finding that double-Gaussian profiles exhibit clear spatial signatures of this transition, while single-Gaussian configurations display more gradual changes. These results establish geometry and disorder as complementary tools for engineering long-lived quantum states in waveguide QED systems, with direct relevance for scalable implementations in photonic platforms.</p>

            <h2>Direct Measurement of Zak Phase and Higher Winding Numbers in an Electroacoustic Cavity System</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guang-Chen He, Zhao-Xian Chen, Xiao-Meng Zhang, Ze-Guo Chen, Ming-Hui Lu</p>
            <p>Topological phases are states of matter defined by global topological invariants that remain invariant under adiabatic parameter variations, provided no topological phase transition occurs. This endows them with intrinsic robustness against local perturbations. Experimentally, these phases are often identified indirectly by observing robust boundary states, protected by the bulk-boundary correspondence. Here, we propose an experimental method for the direct measurement of topological invariants via adiabatic state evolution in electroacoustic coupled resonators, where time-dependent cavity modes effectively emulate the bulk wavefunction of a periodic system. Under varying external driving fields, specially prepared initial states evolve along distinct parameter-space paths. By tracking the relative phase differences among states along these trajectories, we successfully observe the quantized Zak phase in both the conventional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model and its extension incorporating with next-nearest-neighbor coupling. This approach provides compelling experimental evidence for the precise identification of topological invariants and can be extended to more complex topological systems.</p>

            <h2>Strong Molecule-Light Entanglement with Molecular Cavity Optomechanics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hong-Yun Yu, Ya-Feng Jiao, Jie Wang, Feng Li, Bin Yin, Tian Jiang, Qi-Rui Liu, Hui Jing, Ke Wei</p>
            <p>We propose a molecular optomechanical platform to generate robust entanglement among bosonic modes-photons, phonons, and plasmons-under ambient conditions. The system integrates an ultrahigh-Q whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) optical resonator with a plasmonic nanocavity formed by a metallic nanoparticle and a single molecule. This hybrid architecture offers two critical advantages over standalone plasmonic systems: (i) Efficient redirection of Stokes photons from the lossy plasmonic mode into the long-lived WGM resonator, and (ii) Suppression of molecular absorption and approaching vibrational ground states via plasmon-WGM interactions. These features enable entanglement to transfer from the fragile plasmon-phonon subsystem to a photon-phonon bipartition in the blue-detuned regime, yielding robust stationary entanglement resilient to environmental noise. Remarkably, the achieved entanglement surpasses the theoretical bound for conventional two-mode squeezing in certain parameter regimes. Our scheme establishes a universal approach to safeguard entanglement in open quantum systems and opens avenues for noise-resilient quantum information technologies.</p>

            <p>Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a key application in quantum communication, enabling secure key exchange between parties using quantum states. Twin-field (TF) QKD offers a promising solution that surpasses the repeaterless limits, and its measurement-device-independent nature makes it suitable for star-type network architectures. In this work, we propose a scalable TF-QKD network with adaptable architecture, where users prepare quantum signals and send them to network nodes. These nodes use an optical switch to route the signals to multi-user measurement units, enabling secure key distribution among arbitrary users and adapting to complex connection demands of the network. A proof-of-principle demonstration with three users successfully achieved secure key sharing over simulated link losses of up to $30$ dB, with an average rate of $19.57$ bit/s. Additionally, simulations show that the proposed architecture can achieve a total secure key rate of $4.84 \times 10^{4}$ bit/s at $100$ km in a symmetric $32$-user network. This approach represents a significant advancement in the topology of untrusted-node QKD networks and holds promise for practical, large-scale applications in secure communication.</p>

            <p>Topological phases of matter can appear in noninteracting systems, as in band topology, or interacting systems, such as in spin models, with their defining features typically robust against weak disorder. Intriguingly, disorder itself can also induce topological phases--exemplified by the Anderson topological insulator in noninteracting systems. Experimental studies on disorder induced topology have so far been limited to band topology. Here we report direct observations of structural disorder induced many-body interacting topological phase in an atom array at half-filling, whereby random offsets to tweezer locations forming a lattice implement structural disorder, causing fluctuating long-range dipolar interactions between tweezer confined single atoms. The ground state degeneracy in disordered configurations is detected and compared to a regular lattice. The induced topological phase is also vindicated by the spatially resolved atom-atom correlation functions for different forms of dimer compositions. By probing the quench dynamics of a highly excited state, we observe markedly slower decay of edge spin magnetization in comparison to the bulk spin one, consistent with the presence of topologically protected edge modes in disordered lattices. Our experiments open a new direction for studying the interplay between structural disorder and strongly interacting topological matter in Rydberg atom arrays.</p>

            <h2>Time Independence Does Not Limit Information Flow. I. The Free-Particle Case</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dong Yuan, Chao Yin, T. C. Mooney, Christopher L. Baldwin, Andrew M. Childs, Alexey V. Gorshkov</p>
            <p>The speed of information propagation in long-range interacting quantum systems is limited by Lieb-Robinson-type bounds, whose tightness can be established by finding specific quantum state-transfer protocols. Previous works have given quantum state-transfer protocols that saturate the corresponding Lieb-Robinson bounds using time-dependent Hamiltonians. Are speed limits for quantum information propagation different for time-independent Hamiltonians? In a step towards addressing this question, we present and analyze two optimal time-independent state-transfer protocols for free-particle systems, which utilize continuous-time single-particle quantum walks with hopping strength decaying as a power law. We rigorously prove and numerically confirm that our protocols achieve quantum state transfer, with controllable error over an arbitrarily long distance in any spatial dimension, at the speed limits set by the free-particle Lieb-Robinson bounds. This shows that time independence does not limit information flow for long-range free-particle Hamiltonians.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> T. C. Mooney, Dong Yuan, Adam Ehrenberg, Christopher L. Baldwin, Alexey V. Gorshkov, Andrew M. Childs</p>
            <p>While the impact of locality restrictions on quantum dynamics and algorithmic complexity has been well studied in the general case of time-dependent Hamiltonians, the capabilities of time-independent protocols are less well understood. Using clock constructions, we show that the light cone for time-independent Hamiltonians, as captured by Lieb-Robinson bounds, is the same as that for time-dependent systems when local ancillas are allowed. More specifically, we develop time-independent protocols for approximate quantum state transfer with the same run-times as their corresponding time-dependent protocols. Given any piecewise-continuous Hamiltonian, our construction gives a time-independent Hamiltonian that implements its dynamics in the same time, up to error $\varepsilon$, at the cost of introducing a number of local ancilla qubits for each data qubit that is polylogarithmic in the number of qubits, the norm of the Hamiltonian and its derivative (if it exists), the run time, and $1/\varepsilon$. We apply this construction to state transfer for systems with power-law-decaying interactions and one-dimensional nearest-neighbor systems with disordered interaction strengths. In both cases, this gives time-independent protocols with the same optimal light-cone-saturating run-times as their time-dependent counterparts.</p>

            <h2>Evidence of Memory Effects in the Dynamics of Two-Level System Defect Ensembles Using Broadband, Cryogenic Transient Dielectric Spectroscopy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qianxu Wang, Sara Magdalena Gómez, Juan S. Salcedo-Gallo, Roy Leibovitz, Jake Freeman, Salil Bedkihal, Mattias Fitzpatrick</p>
            <p>Two-level system defects (TLSs) in dielectrics are believed to be the primary source of decoherence in superconducting circuits. However, the precise origin of these defects, including their atomistic morphology, frequency distributions, and dipole moments, remains relatively unexplored. A significant reason for this lack of understanding is that TLS defects are currently probed with resonators or qubits that require complex multi-stage fabrication processes. These probes are packaged, cooled in a dilution refrigerator, and measured to infer their corresponding coherence times. However, even frequency-tunable probes only gather information about TLS defects within their mode volume and a narrow bandwidth around their resonance frequency. As a result, a detailed understanding of the atomistic origins of TLS defects in isolated materials and interfaces is currently lacking, making it challenging to design the next generation of superconducting devices and dielectric materials from first principles. Here, we introduce a novel approach that enables probing the cryogenic dielectric response of TLS defect ensembles using a broadband 3D waveguide. This technique provides evidence of memory effects in the dynamics of TLS defect ensembles that may enable the extraction of critical information about the origins of the underlying TLS defects and their interactions. Importantly, this novel spectroscopy technique can be used at all stages of fabrication and ultimately inform mitigation strategies to reduce the impact of TLS defects on superconducting circuits. As a result, this technique will help usher in a new understanding of the atomistic origin of TLS defects, which will have profound consequences for quantum information science and the broader materials science community.</p>

            <h2>State Engineering of Unsteerable Hamiltonians</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi-Xuan Wang, Yuval Gefen</p>
            <p>Lindbladian dynamics of open systems may be employed to steer a many-body system towards a non-trivial ground state of a local Hamiltonian. Such protocols provide us with tunable platforms facilitating the engineering and study of non-trivial many-body states. Steering towards a degenerate ground state manifold provides us with a protected platform to employ many-body states as a resource for quantum information processing. Notably, ground states of frustrated local Hamiltonians have been known not to be amenable to steering protocols. Revisiting this intricate physics we report two new results: (i) we find a broad class of (geometrically) frustrated local Hamiltonians for which steering of the ground state manifold is possible through a sequence of discrete steering steps. Following the steering dynamics, states within the degenerate ground-state manifold keep evolving in a non-stationary manner. (ii) For the class of Hamiltonians with ground states which are non-steerable through local superoperators, we derive a "glass floor" on how close to the ground state one can get implementing a steering protocol. This is expressed invoking the concept of cooling-by-steering (a lower bound of the achievable temperature), or through an upper bound of the achievable fidelity. Our work provides a systematic outline for studying quantum state manipulation of a broad class of strongly correlated states.</p>

            <h2>Tunable Entanglement of Multi-Level Atoms in Photonic Crystals: Leveraging Resonant Dipole Interactions and Quantum Interference</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nancy Ghangas, Shubhrangshu Dasgupta</p>
            <p>We present a comprehensive investigation of entanglement dynamics in multi-level V-type atomic systems embedded within PC cavities. We mainly focus on the synergistic roles of resonant dipole-dipole interactions and quantum interference through analytical modeling and numerical simulations using the Schrodinger equation. In our analysis, we show that resonant dipole-dipole interactions and quantum interference serve as potent tools for tuning and stabilizing entanglement in structured photonic environments. Key findings reveal that resonant interaction dominates when interatomic distances align with the localization length of photonic bound states induced by bandgap which enables coherent coupling via evanescent fields. The entanglement is preserved for extended times when dipoles of each atom are aligned parallel or anti-parallel while a novel oscillatory entanglement mechanism emerges from orthogonally aligned atomic dipoles. It is mainly driven by destructive interference between vacuum-mediated pathways and bandgap-engineered photonic density of states. This mechanism exhibits non-Markovian dynamics, including delayed feedback and entanglement revival. We further demonstrate that positioning the atomic excited states deeper within the photonic bandgap accelerates the decay of entanglement oscillations due to the exponential suppression of resonant energy exchange mediated by evanescent modes.</p>

            <h2>Non-Hermitian effects on the quantum parameter estimation in pseudo-Hermitian systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> L. H. Wei, H. J. Xing, L. B. Fu, H. D. Liu</p>
            <p>Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) is a fundamental quantity in quantum parameter estimation theory, characterizing the ultimate precision bound of parameter estimation. In this work, we investigate QFI for quantum states in non-Hermitian systems. By employing the projected Hilbert space method and spectral decomposition, we derive an explicit expression for the QFI in terms of the density matrix and parameter generators. This formulation not only recovers the well-known results in the Hermitian case but also captures the non-Hermitian effects induced by the time-dependent norm of the state. To validate our theoretical framework, we analyze a single-qubit pseudo-Hermitian system and apply Naimark dilation theory to embed it into an equivalent Hermitian system. The comparison between the original and dilated systems demonstrates the consistency and applicability of the proposed QFI formula in non-Hermitian settings. In addition, we investigate a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric system to further explore the influence of non-Hermiticity on QFI. Our findings offer a new perspective for analyzing and enhancing QFI in non-Hermitian systems, paving the way for promising applications in non-Hermitian quantum metrology and sensing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lorenzo Bernazzani, Balázs Gulácsi, Guido Burkard</p>
            <p>We investigate in parallel two common pictures used to describe quantum systems interacting with their surrounding environment, i.e., the stochastic Hamiltonian description, where the environment is implicitly included in the fluctuating internal parameters of the system, and the explicit inclusion of the environment via the time-convolutionless projection operator method. Utilizing these two different frameworks, we show that the dissipator characterizing the dynamics of the reduced system, determined up to second order in the noise strength or bath-system coupling, is universal. That is, it keeps the same form regardless of the drive term, as long as the drive is weak. We thoroughly discuss the assumptions on which this treatment is based and its limitations. By considering the first non-vanishing higher-order term in our expansion, we also derive the linear response correction due to memory-mediated environmental effects in driven-dissipative systems. We demonstrate this technique to be highly accurate for the problems of dephasing in a driven qubit and for the theory of pseudomodes for quantum environments.</p>

            <p>Quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize quantum chemistry and material science by offering solutions to complex problems unattainable with classical computers. However, the development of efficient quantum algorithms that are efficient under noisy conditions remains a major challenge. This paper introduces the truncated Variational Hamiltonian Ansatz (tVHA), a novel circuit design for conducting quantum calculations on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. tVHA provides a promising approach for a broad range of applications by utilizing principles from the adiabatic theorem in solid state physics. Our proposed ansatz significantly reduces the parameter count and can decrease circuit size substantially, with a trade-off in accuracy. Thus, tVHA facilitates easier convergence within the variational quantum eigensolver framework compared to state-of-the-art ansätze such as Unitary Coupled Cluster (UCC) and Hardware-Efficient Ansatz (HEA). While this paper concentrates on the practical applications of tVHA in quantum chemistry, demonstrating its suitability for both weakly and strongly correlated systems and its compatibility with active space calculations, its underlying principles suggest a wider applicability extending to the broader field of material science computations on quantum computing platforms.</p>

The calculated external-magnetic-field dependence of the total energy, of the magnetization, as well as of the topological charge exhibits a distinctive discontinuity which hints for the existence of zero-temperature magnetic skyrmions-like structures at the quantum level, controlled by the combination of the exchange-coupling and the DMI parameters. The potentially measurable jump in the magnetization upon changing the field indicates the investigated objects as stable enough for eventual applications in spintronics or even as information carriers.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate that spinor Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) can be operated as an analog simulator of the two-dimensional vibron model. This algebraic model for the description of bending and stretching vibrations of molecules, in the case of a triatomic molecules, exhibits two phases where linear and bent configurations are stabilised. Spinor BECs can be engineered to simulate states that correspond to linear or bent triatomic molecules, with the BEC's Wigner function encoding information about the molecular configuration. We show how quantum simulations of the bending dynamics of linear molecules can be realized, and how the straightening of a bent molecule leads to a dynamical instability. In the dynamics triggered by the corresponding instability, a significant amount of entanglement is generated, and we characterise the dynamics with the squeezing parameter and the quantum Fisher information (QFI). The scaling of the non-Gaussian sensitivity, described by the difference between squeezing and QFI, grows with the system size once the spinor system crosses from the linear to the bent phase, thus serving as a dynamical witness for the quantum phase transition.</p>

            <p>The increasing sophistication of available quantum networks has seen a corresponding growth in the pursuit of multi-partite cryptographic protocols. Whilst the use of multi-partite entanglement is known to offer an advantage in certain abstractly motivated contexts, the quest to find practical advantage scenarios is ongoing and substantial difficulties in generalising some bi-partite security proofs still remain. We present rigorous results that address both these challenges at the same time. First, we prove the security of a variant of the GHZ state based secret sharing protocol against general attacks, including participant attacks which break the security of the original GHZ state scheme. We then identify parameters for a performance advantage over realistic bottleneck networks. We show that whilst channel losses limit the advantage region to short distances over direct transmission networks, the addition of quantum repeaters unlocks the performance advantage of multi-partite entanglement over point-to-point approaches for long distance quantum cryptography.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zichang He, David Amaro, Ruslan Shaydulin, Marco Pistoia</p>
            <p>Quantum algorithms must be scaled up to tackle real-world applications. Doing so requires overcoming the noise present on today's hardware. The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a promising candidate for scaling up, due to its modest resource requirements and documented asymptotic speedup over state-of-the-art classical algorithms for some problems. However, achieving better-than-classical performance with QAOA is believed to require fault tolerance. In this paper, we demonstrate a partially fault-tolerant implementation of QAOA using the $[[k+2,k,2]]$ ``Iceberg'' error detection code. We observe that encoding the circuit with the Iceberg code improves the algorithmic performance as compared to the unencoded circuit for problems with up to $20$ logical qubits on a trapped-ion quantum computer. Additionally, we propose and calibrate a model for predicting the code performance. We use this model to characterize the limits of the Iceberg code and extrapolate its performance to future hardware with improved error rates. In particular, we show how our model can be used to determine the necessary conditions for QAOA to outperform the Goemans-Williamson algorithm on future hardware. To the best of our knowledge, our results demonstrate the largest universal quantum computing algorithm protected by partially fault-tolerant quantum error detection on practical applications to date, paving the way towards solving real-world applications with quantum computers.</p>

The quantum layers capture complex, non-linear relationships, while separable convolutions ensure computational efficiency. By reducing both parameter count and circuit depth, the architecture is compatible with near-term quantum hardware and resource-constrained clinical environments. These results establish a foundation for integrating quantum-enhanced models into medical-imaging workflows with minimal changes to existing software platforms.

            <h2>Simulating Time Dependent and Nonlinear Classical Oscillators through Nonlinear Schrödingerization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhinav Muraleedharan, Nathan Wiebe</p>
            <p>We present quantum algorithms for simulating the dynamics of a broad class of classical oscillator systems containing $2^n$ coupled oscillators (Eg: $2^n$ masses coupled by springs), including those with time-dependent forces, time-varying stiffness matrices, and weak nonlinear interactions. This generalization of the Harmonic oscillator simulation algorithm is achieved through an approach that we call ``Nonlinear Schrödingerization'', which involves reduction of the dynamical system to a nonlinear Schrödinger equation and then reduced to a time-independent Schrodinger Equation through perturbative techniques. The linearization of the equation is performed using an approach that allows the dynamics of a nonlinear Schrödinger equation to be approximated as a linear Schrödinger equation in a higher dimensional space. This allows Hamiltonian Simulation algorithms to be applied to simulate the dynamics of resulting system. When the properties of the classical dynamical systems can be efficiently queried, and when the initial state can be efficiently prepared, the complexity of our quantum algorithm is polynomial in $n$, and almost linear in evolution time for most dynamical systems. Our work extends the applicability of quantum algorithms to simulate the dynamics of non-conservative and nonlinear classical systems, addressing key limitations in previous approaches.</p>

            <p>The Mpemba effect, where a system initially farther from equilibrium relaxes faster than one closer to equilibrium, has been extensively studied in classical systems and recently explored in quantum settings. While previous studies of the quantum Mpemba effect (QME) have largely focused on isolated systems with global symmetries, we argue that the QME is ubiquitous in generic, non-integrable many-body systems lacking such symmetries, including U(1) charge conservation, spatial symmetries, and even energy conservation. Using paradigmatic models such as the quantum Ising model with transverse and longitudinal fields, we show that the QME can be understood through the energy density of initial states and their inverse participation ratio in the energy eigenbasis. Our findings provide a unified framework for the QME, linking it with classical thermal relaxation and phenomena such as prethermalization and weak ergodicity breaking.</p>

However, any practical implementation on a critical reactor system must meet strict requirements on latency, control system compatibility, stability, and performance under operational transients. Here, we report the complete end-to-end demonstration of a phase-encoding decoy-state BB84 protocol QKD system under prototypic conditions on Purdue's fully digital nuclear reactor, PUR-1. The system was installed in PUR-1 successfully executing real-time encryption and decryption of 2,000 signals over optic fiber distances up to 82 km using OTP-based encryption and up to 140 km with AES-based encryption. For a core of 68 signals, OTP-secure communication was achieved for up to 130 km. The QKD system maintained a stable secret key rate of 320 kbps and a quantum bit error of 3.8% at 54 km. Our results demonstrate that OTP-based encryption introduces minimal latency while the more key-efficient AES and ASCON encryption schemes can significantly increase the number of signals encrypted without latency penalties. Additionally, implementation of a dynamic key pool ensures several hours of secure key availability during potential system downtimes. This work shows the potential of quantum-based secure remote communications for future digitally driven nuclear reactor technologies.</p>

            <p>Quantum key distribution is a point-to-point communication protocol that leverages quantum mechanics to enable secure information exchange. Commonly, the transmitter and receiver stations are at fixed locations, and the single-photon quantum states are transmitted over fiber or free space. Here, we describe a modular, platform-agnostic, quantum key distribution transmitter and receiver with reduced size, weight, and power consumption to realize a mobile quantum communication system. We deploy the system on different moving platforms, demonstrating drone-to-drone, drone-to-vehicle, and vehicle-to-vehicle quantum communication, achieving secure key rates in the finite-key regime in the range of 1.6 - 20 kbps. To prove the security of the system, we develop advanced physics models of the devices that account for non-ideal behaviors that are of greater importance in mobile platforms. The modular system can be easily upgraded to include sources of entangled photonic quantum states, which will find application in future quantum networks.</p>

            <h2>Neural Network Assisted Fermionic Compression Encoding: A Lossy-QSCI Framework for Scalable Quantum Chemistry Simulations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-cheng Chen, Ronin Wu, M. H. Cheng, Min-Hsiu Hsieh</p>
            <p>Quantum computing promises to revolutionize many-body simulations for quantum chemistry, but its potential is constrained by limited qubits and noise in current devices. In this work, we introduce the Lossy Quantum Selected Configuration Interaction (Lossy-QSCI) framework, which combines a lossy subspace Hamiltonian preparation pipeline with a generic QSCI selection process. This framework integrates a chemistry-inspired lossy Random Linear Encoder (Chemical-RLE) with a neural network-assisted Fermionic Expectation Decoder (NN-FED). The RLE leverages fermionic number conservation to compress quantum states, reducing qubit requirements to O(N log M) for M spin orbitals and N electrons, while preserving crucial ground state information and enabling self-consistent configuration recovery. NN-FED, powered by a neural network trained with minimal data, efficiently decodes these compressed states, overcoming the measurement challenges common in the approaches of the traditional QSCI and its variants. Through iterative quantum sampling and classical post-processing, our hybrid method refines ground state estimates with high efficiency. Demonstrated on the C2 and LiH molecules, our framework achieves chemical accuracy with fewer qubits and basis states, paving a scalable pathway for quantum chemistry simulations on both near-term and fault-tolerant quantum hardware.</p>

            <h2>Tracking phase entanglement during propagation of downconverted photons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rounak Chatterjee, Vikas S Bhat, Kiran Bajar, Sushil Mujumdar</p>
            <p>High-dimensional entanglement in the form of transverse spatial correlation between a pair of photons generated via spontaneous parametric downconversion is not only a valuable resource in many academic and real-life applications but also provides access to several intriguing quantum phenomena. One such non-intuitive phenomenon is phase entanglement, in which the biphoton state is correlated in the complex phase of its wavefunction. This state, which emerges during the propagation of the biphoton wavefunction, exhibits neither position nor momentum correlation, yet retains full entanglement. In this work, we experimentally explore this state in two distinct ways. The first is by tracking the vanishing spatial photon number correlation over propagation distances lying in $\left[0,\infty\right)$, folded into a finite range using single-lens imaging. These observations show excellent agreement with our theoretical predictions based on the Double Gaussian (DG) approximation of the biphoton state. The second approach involves performing a two-photon interference experiment using a double slit and this state, which reveals the correlated phase front. We show, both theoretically and experimentally, that the observed two-photon interference structure is markedly different from that produced by position-correlated photons, as confirmed by computing the joint probability distribution of photons (JPD) and related metrics. Such interference using phase-entangled light has not been attempted before and opens avenues for advanced experiments and applications in the field of spatial entanglement.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julia A. Kunzelmann, Anton Trushechkin, Nikolai Wyderka, Hermann Kampermann, Dagmar Bruß</p>
            <p>Multipartite quantum repeaters play an important role in quantum communication networks enabling the transmission of quantum information over larger distances. To increase the rates for multipartite entanglement distribution, multiplexing of quantum memories is included. Understanding the limitations of achievable rates in the stationary regime for different network sizes is a fundamental step to comprehend scalability of quantum networks. This work investigates the behavior of the multipartite quantum repeater rate (i.e., the number of GHZ states generated per round and per memory) in the stationary regime in multipartite star graphs with a single central multipartite quantum repeater including multiplexing using Markov chains. We derive a closed-form expression for the stationary rate depending on the network size. We support our results with numerical simulations. Further, we show that the rate saturates for large number of memories. On an abstract level, the mathematical description is equivalent to quantum repeater chains between two parties. Therefore, our results also apply to those setups.</p>

            <p>Nonclassical mechanical states, as vital quantum resources for exploring macroscopic quantum behavior, have wide applications in the study of the fundamental quantum mechanics and modern quantum technology. In this work, we propose a scheme for deterministically generating non-classical mechanical states in cavity optomechanical systems. By working in the eigen-representation of the nonlinear optomechanical systems, we identify the carrier-wave resonance conditions and seek optimal driving pulses for state preparations. Concretely, we employ the reinforcement learning method to optimize the pulsed driving fields, effectively suppressing the undesired transitions induced by both the pulsed driving fields and dissipations. This approach enables the high-fidelity preparation of phononic Fock states and superposed Fock states in the single-resonator optomechanical systems, as well as two-mode entangled states in the two-resonator optomechanical systems. The statistical properties of the generated states are also examined. Our results create an opportunity for quantum state engineering in quantum optics and quantum information science via reinforcement learning.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sanjoy Dutta, Nihar Ranjan Dash, Subhashish Banerjee, R. Srikanth</p>
            <p>Steganography is the technique for transmitting a secret message by employing subterfuge to conceal it in innocent-looking data, rather than by overt security measures as in cryptography. Typically, non-degenerate quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs) are used as the cover medium, with the stego message disguised as noise. As in cryptography, a large number of bits or ebits are pre-shared, in this case mainly in order to ensure the innocence effect. In this work we develop three steganographic protocols: first, a scheme based on catalytic quantum codes to minimize initial pre-shared resources; second, a scheme incorporating prior entanglement into QECCs in the form of possibly degenerate entanglement-assisted QECCs; third, a scheme that uses the phase bit of a pre-shared ebit, combined with QECCs.</p>

            <p>Qubit readout schemes often deviate from ideal projective measurements, introducing critical issues that limit quantum computing performance. In this work, we model charge-sensing-based readout for semiconductor spin qubits in double quantum dots, and identify key error mechanisms caused by the back-action of the charge sensor. We quantify how the charge noise of the sensor, residual tunneling, and $g$-tensor modulation degrade readout fidelity, induce a mixed post-measurement state, and cause leakage from the computational subspace. For state-of-the-art systems with strong spin-orbit interaction and electrically tunable $g$-tensors, we identify a readout sweet spot, that is, a special device configuration where readout is closest to projective. Our framework provides a foundation for developing effective readout error mitigation strategies, with broad applications for optimizing readout performance for a variety of charge-sensing techniques, advancing quantum protocols, and improving adaptive circuits for error correction.</p>

            <p>Hybrid light-matter polaritonic states have shown great promise for altering already known and enabling novel chemical reactions and controlling photophysical phenomena. This field has recently become one of the most prominent and active areas of research that connects the communities of chemistry and quantum optics. The ab initio modeling of such polaritonic phenomena has led to updating commonly used electronic structure methods, such as Hartree-Fock, density functional, and coupled cluster theories, to explicitly include Bosonic degrees of freedom. In this work, we explore the quantum electrodynamic auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo (QED-AFQMC) method to accurately capture the polaritonic ground state of representative quantum chemical benchmark systems to explore electron-photon correlations. We analyze these correlations across multiple examples and benchmark the QED-AFQMC results against other ab initio quantum electrodynamics methods, including QED-coupled cluster and QED-full configuration interaction, demonstrating the method's accuracy and its potential for scalable simulations of strongly coupled light-matter systems.</p>

            <p>The generation of magnon entanglement and squeezing plays a crucial role in quantum information processing. In this study, we propose a scheme based on a chiral cavity-magnon system, which consists of a torus-shaped cavity and two yttrium iron garnet spheres. The magnon mode of each yttrium iron garnet sphere is selectively coupled to one of the two degenerate rotating microwave modes of the toroidal cavity. The system aims to achieve entangled and squeezed magnon states through the mediation of the cavity. We further show that bipartite entanglement can be achieved by tuning external driving parameters. Additionally, our scheme does not rely on the magnon Kerr nonlinearity, which is usually extremely weak in yttrium iron garnet spheres. This work provides insights and methods for the research of quantum states in cavity-magnon systems.</p>

            <p>Building hybrid quantum systems is a crucial step for realizing multifunctional quantum technologies, quantum information processing, and hybrid quantum networks. A functional hybrid quantum system requires strong coupling among its components. However, couplings between distinct physical systems are typically very weak. Experimental realization of strong coupling in a hybrid system remains a long-standing challenge, especially when it has multiple components and the components are of different nature. Here we demonstrate the realization of triple strong coupling in a novel {\it polaromechanical} hybrid system, where polaritons, formed by strongly coupled ferromagnetic magnons and microwave photons, are further strongly coupled to phonons. The corresponding polaromechanical normal-mode splitting is observed. A high polaromechanical cooperativity of $9.4\times10^3$ is achieved by significantly reducing the polariton decay rate via exploiting coherent perfect absorption. The quantum cooperativity much greater than unity is achievable if placing the system at cryogenic temperatures, which would enable various quantum applications. Our results pave the way towards coherent quantum control of photons, magnons and phonons, and are a crucial step for building functional hybrid quantum systems based on magnons.</p>

            <p>Topological phases are robust against weak perturbations, but break down when disorder becomes sufficiently strong. However, moderate disorder can also induce topologically nontrivial phases. Thouless pumping, as a (1+1)D counterpart of the integer quantum Hall effect, is one of the simplest manifestations of topology. Here, we report experimental observations of the competition and interplay between Thouless pumping and disorder on a 41-qubit superconducting quantum processor. We improve a Floquet engineering technique to realize cycles of adiabatic pumping by simultaneously varying the on-site potentials and the hopping couplings. We demonstrate Thouless pumping in the presence of disorder and show its breakdown as the strength of disorder increases. Moreover, we observe two types of topological pumping that are induced by on-site potential disorder and hopping disorder, respectively. In particular, an intrinsic topological pump that is induced by quasi-periodic hopping disorder has never been experimentally realized before. Our highly controllable system provides a valuable quantum simulating platform for studying various aspects of topological physics in the presence of disorder.</p>

The identified resilience to decoherence provides valuable insights into the entanglement dynamics of open systems of indistinguishable fermions, and into the conditions under which long-lived entanglement emerges under more general decoherence channels.</p>

            <p>Quantum error correction is essential for achieving fault-tolerant quantum computing. Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes are particularly effective at correcting continuous noise, such as Gaussian noise and loss, and can significantly reduce overhead when concatenated with qubit error-correcting codes like surface codes. GKP error correction can be implemented using either a teleportation-based method, known as Knill error correction, or a quantum non-demolition-based approach, known as Steane error correction. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive performance analysis of these established GKP error correction schemes, deriving an analytical expression for the post-correction GKP squeezing and displacement errors. Our results show that there is flexibility in choosing the entangling gate used with the teleportation-based Knill approach. Furthermore, when implemented using the recently introduced qunaught states, the Knill approach not only achieves superior GKP squeezing compared to other variants but is also the simplest to realize experimentally in the optical domain.</p>

            <h2>Exploring the Delocalization of Dark States in a Multimode Optical Cavity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kunyang Sun, Matthew Du, Joel Yuen-Zhou</p>
            <p>The strong coupling between molecules and photonic modes in a Fabry-Pérot optical cavity, which forms hybrid light-matter states called polaritons, has been demonstrated as a promising route to control the rates of chemical reactions. However, theoretical studies, which largely employ models with a single cavity mode, cannot explain the experimentally observed kinetic changes. While simplified multimode models with one spatial dimension can capture experimental features involving the polariton states, it is unclear whether they can also describe the dark states. Here, we study the delocalization of dark states for molecules in a multimode cavity, accounting for the three-dimensional nature of experimental setups. Accounting for energetic and orientational disorder, but fixing Rabi splitting and intermolecular distances (i.e., no positional disorder), we find that the delocalization of the dark states scales linearly with the number of molecules in the plane parallel to the cavity mirrors, in contrast to one-dimensional multimode models. Adding layers of molecules along the axis normal to the mirrors increases the delocalization much less. Similar to the one-dimensional models, the dark-state delocalization is enhanced for smaller values of molecular energetic disorder, relative to the light-matter coupling, and cavities with longer longitudinal length. Our work indicates that for certain phenomena, understanding the dark states under strong light-matter coupling might require a proper multimode description of the optical cavity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michael Reitz, Arghadip Koner, Joel Yuen-Zhou</p>
            <p>We introduce a theoretical framework that allows for the systematic and efficient description of the ultrafast nonlinear response of molecular polaritons, i.e., hybrid light-matter states, in the collective regime of large numbers of molecules $\mathcal N$ coupled to the cavity photon mode. Our approach is based on a semiclassical, mean-field evolution of the molecular Hamiltonian and the cavity field, which is complemented by a perturbative expansion of both light and matter counterparts in the input fields entering the cavity. In addition, expansion in terms of the pulse phases enables us to disentangle different excitation pathways in Liouville space, thereby distinguishing contributions to the nonlinear response. The formalism extends traditional free-space nonlinear spectroscopy by incorporating the feedback of matter onto the light field via the induced polarization. We demonstrate the utility of the framework by applying it to the calculation of pump-probe polariton spectra and show how, by storing the pulses, the cavity facilitates additional excitation pathways, which can be used to isolate purely bright state contributions. Our method, which does not scale with $\mathcal N$, is broadly applicable and can be extended to model a wide range of current experiments investigating the dynamical nonlinear response of hybrid light-matter states.</p>

Inter-QE entanglement is generated faster than in free space, is significantly amplified, and persists over several resonant wavelengths. Optimality requires large $\beta$-factors but moderately small Purcell factors. Our results establish all-dielectric metasurfaces as a practical, scalable platform for leading-edge quantum photonics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Swarnabha Chattaraj, Giulia Galli</p>
            <p>Radiative and nonradiative resonant couplings between defects are ubiquitous phenomena in photonic devices used in classical and quantum information technology applications. In this work we present a first principles approach to enable quantitative predictions of the energy transfer between defects in photonic cavities, beyond the dipole-dipole approximation and including the many-body nature of the electronic states. As an example, we discuss the energy transfer from a dipole like emitter to an F center in MgO in a spherical cavity. We show that the cavity can be used to controllably enhance or suppress specific spin flip and spin conserving transitions. Specifically, we predict that a ~10 to 100 enhancement in the non-radiative resonant energy transfer rate can be gained in the case of the F center in MgO by a rather moderate cavity with Q~400, and equal suppression in the rate can be achieved by incorporating a significant energy mismatch between the electronic excitation and the cavity mode. Our framework is general and readily applicable to a wide range of devices where localized emitters are embedded in micro-spheres, core-shell nanoparticles, and dielectric Mie resonators. Hence, our approach paves the way to predict how to control energy transfer in quantum memories and in ultra-high density optical memories, and in a variety of quantum information platforms.</p>

            <p>Introducing a controlled and strong anharmonicity in mechanical systems is a present challenge of nanomechanics. In cavity optomechanics a mechanical oscillator may be made anharmonic by ponderomotively coupling its motion to the light field of a laser-driven cavity. In the regime where the mechanical resonating frequency and the single-photon coupling constant are small compared to the decay rate of the cavity field, it turns out that the quantum electromagnetic fluctuations of the laser field drive the oscillator into a high-temperature thermal state. The motional state may however be highly non-Gaussian; we show that a precise tuning of system parameters may even lead to a purely quartic effective potential for the mechanical oscillator. We present a theory that predicts the measurable signatures left by the mechanical anharmonicity. In particular, we obtain analytically and numerically the mechanical displacement spectrum, and explore the imprints of the mechanical anharmonicity on the cavity light field.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yevhenii Morozov, Anatoliy Lapchuk</p>
            <p>Quantum emitters embedded in silicon photonic cavities offer a powerful and scalable platform for label-free refractive index sensing at the nanoscale. We propose and theoretically analyze a novel sensing mechanism based on Purcell-enhanced modulation of the emitter's spontaneous emission lifetime, enabling detection of refractive index changes via time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC). In contrast to traditional resonance-shift sensors, our approach exploits the lifetime sensitivity to variations in the local density of optical states (LDOS), providing an intensity-independent, spectrally unresolvable, and CMOS-compatible sensing modality. We derive analytical expressions linking refractive index perturbations to relative lifetime shifts and identify an optimal off-resonance operation regime, where the lifetime response becomes linear and maximally sensitive to small perturbations. Parametric evaluation of the analytical expressions shows that, for moderate-quality photonic cavities (Q = 10^5 to 10^7), this method enables refractive index detection limits as low as 10^{-9} RIU, competitive with or even outperforming state-of-the-art plasmonic and microresonator sensors, yet requiring significantly simpler instrumentation. Furthermore, we show that long-lived emitters such as T-centers in silicon provide a unique advantage, allowing sub-nanosecond lifetime shifts to be resolved with standard TCSPC systems. Although room-temperature operation of quantum emitters in silicon has yet to be demonstrated, our results lay the theoretical foundation for scalable, room-temperature, quantum-enabled sensing of refractive index changes, eliminating the need for spectral resolution and cryogenic infrastructure.</p>

The quantum component is designed to enhance nonlinear representational capacity while preserving end-to-end differentiability via the PennyLane framework. To assess the impact of quantum enhancements, we conduct a comparative evaluation of QuantumRWKV and its purely classical counterpart across a suite of synthetic time-series forecasting tasks, including linear (ARMA), chaotic (Logistic Map), oscillatory (Damped Oscillation), and piecewise-regime signals. Our results reveal that the quantum-enhanced model achieves superior performance in several tasks characterized by nonlinear or chaotic dynamics-such as Chaotic Logistic, Noisy Damped Oscillator, and Sine Wave-while exhibiting limitations in tasks with sharp discontinuities or simple autoregressive structures. This study provides one of the first systematic comparisons between hybrid quantum-classical and classical recurrent models in temporal domains, highlighting when and how quantum circuits can offer tangible benefits in time-series learning. We conclude with a discussion on architectural trade-offs and potential future directions for expanding quantum integration into large-scale temporal learning systems.</p>

            <h2>Learning to Program Quantum Measurements for Machine Learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samual Yen-Chi Chen, Huan-Hsin Tseng, Hsin-Yi Lin, Shinjae Yoo</p>
            <p>The rapid advancements in quantum computing (QC) and machine learning (ML) have sparked significant interest, driving extensive exploration of quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms to address a wide range of complex challenges. The development of high-performance QML models requires expert-level expertise, presenting a key challenge to the widespread adoption of QML. Critical obstacles include the design of effective data encoding strategies and parameterized quantum circuits, both of which are vital for the performance of QML models. Furthermore, the measurement process is often neglected-most existing QML models employ predefined measurement schemes that may not align with the specific requirements of the targeted problem. We propose an innovative framework that renders the observable of a quantum system-specifically, the Hermitian matrix-trainable. This approach employs an end-to-end differentiable learning framework, enabling simultaneous optimization of the neural network used to program the parameterized observables and the standard quantum circuit parameters. Notably, the quantum observable parameters are dynamically programmed by the neural network, allowing the observables to adapt in real time based on the input data stream. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed method effectively programs observables dynamically within variational quantum circuits, achieving superior results compared to existing approaches. Notably, it delivers enhanced performance metrics, such as higher classification accuracy, thereby significantly improving the overall effectiveness of QML models.</p>

            <h2>Noise-Robust Self-Testing: Detecting Non-Locality in Noisy Non-Local Inputs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Romi Lifshitz</p>
            <p>Non-local games test for non-locality and entanglement in quantum systems and are used in self-tests for certifying quantum states in untrusted devices. However, these protocols are tailored to ideal states, so realistic noise prevents maximal violations and leaves many partially non-local states undetected. Selecting self-tests based on their 'robustness' to noise can tailor protocols to specific applications, but current literature lacks a standardized measure of noise-robustness. Creating such a measure is challenging as there is no operational measure for comparing tests of different dimensionalities and input-output settings. We propose and study three comparative measures: noise-tolerance, convincingness, and an analytic approximation of convincingness called the gapped score. Our computational experiments and analytic framework demonstrate that convincingness provides the most nuanced measure for noise-robustness. We then show that the CHSH game has the highest noise-robustness compared to more complex games (2-CHSH variants and the Magic Square Game) when given equal resources, while with unequal resources, some 2-CHSH variants can outperform CHSH at a high resource cost. This work provides the first systematic and operational framework for comparing noise-robustness in self-testing protocols, laying a foundation for theoretical advances in understanding noise-robustness of self-tests and practical improvements in quantum resource utilization.</p>

            <p>Quantum error correction (QEC) is required for large-scale computation, but incurs a significant resource overhead. Recent advances have shown that by jointly decoding logical qubits in algorithms composed of transversal gates, the number of syndrome extraction rounds can be reduced by a factor of the code distance $d$, at the cost of increased classical decoding complexity. Here, we reformulate the problem of decoding transversal circuits by directly decoding relevant logical operator products as they propagate through the circuit. This procedure transforms the decoding task into one closely resembling that of a single-qubit memory propagating through time. The resulting approach leads to fast decoding and reduced problem size while maintaining high performance. Focusing on the surface code, we prove that this method enables fault-tolerant decoding with minimum-weight perfect matching, and benchmark its performance on example circuits including magic state distillation. We find that the threshold is comparable to that of a single-qubit memory, and that the total decoding run time can be, in fact, less than that of conventional lattice surgery. Our approach enables fast correlated decoding, providing a pathway to directly extend single-qubit QEC techniques to transversal algorithms.</p>

            <h2>Decoding across transversal Clifford gates in the surface code</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marc Serra-Peralta, Mackenzie H. Shaw, Barbara M. Terhal</p>
            <p>Transversal logical gates offer the opportunity for fast and low-noise logic, particularly when interspersed by a single round of parity check measurements of the underlying code. Using such circuits for the surface code requires decoding across logical gates, complicating the decoding task. We show how one can decode across an arbitrary sequence of transversal gates for the unrotated surface code, using a fast "logical observable" minimum-weight-perfect-matching (MWPM) based decoder, and benchmark its performance in Clifford circuits under circuit-level noise. We propose windowed logical observable matching decoders to address the problem of fully efficient decoding: our basic windowed decoder is computationally efficient under the restriction of quiescent (slow) resets. Our two-step windowed decoder can be computationally inefficient but allows fast resets. For both windowed decoders we identify errors which scale sublinearly in $d$ - depending on the structure of the circuit - which can lead to logical failure, and we propose methods to adapt the decoding to remove such failures. Our work highlights the complexity and interest in efficient decoding of fast logic for the surface code.</p>

            <p>This paper introduces Genesis, the first compiler designed to support Hamiltonian Simulation on hybrid continuous-variable (CV) and discrete-variable (DV) quantum computing systems. Genesis is a two-level compilation system. At the first level, it decomposes an input Hamiltonian into basis gates using the native instruction set of the target hybrid CV-DV quantum computer. At the second level, it tackles the mapping and routing of qumodes/qubits to implement long-range interactions for the gates decomposed from the first level. Rather than a typical implementation that relies on SWAP primitives similar to qubit-based (or DV-only) systems, we propose an integrated design of connectivity-aware gate synthesis and beamsplitter SWAP insertion tailored for hybrid CV-DV systems. We also introduce an OpenQASM-like domain-specific language (DSL) named CVDV-QASM to represent Hamiltonian in terms of Pauli-exponentials and basic gate sequences from the hybrid CV-DV gate set. Genesis has successfully compiled several important Hamiltonians, including the Bose-Hubbard model, $\mathbb{Z}_2-$Higgs model, Hubbard-Holstein model, Heisenberg model and Electron-vibration coupling Hamiltonians, which are critical in domains like quantum field theory, condensed matter physics, and quantum chemistry. Our implementation is available at Genesis-CVDV-Compiler(this https URL).</p>

            <p>A quantum mechanical system of two coupled rotors (particles constrained to move on a circle) is studied from an open quantum systems point of view. One of the rotors is integrated out and the reduced density operator of the other rotor is studied. It's eigenvalues are worked out explicitly using the properties of Mathieu functions, and the von Neumann entropy, which is a standard measure of entanglement, is computed in terms of the Fourier coefficients defining the Mathieu functions. Furthermore, upon introducing a time-periodic delta kick and making one of the rotors much heavier than the other, the two-rotor system can be interpreted as a system-bath model, allowing us to introduce a series of approximations to derive a master equation of the Lindblad type describing the time-evolution of the reduced density operator.</p>

            <p>A Gaussian boson sampler (GBS) is a special-purpose quantum computer that can be practically realized at large scale in optics. Here we report on experiments in which we used a frequency-multiplexed GBS with $>400$ modes as the reservoir in the quantum-machine-learning approach of quantum reservoir computing. We evaluated the accuracy of our GBS-based reservoir computer on a variety of benchmark tasks, including spoken-vowels classification and MNIST handwritten-digit classification. We found that when the reservoir computer was given access to the correlations between measured modes of the GBS, the achieved accuracies were the same or higher than when it was only given access to the mean photon number in each mode -- and in several cases the advantage in accuracy from using the correlations was greater than 20 percentage points. This provides experimental evidence in support of theoretical predictions that access to correlations enhances the power of quantum reservoir computers. We also tested our reservoir computer when operating the reservoir with various sources of classical rather than squeezed (quantum) light and found that using squeezed light consistently resulted in the highest (or tied highest, for simple tasks) accuracies. Our work experimentally establishes that a GBS can be an effective reservoir for quantum reservoir computing and provides a practical platform for experimentally exploring the role of quantumness and correlations in quantum machine learning at very large system sizes.</p>

            <h2>Dark States of Light and the Hidden Energy in Thermal Radiation Detection</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Celso Jorge Villas-Boas, Ciro Micheletti Diniz</p>
            <p>We develop a quantum-optical framework demonstrating that thermal radiation can confine a significant portion of its energy in dark collective modes -- highly entangled photon states that, despite their photonic nature, remain decoupled from matter through standard electromagnetic interactions. In a system comprising $M$ thermal field modes, we show that only a fraction $1/M$ of the total energy is accessible to matter, while the remaining $(M-1)/M$ is stored in dark states, rendering it undetectable by conventional electromagnetic means. We also demonstrate that intensity measurements, commonly used to estimate field energy, can be misleading due to collective effects that suppress or enhance light-matter coupling. To explore further this phenomenon, we analyze a cavity QED model enclosing a single dissipative atom and show that symmetry breaking in the atom-field interaction enables access to the hidden energy stored in dark modes. While inconclusive, these findings suggest that dark states of light may underlie certain unexplained energy phenomena, pointing to a possible microscopic mechanism based on the collective structure of thermal radiation.</p>

            <p>Recent advances in quantum computing have demonstrated its potential to significantly enhance the analysis and forecasting of complex classical data. Among these, quantum reservoir computing has emerged as a particularly powerful approach, combining quantum computation with machine learning for modeling nonlinear temporal dependencies in high-dimensional time series. As with many data-driven disciplines, quantitative finance and econometrics can hugely benefit from emerging quantum technologies. In this work, we investigate the application of quantum reservoir computing for realized volatility forecasting. Our model employs a fully connected transverse-field Ising Hamiltonian as the reservoir with distinct input and memory qubits to capture temporal dependencies. The quantum reservoir computing approach is benchmarked against several econometric models and standard machine learning algorithms. The models are evaluated using multiple error metrics and the model confidence set procedures. To enhance interpretability and mitigate current quantum hardware limitations, we utilize wrapper-based forward selection for feature selection, identifying optimal subsets, and quantifying feature importance via Shapley values. Our results indicate that the proposed quantum reservoir approach consistently outperforms benchmark models across various metrics, highlighting its potential for financial forecasting despite existing quantum hardware constraints. This work serves as a proof-of-concept for the applicability of quantum computing in econometrics and financial analysis, paving the way for further research into quantum-enhanced predictive modeling as quantum hardware capabilities continue to advance.</p>

            <p>Large-scale quantum networking systems will inevitably require methods to overcome photon loss. While the no-cloning theorem forbids perfect and deterministic amplification of unknown quantum states, probabilistic heralded amplification schemes offer a viable path forward. Yet, for over a decade, successful multi-photon state amplification has remained out of reach, despite the fundamental importance of such states in achieving quantum advantage in optical applications. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a high-fidelity and post-selection-free amplifier for multi-photon states. We achieve heralded amplification of states with up to two photons in a single optical mode, with over a hundredfold intensity gain, and verify the coherence-preserving operation of our scheme. Our approach is scalable to higher photon numbers and enables noiseless amplification of complex multi-photon quantum states, with applications in large-scale quantum communication systems, distributed quantum metrology, and information processing.</p>

            <h2>Disentangling signalling and causal influence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kathleen Barsse, Paolo Perinotti, Alessandro Tosini, Leonardo Vaglini</p>
            <p>The causal effects activated by a quantum interaction are studied, modelling the last one as a bipartite unitary channel. The two parties, say Alice and Bob, can use the channel to exchange messages -- i.e. to signal. On the other hand, the most general form of causal influence includes also the possibility for Alice, via a local operation on her system, to modify Bob's correlations and viceversa. The presence or absence of these two effects are equivalent, but when they both occur, they can differ in their magnitude. We study the properties of two functions that quantify the amount of signalling and causal influence conveyed by an arbitrary unitary channel. The functions are proved to be continuous and monotonically increasing with respect to the tensor product of channels. Monotonicity is instead disproved in the case of sequential composition. Signalling and causal influence are analytically computed for the quantum SWAP and CNOT gates, in the single use scenario, in the $n$-parallel uses scenario, and in the asymptotic regime. A finite gap is found between signalling and causal influence for the quantum CNOT, thus proving the existence of extra causal effects that cannot be explained in terms of communication only. However, the gap disappears in the asymptotic limit of an infinite number of parallel uses, leaving room for asymptotic equivalence between signalling and causal influence.</p>

            <p>A brain-computer interface (BCI) system enables direct communication between the brain and external devices, offering significant potential for assistive technologies and advanced human-computer interaction. Despite progress, BCI systems face persistent challenges, including signal variability, classification inefficiency, and difficulty adapting to individual users in real time. In this study, we propose a novel hybrid quantum learning model, termed QSVM-QNN, which integrates a Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) with a Quantum Neural Network (QNN), to improve classification accuracy and robustness in EEG-based BCI tasks. Unlike existing models, QSVM-QNN combines the decision boundary capabilities of QSVM with the expressive learning power of QNN, leading to superior generalization performance. The proposed model is evaluated on two benchmark EEG datasets, achieving high accuracies of 0.990 and 0.950, outperforming both classical and standalone quantum models. To demonstrate real-world viability, we further validated the robustness of QNN, QSVM, and QSVM-QNN against six realistic quantum noise models, including bit flip and phase damping. These experiments reveal that QSVM-QNN maintains stable performance under noisy conditions, establishing its applicability for deployment in practical, noisy quantum environments. Beyond BCI, the proposed hybrid quantum architecture is generalizable to other biomedical and time-series classification tasks, offering a scalable and noise-resilient solution for next-generation neurotechnological systems.</p>

In this paper, we first review the foundational principles underlying DIQKD, including Bell tests and security definitions. We then examine a range of protocol designs, including CHSH-based schemes, and non-local game frameworks, alongside with their security proofs. We also assess recent experimental implementations and discuss source architectures, detection technologies, and finite-key analyses. Finally, we identify current open problems, such as noise tolerance, generation rates, and integration with quantum networks, and outline promising directions for future research to realize robust, high-performance DIQKD.</p>

            <p>Solid state quantum devices, operated at dilution cryostat temperatures, are relying on microwave signals to both drive and read-out their quantum states. These signals are transmitted into the cryogenic environment, out of it towards detection devices, or even between quantum systems by well-designed waveguides, almost lossless when made of superconducting materials. Here we report on the quantum theory that describes the simplest Cartesian-type geometries: parallel plates, and rectangular tubes. The aim of the article is twofold: first on a technical and pragmatic level, we provide a full and compact quantum description of the different traveling wave families supported by these guides. Second, on an ontological level, we interpret the results and discuss the nature of the light fields corresponding to each mode family. The concept of potential difference is extended from transverse electric-magnetic (TEM) waves to all configurations, by means of a specific gauge fixing. The generalized flux $\phi$ introduced in the context of quantum electronics becomes here essential: it is the scalar field, conjugate of a charge $Q$, that confines light within the electrodes, let them be real or virtual. The gap in the dispersion relations of non-TEM waves turns out to be linked either to a potential energy necessary for the photon confinement, or to a kinetic energy arising from a photon mass. We finally compute the field zero-point fluctuations in every configuration. The theory is predictive: the lowest transverse magnetic (TM) modes should have smaller quantum noise than the higher ones, which at large wavevectors recover a conventional value similar to TEM and transverse electric (TE) ones. Such low-noise modes might be particularly useful for the routing of quantum information.</p>

            <p>Data encoding plays a fundamental and distinctive role in Quantum Machine Learning (QML). While classical approaches process data directly as vectors, QML may require transforming classical data into quantum states through encoding circuits, known as quantum feature maps or quantum embeddings. This step leverages the inherently high-dimensional and non-linear nature of Hilbert space, enabling more efficient data separation in complex feature spaces that may be inaccessible to classical methods. This encoding part significantly affects the performance of the QML model, so it is important to choose the right encoding method for the dataset to be encoded. However, this choice is generally arbitrary, since there is no "universal" rule for knowing which encoding to choose based on a specific set of data. There are currently a variety of encoding methods using different quantum logic gates. We studied the most commonly used types of encoding methods and benchmarked them using different datasets.</p>

Of technological interest in the presence of magnetic fields are multi-spatial evolution scenarios beyond pure state descriptions. The two-electron density matrix becomes eight-dimensional even for two-dimensional spatial cases and is thus computationally prohibitive. In this work, we present two new approximations of the two-electron Wigner equation that aim at computational feasibility: a BBGKY approach for reducing the number of variables and a field approximation of the Coulomb-Wigner operator. They exhibit different conceptual aspects that illustrate alternative viewpoints to entanglement: Only the evolution provided by the latter model satisfies the orthodox definition of entanglement. Our analysis, based on the Fredholm integral representation of the models, allows us to develop an intuitive picture and physical insight into the process.</p>

            <p>We propose a Hamiltonian-level framework for non-Markovian quantum reservoir computing directly tailored for analog hardware implementations. By dividing the reservoir into a system block and an environment block and evolving their joint state under a unified Hamiltonian, our architecture naturally embeds memory backflow by harnessing entanglement-induced information backflow with tunable coupling strengths. Numerical benchmarks on short-term memory tasks demonstrate that operating in non-Markovian regimes yields significantly slower memory decay compared to the Markovian limit. Further analyzing the echo-state property (ESP), showing that the non-Markovian quantum reservoir evolves from two different initial states, they do not converge to the same trajectory even after a long time, strongly suggesting that the ESP is effectively violated. Our work provides the first demonstration in quantum reservoir computing that strong non-Markovianity can fundamentally violate the ESP, such that conventional linear-regression readouts fail to deliver stable training and inference. Finally, we experimentally showed that, with an appropriate time-evolution step size, the non-Markovian reservoir exhibits superior performance on higher-order nonlinear autoregressive moving-average(NARMA) tasks.</p>

            <h2>MicroCrypt Assumptions with Quantum Input Sampling and Pseudodeterminism: Constructions and Separations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammed Barhoush, Ryo Nishimaki, Takashi Yamakawa</p>
            <p>We investigate two natural relaxations of quantum cryptographic primitives. The first involves quantum input sampling, where inputs are generated by a quantum algorithm rather than sampled uniformly at random. Applying this to pseudorandom generators ($\textsf{PRG}$s) and pseudorandom states ($\textsf{PRS}$s), leads to the notions denoted as $\textsf{PRG}^{qs}$ and $\textsf{PRS}^{qs}$, respectively. The second relaxation, $\bot$-pseudodeterminism, relaxes the determinism requirement by allowing the output to be a special symbol $\bot$ on an inverse-polynomial fraction of inputs. We demonstrate an equivalence between bounded-query logarithmic-size $\textsf{PRS}^{qs}$, logarithmic-size $\textsf{PRS}^{qs}$, and $\textsf{PRG}^{qs}$. Moreover, we establish that $\textsf{PRG}^{qs}$ can be constructed from $\bot$-$\textsf{PRG}$s, which in turn were built from logarithmic-size $\textsf{PRS}$. Interestingly, these relations remain unknown in the uniform key setting. To further justify these relaxed models, we present black-box separations. Our results suggest that $\bot$-pseudodeterministic primitives may be weaker than their deterministic counterparts, and that primitives based on quantum input sampling may be inherently weaker than those using uniform sampling. Together, these results provide numerous new insights into the structure and hierarchy of primitives within MicroCrypt.</p>

            <p>In this work, we propose a general protocol for distributed quantum computing that accommodates arbitrary unknown subroutines. It can be applied to scale up quantum computing through multi-chip interconnection, as well as to tasks such as estimating unknown parameters or processes for circuit depth reduction and constructing secure quantum cryptographic protocols. Our protocol builds upon a few techniques we develop, such as the oblivious quantum teleportation and control, which can circumvent quantum no-go theorems on the manipulation of unknown objects. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this protocol can be physically implemented using currently available quantum computing platforms. These results suggest that our framework could provide a foundation for developing more advanced quantum algorithms and protocols in the future.</p>

            <p>Quantum multiparameter estimation promises to extend quantum advantage to the simultaneous high-precision measurements of multiple physical quantities. However, realizing this capability in practical quantum sensors under realistic conditions remains challenging due to intrinsic system imperfections. Here, we experimentally demonstrate multiparameter estimation using a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, a widely adopted solid-state quantum sensor. Leveraging electronic-nuclear spin entanglement and optimized Bell state measurement at room temperature, we simultaneously estimate the amplitude, detuning, and phase of a microwave drive from a single measurement sequence. Despite practical constraints, our results achieve linear sensitivity scaling for all parameters with respect to interrogation time. This work bridges the gap between foundational quantum estimation theory and real-world quantum sensing, opening pathways toward enhanced multiparameter quantum sensors suitable for diverse scientific and technological applications.</p>

            <p>The use of quantum computing for machine learning is among the most exciting applications of quantum technologies. Researchers are developing quantum models inspired by classical ones to find some possible quantum advantages over classical approaches. A major challenge in the development and testing of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) algorithms is the lack of datasets specifically designed for quantum algorithms. Existing datasets, often borrowed from classical machine learning, need modifications to be compatible with current noisy quantum hardware. In this work, we utilize a dataset generated by Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices in a format directly compatible with the proposed quantum algorithms, eliminating the need for feature reduction. Among quantum-inspired machine learning algorithms, the Projected Quantum Kernel (PQK) stands out for its elegant solution of projecting the data encoded in the Hilbert space into a classical space. We detail how a PQK approach can be employed to construct a prediction model on IoT data. We compare PQK with common Quantum Kernel methods and their classical counterparts, while also investigating the impact of various feature maps in encoding classical IoT data into quantum computers.</p>

            <h2>Large-Scale Tree-Type Photonic Cluster State Generation with Recurrent Quantum Photonic Neural Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jacob Ewaniuk, Bhavin J. Shastri, Nir Rotenberg</p>
            <p>Large, multi-dimensional clusters of entangled photons are among the most powerful resources for emerging quantum technologies, as they are predicted to enable global quantum networks or universal quantum computation. Here, we propose an entirely new architecture and protocol for their generation based on recurrent quantum photonic neural networks (QPNNs) and focusing on tree-type cluster states. Unlike other approaches, QPNN-based generators are not limited by the the coherence of quantum emitters or by probabilistic multi-photon operations, enabling arbitrary scaling only limited by loss (which, unavoidably, also affects all other methods). We show that a single QPNN can learn to perform all of the many different operations needed to create a cluster state, from photon routing to entanglement generation, all with near-perfect fidelity and at loss-limited rates, even when it is created from imperfect photonic components. Although these losses ultimately place a limit on the size of the cluster states, we show that state-of-the-art photonics should already allow for clusters of 60 photons, which can grow into the 100s with modest improvements to losses. Finally, we present an analysis of a one-way quantum repeater based on these states, determining the requisite platform quality for a global quantum network and highlighting the potential of the QPNN to play a vital role in high-impact quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>A quantum unstructured search algorithm for discrete optimisation: the use case of portfolio optimisation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Titos Matsakos, Adrian Lomas</p>
            <p>We propose a quantum unstructured search algorithm to find the extrema or roots of discrete functions, $f(\mathbf{x})$, such as the objective functions in combinatorial and other discrete optimisation problems. The first step of the Quantum Search for Extrema and Roots Algorithm (QSERA) is to translate conditions of the form $f(\mathbf{x}_*) \simeq f_*$, where $f_*$ is the extremum or zero, to an unstructured search problem for $\mathbf{x}_*$. This is achieved by mapping $f(\mathbf{x})$ to a function $u(z)$ to create a quantum oracle, such that $u(z_*) = 1$ and $u(z \neq z_*) = 0$. The next step is to employ Grover's algorithm to find $z_*$, which offers a quadratic speed-up over classical algorithms. The number of operations needed to map $f(\mathbf{x})$ to $u(z)$ determines the accuracy of the result and the circuit depth. We describe the implementation of QSERA by assembling a quantum circuit for portfolio optimisation, which can be formulated as a combinatorial problem. QSERA can handle objective functions with higher order terms than the commonly-used Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimisation (QUBO) framework. Moreover, while QSERA requires some a priori knowledge of the extrema of $f(\mathbf{x})$, it can still find approximate solutions even if the conditions are not exactly satisfied.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Optimization via Gradient-Based Hamiltonian Descent</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiaqi Leng, Bin Shi</p>
            <p>With rapid advancements in machine learning, first-order algorithms have emerged as the backbone of modern optimization techniques, owing to their computational efficiency and low memory requirements. Recently, the connection between accelerated gradient methods and damped heavy-ball motion, particularly within the framework of Hamiltonian dynamics, has inspired the development of innovative quantum algorithms for continuous optimization. One such algorithm, Quantum Hamiltonian Descent (QHD), leverages quantum tunneling to escape saddle points and local minima, facilitating the discovery of global solutions in complex optimization landscapes. However, QHD faces several challenges, including slower convergence rates compared to classical gradient methods and limited robustness in highly non-convex problems due to the non-local nature of quantum states. Furthermore, the original QHD formulation primarily relies on function value information, which limits its effectiveness. Inspired by insights from high-resolution differential equations that have elucidated the acceleration mechanisms in classical methods, we propose an enhancement to QHD by incorporating gradient information, leading to what we call gradient-based QHD. Gradient-based QHD achieves faster convergence and significantly increases the likelihood of identifying global solutions. Numerical simulations on challenging problem instances demonstrate that gradient-based QHD outperforms existing quantum and classical methods by at least an order of magnitude.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kazuma Nagao, Daisuke Yamamoto, Seiji Yunoki, Ippei Danshita</p>
            <p>Using the discrete truncated Wigner approximation (dTWA), we investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of ultracold bosons confined in optical kagome lattices, focusing on both unfrustrated positive and frustrated negative hopping regimes. We consider a protocol in which the system is initialized in a Mott insulating state at unit filling, and the hopping amplitude is gradually increased from zero. For positive hopping, the melting of the Mott insulator is accompanied by the emergence of a sharp peak in the momentum distribution at the $\Gamma$ point of the lowest band, signaling the onset of superfluidity. In contrast, for negative hopping, the Mott insulator melts into a highly nontrivial state without long-range phase coherence, characterized instead by a broad momentum distribution within the flat band, consistent with recent experimental observations. These results demonstrate the applicability of dTWA to highly frustrated quantum systems and offer a new route for numerically exploring the dynamics of frustrated quantum magnets.</p>

            <h2>Unified Structural Embedding of Orbifold Sigma Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco D'Agostino</p>
            <p>This paper introduces a unified structural embedding framework for orbifold sigma models that systematically incorporates twisted sectors, singularities, and smooth regions into a single algebraic object. Traditional approaches to orbifold theories often treat sectors separately, requiring ad hoc regularizations near singularities and failing to capture inter-sector interactions under renormalization group flow. The framework presented herein resolves these limitations through the construction of a unified orbifold algebra $\mathcal{A}(X/G)$ that decomposes canonically into idempotent-projected components corresponding to conjugacy classes of the finite group $G$ acting on the target space $X$. A generalized Laplacian operator is defined on this algebra, enabling the construction of a one-parameter family of renormalization group compatible endomorphisms that preserve the sector structure while implementing scale transformations. The formalism is shown to recover conventional sigma model results in the smooth limit where $G$ approaches the trivial group, with the internal renormalization group derivation reducing to the standard one-loop beta function proportional to the Ricci tensor. Several examples demonstrate the framework's utility, including explicit calculations for the $\mathbb{C}/\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold that exhibit the decomposition into untwisted and twisted field contributions. This approach provides a mathematically rigorous foundation for quantum field theories on singular spaces while maintaining compatibility with established results for smooth manifolds.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pranay Gorantla, Abhinav Prem, Nathanan Tantivasadakarn, Dominic J. Williamson</p>
            <p>We present a new perspective on the $p$-string condensation procedure for constructing 3+1D fracton phases by implementing this process via the gauging of higher-form symmetries. Specifically, we show that gauging a 1-form symmetry in 3+1D that is generated by Abelian anyons in isotropic stacks of 2+1D topological orders naturally results in a 3+1D $p$-string condensed phase, providing a controlled non-perturbative construction that realizes fracton orders. This approach clarifies the symmetry principles underlying $p$-string condensation and generalizes the familiar connection between anyon condensation and one-form gauging in two spatial dimensions. We demonstrate this correspondence explicitly in both field theories and lattice models: in field theory, we derive the foliated field theory description of the $\mathbb{Z}_N$ X-Cube model by gauging a higher-form symmetry in stacks of 2+1D $\mathbb{Z}_N$ gauge theories; on the lattice, we show how gauging a diagonal 1-form symmetry in isotropic stacks of $G$-graded string-net models leads to string-membrane-nets hosting restricted mobility excitations. This perspective naturally generalizes to spatial dimensions $d \geq 2$ and provides a step towards building an algebraic theory of $p$-string condensation.</p>

            <p>Quantum annealing provides a powerful platform for simulating magnetic materials and realizing statistical physics models, presenting a compelling alternative to classical Monte Carlo methods. We demonstrate that quantum annealers can accurately reproduce phase diagrams and simulate critical phenomena without suffering from the critical slowing down that often affects classical algorithms. To illustrate this, we study the piled-up dominoes model, which interpolates between the ferromagnetic 2D Ising model and Villain's fully frustrated ``odd model''. We map out its phase diagram and for the first time, employ finite-size scaling and Binder cumulants on a quantum annealer to study critical exponents for thermal phase transitions. Our method achieves systematic temperature control by tuning the energy scale of the Hamiltonian, eliminating the need to adjust the physical temperature of the quantum hardware. This work demonstrates how, through fine-tuning and calibration, a quantum annealer can be employed to apply sophisticated finite-size scaling techniques from statistical mechanics. Our results establish quantum annealers as robust statistical physics simulators, offering a novel pathway for studying phase transitions and critical behavior.</p>

            <p>Monolayer V2O3, a two-dimensional magnetic topological insulator with intrinsic ferromagnetic order and a nontrivial band gap, offers a promising platform for realizing quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) states. Using first-principles density functional theory calculations, we systematically investigate the impact of substrate selection on its electronic and topological properties. By modeling heterostructures with van der Waals (vdW) substrates, we demonstrate that non-magnetic substrates such as h-BN preserve the QAH phase with a Chern number C = 1, maintaining gapless chiral edge states. In contrast, ferromagnetic substrates induce extra electrons, destroying the topological order by shifting the Fermi level. These findings establish substrate engineering as a pivotal strategy for experimental realization of dissipationless edge transport in V2O3-based vdW heterostructures, advancing their potential applications as low-power topological electronics.</p>

            <p>Characterizing the ground state properties of quantum systems is fundamental to capturing their behavior but computationally challenging. Recent advances in AI have introduced novel approaches, with diverse machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models proposed for this purpose. However, the necessity and specific role of DL models in these tasks remain unclear, as prior studies often employ varied or impractical quantum resources to construct datasets, resulting in unfair comparisons. To address this, we systematically benchmark DL models against traditional ML approaches across three families of Hamiltonian, scaling up to 127 qubits in three crucial ground-state learning tasks while enforcing equivalent quantum resource usage. Our results reveal that ML models often achieve performance comparable to or even exceeding that of DL approaches across all tasks. Furthermore, a randomization test demonstrates that measurement input features have minimal impact on DL models' prediction performance. These findings challenge the necessity of current DL models in many quantum system learning scenarios and provide valuable insights into their effective utilization.</p>

The rotation is introduced by a metric obtained by a Galilean transformation from a rest frame. The constraint $\Omega R<c$ must be obeyed to maintain causality. To compute the vacuum energy, we use an imaginary frequency representation and the well-known uniform asymptotic expansion of the Bessel function. We use the zeta-functional regularization and separate the divergent contributions, which we discuss in terms of the heat kernel coefficients. The divergences are found to be independent of rotation. The renormalized finite part of the vacuum energy is negative and becomes more negative for larger rotation frequencies.</p>

Specifically, we take the ground state of atomic carbon, i. e., $(1s^22s^22p^2,{}^3\text{P}^\text{e})$ as a prototype. We observe and quantify the strong dependency on the relative carrier-envelope phase (CEP) of the two-color pulses and on the spatial orientation of the electronic target states. Notably, we observe that the photoelectron momentum distributions (PMDs) vary as a function of the CEP due to the interfering two-color one- and two-photon ionization paths. Besides, the PMD region corresponding to one-photon photoionization remains unaffected, with varying CEP, depending only on the ellipticity of the pulse, the central photon frequency and the magnetic quantum number of the initial state. Therefore, comparing the one-photon ionization electron ejection direction following absorption of a single ($2\omega$) photon with that of the two-photon ionization channel following absorption of two photon each with energy $\omega$ we may extrapolate information on the CEP difference between the two pulses.</p>

The spin relaxation is assisted by the emission of acoustic phonons via the bond-length change and deformation potential mechanisms and $1/f$ charge noise. In the perpendicular magnetic-field dependence of the spin relaxation rate $T_1^{-1}$, we predict a monotonic increase of $T_1^{-1}$ at higher fields where the electron-phonon coupling via the deformation potential plays a dominant role in spin relaxation. We show a less pronounced dip in $T_1^{-1}$ at lower magnetic fields due to the competition between the electron-phonon coupling due to bond-length change and $1/f$ charge noise. Finally, detailed comparisons of the magnetic-field dependence of the spin relaxation with the existing experiments by Banszerus et al. [Nat. Commun. 13, 3637 (2022)] and Gächter et al.

Then a derivation of the full quantum theory is given using mesoscopic quantisation techniques in terms of discrete mode operators. This results in a Hamiltonian that describes the process of parametric amplification.

            <p>In this paper, we introduce an algorithm for extracting topological data from translation invariant generalized Pauli stabilizer codes in two-dimensional systems, focusing on the analysis of anyon excitations and string operators. The algorithm applies to $\mathbb{Z}_d$ qudits, including instances where $d$ is a nonprime number. This capability allows the identification of topological orders that differ from the $\mathbb{Z}_d$ toric codes. It extends our understanding beyond the established theorem that Pauli stabilizer codes for $\mathbb{Z}_p$ qudits (with $p$ being a prime) are equivalent to finite copies of $\mathbb{Z}_p$ toric codes and trivial stabilizers. The algorithm is designed to determine all anyons and their string operators, enabling the computation of their fusion rules, topological spins, and braiding statistics. The method converts the identification of topological orders into computational tasks, including Gaussian elimination, the Hermite normal form, and the Smith normal form of truncated Laurent polynomials. Furthermore, the algorithm provides a systematic approach for studying quantum error-correcting codes. We apply it to various codes, such as self-dual CSS quantum codes modified from the 2d honeycomb color code and non-CSS quantum codes that contain the double semion topological order or the six-semion topological order.</p>

            <p>Solving combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) is a promising application of quantum computation, with the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) being one of the most studied quantum algorithms for solving them. However, multiple factors make the parameter search of the QAOA a hard optimization problem. In this work, we study transfer learning (TL), a methodology to reuse pre-trained QAOA parameters of one problem instance into different COP instances. This methodology can be used to alleviate the necessity of classical optimization to find good parameters for individual problems. To this end, we select small cases of the traveling salesman problem (TSP), the bin packing problem (BPP), the knapsack problem (KP), the weighted maximum cut (MaxCut) problem, the maximal independent set (MIS) problem, and portfolio optimization (PO), and find optimal $\beta$ and $\gamma$ parameters for p layers. We compare how well the parameters found for one problem adapt to the others. Among the different problems, BPP is the one that produces the best transferable parameters, maintaining the probability of finding the optimal solution above a quadratic speedup over random guessing for problem sizes up to 42 qubits and p = 10 layers. Using the BPP parameters, we perform experiments on IonQ Harmony and Aria, Rigetti Aspen-M-3, and IBM Brisbane of MIS instances for up to 18 qubits. The results indicate that IonQ Aria yields the best overlap with the ideal probability distribution. Additionally, we show that cross-platform TL is possible using the D-Wave Advantage quantum annealer with the parameters found for BPP. We show an improvement in performance compared to the default protocols for MIS with up to 170 qubits. Our results suggest that there are QAOA parameters that generalize well for different COPs and annealing protocols.</p>

            <h2>Complexity of graph-state preparation by Clifford circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Soh Kumabe, Ryuhei Mori, Yusei Yoshimura</p>
            <p>In this work, we study the complexity of graph-state preparation. We consider general quantum algorithms consisting of Clifford operations acting on at most two qubits for graph-state preparations. We define the CZ-complexity of a graph state $|G\rangle$ as the minimum number of two-qubit Clifford operations (excluding single-qubit Clifford operations) for generating $|G\rangle$ from a trivial state $|0\rangle^{\otimes n}$. We first prove that a graph state $|G\rangle$ is generated by at most $t$ two-qubit Clifford operations if and only if $|G\rangle$ is generated by at most $t$ controlled-Z (CZ) operations. We next prove that a graph state $|G\rangle$ is generated from another graph state $|H\rangle$ by $t$ CZ operations if and only if the graph $G$ is generated from $H$ by some combinatorial graph transformation with cost $t$. As the main results, we show a connection between the CZ-complexity of graph state $|G\rangle$ and the rank-width of the graph $G$. Indeed, we prove that for any graph $G$ with $n$ vertices and rank-width $r$, 1. The CZ-complexity of $|G\rangle$ is $O(rn)$. 2. If $G$ is connected, the CZ-complexity of $|G\rangle$ is at least $n + r - 2$. We also demonstrate the existence of graph states whose CZ-complexities are close to the upper and lower bounds. Finally, we present quantum algorithms for preparing graph states for three specific graph classes related to intervals: interval graphs, interval containment graphs, and circle graphs. We prove that the CZ-complexity is $O(n)$ for interval graphs, and $O(n\log n)$ for both interval containment graphs and circle graphs.</p>

            <h2>Quantum State Evolution and Berry Potentials at Exceptional Points and Quantum Phase Transitions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chia-Yi Ju, Fu-Hsiang Huang</p>
            <p>The behavior of quantum states at exceptional points and at critical points associated with quantum phase transitions is intriguing yet puzzling. In this study, we present an alternative method for obtaining the Berry potentials using the evolution generator along the parameter induced dimension and demonstrate that they are singular at these critical points. Although these singularities may appear to indicate a breakdown in quantum state evolution, we show that the information carried by quantum states evolving across these critical points is not destroyed. Specifically, when the evolution generator of the full Hilbert space bundle is taken into account, the quantum states remain insensitive to the critical points. In physical terms, it's similar to the classical image of an object smoothly passing through a black hole's event horizon. Further similarities between exceptional points and quantum phase transitions are explored in this work.</p>

            <h2>Further results on the power-law decay of the fraction of the mixed eigenstates in kicked-top model with mixed-type classical phase space</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hua Yan, Qian Wang, Marko Robnik</p>
            <p>By using the Krylov subspace technique to generate the spin coherent states in kicked top model, a prototype model for studying quantum chaos, the accessible system size for studying the Husimi functions of eigenstates can be much larger than that reported in the literature and our previous study Phys. Rev. E 108, 054217 (2023) [arXiv:2308.04824]. In the fully chaotic kicked top, we find that the mean Wehrl entropy localization measure approaches the prediction given by the Circular Unitary Ensemble. In the mixed-type case, we identify mixed eigenstates by the overlap of the Husimi function with regular and chaotic regions in classical compact phase space. Numerically, we show that the fraction of mixed eigenstates scales as $j^{-\zeta}$, a power-law decay as the system size $j$ increases, across nearly two orders of magnitude. This provides supporting evidence for the principle of uniform semiclassical condensation of Husimi functions and the Berry-Robnik picture in the semiclassical limit.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ray Ganardi, Tulja Varun Kondra, Nelly H.Y. Ng, Alexander Streltsov</p>
            <p>A central question since the beginning of quantum information science is how two distant parties can convert one entangled state into another. It has been conjectured that such conversions could be executed reversibly in an asymptotic regime, mirroring the reversible nature of Carnot cycles in classical thermodynamics. While a conclusive proof of this conjecture has been missing so far, earlier studies have excluded reversible entanglement manipulation in various settings. In this work, we show that arbitrary mixed state entanglement transformations can be made reversible under local operations and classical communication, when assisted by an entanglement battery--an auxiliary quantum system that stores and supplies entanglement in a way that ensures no net entanglement is lost. In particular, the rate of transformation in the asymptotic limit can be quantitatively expressed as a ratio of entanglement present within the quantum states involved. Our setting allows to consider different entanglement quantifiers which give rise to unique principles governing state transformations, effectively constituting diverse manifestations of a ``second law'' of entanglement manipulation. These findings resolve a long-standing open question on the reversible manipulation of entangled states and are also applicable to multipartite entanglement and other quantum resource theories, including quantum thermodynamics.</p>

PCS provides protection on the targeted qubits and generally requires less resource overhead than standard quantum error correction and detection codes.

We also introduce a recursive version of PCS that generates a family of distance 2 quantum codes that are locally equivalent to CSS codes. Our analytical results are benchmarked against BBPSSW in comparable scenarios. We also perform simulations with noisy gates for entanglement swapping and attain fidelity improvements. Lastly, we discuss various setups and graph state properties of PCS.</p>

            <h2>Rise of conditionally clean ancillae for efficient quantum circuit constructions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tanuj Khattar, Craig Gidney</p>
            <p>We introduce conditionally clean ancilla qubits, a new quantum resource, recently explored by [NZS24], that bridges the gap between traditional clean and dirty ancillae. Like dirty ancillae, they begin and end in an unknown state and can be borrowed from existing system qubits, avoiding the space overhead of explicit qubit allocation. Like clean ancillae, they can be treated as initialized in a known state within specific computations, thus avoiding the overhead of toggle detection required for dirty ancillae. We present new circuit constructions leveraging conditionally clean ancillae to achieve lower gate counts and depths, particularly with limited ancilla availability. Specifically, we provide constructions for: (a) $n$-controlled NOT using $2n$ Toffolis and $O(\log{n})$ depth given 2 clean ancillae. (b) $n$-qubit incrementer using $3n$ Toffolis given $\log_2^*{n}$ clean ancillae. (c) $n$-qubit quantum-classical comparator using $3n$ Toffolis given $\log_2^*{n}$ clean ancillae. (d) unary iteration over $[0,N)$ using $2.5N$ Toffolis given $\log_2^*{n}$ clean ancillae. (e) unary iteration via skew tree over $[0, N)$ using $1.25N$ Toffolis given $n$ dirty ancillae. We also introduce laddered toggle detection, a technique to replace clean ancillae with dirty ancillae in all our constructions, incurring a 2x Toffoli gate overhead. Our results demonstrate that conditionally clean ancillae are a valuable tool for quantum circuit design, especially in the resource-constrained early fault-tolerant era.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wojciech Górecki, Francesco Albarelli, Simone Felicetti, Roberto Di Candia, Lorenzo Maccone</p>
            <p>Quantum entanglement and coherence often allow for protocols that outperform classical ones in estimating a system's parameter. When using infinite-dimensional probes (such as a bosonic mode), one could in principle obtain infinite precision in a finite time for both classical and quantum protocols, which makes it hard to quantify potential quantum advantage. However, such a situation is unphysical, as it would require infinite resources, so one needs to impose some additional constraint: typically the average energy employed by the probe is finite. Here we treat both energy and time as a resource, showing that, in the presence of noise, there is a nontrivial interplay between the average energy and the time devoted to the estimation. Our results are valid for the most general metrological schemes (e.g. adaptive schemes which may involve entanglement with external ancillae or any kind of continuous measurement). We apply recently derived precision bounds for all parameters characterizing the paradigmatic case of a bosonic mode, subject to Lindbladian noise. We show how the time employed in the estimation should be partitioned in order to achieve the best possible precision. In most cases, the optimal performance may be obtained without the necessity of adaptivity or entanglement with ancilla. We compare results with classical strategies. Interestingly, for temperature estimation, applying a fast-prepare-and-measure protocol with Fock states provides better scaling with the number of photons than any classical strategy.</p>

            <p>In order to enable the sequential implementation of quantum information theoretic protocols in the continuous variable framework, we propose two schemes for resource reusability, resource-splitting protocol and unsharp homodyne measurements. We demonstrate the advantage offered by the first scheme in implementing sequential attempts at continuous variable teleportation when the protocol fails in the previous round. In the second scheme, unsharp quadrature measurements are employed to implement the detection of entanglement between several pairs of observers. Under specific conditions, our calculations show that it is possible to successfully witness the entanglement of the same two-mode state, sequentially by as many as five observers.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michael Reitz, Arghadip Koner, Joel Yuen-Zhou</p>
            <p>We introduce a theoretical framework that allows for the systematic and efficient description of the ultrafast nonlinear response of molecular polaritons, i.e., hybrid light-matter states, in the collective regime of large numbers of molecules $\mathcal N$ coupled to the cavity photon mode. Our approach is based on a semiclassical, mean-field evolution of the molecular Hamiltonian and the cavity field, which is complemented by a perturbative expansion of both light and matter counterparts in the input fields entering the cavity. In addition, expansion in terms of the pulse phases enables us to disentangle different excitation pathways in Liouville space, thereby distinguishing contributions to the nonlinear response. The formalism extends traditional free-space nonlinear spectroscopy by incorporating the feedback of matter onto the light field via the induced polarization. We demonstrate the utility of the framework by applying it to the calculation of pump-probe polariton spectra and show how, by storing the pulses, the cavity facilitates additional excitation pathways, which can be used to isolate purely bright state contributions. Our method, which does not scale with $\mathcal N$, is broadly applicable and can be extended to model a wide range of current experiments investigating the dynamical nonlinear response of hybrid light-matter states.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Max McGinley, Wen Wei Ho, Daniel Malz</p>
            <p>We analyse the entanglement structure of states generated by random constant-depth two-dimensional quantum circuits, followed by projective measurements of a subset of sites. By deriving a rigorous lower bound on the average entanglement entropy of such post-measurement states, we prove that macroscopic long-ranged entanglement is generated above some constant critical depth in several natural classes of circuit architectures, which include brickwork circuits and random holographic tensor networks. This behaviour had been conjectured based on previous works, which utilize non-rigorous methods such as replica theory calculations, or work in regimes where the local Hilbert space dimension grows with system size. To establish our lower bound, we develop new replica-free theoretical techniques that leverage tools from multi-user quantum information theory, which are of independent interest, allowing us to map the problem onto a statistical mechanics model of self-avoiding walks without requiring large local Hilbert space dimension. Our findings have consequences for the complexity of classically simulating sampling from random shallow circuits, and of contracting tensor networks: First, we show that standard algorithms based on matrix product states which are used for both these tasks will fail above some constant depth and bond dimension, respectively. In addition, we also prove that these random constant-depth quantum circuits cannot be simulated by any classical circuit of sublogarithmic depth.</p>

This work introduces and proves, for the first time, the necessary and sufficient conditions for the optimality of the Petz map in terms of entanglement fidelity. In some special cases, the violation of this condition can be easily characterized by a simple commutator that can be efficiently computed. We provide multiple examples that substantiate our new findings.</p>

            <p>We identify and interpret the possible quantum thermal machine regimes with a transverse-field Ising model as the working substance. In general, understanding the emergence of such regimes in a many-body quantum system is challenging due to the dependence on the many energy levels in the system. By considering infinitesimal work strokes, we can understand the operation from equilibrium properties of the system. We find that infinitesimal work strokes enable both heat engine and accelerator operation, with the output and boundaries of operation described by macroscopic properties of the system, in particular the net transverse magnetization. At low temperatures, the regimes of operation and performance can be understood from quasiparticles in the system, while at high temperatures an expansion of the free energy in powers of inverse temperature describes the operation. The understanding generalises to larger work strokes when the temperature difference between the hot and cold reservoirs is large. For hot and cold reservoirs close in temperature, a sufficiently large work stroke can enable refrigerator and heater regimes. Our results and method of analysis will prove useful in understanding the possible regimes of operation of quantum many-body thermal machines more generally.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sébastien Lord</p>
            <p>A quantum tamper-evident encryption scheme is a non-interactive symmetric-key encryption scheme mapping classical messages to quantum ciphertexts such that an honest recipient of a ciphertext can detect with high probability any meaningful eavesdropping. This quantum cryptographic primitive was first introduced by Gottesman in 2003. Beyond formally defining this security notion, Gottesman's work had three main contributions: showing that any quantum authentication scheme is also a tamper-evident scheme, noting that a quantum key distribution scheme can be constructed from any tamper-evident scheme, and constructing a prepare-and-measure tamper-evident scheme using only Wiesner states inspired by Shor and Preskill's proof of security for the BB84 quantum key distribution scheme. In this work, we further our understanding of tamper-evident encryption by formally relating it to other quantum cryptographic primitives in an information-theoretic setting. In particular, we show that tamper evidence implies encryption, answering a question left open by Gottesman, we show that it can be constructed from any encryption scheme with revocation and vice-versa, and we formalize an existing sketch of a construction of quantum money from any tamper-evident encryption scheme. These results also yield as a corollary that any scheme allowing the revocation of a message must be an encryption scheme. We also show separations between tamper evidence and other primitives, notably showing that tamper evidence does not imply authentication and does not imply uncloneable encryption.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martin Mendez, Federico M. Pont</p>
            <p>The dynamics and processes involved in particle-molecule scattering, including nuclear dynamics, is described and analyzed by different quantum information quantities along the different stages of the scattering. The main process studied and characterized with the information quantities is the interatomic coulombic electronic capture (ICEC), an inelastic process that can lead to dissociation of the target molecule. The analysis is focused in a one-dimensional transversely confined $\text{NeHe}$ molecule model used to simulate the scattering between an electron $\text{e}^-$(particle) and a $\text{NeHe}^+$ ion (molecule). The time-independent Schrödinger equation (TISE) is solved using the Finite Element Method (FEM) with a self-developed Julia package FEMTISE to compute potential energy curves (PECs) and the parameters of the interactions between particles. The time-dependent Schrödinger equation (TDSE) is solved using the Multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH) algorithm. The time dependent electronic and nuclear probability densities are calculated for different electron incoming energies, evidencing elastic and inelastic processes that can be correlated to changes in von Neumann entropy, conditional mutual information and Shannon entropies. The expectation value of the position of the particles, as well as their standard deviations, are analyzed along the whole dynamics and related to the entanglement during the collision and after the process is over, hence evidencing the dynamics of entanglement generation. It is shown that the correlations generated in the collision is partially retained only when the inelastic process is active.</p>

            <p>We investigate a phenomenon known as Superactivation of Backflow of Information (SBFI); namely, the fact that the tensor product of a non-Markovian dynamics with itself exhibits Backflow of Information (BFI) from environment to system even if the single dynamics does not. Such an effect is witnessed by the non-monotonic behaviour of the Helstrom norm and emerges in the open dynamics of two independent, but statistically coupled, parties. We physically interpret SBFI by means of the discrete-time non-Markovian dynamics of two open qubits collisionally coupled to an environment described by a classical Markov chain. In such a scenario SBFI can be ascribed to the decrease of the qubit-qubit-environment correlations in favour of those of the two qubits, only. We further prove that the same mechanism at the roots of SBFI also holds in a suitable continuous-time limit. We also show that SBFI does not require entanglement to be witnessed, but only the quantumness of the Helstrom ensemble.</p>

            <p>A convenient way to represent quantum optical states is through the quadrature basis of single-modes of the field. This framework provides intuitive definitions for quasi-classical states, their phase-space representations, and enables the definition of a universal gate set. In this widely adopted representation of quantum optics, most pure states consist of coherent superpositions of photon-number states. However, this approach neglects the particle-number superselection rule - which prohibits coherence between states of differing photon numbers - and implicitly assumes a phase reference. We adopt a representation of quantum optical states that respects the superselection rule and revisit key tools and results in quantum optics and information encoding within quantum optics. This approach preserves the intuitive aspects of the traditional quadrature representation while unifying insights from quantum optics with those from symmetric spin-like and angular momentum systems. More than just an alternative representation, we show that a superselection rule-compliant framework provides a unified formalism for all bosonic encodings, from single-photon to continuous-variable encodings. This perspective allows for a precise characterization of the roles of Gaussian and non-Gaussian resources, as well as the interplay between modes and states in quantum universality and potential computational advantage.</p>

            <p>Entanglement distribution across remote distances is critical for many quantum applications. Currently, the de facto approach for remote entanglement distribution relies on optical fiber for on-the-ground entanglement distribution. However, the fiber-based approach is incapable of global-scale entanglement distribution due to intrinsic limitations. This paper investigates a new hybrid ground-satellite quantum network architecture (QuESat) for global-scale entanglement distribution, integrating an on-the-ground fiber network with a global-scale passive optical network built with low-Earth-orbit satellites. The satellite network provides dynamic construction of photon lightpaths based on near-vacuum beam guides constructed via adjustable arrays of lenses, forwarding photons from one ground station to another with very high efficiency over long distances compared to using fiber. To assess the feasibility and effectiveness of QuESat for global communication, we formulate lightpath provisioning and entanglement distribution problems, considering the orbital dynamics of satellites and the time-varying entanglement demands from ground users. A two-stage algorithm is developed to dynamically configure the beam guides and distribute entanglements, respectively. The algorithm combines randomized and deterministic rounding for lightpath provisioning to enable global connectivity, with optimal entanglement swapping for distributing entanglements to meet users' demands. By developing a ground-satellite quantum network simulator, QuESat achieves multi-fold improvements compared to repeater networks.</p>

            <p>A fundamental problem in quantum information is to understand the operational significance of quantum resources. Quantum resource theories (QRTs) provide a powerful theoretical framework that aids in analyzing and comprehending the operational meaning of these resources. Early resource theories primarily focused on analyzing static quantum resources. Recently, there has been growing interest in the study of dynamic quantum resources. In this paper, we utilize superchannel theory to describe the dynamic resource theory of quantum coherence. In this dynamic resource theory, we treat classical channels as free channels and consider two classes of free superchannels that preserve channel incoherence (maximally incoherent superchannels (MISC) and dephasing-covariant incoherent superchannels (DISC)) as free resources. We regard the quantum Fourier transform as the golden unit of dynamic coherence resources. We first establish the one-shot theory of dynamic coherence cost and dynamic coherence distillation, which involves converting the quantum Fourier transform into an arbitrary quantum channel using MISC and DISC. Next, we introduce a class of free superchannels known as $\delta$-MISC, which asymptotically generate negligible dynamic coherence. Finally, we provide upper and lower bounds for the one-shot catalytic dynamic coherence cost of quantum channels under the action of these $\delta$-MISC superchannels.</p>

We identify the optimal interactions providing large average work with small fluctuations in the operational regime of the heat engine. Then, we consider the specific cases $n=2$, $m=1$ and $n=1$, $m=2$ up to the fourth order in $\theta$. We optimize the average work and the signal-to-noise ratio over the frequencies of the bosonic modes and the temperatures of the reservoirs. Finally, we determine the thermodynamic uncertainty relations for these processes in relation with the order of the expansion of the unitary interaction $V_{\theta}$.</p>

Building on this foundation, we introduce a versatile suite of coherence measures, including the relative cross-entropy of coherence and its partial variants, that satisfy all resource theoretic axioms under incoherent operations. This unifying approach clarifies the geometric boundaries of physically realizable states in von Neumann-Tsallis entropy space and uncovers the phenomenon of degenerate coherence distillation where symmetry in the eigenvalue spectrum enables enhanced coherence extraction in higher-dimensional systems. In addition, we strengthen the entropy-based uncertainty relation by refining the Massen-Uffink bound to account for the largest eigenvalues across distinct measurement bases. This refinement forges a deeper connection between entropy and uncertainty, which yields operationally meaningful constraints for quantum information tasks. Altogether, our findings illustrate the power of majorization in resource-theoretic analyses of quantum coherence, which offer valuable tools for both fundamental research and real-world applications in quantum information processing.</p>

            <h2>The stellar decomposition of Gaussian quantum states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arsalan Motamedi, Yuan Yao, Kasper Nielsen, Ulysse Chabaud, J. Eli Bourassa, Rafael Alexander, Filippo Miatto</p>
            <p>We introduce the stellar decomposition, a novel method for characterizing non-Gaussian states produced by photon-counting measurements on Gaussian states. Given an (m+n)-mode Gaussian state G, we express it as an (m+n)-mode "Gaussian core state" G_core followed by a fixed m-mode Gaussian transformation T that only acts on the first m modes. The defining property of the Gaussian core state G_core is that measuring the last n of its modes in the photon-number basis leaves the first m modes on a finite Fock support, i.e. a core state. Since T is measurement-independent and G_core has an exact and finite Fock representation, this decomposition exactly describes all non-Gaussian states obtainable by projecting n modes of G onto the Fock basis. For pure states we prove that a physical pair (G_core, T) always exists with G_core pure and T unitary. For mixed states, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for (G_core, T) to be a Gaussian mixed state and a Gaussian channel. Finally, we develop a semidefinite program to extract the "largest" possible Gaussian channel when these conditions fail. The stellar decomposition leads to practical bounds on achievable state quality in photonic circuits and for GKP state generation in particular. Our results are based on a new characterization of Gaussian completely positive maps in the Bargmann picture, which may be of independent interest. As a result, this work provides novel tools for improved simulations of quantum optical systems, and for understanding the generation of non-Gaussian resource states.</p>

            <p>We report on an industry-grade CMOS-compatible qubit fabrication approach using a CMOS pilot line, enabling a yield of functional devices reaching 92.8%, with a resistance spread evaluated across the full wafer 200 mm diameter of 12.4% and relaxation times (T1) approaching 80 us. Furthermore, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of wafer-scale room temperature (RT) characteristics collected from multiple wafers and fabrication runs, focusing on RT measurements and their correlation to low temperature qubit parameters. From defined test structures, a across-wafer junction area variation of 10.1% and oxide barrier variation of 7.2% was calculated. Additionally, we notably show a close-correlation between qubit junction resistance and frequency in accordance with the Ambegaokar-Baratoff relation with a critical temperature Tc of about 0.71 K. This overarching relation sets the stage for pre-cooldown qubit evaluation and sorting. In particular, such early-on device characterization and validation are crucial for increasing the fabrication yield and qubit frequency targeting, which currently represent major scaling challenges. Furthermore, it enables the fabrication of large multichip quantum systems in the future. Our findings highlight the great potential of CMOS-compatible industry-style fabrication of superconducting qubits for scalable quantum computing in a foundry pilot line cleanroom.</p>

            <p>We introduce a framework which allows to systematically and arbitrarily scale the code distance of local fermion-to-qubit encodings in one and two dimensions without growing the weights of stabilizers. This is achieved by embedding low-distance encodings into the surface code in the form of topological defects. We introduce a family of Ladder Encodings (LE), which is optimal in the sense that the code distance is equal to the weights of density and nearest-neighbor hopping operators of a one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model. In two dimensions, we show how to scale the code distance of LE as well as other low-distance encodings such as Verstraete-Cirac and Derby-Klassen. We further introduce Perforated Encodings, which locally encode two fermionic spin modes within the same surface code structure. We show that our strategy is also extendable to other topological codes by explicitly embedding the LE into a 6.6.6 color code.</p>

            <h2>Exponential concentration and symmetries in Quantum Reservoir Computing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Antonio Sannia, Gian Luca Giorgi, Roberta Zambrini</p>
            <p>Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) is an emerging framework for near-term quantum machine learning that offers in-memory processing, platform versatility across analogue and digital systems, and avoids typical trainability challenges such as barren plateaus and local minima. The exponential number of independent features of quantum reservoirs opens the way to a potential performance improvement compared to classical settings. However, this exponential scaling can be hindered by exponential concentration, where finite-ensemble noise in quantum measurements requires exponentially many samples to extract meaningful outputs, a common issue in quantum machine learning. In this work, we go beyond static quantum machine learning tasks and address concentration in QRC for time-series processing using quantum-scrambling reservoirs. Beyond discussing how concentration effects can constrain QRC performance, we demonstrate that leveraging Hamiltonian symmetries significantly suppresses concentration, enabling robust and scalable QRC implementations. We illustrate our approach with concrete examples, including an established QRC design.</p>

            <p>Many computational problems are unchanged under some symmetry operation. In classical machine learning, this can be reflected with the layer structure of the neural network. In quantum machine learning, the ansatz can be tuned to correspond to the specific symmetry of the problem. We investigate this adaption of the quantum circuit to the problem symmetry on graph classification problems. On random graphs, the quantum machine learning ansatz classifies whether a given random graph is connected, bipartite, contains a Hamiltonian path or cycle, respectively. We find that if the quantum circuit reflects the inherent symmetry of the problem, it vastly outperforms the standard, unsymmetrized ansatzes. Even when the symmetry is only approximative, there is still a significant performance gain over non-symmetrized ansatzes. We show how the symmetry can be included in the quantum circuit in a straightforward constructive method.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu Guo, Ning Yang</p>
            <p>It is known that $\rho^{AB}$ as a bipartite reduced state of the 3-qubit GHZ state is separable, but part $A$ and part $B$ are indeed entangled with each other without tracing out part $C$. Namely, whether a state containing entanglement is always dependent on the global system it lives in. We explore here such entanglement in any $n$-partite system with arbitrary dimensions, $n\geqslant3$, and call it partite-wise entanglement (PWE) which contains pairwise entanglement (PE) proposed in [Phys. Rev. A 110, 032420(2024)] as a special case. In particular, we investigate the partite-wise entanglement extensibility, and from which we find that the reduced state of a genuine entangled state could be any mixed state without pure reduced states. We then propose three classes of the partite-wise entanglement measures which are based on the genuine entanglement measure, minimal bipartition measure, and the minimal distance from the partite-wise separable states, respectively. The former two methods are far-ranging since all of them are defined by the reduced functions. Consequently, we establish the framework of the resource theory of the partite-wise entanglement and the genuine partite-wise entanglement for which the free states are the pure states and the states with pure reduced states, respectively.</p>

            <p>In this note, we study the holographic CFT in the de Sitter static patch at finite temperature $T$ and chemical potential. We find that butterfly velocity $v_B$ in such field theory degenerates for all values of the Hubble parameter $H$ and $T$. We interpret this as a chaos disruption caused by the interplay between the expansion of chaotic correlations constrained by $v_B$ and effects caused by de Sitter curvature. The chemical potential restores healthy butterfly velocity for some range of temperatures. Also, we provide some analogy of this chaos suppression with the Schwinger effect in de Sitter and black hole formation from shock wave collision.</p>

The experimental signal contains the information about the dimension and the topology of spacetime (with the currently achievable precision), and establishes its manifold structure, while respecting its underlying diffeomorphism symmetry. We also introduce and discuss appropriate criteria for the concept of emergence of spacetime, which any tentative theoretical model of physics must satisfy in order to claim that spacetime does emerge from some more fundamental concepts.</p>

The bra and ket vectors for a composite system that form the basis of an identical particle system are described in dual and anti-dual spaces for the tensor product of rigged Hilbert spaces. The permutation operator that characterizes the symmetry of identical particles is constructed as the operator on such dual spaces. We also show that the nuclear spectral theorem in the tensor product of rigged Hilbert spaces endows the spectral expansion of the self-adjoint operator in the dual and anti-dual spaces and the expansion is consistent with the identicle particle system when the permutation operator commutes the self-adjoint operator.</p>

            <p>Introducing a class of SU(2) invariant quantum unitary circuits generating chiral transport, we examine the role of broken space-reflection and time-reversal symmetries on spin transport properties. Upon adjusting parameters of local unitary gates, the dynamics can be either chaotic or integrable. The latter corresponds to a generalization of the space-time discretized (Trotterized) higher-spin quantum Heisenberg chain. We demonstrate that breaking of space-reflection symmetry results in a drift in the dynamical spin susceptibility. Remarkably, we find a universal drift velocity given by a simple formula which, at zero average magnetization, depends only on the values of SU(2) Casimir invariants associated with local spins. In the integrable case, the drift velocity formula is confirmed analytically based on the exact solution of thermodynamic Bethe ansatz equations. Finally, by inspecting the large fluctuations of the time-integrated current between two halves of the system in stationary maximum-entropy states, we demonstrate violation of the Gallavotti-Cohen symmetry, implying that such states cannot be regarded as equilibrium ones. We show that the scaled cumulant generating function of the time-integrated current instead obeys a generalized fluctuation relation.</p>

            <p>We write down a class of two-dimensional quantum spin-1/2 Hamiltonians whose eigenspectra are exactly solvable via the Jordan-Wigner transformation. The general structure corresponds to a suitable grid composed of XY or XX-Ising spin chains and ZZ-Ising spin chains and is generalizable to higher dimensions. They can host stacks of one-dimensional spinless fermion liquids with gapless excitations and power-law correlations coexisting with ordered spin moments (localized spinless fermions). Bond-dependent couplings thus can be an alternate mechanism than geometric frustration of SU(2)-symmetric couplings to obtain spinless fermionic excitations. Put in a different way, bond-dependent couplings allow for an embedding of one-dimensional spinless fermion (Tomonoga-Luttinger) liquids and solids and also Majorana excitations in higher dimensions. They can accommodate a simpler set of site-local conserved quantities apart from the more intricate, interlocked set of plaquette-local or bond-local conserved quantities in Kitaev's honeycomb model with Majorana excitations. The proposed grid structure may provide an architecture for quantum engineering with controllable qubits.</p>

            <p>The Fubini-Study metric is a central element of information geometry. We explore the role played by information geometry for determining the circuit complexity of Virasoro circuits and their deformations. To this effect, we study unitary quantum circuits generated by the Virasoro algebra and Fourier modes of a primary operator. Such primary-deformed Virasoro circuits can be realized in two-dimensional conformal field theories, where they provide models of inhomogeneous global quenches. We consider a cost function induced by the Fubini-Study metric and provide a universal expression for its time-evolution to quadratic order in the primary deformation for general source profiles. For circuits generated by the Virasoro zero mode and a primary, we obtain a non-zero cost only if spatial inhomogeneities are sufficiently large. In this case, we find that the cost saturates when the source becomes time-independent. The exact saturation value is determined by the history of the source profile. As a byproduct, returning to undeformed circuits, we relate the Fubini-Study metric to the Kähler metric on a coadjoint orbit of the Virasoro group.</p>

            <p>We investigate the role of both magnetic field and chemical potential on the emergence of chaotic dynamics in the QCD confining string from the holographic principle. An earlier developed bottom-up model of Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity, which mimics QCD features quite well, is used. The qualitative information about the chaos is obtained using the Poincaré sections and Lyapunov exponents. We find signatures of chaos in energetically disfavored string configurations, that are closer to the horizon, whereas no chaos is observed in energetically favored string configurations that are away from the horizon. Our results depend quite strongly on the frame we consider in the analysis. In the string frame, the chemical potential and the magnetic field suppress the chaotic dynamics in both parallel and perpendicular orientations of the string with respect to the magnetic field. Meanwhile, in the Einstein frame, the magnetic field suppresses/enhances the chaotic dynamics when the string is orientated perpendicular/parallel to the magnetic field, while the chemical potential enhances the chaotic dynamics for both orientations. The reported Lyapunov exponents are consistent with a classical analogue of the MSS bound in the parameter space of the model and we find it to be always satisfied in both frames.</p>

By leveraging the intrinsic link between the Hofstadter model and high energy physics, we propose a conjecture connecting the above signed area enumeration $C_N(A)$ in statistical mechanics to the quantum A-period of associated toric Calabi-Yau threefold in topological string theory: square lattice walks correspond to local $\mathbb{F}_0$ geometry, while triangular lattice walks are associated with local $\mathcal{B}_3$.</p>

Once the chains are formed and the Majorana zero modes are braided/fused, reading out the parity of the chains is essential for further verifying the non-Abelian property of the Majorana zero modes. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of using a superconducting transmon qubit, which incorporates an end of a four-site quantum dot-superconductor chain based on a Ge/Si nanowire, to directly detect the singlet/doublet state, and thus the parity of the entire chain. We also demonstrate that for multiple-dot chains there are two types of 0-{\pi} transitions between different charging states: the parity-flip 0-{\pi} transition and the parity-preserved 0-{\pi} transition. Furthermore, we show that the inter-dot coupling, hence the strengths of cross Andreev reflection and elastic cotunneling of electrons, can be adjusted by local electrostatic gating in chains fabricated on Ge/Si core-shell nanowires. Our exploration would be helpful for the ultimate realization of topological quantum computing based on artificial Kitaev chains.</p>

In the present work, we identify the origin of this deficiency and devise a strategy to obtain accurate closed-form expressions also in cases challenging the conventional (leading order) paraxial beam model.

            <p>In this paper, we seek to combine two emerging standpoints in control theory. On the one hand, recent advances in infinite-dimensional geometric control have unlocked a method for controlling (with arbitrary precision and in arbitrarily small times) state transfers for bilinear Schrödinger PDEs posed on a Riemannian manifold $M$. In particular, these arguments rely on controllability results in the group of the diffeomorphisms of $M$. On the other hand, using tools of $\Gamma$-convergence, it has been proved that we can phrase the retrieval of a diffeomorphism of $M$ as an ensemble optimal control problem. More precisely, this is done by employing a control-affine system for \emph{simultaneously} steering a finite swarm of points towards the respective targets. Here we blend these two theoretical approaches and numerically find control laws driving state transitions (such as eigenstate transfers) in small time in a bilinear Schrödinger PDE posed on the torus. Such systems have experimental relevance and are currently used to model rotational dynamics of molecules, and cold atoms trapped in periodic optical lattices.</p>

            <p>We study the effect of quenched disorder on the non-Hermitian skin effect in systems that conserve a U(1) charge and its associated multipole moments. In particular, we generalize the Hatano-Nelson argument for a localization transition in disordered, non-reciprocal systems to the interacting case. When only U(1) charge is conserved, we show that there is a transition between a skin effect phase, in which charges cluster at a boundary, and a many-body localized phase, in which charges localize at random positions. In the dynamics of entanglement, this coincides with an area to volume law transition. For systems without boundaries, the skin effect becomes a delocalized phase with a unidirectional current. If dipoles or higher multipoles are conserved, we show that the non-Hermitian skin effect remains stable to arbitrary disorder. Counterintuitively, the system is therefore always delocalized under periodic boundary conditions, regardless of disorder strength.</p>

Conventional DMRG and MPS methods frequently encounter limitations when dealing with subtle quantum correlations and entanglement structures near critical points, avoided crossings, and topologically ordered phases. By integrating the dynamical Uhlmann gauge potential and its categorical extensions into the numerical optimization and truncation procedures, our approach substantially improves coherence stability and accuracy. Through illustrative applications in quantum chemistry, condensed matter physics, and quantum dynamics, we demonstrate significant enhancements in precision and reliability, underscoring the broad potential of Uhlmann gauge-enhanced computational methods.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Coherence and Chaotic Dynamics: Guiding Molecular Machines Toward Low-Entropy States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrei Tudor Patrascu</p>
            <p>Quantum coherence profoundly alters classical thermodynamic expectations by modifying the structure and accessibility of probability distributions. Classically, transitions to lower-entropy states (local second-law violations) are exponentially suppressed, as lower-entropy configurations have fewer available microstates and are statistically improbable. However, introducing quantum coherence and structured quantum interference among semiclassical trajectories significantly changes this scenario. Quantum coherence reduces local entropy by establishing correlations among states that are classically independent, effectively restructuring probability amplitudes to channel transitions toward otherwise improbable low-entropy states. We analyze this phenomenon explicitly within the framework of semiclassical approximations, employing the Van Vleck-Gutzwiller propagator to quantify how interference terms arising from coherent superpositions modify classical fluctuation theorems. We demonstrate that quantum coherence, especially when combined with chaos-assisted dynamical tunneling, greatly enhances the probability of transitions to low-entropy configurations, creating pronounced counter-ergodic effects. Furthermore, by considering purification of mixed quantum states, we propose methodologies for deliberately engineering quantum phases among interfering pathways. This phase engineering can explicitly enhance coherence-driven transitions into lower-entropy states, providing a novel thermodynamic resource. Finally, we explore the feasibility of molecular-scale quantum machines exploiting these principles, highlighting their potential applications in quantum thermodynamics and quantum biology for performing useful work through coherence-mediated entropy reduction.</p>

            <p>Quantum networking enables the exchange of quantum information between physically separated quantum systems, which has applications ranging from quantum computing to unconditionally secure communication. Such quantum information is generally represented by two-level quantum systems or qubits. Here, we demonstrate a quantum network of high-dimensional (HD) quantum memories or ``qudits" stored in individual atoms. The interference and detection of HD time-bin encoded single photons emitted from atomic qudit memories heralds maximally-entangled Bell states across pairs of atomic qudit levels. This approach expands the quantum information capacity of a quantum network while improving the entanglement success fraction beyond the standard 50\% limit of qubit-based measurement protocols.</p>

            <p>We report a systematic procedure to engineer the van der Waals force between levitated nanoparticles in high vacuum by setting them into a fast rotation. By tuning the rotation frequency close to a polaritonic resonance, we can significantly enhance the van der Waals attraction. In addition, for frequencies slightly beyond resonance, rotation can change the nature of the interaction from attraction to repulsion. Rotational Doppler shifts effectively modify the frequency-dependent polarizability of the nanoparticles, thereby reshaping their mutual interaction. As a concrete and realistic example, we consider spinning barium strontium titanate nanoparticles at state-of-the-art rotation frequencies and demonstrate a modification of the force within the sensitivity of current experimental techniques.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenqi Tong, H. Alaeian, F. Robicheaux</p>
            <p>We study the steady-state behavior of the open Dicke model, which describes the collective interaction of $N$ spin-$1/2$ particles with a lossy, quantized cavity mode and exhibits a superradiant phase transition above a critical light-matter coupling. While the standard model conserves total spin, Kirton and Keeling \cite{PhysRevLett.118.123602} demonstrated that even infinitesimal homogeneous local dephasing destroys this phase transition, and that local atomic decay can restore it. We analyze this interplay using degenerate perturbation theory across subspaces of fixed total spin, $S$. For coupling strengths above the threshold, we identify a critical spin value $S_c$ such that the superradiant phase transition occurs only for $S>S_c$. Our perturbative approach captures how weak dephasing and decay induce mixing between different $S$-subspaces, yielding a steady-state spin distribution whose width scales as $1/\sqrt{N}$. This framework requires only the first and second moments and can be implemented via the 2nd-cumulant approach, circumventing the need for full density matrix calculations. Our results bridge the quantum Rabi model and Dicke physics, elucidate the roles of dephasing and decay in collective quantum effects, and apply broadly to open quantum systems with degenerate steady states.</p>

We present a combined theoretical and numerical study of stability regions in circuit QED using Floquet theory, focusing on the appearance of Arnold tongues that distinguish stable from unstable regimes. Starting from simple Josephson circuits and progressing to full multimode qubit-cavity systems, we show how time-dependent modulation maps the dynamics to Mathieu-type equations, revealing thresholds for parametric resonances. Perturbative corrections capture effects like higher harmonics and weak nonlinearities. Simulations validate these predictions and expose sensitivity to fabrication parameters.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xin H. H. Zhang, Daniel Malz, Peter Rabl</p>
            <p>We study the collective decay of an initially inverted ensemble of two-level emitters into a squeezed photonic reservoir. By using a quantum-state diffusion approach to unravel the emission process, we investigate entanglement and classical correlations along individual quantum trajectories over time. This numerical analysis shows that despite an accelerated initial build-up of entanglement and a significant amount of spin squeezing in the steady state, the essential features of the superradiant burst are well described by averages over fully factorizable states. We explain this observation in terms of an almost complete factorization of all 2-local observables, which we identify as a generic property of superradiant decay. Based on this insight, we provide a purely classical theory for the burst in squeezed superradiance, which is both intuitive and exact for a large number of emitters. Moreover, we show that our numerical approach is also applicable for the investigation of subradiant states, which dominate the slow residual decay of non-uniform ensembles at very long times.</p>

            <p>Photon magnon hybrid systems present a promising platform for the development of next generation devices in quantum information processing and quantum sensing technologies. In this study, we investigate the control of photon magnon coupling (PMC) strength through systematic variation of the saturation magnetization in a planar hexagonal ring resonator (HRR) integrated with a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) thin film configuration. Using full wave numerical simulations in CST Microwave Studio, we demonstrate that tuning the Ms of the YIG film from 1750 Oe to 900 Oe enables systematic control over the coupling strength across the 127 to 51 MHz range at room temperature. To explain the observed PMC dynamics, we develop a semiclassical analytical model based on electromagnetic theory that accurately reproduces the observed coupling behavior, revealing the key role of spin density in mediating the light matter interaction. The model is further extended to include the effects of variable magnon damping across different Ms values, enabling broader frequency control. These findings establish Ms as a key tuning parameter for tailoring PMC, with direct implications for the design of tunable hybrid systems for reconfigurable quantum devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dorival Gonçalves, Ajay Kaladharan, Frank Krauss, Alberto Navarro</p>
            <p>Polarization and spin correlations in diboson systems serve as powerful tools for precision tests and searches for new physics. Recently, interpreting these observables through the lens of quantum information, for instance by examining whether the diboson systems exhibit entanglement, has introduced a compelling new dimension to these studies. We analyze the angular coefficients in the processes $pp\to e^+e^-\mu^+\mu^-$ and $h\to e^+e^-\mu^+\mu^-$, incorporating higher-order QCD and electroweak corrections. Guided by the fundamental properties of the spin density matrix, we assess the stability of the two-qutrit interpretation under radiative effects. For the $pp \to e^+e^-\mu^+\mu^-$ process, NLO QCD corrections preserve the two-qutrit structure but weaken entanglement indicators, an effect that can be partially mitigated by jet binning. In contrast, electroweak corrections introduce non-factorizable contributions that modify the quantum properties of the system. While these effects can be largely depleted by selecting events with a double-resonant $ZZ$ structure, such a kinematic handle is not available for Higgs decays. In the $h \to e^+e^-\mu^+\mu^-$ channel, singly-resonant NLO electroweak corrections substantially distort the angular coefficients, challenging the description of these events as a two-qutrit system.</p>

Quantum computers promise efficient chemical simulation, but the existing quantum algorithms require many logical qubits and gates, placing practical applications beyond existing technology. Here, we carry out the first quantum simulations of chemical dynamics by employing a more hardware-efficient encoding scheme that uses both qubits and bosonic degrees of freedom. Our trapped-ion device accurately simulates the dynamics of non-adiabatic chemical processes, which are among the most difficult problems in computational chemistry because they involve strong coupling between electronic and nuclear motions. We demonstrate the programmability and versatility of our approach by simulating the dynamics of three different molecules as well as open-system dynamics in the condensed phase, all with the same quantum resources. Our approach requires orders of magnitude fewer resources than equivalent qubit-only quantum simulations, demonstrating the potential of using hybrid encoding schemes to accelerate quantum simulations of complex chemical processes, which could have applications in fields ranging from energy conversion and storage to biology and drug design.</p>

            <p>High-precision rotational angle measurement in noise-prone environments holds critical impor tance in aerospace engineering, military navigation, and related domains. In this paper, we propose a quantum gyroscope scheme based on a cavity magnomechanical system, which enables high precision rotation angle detection by harnessing hybrid light-magnon interactions. Central to this framework is the employment of a two-mode squeezed coherent state, generated via parametric coupling of dual quantized optical fields with collective spin excitations (magnons), serving as the quantum metrological probe. We demonstrate that this scheme can significantly reduce quantum noise to levels far below the shot-noise limit. Furthermore, in the non-Markovian case, the per formance of the quantum gyroscope in a dissipative environment does not deteriorate over time, provided that the environmental spectral density satisfies certain conditions. These findings provide critical insights for advancing miniaturized quantum gyroscopes with sub-microradian precision, addressing long-standing challenges in inertial navigation systems under strong ambient noise.</p>

            <h2>Exploring Quantum Aspects of Dark Matter Axions and Dark Photons Transitioning to Photons in a Resonant Cavity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruifeng Zheng, Puxian Wei, Qiaoli Yang</p>
            <p>When axion cold dark matter interacts with a static magnetic field, it can be converted to photons with energy near the axion's mass. Classical analysis shows that incorporating a resonant cavity significantly enhances this conversion rate, forming the basis for many experiments aimed at detecting dark matter axions. However, one might ask: Does the axion-photon conversion rate increase for a single axion-photon transition? Answering this question could lead to optimizing the search for axions by integrating quantum measurement techniques. In this paper, we demonstrate that at the quantum level, single axion-photon transitions are amplified by the cavity quality factor $Q$. Furthermore, the coherence of dark matter waves is unnecessary during the measurement. The underlying principle is similar to the Purcell effect. Additionally, we provide an analysis of the scenario involving dark photon dark matter.</p>

            <p>Isotopically enriched silicon (Si) can greatly enhance qubit coherence times by minimizing naturally occurring $^{29}$Si which has a non-zero nuclear spin. Ultra-high fluence $^{28}$Si ion implantation of bulk natural Si substrates was recently demonstrated as an attractive technique to ultra-high $^{28}$Si isotopic purity. In this work, we apply this $^{28}$Si enrichment process to produce $^{28}$Si and $^{28}$Si-on-insulator (SOI) samples. Experimentally, we produced a $^{28}$Si sample on natural Si substrate with $^{29}$Si depleted to 7~ppm (limited by measurement noise floor), that is at least 100 nm thick. This is achieved with an ion energy that results in a sputter yield of less than one and an ultra-high ion fluence, as supported by our improved computational model that is based on fitting a large number of experiments. Further, our model predicts the $^{29}$Si and $^{30}$Si depletion in our sample to be less than 1~ppm. In the case of SOI, ion implantation conditions are found to be more stringent than those of bulk natural Si in terms of minimizing threading dislocations upon subsequent solid phase epitaxy annealing. Finally, we do not observe open volume defects in our $^{28}$SOI and $^{28}$Si samples after SPE annealing (620°C, 10 minutes).</p>

            <p>We investigate a Lieb lattice of quantum emitters coupled to a two-dimensional waveguide network and demonstrate that this system supports an energetically isolated flat band, enabling localization despite the presence of long-range photon-mediated couplings. We then explore the two-excitation dynamics in both the softcore and hardcore interaction regimes, which arise from the nonlinearity of the emitters. In the softcore regime, we observe interaction-induced photon transport within the flat band, mediated by the formation of bound photon pairs. In the hardcore regime, corresponding to the two-level atom limit, we instead find the emergence of metastable exciton-like dressed states involving both flat and dispersive bands. Our findings highlight how the interplay between the collective behavior of emitters and effective photon-photon interactions can provide a platform for studying highly correlated photonic states in flat-band systems.</p>

            <p>Color centers in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) emerge as promising quantum light sources at room temperature, with potential applications in quantum communications, among others. The temporal coherence of emitted photons (i.e. their capacity to interfere and distribute photonic entanglement) is essential for many of these applications. Hence, it is crucial to study and determine the temporal coherence of this emission under different experimental conditions. In this work, we report the coherence time of the single photons emitted by an hBN defect in a nanocrystal at room temperature, measured via Michelson interferometry. The visibility of this interference vanishes when the temporal delay between the interferometer arms is a few hundred femtoseconds, highlighting that the phonon dephasing processes are four orders of magnitude faster than the spontaneous decay time of the emitter. We also analyze the single photon characteristics of the emission via correlation measurements, defect blinking dynamics, and its Debye-Waller factor. Our room temperature results highlight the presence of a strong phonon-electron coupling, suggesting the need to work at cryogenic temperatures to enable quantum photonic applications based on photon interference.</p>

            <p>Color codes are a leading class of topological quantum error-correcting codes with modest error thresholds and structural compatibility with two-dimensional architectures, which make them well-suited for fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC). Here, we propose and analyze a distributed architecture for realizing the (6.6.6) color code. The architecture involves interconnecting patches of the color code housed in different quantum processing units (QPUs) via entangled pairs. To account for noisy interconnects, we model the qubits in the color code as being subject to a bit-flip noise channel, where the qubits on the boundary (seam) between patches experience elevated noise compared to those in the bulk. We investigate the error threshold of the distributed color code under such asymmetric noise conditions by employing two decoders: a tensor-network-based decoder and a recently introduced concatenated Minimum Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) algorithm. Our simulations demonstrate that elevated noise on seam qubits leads to a slight reduction in threshold for the tensor-network decoder, whereas the concatenated MWPM decoder shows no significant change in the error threshold, underscoring its effectiveness under asymmetric noise conditions. Our findings thus highlight the robustness of color codes in distributed architectures and provide valuable insights into the practical realization of FTQC involving noisy interconnects between QPUs.</p>

            <p>Device-independent quantum secret sharing (DI QSS) relaxes security assumptions of experimental devices to provide the highest security level for QSS. Previous DI QSS protocols require to generate multi-partite entangled states and then implement the long-distance entanglement distribution. The extremely low generation probability of current multi-partite entanglement source and photon transmission loss largely limit DI QSS's practical key generation rate and secure photon transmission distance. In the paper, we propose a high-efficient long-distance DI QSS protocol based on practical nearly on-demand single-photon sources (SPSs), which adopts the single photons and heralded architecture to construct long-distance multi-partite entanglement channels. Our SPS DI QSS protocol can automatically eliminate the negative influence from photon transmission loss and largely increase the secure photon transmission distance. Moreover, we adopt active improvement strategies such as random key generation basis, postselection, and advanced postselection to further increase the practical key generation rate and lower the experimental requirement. Comparing with previous DI QSS protocols based on entanglement sources, our SPS DI QSS protocol can increase the practical communication efficiency by six orders of magnitude, and increase the secure photon transmission distance by at least 151 times. This SPS DI QSS protocol is feasible with the current experimental technologies. Our protocol makes it possible to realize high-efficient long-distance DI network in the near future.</p>

By mapping up to 2^{n} photonic Fock states onto n qubits, our framework leverages Gray-code-based encodings to reduce gate overhead compared to conventional one-hot or binary mappings. We further optimize resource usage by restricting the simulation on Fock states with even number of photons only, effectively doubling the range of photon numbers that can be represented for a given number of qubits. To overcome noise and finite coherence in current hardware, we employ a variational quantum simulation protocol, which adapts shallow, parameterized circuits through iterative optimization. Implemented on the Zuchongzhi-2 superconducting platform, our method demonstrates squeezed-state dynamics across a parameter sweep from vacuum state preparation (r=0) to squeezing levels exceeding the Fock space truncation limit (r>1.63). Experimental results, corroborated by quantum state tomography and Wigner-function analysis, confirm high-fidelity state preparation and demonstrate the potential of Gray-code-inspired techniques for realizing continuous-variable physics on near-term, qubit-based quantum processors.</p>

            <p>Near-term quantum devices require wavefunction ansätze that are expressive while also of shallow circuit depth in order to both accurately and efficiently simulate molecular electronic structure. While unitary coupled cluster (e.g., UCCSD) has become a standard, the high gate count associated with the implementation of this limits its feasibility on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. K-fold unitary cluster Jastrow (uCJ) ansätze mitigate this challenge by providing $O(kN^2)$ circuit scaling and favorable linear depth circuit implementation. Previous work has focused on the real orbital-rotation (Re-uCJ) variant of uCJ, which allows an exact (Trotter-free) implementation. Here we extend and generalize the $k$-fold uCJ framework by introducing two new variants, Im-uCJ and g-uCJ, which incorporate imaginary and fully complex orbital rotation operators, respectively. Similar to Re-uCJ, both of the new variants achieve quadratic gate-count scaling. Our results focus on the simplest $k=1$ model, and show that the uCJ models frequently maintain energy errors within chemical accuracy. Both g-uCJ and Im-uCJ are more expressive in terms of capturing electron correlation and are also more accurate than the earlier Re-uCJ ansatz. We further show that Im-uCJ and g-uCJ circuits can also be implemented exactly, without any Trotter decomposition. Numerical tests using $k=1$ on $H_2$, $H_3^+$, $Be_2$, $C_2H_4$, $C_2H_6$ and $C_6H_6$ in various basis sets confirm the practical feasibility of these shallow Jastrow-based ansätze for applications on near-term quantum hardware.</p>

            <p>By precisely timed optical excitation of their spin, optical emitters such as semiconductor quantum dots or atoms can be harnessed as sources of linear photonic cluster states. This significantly reduces the required resource overhead to reach fault-tolerant optical quantum computing. Here, we develop an algorithm that analytically tracks the global density matrix through the process of the protocol for generating linear-cluster states by Lindner and Rudolph. From this we derive a model to calculate the entangling gate fidelity and the state fidelity of the generated linear optical cluster states. Our model factors in various sources of error, such as spin decoherence and the finite excited state lifetime. Additionally, we highlight the presence of partial reinitialization of spin coherence with each photon emission, eliminating the hard limitation of coherence time. Our framework provides valuable insight into the cost-to-improvement trade-offs for device design parameters as well as the identification of optimal working points. For a combined state-of-the-art quantum dot with a spin coherence time of T_2^*=535 ns and an excited state lifetime of {\tau}=23 ps, we show that a near-unity entangling gate fidelity as well as near-unity state fidelity for 3-photon and 7-photon linear cluster states can be reached.</p>

We relate this improved performance to the enhanced dimensionality and expressivity of the feature space, as indicated by the increased rank of the feature matrix in both experiment and simulation.</p>

            <p>Embedding semiconductor quantum dots into bullseye resonators has significantly advanced the development of bright telecom quantum light sources for fiber-based quantum networks. To further improve the device flexibility and stability, the bullseye approach should be combined with a pin diode structure to enable Stark tuning, deterministic charging, and enhanced coherence. In this work, we fabricate and characterize photonic structures incorporating hole gratings that efficiently support charge carrier transport while maintaining excellent optical performance. We report bright, Purcell-enhanced single-photon emission in the telecom C-band under above-band and phonon-assisted excitation. Additionally, we present electrically contacted resonators, demonstrating wide range tuneability of quantum dot transitions in the telecom O-band. These results mark significant steps toward scalable and tunable quantum light sources for real-world quantum photonic applications.</p>

            <p>Group-V materials such as niobium and tantalum have become popular choices for extending the performance of circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) platforms allowing for quantum processors and memories with reduced error rates and more modes. The complex surface chemistry of niobium however makes identifying the main modes of decoherence difficult at millikelvin temperatures and single-photon powers. We use niobium coaxial quarter-wave cavities to study the impact of etch chemistry, prolonged atmospheric exposure, and the significance of cavity conditions prior to and during cooldown, in particular niobium hydride evolution, on single-photon coherence. We demonstrate cavities with quality factors of Q_int>1.4X10^9 in the single-photon regime, a 15 fold improvement over aluminum cavities of the same geometry. We rigorously quantify the sensitivity of our fabrication process to various loss mechanisms and demonstrate a 2-4X reduction in the two-level system (TLS) loss tangent and a 3-5X improvement in the residual resistance over traditional BCP etching techniques. Finally, we demonstrate transmon integration and coherent cavity control while maintaining a cavity coherence of 11.3ms. The accessibility of our method, which can easily be replicated in academic-lab settings, and the demonstration of its performance mark an advancement in 3D cQED.</p>

            <p>The Transformer model, renowned for its powerful attention mechanism, has achieved state-of-the-art performance in various artificial intelligence tasks but faces challenges such as high computational cost and memory usage. Researchers are exploring quantum computing to enhance the Transformer's design, though it still shows limited success with classical data. With a growing focus on leveraging quantum machine learning for quantum data, particularly in quantum chemistry, we propose the Molecular Quantum Transformer (MQT) for modeling interactions in molecular quantum systems. By utilizing quantum circuits to implement the attention mechanism on the molecular configurations, MQT can efficiently calculate ground-state energies for all configurations. Numerical demonstrations show that in calculating ground-state energies for H2, LiH, BeH2, and H4, MQT outperforms the classical Transformer, highlighting the promise of quantum effects in Transformer structures. Furthermore, its pretraining capability on diverse molecular data facilitates the efficient learning of new molecules, extending its applicability to complex molecular systems with minimal additional effort. Our method offers an alternative to existing quantum algorithms for estimating ground-state energies, opening new avenues in quantum chemistry and materials science.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hui Hu, Xia-Ji Liu</p>
            <p>We predict the existence of two tri-critical quantum Lifshitz points in recently discovered $d$-wave altermagnetic metals subjected to an external magnetic field. These points connect a spatially modulated Fulde--Ferrell--Larkin--Ovchinnikov (FFLO) phase, a uniform polarized Bardeen--Cooper--Schrieffer (BCS) superconducting phase, and the normal metallic phase in a nontrivial manner. Depending on whether the FFLO state is primarily induced by the magnetic field or by $d$-wave altermagnetism, we classify the corresponding Lifshitz points as field-driven or altermagnetism-driven, respectively. Notably, the two types exhibit distinct behaviors: the transition from the FFLO phase to the polarized BCS phase is first-order near the field-driven Lifshitz point, as might be expected, whereas it becomes continuous near the altermagnetism-driven Lifshitz point. We further explore the effects of finite temperature and find that the altermagnetism-driven Lifshitz point is significantly more sensitive to thermal fluctuations.</p>

            <p>The rapid advancements in quantum computing (QC) and machine learning (ML) have led to the emergence of quantum machine learning (QML), which integrates the strengths of both fields. Among QML approaches, variational quantum circuits (VQCs), also known as quantum neural networks (QNNs), have shown promise both empirically and theoretically. However, their broader adoption is hindered by reliance on quantum hardware during inference. Hardware imperfections and limited access to quantum devices pose practical challenges. To address this, the Quantum-Train (QT) framework leverages the exponential scaling of quantum amplitudes to generate classical neural network parameters, enabling inference without quantum hardware and achieving significant parameter compression. Yet, designing effective quantum circuit architectures for such quantum-enhanced neural programmers remains non-trivial and often requires expertise in quantum information science. In this paper, we propose an automated solution using differentiable optimization. Our method jointly optimizes both conventional circuit parameters and architectural parameters in an end-to-end manner via automatic differentiation. We evaluate the proposed framework on classification, time-series prediction, and reinforcement learning tasks. Simulation results show that our method matches or outperforms manually designed QNN architectures. This work offers a scalable and automated pathway for designing QNNs that can generate classical neural network parameters across diverse applications.</p>

            <h2>Uniqueness of Squeezed States for One and Two Modes, and a No-Go Beyond</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arash Azizi</p>
            <p>We investigate the structure and uniqueness of squeezed vacuum states defined by annihilation conditions of the form $(a - \alpha a^\dagger)|\psi\rangle = 0$ and their multimode generalizations. For $N=1$ and $N=2$, we rigorously show that these conditions uniquely define the standard single- and two-mode squeezed states in the Fock basis. We then analyze a cyclically coupled $N$-mode system governed by $(a_i - \alpha_i a_{i+1}^\dagger)|\psi\rangle = 0$ with $a_{N+1} \equiv a_1$. Although the recurrence structure restricts solutions to equal-photon-number states, we prove that for $N>2$ no such state satisfies the full set of conditions. This establishes a sharp no-go result for multipartite squeezed states under cyclic annihilation constraints, underscoring a fundamental structural limitation beyond pairwise squeezing.</p>

            <p>Quantum computers hold the potential to surpass classical computers in solving complex computational problems. However, the fragility of quantum information and the error-prone nature of quantum operations make building large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computers a prominent challenge. To combat errors, pioneering experiments have demonstrated a variety of quantum error correction codes. Yet, most of these codes suffer from low encoding efficiency, and their scalability is hindered by prohibitively high resource overheads. Here, we report the demonstration of two low-overhead quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes, a distance-4 bivariate bicycle code and a distance-3 qLDPC code, on our latest superconducting processor, Kunlun, featuring 32 long-range-coupled transmon qubits. Utilizing a two-dimensional architecture with overlapping long-range couplers, we demonstrate simultaneous measurements of all nonlocal weight-6 stabilizers via the periodic execution of an efficient syndrome extraction circuit. We achieve a logical error rate per logical qubit per cycle of $(8.91 \pm 0.17)\%$ for the distance-4 bivariate bicycle code with four logical qubits and $(7.77 \pm 0.12)\%$ for the distance-3 qLDPC code with six logical qubits. Our results establish the feasibility of implementing various qLDPC codes with long-range coupled superconducting processors, marking a crucial step towards large-scale low-overhead quantum error correction.</p>

            <h2>Efficient benchmarking of logical magic state</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Su-un Lee, Ming Yuan, Senrui Chen, Kento Tsubouchi, Liang Jiang</p>
            <p>High-fidelity logical magic states are a critical resource for fault-tolerant quantum computation, enabling non-Clifford logical operations through state injection. However, benchmarking these states presents significant challenges: one must estimate the infidelity $\epsilon$ with multiplicative precision, while many quantum error-correcting codes only permit Clifford operations to be implemented fault-tolerantly. Consequently, conventional state tomography requires $\sim1/\epsilon^2$ samples, making benchmarking impractical for high-fidelity states. In this work, we show that any benchmarking scheme measuring one copy of the magic state per round necessarily requires $\Omega(1/\epsilon^2)$ samples for single-qubit magic states. We then propose two approaches to overcome this limitation: (i) Bell measurements on two copies of the twirled state and (ii) single-copy schemes leveraging twirled multi-qubit magic states. Both benchmarking schemes utilize measurements with stabilizer states orthogonal to the ideal magic state and we show that $O(1/\epsilon)$ sample complexity is achieved, which we prove to be optimal. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness of our protocols through numerical simulations under realistic noise models, confirming that their advantage persists even at moderate error rates currently achievable in state-of-the-art experiments.</p>

            <p>Quantum information science has leaped forward with the exploration of high-dimensional quantum systems, offering greater potential than traditional qubits in quantum communication and quantum computing. To advance the field of high-dimensional quantum technology, a significant effort is underway to progressively enhance the entanglement dimension between two particles. An alternative effective strategy involves not only increasing the dimensionality but also expanding the number of particles that are entangled. We present an experimental study demonstrating multi-partite quantum non-locality beyond qubit constraints, thus moving into the realm of strongly entangled high-dimensional multi-particle quantum systems. In the experiment, quantum states were encoded in the path degree of freedom (DoF) and controlled via polarization, enabling efficient operations in a two-dimensional plane to prepare three- and four-particle Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states in three-level systems. Our experimental results reveal ways in which high-dimensional systems can surpass qubits in terms of violating local-hidden-variable theories. Our realization of multiple complex and high-quality entanglement technologies is an important primary step for more complex quantum computing and communication protocols.</p>

            <p>Optical cavities can be used to enhance the interaction of light with atoms or molecules. In a regime where cavity resonances are very far from the atomic or molecular transition frequencies, photon absorption can be neglected and the dispersive part of the interaction can induce spectacular phenomena such as squeezing, cooling, and self-organization. So far, this dispersive interaction regime has only been explored using a single or few longitudinal cavity modes at a time. We experimentally study the dispersive interaction between a cold atom cloud and many longitudinal modes of a Fabry-Perot cavity, by detecting collective light shifts in the transmission spectrum of an optical frequency comb probe. Notably, using a high quality resonator coupled to more than $10^5$ intracavity atoms, we detect appreciable shifts of $\sim 100$ cavity modes simultaneously. These results constitute a direct demonstration of dispersive coupling of matter with many longitudinal modes of a linear resonator, and pave the way towards deeper exploration of atom-light dynamics in the multifrequency domain.</p>

            <p>Light-matter interactions with quantum dots have been extensively studied to harness key quantum properties of photons, such as indistinguishability and entanglement. In this theoretical work, we exploit the atomic-like four-level structure of a quantum dot coupled to a waveguide to model a shaping frequency entangling gate (ShaFrEnGa) for single photons. Our approach is based on the identification of input frequencies and an atomic level structure for which frequency-dependent one-photon transitions are adiabatically eliminated, while frequency-dependent two-photon transitions are resonantly enhanced. The frequency entanglement performance of the gate is analyzed using a Schmidt decomposition for continuous variables, revealing a trade-off between entanglement generation efficiency and entanglement quality. We further demonstrate the use of the ShaFrEnGa for the generation of entangled frequency qudit states.</p>

            <p>Embedding materials in optical cavities has emerged as a strategy for tuning material properties. Accurate simulations of electrons in materials interacting with quantum photon fluctuations of a cavity are crucial for understanding and predicting cavity-induced phenomena. In this article, we develop a non-perturbative quantum electrodynamical approach based on a photon-free self-consistent Hartree-Fock framework to model the coupling between electrons and cavity photons in crystalline materials. We apply this theoretical approach to investigate graphene coupled to the vacuum field fluctuations of cavity photon modes with different types of polarizations. The cavity photons introduce nonlocal electron-electron interactions, originating from the quantum nature of light, that lead to significant renormalization of the Dirac bands. In contrast to the case of graphene coupled to a classical circularly polarized light field, where a topological Dirac gap emerges, the nonlocal interactions induced by a quantum linearly polarized photon mode give rise to the formation of flat bands and the opening of a topologically trivial Dirac gap. When two symmetric cavity photon modes are introduced, Dirac cones remain gapless, but a Fermi velocity renormalization yet indicates the relevant role of nonlocal interactions. These effects disappear in the classical limit for coherent photon modes. This new self-consistent theoretical framework paves the way for the simulation of non-perturbative quantum effects in strongly coupled light-matter systems, and allows for a more comprehensive discovery of novel cavity-induced quantum phenomena.</p>

            <p>The emergence of hybrid quantum-classical machine learning (HQML) models opens new horizons of computational intelligence but their fundamental complexity frequently leads to black box behavior that undermines transparency and reliability in their application. Although XAI for quantum systems still in its infancy, a major research gap is evident in robust global and local explainability approaches that are designed for HQML architectures that employ quantized feature encoding followed by classical learning. The gap is the focus of this work, which introduces QuXAI, an framework based upon Q-MEDLEY, an explainer for explaining feature importance in these hybrid systems. Our model entails the creation of HQML models incorporating quantum feature maps, the use of Q-MEDLEY, which combines feature based inferences, preserving the quantum transformation stage and visualizing the resulting attributions. Our result shows that Q-MEDLEY delineates influential classical aspects in HQML models, as well as separates their noise, and competes well against established XAI techniques in classical validation settings. Ablation studies more significantly expose the virtues of the composite structure used in Q-MEDLEY. The implications of this work are critically important, as it provides a route to improve the interpretability and reliability of HQML models, thus promoting greater confidence and being able to engage in safer and more responsible use of quantum-enhanced AI technology.</p>

            <p>The non-Hermitian skin effect, nonreciprocity-induced anomalous localization of an extensive number of eigenstates, represents a hallmark of non-Hermitian topological systems with no analogs in Hermitian systems. Despite its significance across various open classical and quantum systems, the influence of nonlinearity has remained largely unclear. Here, we reveal the Hopf bifurcation of the nonlinear skin effect as a critical phenomenon unique to nonlinear non-Hermitian systems. We demonstrate that nonlinearity destabilizes skin states and instead gives rise to the emergence of delocalized states associated with limit cycles in phase space. We also uncover the algebraically localized critical skin effect precisely at the Hopf bifurcation point. We illustrate these behavior in a nonlinear extension of the Hatano-Nelson model in both continuum and lattice. Our work shows a significant role of nonlinearity in the skin effect and uncovers rich phenomena arising from the interplay between non-Hermiticity and nonlinearity.</p>

            <p>Testing and verifying imperfect multi-qubit quantum devices are important as such noisy quantum devices are widely available today. Bell inequalities are known useful for testing and verifying the quality of the quantum devices from their nonlocal quantum states and local measurements. There have been many experiments demonstrating the violations of Bell inequalities but they are limited in the number of qubits and the types of quantum states. We report violations of Bell inequalities on IBM Quantum devices based on the scalable and robust inequalities maximally violated by graph states as proposed by Baccari et al. (Ref.[1]). The violations are obtained from the quantum states of path graphs up to 57 and 21 qubits on the 65-qubit and 27-qubit IBM Quantum devices, respectively, and from those of star graphs up to 8 and 7 qubits with error mitigation on the same devices. We are able to show violations of the inequalities on various graph states by constructing low-depth quantum circuits producing them, and by applying the readout error mitigation technique. We also point out that quantum circuits for star graph states of size N can be realized with circuits of depth $O(\sqrt n)$ on subdivided honeycomb lattices which are the topology of the 65-qubit IBM Quantum device. Our experiments show encouraging results on the ability of existing quantum devices to prepare entangled quantum states, and provide experimental evidences on the benefit of scalable Bell inequalities for testing them.</p>

However, the absence of piezoelectricity in diamond requires interfacing with a piezoelectric material for efficient transduction and delivery of acoustic waves to spins in diamonds. Here, we demonstrate a heterogeneously integrated phononic platform that combines thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) with diamond to enable acoustic control of single SiV spins. Additionally, leveraging large SAW-induced strain at the location of SiV, we achieve coherent acoustic control of an electron spin with more than twofold improvement in Rabi frequency compared to the state-of-the-art devices based on aluminum nitride-on-diamond. This work represents a crucial step towards realizing phonon-based quantum information processing systems.</p>

            <p>We present the first demonstration of an end-to-end pipeline with quantum error correction (QEC) for a quantum computation of the electronic structure of molecular systems. Using Quantinuum H2-2, we calculate the ground-state energy of molecular hydrogen, using quantum phase estimation (QPE) on qubits encoded with the $[[7,1,3]]$ color code. To improve on the performance of the logical compilation of the QPE circuits into the Clifford+$T$ gate set, we introduce several partially fault-tolerant (FT) techniques for the Clifford+$R_{Z}$ (arbitrary-angle single-qubit rotation) gate set. To enhance computational fidelity, we integrate Steane QEC gadgets for real-time error correction, demonstrating measurable improvements in precision. The circuits used contain 22 qubits, and up to 2185 physical two-qubit gates and $760$ mid-circuit measurements. We observe that adding QEC gadgets in the middle of circuits improves the QPE circuits' performance despite the complexity of the extra QEC circuitry. The energy $E$ is experimentally estimated to within $E - E_{\mathrm{FCI}} = 0.018(10)$ hartree, where $E_{\mathrm{FCI}}$ denotes the exact ground state energy within the given basis set. Additionally, we conduct numerical simulations with tunable noise parameters to identify the dominant sources of noise. We find that orienting the QEC protocols towards higher memory noise protection is the most promising avenue to improve our experimental results.</p>

            <p>Long distance quantum networking requires combining efficient spin-photon interfaces with long-lived local memories. Group-IV color centers in diamond (SiV, GeV, and SnV) are promising candidates for this application, containing an electronic spin-photon interface and dopant nuclear spin memory. Recent work has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in spin-photon coupling and spin-spin entanglement. However, coupling between the electron and nuclear spins introduces a phase kickback during optical excitation that limits the utility of the nuclear memory. Here, we propose using the large hyperfine coupling of SnV-117 to operate the device at zero magnetic field in a regime where the memory is insensitive to optical excitation. We further demonstrate ground state spin control of a SnV-117 color center integrated in a photonic integrated circuit, showing 97.8% gate fidelity and 2.5 ms coherence time for the memory spin level. This shows the viability of the zero-field protocol for high fidelity operation, and lays the groundwork for building quantum network nodes with SnV-117 devices.</p>

            <p>It is well known that superconducting waveguides strongly attenuate the propagation of electromagnetic waves with frequencies beyond the superconducting gap. In circuit QED, the interaction between non-linear charge qubits and superconducting resonators invariably involves the qubit coupling to a large set of resonator modes. So far, strong dispersion effects near and beyond the superconducting-gap have been ignored in quantization models. Rather, it is assumed that the superconducting resonator behaves ideally across the large frequency intervals. We present a quantization approach which includes the superconducting frequency-dependent surface impedance and demonstrate that superconducting dispersion plays a role in determining the effective light-matter interaction cut-off.</p>

Here, we investigate the resonant interaction between a two-level emitter and a chiral flat band hosted by a photonic lattice. In the weak coupling regime, the emitter undergoes Rabi oscillations with a lifted photonic mode whose spatial structure reflects the nature of compact localized states and the onset of Anderson localization. We illustrate our approach using selected chiral quasi-1D lattices. Our findings provide a route to flat band state preparation via quench dynamics while preserving the structure of the flat band.</p>

            <p>We study the one-dimensional extended Hubbard model coupled with an optical cavity, which describes an interplay of the effect of vacuum fluctuation of light and the quantum phase transition between the charge- and spin-density-wave phases. The ground state and excitation spectrum of the model are calculated by numerically exact tensor-network methods. We find that the photon number of the ground state is enhanced (suppressed) along the quantum phase transition line when the light-matter coupling is comparable to (much smaller than) the cavity frequency. We also show that the exciton peak in the optical conductivity and photon spectrum that exists without the cavity exhibits the vacuum Rabi splitting at resonance due to the light-matter interaction. This behavior is in contrast to the case without excitons, where the photon spectrum is merely broadened without splitting due to the lack of a sharp resonance.</p>

            <h2>High-efficiency quantum Monte Carlo algorithm for extracting entanglement entropy in interacting fermion systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weilun Jiang, Gaopei Pan, Zhe Wang, Bin-Bin Mao, Heng Shen, Zheng Yan</p>
            <p>The entanglement entropy probing novel phases and phase transitions numerically via quantum Monte Carlo has made great achievements in large-scale interacting spin/boson systems. In contrast, the numerical exploration in interacting fermion systems is rare, even though fermion systems attract more attentions in condensed matter. The fundamental restrictions is that the computational cost of fermion quantum Monte Carlo ($\sim \beta N^3$) is much higher than that of spin/boson ($\sim \beta N$). Here, $N$ is the total number of sites and $\beta$ is the inverse temperature or projection length. To tackle this problem, we propose a fermionic quantum Monte Carlo algorithm based on the incremental technique along physical parameters, which greatly improves the efficiency of extracting entanglement entropy. We benchmark the developed algorithm by calculating the scaling behavior of the entanglement entropy in a two-dimensional square lattice Hubbard model. The obtained phase diagram including Fermi surface and Goldstone modes validates the correctness of the algorithm. Remarkably, our method shows the high-efficiency with respect to the existing algorithms, while keeping the high computation precision. We proceed to apply this algorithm to explore the scaling behavior of the entanglement entropy and particularly its derivative at Gross-Neveu criticality. Our results elucidate that such critical behavior can be quantified by the correlation length exponent.</p>

            <p>Solutions of the wave equations for time-independent disordered media can exhibit Anderson localization where instead of wave propagation we observe their localization around different points in space. Photonic time crystals are spatially homogeneous media in which the refractive index changes periodically in time, leading to the formation of bands in the wave number domain. By analogy to Anderson localization in space, one might expect that the presence of temporal disorder in photonic time crystals would lead to Anderson localization in the time domain. Here, we show that indeed periodic modulations of the refractive index with the addition of temporal disorder lead to Anderson localization in time, where an electromagnetic field can emerge from the temporally modulated medium at a certain moment in time and then decay exponentially over time. Thus, we are dealing with a situation where, in a fluctuating three-dimensional medium, the birth and death of waves can occur, and the mechanism of this phenomenon corresponds to Anderson localization.</p>

In quantum many-body systems and quantum field theory (QFT), we discuss a geometric definition of complexity in terms of geodesics on the unitary group. In dynamical systems, we explore a definition of complexity in terms of state or operator spreading, as well as concepts from tensor-networks. We also outline applications to simple quantum systems, quantum many-body models, and QFTs including conformal field theories (CFTs). Finally, we explain the proposed relationship between complexity and gravitational observables within the holographic anti-de Sitter (AdS)/CFT correspondence.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Algorithm for Structure-Based Virtual Drug Screening Using Classical Force Fields</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pei-Kun Yang</p>
            <p>Structure-based virtual screening must address a combinatorial explosion arising from up to 10^60 drug-like molecules, multiple conformations of proteins and ligands, and all possible spatial translations and rotations of ligands within the binding pocket. Although these calculations are inherently parallelizable, their sheer volume remains prohibitive for classical CPU/GPU resources. Quantum computing offers a promising solution: by using n qubits to compute the binding energy of a single protein-ligand pair and m additional qubits to encode different configurations, the algorithm can simultaneously evaluate 2^m combinations in a single quantum execution. To realize this potential, we propose a quantum algorithm that integrates classical force field models to compute electrostatic and van der Waals interactions on discretized grid points. Binding energy calculations are reformulated as matrix-based inner products, while ligand translations and rotations are encoded using unitary operations. This approach circumvents explicit distance calculations and provides a scalable, quantum-enhanced framework for efficient and high-dimensional binding energy estimation in drug discovery.</p>

            <h2>Orchestrating Multi-Zone Shuttling in Trapped-Ion Quantum Computers</h2>

            <p>Trapped-ion quantum computers are a promising platform, offering high-quality qubits with long coherence times and high-fidelity gate operations. The Quantum Charge Coupled Device (QCCD) architecture provides a scalable blueprint by leveraging the ability to shuttle ions between distinct zones. However, realizing such architectures in practice requires software support to manage ion movement across multi-zone layouts. In this work, we propose a compilation strategy for QCCD architectures with multiple processing zones located outside a grid-type memory zone. Unlike previous approaches that treat processing zones as black-boxes, our method explicitly models their structural constraints, enabling optimized ion movement to and through them. It combines qubit partitioning with dependency-aware gate selection to reduce inter-zone shuttling while enabling simultaneous gate execution. We implemented the method in an open-source tool and empirically demonstrated its effectiveness across several QCCD layouts, laying a foundation for the compilation of multi-zone trapped-ion systems.</p>

Our analysis highlights the advantages of polarization-multiplexed schemes for daylight operation.

            <h2>Quantum entanglement and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering in ultrastrongly light-matter coupled system</h2>

            <p>This work presents a scheme for engineering quantum entanglement and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering with Gaussian measurements based on the quantum Hopfield model that incorporates a common thermal reservoir. We begin by examining quantum correlations, specifically quantum entanglement and EPR steering, in the ground state. These quantum correlations primarily stem from squeezing interactions in weak and normal strong coupling regimes. As the coupling strength increases, especially upon entering the ultrastrong coupling regime, the correlations emerge from the combined effect of squeezing and mix-mode interactions. Importantly, this scenario enables the realization of two-way EPR steering. Moreover, lower optical frequencies enhance both quantum entanglement and EPR steering. Further, when considering thermal effects, the ultrastrong and deep strong coupling regimes, paired with lower optical frequencies, lead to improved entanglement. The one-way EPR steering for resonant case can be effectively controlled in the ultrastrong and deep strong coupling regimes which originates from the asymmetry of subsystem and reservoir coupling induced by the diamagnetic term. Additionally, one-way EPR steering can also be produced for nonresonant case. In this case, the asymmetry of the subsystem and reservoir originates from the combined effect of nonresonant frequencies and diamagnetic term. Our findings have the potential to inspire further research into quantum information processing that leverages light-matter entanglement and EPR steering.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qing-Song Li, Jiaxuan Zhang, Huan-Yu Liu, Qingchun Wang, Yu-Chun Wu, Guo-Ping Guo</p>
            <p>A potential approach for demonstrating quantum advantage is using quantum computers to simulate fermionic systems. Quantum algorithms for fermionic system simulation usually involve the Hamiltonian evolution and measurements. However, in the second quantization representation, the number of terms in many fermion-system Hamiltonians, such as molecular Hamiltonians, is substantial, approximately $\mathcal{O}(N^4)$, where $N$ is the number of molecular orbitals. Due to this, the computational resources required for Hamiltonian evolution and expectation value measurements could be excessively large. To address this, we introduce a grouping strategy that partitions these $\mathcal{O}(N^4)$ Hamiltonian terms into $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ groups, with the terms in each group mutually commuting. Based on this grouping method, we propose a parallel Hamiltonian evolution scheme that reduces the circuit depth of Hamiltonian evolution by a factor of $N$. Moreover, our grouping measurement strategy reduces the number of measurements needed to $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$, whereas the current best grouping measurement schemes require $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ measurements. Additionally, we find that measuring the expectation value of a group of Hamiltonian terms requires fewer repetitions than measuring a single term individually, thereby reducing the number of quantum circuit executions. Our approach saves a factor of $N^3$ in the overall time for Hamiltonian evolution and measurements, significantly decreasing the time required for quantum computers to simulate fermionic systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hang Zou, Erika Magnusson, Hampus Brunander, Werner Dobrautz, Martin Rahm</p>
            <p>Quantum error mitigation (QEM) strategies are essential for improving the precision and reliability of quantum chemistry algorithms on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Reference-state error mitigation (REM) is a cost-effective chemistry-inspired QEM method that performs exceptionally well for weakly correlated problems. However, the effectiveness of REM is often limited when applied to strongly correlated systems. Here, we introduce multireference-state error mitigation (MREM), an extension of REM that systematically captures quantum hardware noise in strongly correlated ground states by utilizing multireference states. A pivotal aspect of MREM is using Givens rotations to efficiently construct quantum circuits to generate multireference states. To strike a balance between circuit expressivity and noise sensitivity, we employ compact wavefunctions composed a few dominant Slater determinants. These truncated multireference states, engineered to exhibit substantial overlap with the target ground state, can effectively enhance error mitigation in variational quantum eigensolver experiments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MREM through comprehensive simulations of molecular systems $\mathrm{H_2O, ~N_2, ~and ~F_2}$, underscoring its ability to realize significant improvements in computational accuracy compared to the original REM method. MREM broadens the scope of error mitigation to encompass a wider variety of molecular systems, including those exhibiting pronounced electron correlation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giuseppe Castagnoli</p>
            <p>Involving only the measurements of commuting observables (the setting and the corresponding solution of the problem), quantum algorithms should be subject to classical logic. Under this assumption, their customary quantum description can be flunked by a classical logic description. This creates a new perspective under which to see them. The classical logic description of an optimal quantum algorithm shows that the sheer existence of its quantum speedup logically implies the mutually exclusive or of causal loops. In each of them, it is as if the problem-solver knew in advance, before beginning her problem-solving action, one of the possible halves of the information that specifies the solution of the problem she will produce and measure in the future. Then, she can use this knowledge in the best logical way to produce the solution with exactly the number of computation steps of the optimal quantum algorithm. Since the quantum and classical logic descriptions of the quantum algorithm must go along, this tells us that their customary quantum description, which says nothing of the sort, must be incomplete. It is indeed completed by time-symmetrizing it. This leaves the unitary part of the customary quantum description mathematically unaltered but changes the description of the behavior of causality along it. Its single causal process is replaced by the quantum superposition of the causal loops whose mutually exclusive or is logically implied by the sheer existence of the quantum speedup.</p>

            <p>High-precision rotational angle measurement in noise-prone environments holds critical impor tance in aerospace engineering, military navigation, and related domains. In this paper, we propose a quantum gyroscope scheme based on a cavity magnomechanical system, which enables high precision rotation angle detection by harnessing hybrid light-magnon interactions. Central to this framework is the employment of a two-mode squeezed coherent state, generated via parametric coupling of dual quantized optical fields with collective spin excitations (magnons), serving as the quantum metrological probe. We demonstrate that this scheme can significantly reduce quantum noise to levels far below the shot-noise limit. Furthermore, in the non-Markovian case, the per formance of the quantum gyroscope in a dissipative environment does not deteriorate over time, provided that the environmental spectral density satisfies certain conditions. These findings provide critical insights for advancing miniaturized quantum gyroscopes with sub-microradian precision, addressing long-standing challenges in inertial navigation systems under strong ambient noise.</p>

            <p>Superconducting quantum processors offer a promising path towards practical quantum computing. However, building a fault-tolerant quantum computer with millions of superconducting qubits is hindered by wiring density, packaging constraints and fabrication yield. Interconnecting medium-scale processors via low-loss superconducting links provides a promising alternative. Yet, achieving high-fidelity two-qubit gates across such channels remains difficult. Here, we show that a multimode coaxial cable can mediate high-contrast interaction between spatially separated super-conducting qubits. Leveraging interference between cable modes, we can implement high-fidelity controlled-Z and ZZ-free iSWAP gates by simply modulating qubit frequencies. Numerical simulations under realistic coherence and coupling parameters predict fidelities above 99% for both gate schemes. Our approach provides a versatile building block for modular superconducting architectures and facilitates distributed quantum error correction and large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computing.</p>

Here, we study the cooperative radiance of moiré excitons that is demonstrated to emerge from the deep subwavelength nature of the moiré lattice and the strong excitonic on-site interaction. In particular, we show that the static dipole-dipole interaction between interlayer excitons can strongly affect their cooperative optical properties, suppressing superradiance of disordered states while enhancing superradiance of ordered phases of moiré excitons. Moreover, we show that doping permits direct control of optical cooperativity, e.g., by generating supperradiant dynamics of otherwise subradiant states of excitons. Our results show that interlayer moiré excitons offer a unique platform for exploring cooperative optical phenomena in strongly interacting many-body systems, thus, holding promise for applications in quantum nonlinear optics.</p>

            <p>The resource overhead required to achieve net computational benefits from quantum error correction (QEC) limits its utility while current systems remain constrained in size, despite exceptional progress in experimental demonstrations. In this paper, we demonstrate that the strategic application of QEC primitives without logical encoding can yield significant advantages on superconducting processors--relative to any alternative error-reduction strategy--while only requiring a modest overhead. We first present a novel protocol for implementing long-range CNOT gates that relies on a unitarily prepared Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state as well as a unitary disentangling step; the protocol natively introduces an error-detection process using the disentangled qubits as flags. We demonstrate that it achieves state-of-the-art gate fidelities of over 85% across up to 40 lattice sites, significantly and consistently outperforming the best alternative measurement-based protocol without introducing any additional ancilla qubits. We then apply sparse stabilizer measurements to generate large GHZ states by detecting bit-flip and amplitude-damping errors. Employing this technique in combination with deterministic error suppression, we generate a 75-qubit GHZ state exhibiting genuine multipartite entanglement, the largest reported to date. The generation requires no more than 9 ancilla qubits and the fraction of samples discarded due to errors grows no higher than 78%, far lower than previous discard fractions required for tests using comparable numbers of fully encoded qubits. This work in total represents compelling evidence that adopting QEC primitives on current-generation devices can deliver substantial net benefits.</p>

            <h2>Schwinger pair production in counterpropagating laser pulses: Identifying volume factors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. G. Tkachev, I. A. Aleksandrov, V. M. Shabaev</p>
            <p>We investigate the nonperturbative process of vacuum pair production in a combination of two counterpropagating linearly polarized laser pulses of a finite spatial extent. By means of the locally-constant field approximation (LCFA), we calculate the total particle yield for the corresponding four-dimensional setup and compare it with the estimates obtained for simplified low-dimensional scenarios. Within the domain where the LCFA is well justified, we examine a combination of two plane-wave pulses, a standing electromagnetic wave, and a spatially uniform oscillating field and demonstrate that at each of these three levels of approximation, one can accurately predict the actual particle number by multiplying the results by properly chosen volume factors depending on the field parameters. We present closed-form expressions for these factors providing universal prescriptions for evaluating the particle yield. Our final formula connecting the spatially uniform setup with the four-dimensional scenario has a relative uncertainty of the level of $10\%$. The explicit correspondences deduced in this study not only prove the relevance of the approximate predictions, but also allow one to quickly estimate the number of pairs for various realistic scenarios without performing multidimensional LCFA integrations.</p>

            <p>The realization of electron-spin resonance at the single-atom level using scanning tunneling microscopy has opened new avenues for coherent quantum sensing and quantum state manipulation at the ultimate size limit. This allows to build many-body Hamiltonians and the study of their complex physical behavior. Recently, a novel qubit platform has emerged from this field, raising questions about the driving mechanism from single-atom magnets. In this work, we demonstrate how single-atom magnets can be used to drive a nearby single spin qubit efficiently. We show that the modulation of exchange coupling is the primary driving force, which successfully reproduces Rabi rates in the tens of MHz range, consistent with experimental data, while also addressing critical aspects related to the optimization of experimental parameters.</p>

            <h2>Study of the Quartic Anharmonic Oscillator Using the System's Wave Function Expansion in the Oscillator Basis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> V. A. Babenko, A. V. Nesterov</p>
            <p>The quantum quartic anharmonic oscillator with the Hamiltonian $H=\frac{1}{2}\left( p^{2}+x^{2}\right) +\lambda x^{4}$ is a classical and fundamental model that plays a key role in various branches of physics, including quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, high-energy particle physics, and other areas. To study this model, we apply a method based on a convergent expansion of the system's wave function in a complete set of harmonic oscillator eigenfunctions -- namely, the basis of eigenfunctions $\varphi^{(0)}_n$ of the unperturbed Hamiltonian $H^{(0)}=\frac{1}{2}\left(p^{2}+x^{2}\right)$. This approach enables a thorough analysis and calculation of the oscillator's physical characteristics. We demonstrate very good convergence of all calculated quantities with respect to the number of basis functions included in the expansion, over a wide range of $\lambda$ values. We have computed the energies of the ground and the first six excited states for a broad range of the coupling constant $\lambda$, and also calculated and constructed the corresponding wave functions. Additionally, we propose and detail an improved version of the expansion method using a modified optimized oscillator basis with variable frequency. This modification significantly accelerates the convergence of expansions across the entire range of $\lambda$, thereby greatly enhancing the efficiency of the method and allowing accurate calculations with a very small number of expansion functions $N\lesssim 10$. As a result, this modified approach provides an essentially complete, simple, and efficient solution to the problem of the anharmonic oscillator, enabling straightforward computation of all its physical properties -- including the energies and wave functions of both ground and excited states -- for arbitrary values of $\lambda$.</p>

            <p>We characterize exact, and approximate, optimality of games that players can interact with using quantum strategies. In comparison to a previous work of the author, arXiv: 2311.12887, which applied a 2016 framework due to Ostrev for constructing error bounds beyond CHSH and XOR games, in addition to the existence of well-posed semidefinite programs for determining primal feasible solutions, along with quantum-classical duality gaps, it continues to remain of interest to further develop the construction of error bounds, and related objects, to game-theoretic settings with several participants. In such settings, one encounters a rich information theoretic landscape, not only from the fact that there exists a significantly larger combinatorial space of possible strategies for each player, but also several opportunities for pronounced quantum advantage. We conclude this effort by describing other variants of other possible strategies, as proposed sources for quantum advantage, in $\mathrm{XOR}^{*}$, compiled $\mathrm{XOR}^{*}$, and strong parallel repetition variants of $\mathrm{XOR}^{*}$ games.</p>

            <h2>2D Quon Language: Unifying Framework for Cliffords, Matchgates, and Beyond</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Byungmin Kang, Chen Zhao, Zhengwei Liu, Xun Gao, Soonwon Choi</p>
            <p>Simulating generic quantum states and dynamics is practically intractable using classical computers. However, certain special classes -- namely Clifford and matchgate circuits -- permit efficient computation. They provide invaluable tools for studying many-body physics, quantum chemistry, and quantum computation. While both play foundational roles across multiple disciplines, the origins of their tractability seem disparate, and their relationship remain unclear. A deeper understanding of such tractable classes could expand their scope and enable a wide range of new applications. In this work, we make progress toward the unified understanding of the Clifford and matchgate -- these two classes are, in fact, distinct special cases of a single underlying structure. Specifically, we introduce the 2D Quon language, which combines Majorana worldlines with their underlying spacetime topology to diagrammatically represent quantum processes and tensor networks. In full generality, the 2D Quon language is universal -- capable of representing arbitrary quantum states, dynamics, or tensor networks -- yet they become especially powerful in describing Clifford and matchgate classes. Each class can be efficiently characterized in a visually recognizable manner using the Quon framework. This capability naturally gives rise to several families of efficiently computable tensor networks introduced in this work: punctured matchgates, hybrid Clifford-matchgate-MPS, and ansatze generated from factories of tractable networks. All of these exhibit high non-Cliffordness, high non-matchgateness, and large bipartite entanglement entropy. We discuss a range of applications of our approach, from recovering well-known results such as the Kramers-Wannier duality and the star-triangle relation of the Ising model, to enabling variational optimization with novel ansatz states.</p>

            <h2>Quasiprobabilistic imaginary-time evolution on quantum computers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Annie Ray, Esha Swaroop, Ningping Cao, Michael Vasmer, Anirban Chowdhury</p>
            <p>Imaginary-time evolution plays an important role in algorithms for computing ground-state and thermal equilibrium properties of quantum systems, but can be challenging to simulate on classical computers. Many quantum algorithms for imaginary-time evolution have resource requirements that are prohibitive for current quantum devices and face performance issues due to noise. Here, we propose a new algorithm for computing imaginary-time evolved expectation values on quantum computers, inspired by probabilistic error cancellation, an error-mitigation technique. Our algorithm works by decomposing a Trotterization of imaginary-time evolution into a probabilistic linear combination of operations, each of which is then implemented on a quantum computer. The measurement data is then classically post-processed to obtain the expectation value of the imaginary-time evolved state. Our algorithm requires no ancillary qubits and can be made noise-resilient without additional error mitigation. It is well-suited for estimating thermal expectation values by making use of the notion of a thermal pure quantum state. We demonstrate our algorithm by performing numerical simulations of thermal pure quantum state preparation for the 1D Heisenberg Hamiltonian on 8 qubits, and by using an IBM quantum computer to estimate the energy of the same Hamiltonian on 2 qubits. We observe promising results compared to the exact values, illustrating the potential of our algorithm for probing the physics of quantum many-body systems on current hardware.</p>

Demonstrations on the Ising and XY spin chains with n = 9 qubits yield circuits containing 4 parameters, achieving near-exact energy extrapolation across system sizes. Implementations on quantum hardware (Zuchongzhi chip) validate practicality, where two-qubit quantum gate noises can be effectively mitigated via zero-noise extrapolations for a spin chain system as large as 20 sites. This framework bridges algorithmic design and experimental constraints, complementing contemporary quantum architecture search frameworks to advance scalable quantum simulations.</p>

            <h2>Fault Tolerant Decoding of QLDPC-GKP Codes with Circuit Level Soft Information</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shantom K. Borah, Asit K. Pradhan, Nithin Raveendran, Michele Pacenti, Bane Vasic</p>
            <p>Concatenated bosonic-stabilizer codes have recently gained prominence as promising candidates for achieving low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum computing in the long term. In such systems, analog information obtained from the syndrome measurements of an inner bosonic code is used to inform decoding for an outer code layer consisting of a discrete-variable stabilizer code such as a surface code. The use of Quantum Low-Density Parity Check (QLDPC) codes as an outer code is of particular interest due to the significantly higher encoding rates offered by these code families, leading to a further reduction in overhead for large-scale quantum computing. Recent works have investigated the performance of QLDPC-GKP codes in detail, and the use of analog information from the inner code significantly boosts decoder performance. However, the noise models assumed in these works are typically limited to depolarizing or phenomenological noise. In this paper, we investigate the performance of QLDPC-GKP concatenated codes under circuit-level noise, based on a model introduced by Noh et al. in the context of the surface-GKP code. To demonstrate the performance boost from analog information, we investigate three scenarios: (a) decoding without soft information, (b) decoding with precomputed error probabilities but without real-time soft information, and (c) decoding with real-time soft information obtained from round-to-round decoding of the inner GKP code. Results show minimal improvement between (a) and (b), but a significant boost in (c), indicating that real-time soft information is critical for concatenated decoding under circuit-level noise. We also study the effect of measurement schedules with varying depths and show that using a schedule with minimum depth is essential for obtaining reliable soft information from the inner code.</p>

            <h2>The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm Can Require Exponential Time to Optimize Linear Functions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francisco Chicano, Zakaria Abdelmoiz Dahi, Gabiel Luque</p>
            <p>QAOA is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm to solve optimization problems in gate-based quantum computers. It is based on a variational quantum circuit that can be interpreted as a discretization of the annealing process that quantum annealers follow to find a minimum energy state of a given Hamiltonian. This ensures that QAOA must find an optimal solution for any given optimization problem when the number of layers, $p$, used in the variational quantum circuit tends to infinity. In practice, the number of layers is usually bounded by a small number. This is a must in current quantum computers of the NISQ era, due to the depth limit of the circuits they can run to avoid problems with decoherence and noise. In this paper, we show mathematical evidence that QAOA requires exponential time to solve linear functions when the number of layers is less than the number of different coefficients of the linear function $n$. We conjecture that QAOA needs exponential time to find the global optimum of linear functions for any constant value of $p$, and that the runtime is linear only if $p \geq n$. We conclude that we need new quantum algorithms to reach quantum supremacy in quantum optimization.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Asif Akhtab Ronggon, Md. Saifur Rahman</p>
            <p>This paper presents a novel quantum K-nearest neighbors (QKNN) algorithm, which offers improved performance over the classical k-NN technique by incorporating quantum computing (QC) techniques to enhance classification accuracy, scalability, and robustness. The proposed modifications focus on optimizing quantum data encoding using Hadamard and rotation gates, ensuring more effective rendering of classical data in quantum states. In addition, the quantum feature extraction process is significantly enhanced by the use of entangled gates such as IsingXY and CNOT, which enables better feature interactions and class separability. A novel quantum distance metric, based on the swap test, is introduced to calculate similarity measures between various quantum states, offering superior accuracy and computational efficiency compared to traditional Euclidean distance metrics. We assess the achievement of the proposed QKNN algorithm on three benchmark datasets: Wisconsin Breast Cancer, Iris, and Bank Note Authentication, and have noted its superior performance relative to both classical k-NN (CKNN) and Quantum Neural Network (QNN). The proposed QKNN algorithm is found to achieve prediction accuracies of 98.25%, 100%, and 99.27% ,respectively, for the three datasets, while the customized QNN shows prediction accuracies of only 97.17%, 83.33%, and 86.18%, respectively. Furthermore, we address the challenges of quantum noise by incorporating a repetition encoding-based error mitigation strategy, which ensures the stability and resilience of the algorithm in noisy quantum environments. The results highlight the potential of the proposed QKNN as a scalable, efficient and robust quantum-enhanced machine learning algorithm, especially in high-dimensional and complex datasets, when traditional approaches frequently fail.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhixin Song, Hang Ren, Melody Lee, Bryan Gard, Nicolas Renaud, Spencer H. Bryngelson</p>
            <p>Quantum tomography is a crucial tool for characterizing quantum states and devices and estimating nonlinear properties of the systems. Performing full quantum state tomography (FQST) on an $N_\mathrm{q}$ qubit system requires an exponentially increasing overhead with $O(3^{N_\mathrm{q}})$ distinct Pauli measurement settings to resolve all complex phases and reconstruct the density matrix. However, many appealing applications of quantum computing, such as quantum linear system algorithms, require only real-valued amplitudes. Here we introduce a novel readout method for real-valued quantum states that reduces measurement settings required for state vector reconstruction to $O(N_\mathrm{q})$, while the post-processing cost remains exponential. This approach offers a substantial speedup over conventional tomography. We experimentally validate our method up to 10~qubits on the latest available IBM quantum processor and demonstrate that it accurately extracts key properties such as entanglement and magic. Our method also outperforms the standard SWAP test for state overlap estimation. This calculation resembles a numerical integration in certain cases and can be applied to extract nonlinear properties, which are important in application fields.</p>

            <p>Quantum image processing (QIMP) has recently emerged as a promising field for modern image processing applications. In QIMP algorithms, encoding classical image informaiton into quantum circuit is important as the first step. However, most of existing encoding methods use gates almost twice the number of pixels in an image, and simulating even a modest sized image is computationally demanding. In this work, we propose a quantum image encoding method that effectively reduces gates than the number of pixels by a factor at least 4. We demonstrate our method for various 1024 by 1024 high-quality medical images captured during the Bilateral Axillo-Breast Approach (BABA) robotic thyroidectomy surgery. Additionally, two compression techniques are proposed to further reduce the number of gates as well as pre-processing time with negligible loss of image quality. We suggest our image encoding strategy as a valuable option for large scale medical imaging.</p>

            <p>The (tolerant) Hamiltonian locality testing problem, introduced in [Bluhm, Caro,Oufkir `24], is to determine whether a Hamiltonian $H$ is $\varepsilon_1$-close to being $k$-local (i.e. can be written as the sum of weight-$k$ Pauli operators) or $\varepsilon_2$-far from any $k$-local Hamiltonian, given access to its time evolution operator and using as little total evolution time as possible, with distance typically defined by the normalized Frobenius norm. We give the tightest known bounds for this problem, proving an $\text{O}\left(\sqrt{\frac{\varepsilon_2}{(\varepsilon_2-\varepsilon_1)^5}}\right)$ evolution time upper bound and an $\Omega\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon_2-\varepsilon_1}\right)$ lower bound. Our algorithm does not require reverse time evolution or controlled application of the time evolution operator, although our lower bound applies to algorithms using either tool. Furthermore, we show that if we are allowed reverse time evolution, this lower bound is tight, giving a matching $\text{O}\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon_2-\varepsilon_1}\right)$ evolution time algorithm.</p>

            <p>We present a thermodynamic rendering model in which the traditional quantum observer is reframed as a special case of a coherence-constrained interface. Collapse is treated not as an interpretive postulate but as a structural threshold -- reached when the energetic cost of stabilizing superposition exceeds a system's available budget. The Quantum Toll Framework (QTF) formalizes this by recasting observation as a bounded rendering process, governed by entropy, energy, and failure. Extending Landauer's principle, we show that the thermodynamic cost of observation includes not only information erasure but also the sustainment of rendered states. Collapse is thus reinterpreted as a solvable, testable thermodynamic transition. This model explains classical emergence, time asymmetry, and measurement without invoking consciousness or symbolic cognition. Under QTF, the observer is not fundamental but derivative -- a biological and technological interface evolved to stabilize collapse. Empirical consequences, including spatial constraints on collapse in cloud chambers, are discussed.</p>

            <p>We study the radiative dynamics of coupled electric dipoles, modelled as Lorentz oscillators (LOs), in the presence of real-time mechanical oscillations. The dipoles are treated in a self-consistent way through a direct electromagnetic simulation approach that fully includes the dynamical movement of the charges, accounting for radiation reaction, emission and absorption. This allows for a powerful numerical solution of optomechanical resonances without any perturbative approximations for the mechanical motion. The scaled population (excitation) dynamics of the LOs are investigated as well as the emitted radiation and electromagnetic spectra, which demonstrates how the usual dipole-dipole resonances couple to the underlying Floquet states, yielding multiple spectral peaks that are separated from the superradiant and subradiant states by an integer number of the mechanical oscillation frequency. Moreover, we observe that when the mechanical amplitude and frequency are sufficiently large, these additional spectral peaks undergo further modification, including spectral splitting, spectral squeezing, or shifting. These observations are fully corroborated by a theoretical Floquet analysis conducted on two coupled harmonic oscillators.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiun-Shiuan Shiu, Chang-Wei Lin, Yong-Fan Chen</p>
            <p>We present an experimental investigation of how ground-state decoherence and phase mismatch influence biphoton generation in double-{\Lambda} spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) within a cold atomic ensemble. Our results reveal significant asymmetry in the Stokes and anti-Stokes photon generation rates, arising from the distinct effects of phase mismatch and ground-state decoherence. While phase mismatch primarily drives this asymmetry under minimal decoherence, larger decoherence further amplifies it, underscoring the complex interplay between these factors. Using the coincidence count rate representation, we provide insights into pairing ratios and demonstrate that the stimulated four-wave mixing process inherent in SFWM explains the observed phenomena. Interestingly, although ground-state decoherence reduces the generation of temporally correlated photons, it paradoxically enhances biphoton purity, as confirmed through conditional autocorrelation measurements. This counterintuitive phenomenon is reported here for the first time. Furthermore, unconditional autocorrelation measurements show that the generated photons follow a thermal-state distribution, consistent with theoretical predictions. This study advances the understanding of biphoton generation dynamics and temporal photon correlations in SFWM, offering valuable insights for optimizing SFWM-based biphoton sources and their applications in quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>Academia, governments, and industry around the world are on a quest to build long-distance quantum communication networks for a future quantum internet. Using air and fiber channels, quantum communication quickly faced the daunting challenge of exponential photon loss with distance. Quantum repeaters were invented to solve the loss problem by probabilistically establishing entanglement over short distances and using quantum memories to synchronize the teleportation of such entanglement to long distances. However, due to imperfections and complexities of quantum memories, ground-based proof-of-concept repeater demonstrations have been restricted to metropolitan-scale distances. In contrast, direct photon transmission from satellites through empty space faces almost no exponential absorption loss and only quadratic beam divergence loss. A single satellite successfully distributed entanglement over more than 1,200 km. It is becoming increasingly clear that quantum communication over large intercontinental distances (e.g. 4,000-20,000 km) will likely employ a satellite-based architecture. This could involve quantum memories and repeater protocols in satellites, or memory-less satellite-chains through which photons are simply reflected, or some combination thereof. Rapid advancements in the space launch and classical satellite communications industry provide a strong tailwind for satellite quantum communication, promising economical and easier deployment of quantum communication satellites.</p>

            <p>Absolutely maximally entangled states are quantum states that exhibit maximal entanglement across any bipartition, making them valuable for applications. This study investigates the behavior of qubit AME states under the influence of noisy quantum channels. Our results demonstrate that for certain channels, such as the depolarizing channel, the entanglement properties remain invariant under local unitary transformations and are independent of the choice of qubits in each subset. However, for channels like the dephasing channel, the entanglement behavior can vary depending on the specific AME state and the choice of qubits, revealing a symmetry-breaking effect. These findings highlight the nuanced relationship between AME states and noise, providing insights into their robustness and potential applications in noisy quantum systems.</p>

            <p>The generation and manipulation of distant entanglement between disparate systems is crucial for various quantum technologies. In this work, we investigate a system of coupled cavities comprising an ensemble in cavity-1, a yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) sphere in cavity-2, and a coherent feedback loop (CFL) that feeds the output of cavity-1 back into cavity-1 through a beam splitter. This system features five excitation modes: cavity-1 photons, atomic ensemble, cavity-2 photons, the magnon, and phonon modes of the YIG sphere. Thus various combinations of bipartite entanglements can be studied. Our main focus is the study of various combinations of distant bipartite entanglements, especially the entanglement of the atomic ensemble and photons in cavity-1 with the magnon and phonon modes of the YIG sphere in cavity-2. Compared to the previously reported results, introducing a CFL significantly enhances all the bipartite entanglements. Besides, the degree of entanglement of various modes, the parameters space, where the strong entanglement exists, is also significantly enhanced due to CFL. Moreover, the entanglement is more robust against thermal noise. We believe our results are important for quantum technologies where the distribution of entanglement on quantum networks is crucial.</p>

            <p>On-chip photonic networks require adequately spatially ordered matter-photon interconversion qubit sources with emission figures-of-merit exceeding the requirements that would enable the desired functional response of the network. The mesa-top single quantum dots (MTSQDs) have recently been demonstrated to meet these requirements. The substrate-encoded size-reducing epitaxy (SESRE) approach underpinning the realization of these quantum emitters allows control on the shape, size, and strain (lattice-matched or mismatched) of these epitaxial single quantum dots. We have exploited this unique feature of the MTSQDs to reproducibly create arrays of quantum dots that exhibit single photon superradiance, characteristic of a delicate balance between the confinement potential volume, depth, and the resulting binding energy of the center of mass motion of the exciton and the exciton binding energy. In the exciton's weak confinement regime, direct enhancement of the quantum dot oscillator strength to ~30 is demonstrated for emitters in large arrays. Our findings provide compelling incentive for investigations of the potential of SESRE based tailored MTSQDs of lattice matched and mismatched material combinations for fabricating and studying interconnected networks enabled by these unique matter qubit-light qubit interconversion units.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anthony J. Brady, Alec Eickbusch, Shraddha Singh, Jing Wu, Quntao Zhuang</p>
            <p>Encoding quantum information into a set of harmonic oscillators is considered a hardware efficient approach to mitigate noise for reliable quantum information processing. Various codes have been proposed to encode a qubit into an oscillator -- including cat codes, binomial codes and Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes -- and are among the first to reach a break-even point for quantum error correction. Though GKP codes are widely recognized for their promise in quantum computation, they also facilitate near-optimal quantum communication rates in bosonic channels and offer the ability to safeguard arbitrary quantum states of oscillators. This review focuses on the basic working mechanism, performance characterization, and the many applications of GKP codes -- emphasizing recent experimental progress in superconducting circuit architectures and theoretical advancements in multimode GKP qubit codes and oscillators-to-oscillators (O2O) codes. We begin with a preliminary continuous-variable formalism needed for bosonic codes. We then proceed to the quantum engineering involved to physically realize GKP states. We take a deep dive into GKP stabilization and preparation in superconducting architectures and examine proposals for realizing GKP states in the optical domain (along with a concise review of GKP realization in trapped-ion platforms). Finally, we present multimode GKP qubits and GKP-O2O codes, examine code performance and discuss applications of GKP codes in quantum information processing tasks such as computing, communication, and sensing.</p>

            <h2>Resource-efficient Generalized Quantum Subspace Expansion</h2>

            <p>Realizing practical quantum computing requires overcoming a number of computation errors and the limitation of device size, which have intensively been tackled by quantum error mitigation (QEM) these days. As a unified approach of noise-agnostic QEM, generalized quantum subspace expansion (GSE) has lately been proposed to be remarkably robust against stochastic and coherent errors, integrating quantum subspace expansion and virtual state purification. However, the requirement in GSE to perform entangled measurements between copies of the quantum states remains a significant drawback under the current situation of quantum devices with a restricted number of qubits and their connectivity. In this work, we propose ``Dual-GSE'', a resource-efficient implementation of GSE to circumvent this overhead by constructing an ansatz of error-mitigated quantum states via dual-state purification without state copies. Remarkably, the proposed method can further simulate larger quantum systems beyond the size of available quantum hardware, achieved by a suitable ansatz construction inspired by the divide-and-conquer strategy that classically reintroduces the effect of entanglement. While classically forging the entanglement comes with additional cost, the total sampling overhead can be notably reduced by reusing the same Pauli expectation values among divided-and-conquered subsystems. We comprehensively analyze the advantages and overhead of Dual-GSE and perform numerical simulations of the eight-qubit transverse-field Ising model under various setups. Our results demonstrate that Dual-GSE estimates the ground state energy with high accuracy under gate noise with low mitigation overhead and practical sampling cost.</p>

            <p>Quantum systems subject to random unitary evolution and measurements at random points in spacetime exhibit entanglement phase transitions which depend on the frequency of these measurements. Past work has experimentally observed entanglement phase transitions on near-term quantum computers, but the characterization approach using entanglement entropy is not scalable due to exponential overhead of quantum state tomography and postselection. Recently, an alternative protocol to detect entanglement phase transitions using linear cross entropy was proposed, attempting to eliminate both bottlenecks. Here, we report demonstrations of this protocol in systems with one-dimensional and all-to-all connectivities on IBM's quantum hardware on up to 22 qubits, a regime which is presently inaccessible if postselection is required. We demonstrate data collapses onto scaling functions with critical exponents in semiquantitative agreement with theory. Our demonstration of the cross entropy benchmark (XEB) protocol paves the way for studies of measurement-induced entanglement phase transitions and associated critical phenomena on larger near-term quantum systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Neng Zeng, Tao Liu, Keyu Xia, Yu-Ran Zhang, Franco Nori</p>
            <p>By employing the Naimark dilation, we establish a fundamental connection between non-Hermitian quantum sensing and post-selected measurements. The sensitivity of non-Hermitian quantum sensors is determined by the effective quantum Fisher information (QFI), which incorporates the success probability of post-selection. We demonstrate that non-Hermitian sensors cannot outperform their Hermitian counterpart when all information is harnessed, since the total QFI for the extended system constrains the effective QFI of the non-Hermitian subsystem. Moreover, we quantify the efficiency of non-Hermitian sensors with the ratio of the effective QFI to the total QFI, which can be optimized within the framework of post-selected measurements with minimal experimental trials. Our work provides a distinctive theoretical framework for investigating non-Hermitian quantum sensing and designing noise-resilient quantum metrological protocols.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Umut Eren Usturali, Claudio Chamon, Andrei E. Ruckenstein, Eduardo R. Mucciolo</p>
            <p>We introduce a novel normal form representation of Boolean functions in terms of products of binary matrices, hereafter referred to as the Binary Matrix Product (BMP) representation. BMPs are analogous to the Tensor-Trains (TT) and Matrix Product States (MPS) used, respectively, in applied mathematics and in quantum many-body physics to accelerate computations that are usually inaccessible by more traditional approaches. BMPs turn out to be closely related to Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs), a powerful compressed representation of Boolean functions invented in the late 80s by Bryant that has found a broad range of applications in many areas of computer science and engineering. We present a direct and natural translation of BMPs into Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs), and derive an elementary set of operations used to manipulate and combine BMPs that are analogous to those introduced by Bryant for BDDs. Both BDDs and BMPs are practical tools when the complexity of these representations, as measured by the maximum bond dimension of a BMP (or the accumulated bond dimension across the BMP matrix train) and the number of nodes of a BDD, remains polynomial in the number of bits, $n$. In both cases, controlling the complexity hinges on optimizing the order of the Boolean variables. BMPs offer the advantage that their construction and manipulation rely on simple linear algebra -- a compelling feature that can facilitate the development of open-source libraries that are both more flexible and easier to use than those currently available for BDDs. An initial implementation of a BMP library is available on GitHub, with the expectation that the close conceptual connection to TT and MPS techniques will motivate further development of BMP methods by researchers in these fields, potentially enabling novel applications to classical and quantum computing.</p>

            <h2>General Hamiltonian description of nonreciprocal interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Bo Shi, Roderich Moessner, Ricard Alert, Marin Bukov</p>
            <p>In a vast class of systems, which includes members as diverse as active colloids and bird flocks, interactions do not stem from a potential, and are in general nonreciprocal. Thus, it is not possible to define a conventional energy function, nor to use analytical or numerical tools that rely on it. Here, we overcome these limitations by constructing a Hamiltonian that includes auxiliary degrees of freedom; when subject to a constraint, this Hamiltonian yields the original non-reciprocal dynamics. We show that Glauber dynamics based on the constrained Hamiltonian reproduces the steady states of the original Langevin dynamics, as we explicitly illustrate for dissipative XY spins with vision-cone interactions. Further, the symplectic structure inherent to our construction allows us to apply the well-developed notions of Hamiltonian engineering, which we demonstrate by varying the amplitude of a periodic drive to tune the spin interactions between those of a square and a chain lattice geometry. Overall, our framework for generic nonreciprocal pairwise interactions paves the way for bringing to bear the full conceptual and methodological power of conventional statistical mechanics and Hamiltonian dynamics to nonreciprocal systems.</p>

            <h2>A Circuit-QED Lattice System with Flexible Connectivity and Gapped Flat Bands for Photon-Mediated Spin Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kellen O'Brien, Maya Amouzegar, Won Chan Lee, Martin Ritter, Alicia J. Kollár</p>
            <p>Quantum spin models are ubiquitous in solid-state physics, but classical simulation of them remains extremely challenging. Experimental testbed systems with a variety of spin-spin interactions and measurement channels are therefore needed. One promising potential route to such testbeds is provided by microwave-photon-mediated interactions between superconducting qubits, where native strong light-matter coupling enables significant interactions even for virtual-photon-mediated processes. In this approach, the spin-model connectivity is set by the photonic mode structure, rather than the spatial structure of the qubit. Lattices of coplanar-waveguide (CPW) resonators have been demonstrated to allow extremely flexible connectivities and can therefore host a huge variety of photon-mediated spin models. However, large-scale CPW lattices have never before been successfully combined with superconducting qubits. Here we present the first such device featuring a quasi-1D CPW lattice with a non-trivial band structure and multiple transmon qubits. We demonstrate that superconducting-qubit readout and diagnostic techniques can be generalized to this highly multimode environment and observe the effective qubit-qubit interaction mediated by the bands of the resonator lattice. This device completes the toolkit needed to realize CPW lattices with qubits in one or two Euclidean dimensions, or negatively-curved hyperbolic space, and paves the way to driven-dissipative spin models with a large variety of connectivities.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samuele Piccinelli, Francesco Tacchino, Ivano Tavernelli, Giuseppe Carleo</p>
            <p>We propose a novel, ancilla-free algorithm to compute Retarded Green's Functions (RGFs) on quantum computers. Our proposal is based on real-time evolution and specifically designed circuit components, which we refer to as circuit perturbations, acting as a direct representation of the external perturbative force within the quantum circuit in a linear response framework. First, we establish a direct analytical connection between the evaluation of circuit derivatives and the computation of RGFs. We then build on this connection to devise a new approach involving multiple simultaneous time perturbations. Our method does not require long-range connections and is efficient in terms of circuit calls, allowing us to compute the RGFs at different times simultaneously. We benchmark the protocol on the one-dimensional Heisenberg and Fermi-Hubbard models, comparing the resulting dynamical correlations and spectral functions with exact diagonalization. The results demonstrate good quantitative agreement with the predicted solutions even under realistic noise models, highlighting the practical potential of our method for studying complex dynamical phenomena on near-term quantum devices.</p>

            <p>Quantum networks might enable quantum communication and distributed quantum computation. Solid-state defects are promising platforms for such networks, because they provide an optical interface for remote entanglement distribution and a nuclear-spin register to store and process quantum information. A key challenge towards larger networks is to improve the storage of previously generated entangled states during new entanglement generation. Here, we introduce a method that uses `spectator' qubits combined with real-time decision making and feedforward to mitigate dephasing of stored quantum states during remote entanglement sequences. We implement the protocol using a single NV center in diamond and demonstrate improved memory fidelity. Our results show that spectator qubits can improve quantum network memory using minimal overhead and naturally present resources, making them a promising addition for near-term testbeds for quantum networks.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Teleportation in Non-equilibrium Environments and Fixed-point Fidelity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaokun Yan, Zhihai Wang, Kun Zhang, Jin Wang</p>
            <p>Quantum teleportation, a fundamental protocol in quantum information science, enables the transfer of quantum states through entangled particle pairs and classical communication channels. While ideal quantum teleportation requires maximally entangled states as resources, real-world implementations inevitably face environmental noise and decoherence effects. In this work, we investigate quantum teleportation in non-equilibrium environments with different temperatures or chemical potentials. We apply the Bloch-Redfield equation to characterize the non-equilibrium dynamics. In both bosonic and fermionic setups, the fidelity can be enhanced beyond the equilibrium values. Under specific non-equilibrium conditions, the fidelities of all input states are identical. We call it teleportation with a fixed-point fidelity. Notably, at the fixed-point, fidelity can also be enhanced by combining the two detuned qubits and non-equilibrium environments. These findings provide important guidance for implementing quantum communication protocols in realistic environments, while the fixed-point mechanism offers a promising pathway toward simplifying practical quantum teleportation schemes.</p>

            <p>In the last decade, the microwave quantum electronics toolbox has been enriched with quantum limited detection devices such as Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifiers (TWPAs). The extreme sensitivity they provide is not only mandatory for some physics applications within quantum information processing, but is also the key element that will determine the detection limit of quantum sensing setups. In the framework of microwave optomechanical systems, an unprecedented range of small motions and forces is accessible, for which a specific quantitative calibration becomes necessary. We report on near quantum-limited measurements performed with an aluminum drumhead mechanical device within the temperature range 4 mK - 400 mK. The whole setup is carefully calibrated, especially taking into account the power-dependence of microwave absorption in the superconducting optomechanical cavity. This effect is commonly attributed to Two-Level-Systems (TLSs) present in the metal oxide. We demonstrate that a similar feature exists in the TWPA, and can be phenomenologically fit with adapted expressions. The power and temperature dependence is studied over the full parameter range, leading to an absolute definition of phonon population (i.e. Brownian motion amplitude), with an uncertainty +-20 %.</p>

            <p>Ideal effective parity-time (PT)-symmetry can be achieved in a passive open system by accurately balancing feeding and absorption processes. Such PT-symmetric systems display Hermitian subspaces which enable perfect absorption (PA) of radiation, i.e., all the incoming energy is absorbed by the system. In this work, we consider a passive open quantum system obtained by coupling molecular spin centers to a planar microwave resonator operating at milliKelvin temperatures and at few-photon power level. We experimentally demonstrate that Hermitian subspaces and thus PA can be implemented even in the absence of PT-symmetry, by exploiting the spin detuning to control the photon and spin content of a polariton mode. In such a way, the required balance between the feeding and the loss rates is effectively recovered. We show that Hermitian subspaces influence the overall aspect of coherent spectra of cavity QED systems and significantly enlarge the possibility to explore non-Hermitian effects in open quantum systems. We finally discuss how Hermitian subspaces can be potentially exploited for the development of efficient switches and modulators with high modulation depths over a broad spectral range.</p>

Chiral EPs are implemented by dynamically tuning the coupling between the modes associated with a micro-ring resonator, resulting in anomalous spontaneous emission dynamic with a 7-fold modulation of the lifetime (120 ps to 850 ps). Meanwhile, we reshape single-photon spectra via cavity local density of states (LDOS) engineering and generate non-Lorentzian spectral profiles: squared-Lorentzian, Fano-like, and EP-induced transparency (EPIT), a suppression of emission at zero detuning.

To accomplish this, we use chip-scale silicon nitride micro-resonators to generate entangled photons with narrow linewidth, compatible with the quantum memory. We confirm the quality of the quantum teleportation procedure using quantum state and process tomography techniques, in which both the quantum state and process fidelities exceeds the classical limit.

However, unlocking diamond's full potential as a nonlinear photonic material with non-zero second-order susceptibility $\chi^{(2)}\neq0$ requires symmetry breaking. In this work, we use a nanoscale cavity to demonstrate second-harmonic generation (SHG) in diamond, and demonstrate, for the first time, that the magnitude of the diamond's effective $\chi^{(2)}$ strongly depends on the electronic configuration of defects in the diamond crystal, such as nitrogen vacancy centres. The modification of $\chi^{(2)}$ arises from photoionisation from the negative to neutral charge state, and is manifested by quenching of SHG upon green illumination. Toggling the green illumination allows for optical switching of the device's $\chi^{(2)}$.

            <h2>Quantum information processing in modular cavity QED architectures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Z. M. McIntyre</p>
            <p>This thesis contains a collection of articles exploring various aspects of quantum information processing with cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED), starting with qubit noise spectroscopy and building towards the longer-term goal of modular quantum-computing architectures equipped with protocols for controlling and correcting the states of distantly separated qubits. The first chapter presents a self-contained introduction to the field of cavity QED. Following this introductory material, we show in Chapter 2 how measurements of the field emitted by a cavity can be leveraged for in-situ qubit noise spectroscopy in the presence of significant inhomogeneous broadening. We also identify a signature of genuinely quantum noise in the cavity output field originating from the non-commutation of bath operators acting on the qubit. In Chapter 3, we present a novel quantum-optical effect whereby a suitable modulation of a longitudinal cavity-qubit coupling can be used to entangle the state of a qubit with the path taken by a multiphoton wavepacket. Entanglement between a qubit and a which-path degree-of-freedom can in turn be used to generate entanglement between distant stationary qubits. As shown in Chapter 4, qubit-which-path entanglement can also be exploited for maximally sensitive estimation of a phase in a Mach-Zehnder interferometry setup, i.e., sensing at the quantum Cramér-Rao bound. In Chapter 5, we discuss strategies for realizing stabilizer measurements using qubit-conditioned phase shifts applied to propagating pulses of radiation. We find that in the context of a subsystem surface code, photon loss during such stabilizer measurements would not introduce any horizontal hook errors on the code qubits. In the sixth and final chapter, we give protocols for performing entangling gates between distant stationary qubits using Fock- or time-bin encoded photons.</p>

            <p>We discover an unexpected behavior in a hybrid system composed of cavity strongly coupled to molecules and subjected to high intensity coherent pumping. We show that if the frequency of the pumping wave is close to polariton transitions in the hybrid system, non monotone dependence of fluorescence and scattering amplitudes on pump intensity with a narrow resonance-like response occurs. We demonstrate that this phenomenon occurs due to hybridization of lower and upper polaritons with substantially different excitation numbers caused by the pumping affecting polariton states of the system. This occurs when the Rabi interaction with coherent field is comparable to the field-matter coupling constant which in turn needs to be sufficient for the manifestation of strong coupling. This non-monotonic dependence of the fluorescence and scattering amplitudes on pump rate intensity pave the way for creation of nonlinear optical devices.</p>

            <p>Polaritons are quantum mechanical superpositions of photon states with elementary excitations in molecules and solids. The light-matter admixture causes a characteristic frequency-momentum dispersion shared by all polaritons irrespective of the microscopic nature of material excitations that could entail charge, spin, lattice or orbital effects. Polaritons retain the strong nonlinearities of their matter component and simultaneously inherit ray-like propagation of light. Polaritons prompt new properties, enable new opportunities for spectroscopy/imaging, empower quantum simulations and give rise to new forms of synthetic quantum matter. Here, we review the emergent effects rooted in polaritonic quasiparticles in a wide variety of their physical implementations. We present a broad portfolio of the physical platforms and phenomena of what we term polaritonic quantum matter. We discuss the unifying aspects of polaritons across different platforms and physical implementations and focus on recent developments in: polaritonic imaging, cavity electrodynamics and cavity materials engineering, topology and nonlinearities, as well as quantum polaritonics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei Chen, Guin-Dar Lin, H. H. Jen</p>
            <p>In one-dimensional waveguide quantum electrodynamics systems, quantum emitters interact through infinite-range, dispersive, and dissipative dipole-dipole interactions mediated by guided photonic modes. These interactions give rise to long-range periodic behavior and rich many-body physics absent in free space. In this work, we construct a set of symmetrized multi-excitation dark states and derive analytic expressions for their time-evolution projections. This framework captures the essential dynamics of excitation transport and storage while significantly reducing computational complexity compared to full quantum simulations. Our analysis reveals a fundamental bound on energy redistribution governed by the structure of dark states and collective dissipation, and discovers that optimal excitation transfer between emitter ensembles converges toward an initial pumped fraction of $N_\text{p}/N \approx 0.55$ for large system sizes. We further examine the robustness of this mechanism under realistic imperfections, including positional disorder, nonradiative decay, and dephasing. These results highlight the role of many-body dark states in enabling efficient and controllable energy transfer, offering new insights into dissipative many-body dynamics in integrated quantum platforms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinxin Cai, Habitamu Y. Walelign, John M. Nichol</p>
            <p>Silicon-based qubits are often made by trapping individual electrons in quantum dots defined by electric gates. Quantum information can then be stored using the spin states of the electrons. However, the nuclei of the surrounding atoms also have spin degrees of freedom that couple to the electron spin qubits and cause decoherence. The emergence of a nuclear-spin dark state has been predicted to reduce this coupling during dynamic nuclear polarization, when the electrons in the quantum dot drive the nuclei in the semiconductor into a decoupled state. Here, we report the formation of a nuclear-spin dark state in a gate-defined silicon double quantum dot. We show that, as expected, the transverse electron-nuclear coupling rapidly diminishes in the dark state, and that this state depends on the synchronized precession of the nuclear spins. Moreover, the dark state significantly reduces the relaxation rate between the singlet and triplet electronic spin states. This nuclear-spin dark state has potential applications as a quantum memory or in quantum sensing, and might enable increased polarization of nuclear spin ensembles.</p>

            <h2>Composable Finite-Size Security of High-Dimensional Quantum Key Distribution Protocols</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Florian Kanitschar, Marcus Huber</p>
            <p>Practical implementations of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) extending beyond urban areas commonly use satellite links. However, the transmission of quantum states through the Earth's atmosphere is highly susceptible to noise, restricting its application primarily to nighttime. High-dimensional (HD) QKD offers a promising solution to this limitation by employing high-dimensionally entangled quantum states. Although experimental platforms for HD QKD exist, previous security analyses were limited to the asymptotic regime and have either relied on impractical measurements or employed computationally demanding convex optimization tasks restricting the security analysis to low dimensions. In this work, we bridge this gap by presenting a composable finite-size security proof against both collective and coherent attacks for a general HD QKD protocol that utilizes only experimentally accessible measurements. In addition to the conventional, yet impractical `one-shot' key rates, we also provide a practical variable-length security argument that yields significantly higher expected key rates. This approach is particularly crucial for rapidly changing and turbulent atmospheric conditions, as encountered for free-space and satellite-based QKD platforms.</p>

            <h2>Non-Gaussian Noise Magnetometry Using Local Spin Qubits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonathan B. Curtis, Amir Yacoby, Eugene Demler</p>
            <p>Atomic scale qubits, as may be realized in nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, offer the opportunity to study magnetic field noise with nanometer scale spatial resolution. Using these spin qubits, one can learn a great deal about the magnetic-field noise correlations, and correspondingly the collective-mode spectra, in quantum materials and devices. However, to date these tools have been essentially restricted to studying Gaussian noise processes -- equivalent to linear-response. In this work we will show how to extend these techniques beyond the Gaussian regime and show how to unambiguously measure higher-order magnetic noise cumulants in a local, spatially resolved way. We unveil two protocols for doing this; the first uses a single spin-qubit and different dynamical decoupling sequences to extract non-Markovian and non-Gaussian spin-echo noise. The second protocol uses two-qubit coincidence measurements to study spatially non-local cumulants in the magnetic noise. We then demonstrate the utility of these protocols by considering a model of a bath of non-interacting two-level systems, as well as a model involving spatially correlated magnetic fluctuations near a second-order Ising phase transition. In both cases, we highlight how this technique can be used to measure in a real many-body system how fluctuation dynamics converge towards the central limit theorem as a function of effective bath size. We then conclude by discussing some promising applications and extensions of this method.</p>

            <h2>Real-Time Scattering on Quantum Computers via Hamiltonian Truncation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> James Ingoldby, Michael Spannowsky, Timur Sypchenko, Simon Williams, Matthew Wingate</p>
            <p>We present a quantum computational framework using Hamiltonian Truncation (HT) for simulating real-time scattering processes in $(1+1)$-dimensional scalar $\phi^4$ theory. Unlike traditional lattice discretisation methods, HT approximates the quantum field theory Hilbert space by truncating the energy eigenbasis of a solvable reference Hamiltonian, significantly reducing the number of required qubits. Our approach involves preparing initial states as wavepackets through adiabatic evolution from the free-field theory to the interacting regime. We experimentally demonstrate this state preparation procedure on an IonQ trapped-ion quantum device and validate it through quantum simulations, capturing key phenomena such as wavepacket dynamics, interference effects, and particle production post-collision. Detailed resource comparisons highlight the advantages of HT over lattice approaches in terms of qubit efficiency, although we observe challenges associated with circuit depth scaling. Our findings suggest that Hamiltonian Truncation offers a promising strategy for quantum simulations of quantum field theories, particularly as quantum hardware and algorithms continue to improve.</p>

            <p>Controlling the synchronization of photons from probabilistic quantum sources plays a pivotal role in advancing efficient quantum information processing. We report the realization of a probabilistic entangling gate operating on actively synchronized photon pairs, using a quantum memory based on warm atomic vapor.

The reduction in visibility of the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference introduced by the storage process is identified as a primary factor limiting the gate fidelity. We derive an exact quantitative relation between HOM visibility and gate fidelity for pure single photons, which applies to all photonic gates relying on interference, regardless of the physical platform.</p>

            <h2>Nanoscale Mirrorless Superradiant Lasing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anna Bychek, Raphael Holzinger, Helmut Ritsch</p>
            <p>We predict collective 'free-space' lasing in a dense nanoscopic emitter arrangement where dipole-dipole coupled atomic emitters synchronize their emission and exhibit lasing behavior without the need for an optical resonator.~At the example of a subwavelength-spaced linear emitter chain with varying fractions of pumped and unpumped emitters, we present a comprehensive study of this mirrorless lasing phenomenon. The total radiated power transitions from subradiant suppression under weak pumping to superradiant enhancement at stronger pumping, while exhibiting directional emission confined to a narrow spatial angle. At the same time multiple independent spectral emission lines below the lasing threshold merge towards a single narrow spectral line at high pump power. The most substantial enhancement and line narrowing occur when a fraction of unpumped atoms is present. We show that this leads to superradiant lasing near the bare atomic frequency, making the system a promising candidate for a minimalist active optical frequency reference.</p>

            <p>We use the spin-boson model to describe the dynamics of a two-level atom interacting with Fabry-Pérot cavity modes. We solve the Schrödinger equation for the system-bath model without the Born-Markov approximation to derive the non-Markovian reduced dynamics of the qubit. We further construct an exact Lindblad-type master equation for it. Similar to the quantum Otto cycle, we construct a non- Markovian quasi-cyclic process based on the atom-cavity interactions, which we call the quasi-Otto cycle. For judicious choices of input state and parameters, the quasi-cycle can be more efficient as a quantum engine than the Otto cycle. We also showed that if the quasi-cycle is repeated multiple times, the efficiency of the quasi-Otto engine asymptotically approaches that of the Otto engine.</p>

            <h2>Unconventional photon blockade in cavity QED with parametric amplification</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Madan Mohan Mahana, Sanket Das, Tarak Nath Dey</p>
            <p>We theoretically investigate the quantum-interference-induced photon blockade effect in a single two-level atom-cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) system with degenerate parametric am- plification. The analytical calculations reveal the optimal parametric gain and phase parameters for achieving optimum unconventional photon blockade conditions. Under the optimal parameter regime, the numerical results of the second-order correlation function demonstrate strong photon antibunching consistent with the analytical results. Furthermore, the numerical results corroborate that coherently driving the atom leads to a stronger photon blockade than a coherently driven cavity with the optimal parameters. We numerically demonstrate that the UPB effect is compromised by a non-zero cavity-atom coupling in the cavity-driven configuration. However, stronger photon an- tibunching can be attained with a non-zero cavity-atom coupling in the atom-driven configuration. This work may be suitable for experimentally realising a strongly antibunched single-photon source for applications in quantum technology.</p>

            <h2>Generic Two-Mode Gaussian States as Quantum Sensors</h2>

            <p>Gaussian quantum channels constitute a cornerstone of continuous-variable quantum information science, underpinning a wide array of protocols in quantum optics and quantum metrology. While the action of such channels on arbitrary states is well-characterized under full channel knowledge, we address the inverse problem, namely, the precise estimation of fundamental channel parameters, including the beam splitter transmissivity and the two-mode squeezing amplitude. Employing the quantum Fisher information (QFI) as a benchmark for metrological sensitivity, we demonstrate that the symmetry inherent in mode mixing critically governs the amplification of QFI, thereby enabling high-precision parameter estimation. In addition, we investigate quantum thermometry by estimating the average photon number of thermal states, revealing that the transmissivity parameter significantly modulates estimation precision. Our results underscore the metrological utility of two-mode Gaussian states and establish a robust framework for parameter inference in noisy and dynamically evolving quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>Quantum refrigerator embedded in spin-star environments: Scalings of temperature and refrigeration time</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sukrut Mondkar, Aparajita Bhattacharyya, Ujjwal Sen</p>
            <p>We examine a quantum absorption refrigerator that comprises three qubits, each of which is connected with a separate spin-star environment. The refrigerator exhibits the feature of transient cooling, i.e., lowering of the temperature of the first qubit in sufficiently small timescales. Since the spin-star environment is inherently non-Markovian in nature, steady-state cooling may or may not be achieved. A key advantage of our model is that the symmetries of the Hamiltonian enable a solution of the reduced density matrices of the refrigerator qubits, even in the presence of a large number (~50) of environmental spins. We derive the condition for autonomous refrigeration and analyze how the optimal cold qubit temperature scales with the number of bath qubits. We find a power law scaling towards a constant asymptotic value. We also find the scaling of the minimum time required for cooling as a function of the number of bath spins. Further, we scrutinize the heat currents associated with each of the three qubits.</p>

            <h2>Timescales, Squeezing and Heisenberg Scalings in Many-Body Continuous Sensing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gideon Lee, Ron Belyansky, Liang Jiang, Aashish A. Clerk</p>
            <p>The continuous monitoring of driven-dissipative systems offers new avenues for quantum advantage in metrology. This approach mixes temporal and spatial correlations in a manner distinct from traditional metrology, leading to ambiguities in how one identifies Heisenberg scalings (e.g.~standard asymptotic metrics like the sensitivity are not bounded by system size). Here, we propose a new metric for continuous sensing, the optimized finite-time environmental quantum Fisher information (QFI), that remedies the above issues by simultaneously treating time and system size as finite resources. In addition to having direct experimental relevance, this quantity is rigorously bounded by both system size and integration time, allowing for a precise formulation of Heisenberg scaling. We also introduce two many-body continuous sensors: the high-temperature superradiant sensor, and the dissipative spin squeezer. Both exhibit Heisenberg scaling of a collective magnetic field for multiple directions. The spin squeezed sensor has a striking advantage over previously studied many-body continuous sensors: the optimal measurement achieving the full QFI does not require the construction of a complex decoder system, but can be achieved using direct photodetection of the cavity output field.</p>

We use this mean-field many-body Ehrenfest approach to analyze how the phonon-induced dynamic disorder and the many-body interaction affect the incoherent and coherent dynamics of excitons and exciton-polaritons. We examine how the number of excitations and the strength of repulsive exciton-exciton interaction nonlinearly influence the transport, Fröhlich scattering and decoherence.</p>

            <p>An investigation into Schwinger pair production mechanisms is presented, demonstrating that vacuum tunneling processes can be effectively controlled through electromagnetic potential modulation while maintaining the strong ffelds in the interaction region. This challenges the conventional paradigm that attributes exclusive governance of Schwinger processes to localized ffeld intensities. Through comprehensive analysis of particle number, momentum spectra, and spatial distribution of created pairs, we establish that the observed modulation effects originate from electromagnetic potential - induced modiffcations to the quantum phase structure of virtual particles. This phenomenon reveals a profound connection between Schwinger tunneling dynamics and the geometric phase properties of the quantum vacuum state - a vacuum analogue to the Aharonov-Bohm effect in charged particle systems. This discovery not only advances our understanding of electromagnetic interactions in quantum vacuum but also opens up new experimental opportunities for realizing Schwinger tunneling processes with existing facilities.</p>

            <h2>Many-Body Quantum Optics in a Bose-Hubbard Waveguide</h2>

            <p>Waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED) studies the interaction between quantum emitters and guided photons in one-dimension. When the waveguide hosts interacting photons, it becomes a platform to explore many-body quantum optics. However, the influence of photonic correlations on emitter dynamics remains poorly understood. In this work, we study the collective decay and coherent interactions of quantum emitters coupled to a one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard waveguide, an array of coupled photonic modes with repulsive on-site interactions that supports superfluid and Mott insulating phases. We show that photon-photon interactions alone can trigger a superradiant burst, independent of emitter spacing and transition frequency. In the off-resonant regime, emitters exhibit two distinct types of mediated interactions: delocalized superfluid excitations yield distance-independent couplings, while Mott-insulator quasiparticles generate short-range interactions mediated by doublons and holons. Our work bridges many-body physics and waveguide QED, revealing how photonic many-body states shape emitter dynamics.</p>

            <p>Recent advances have defined nontrivial phases of matter in open quantum systems, such as many-body quantum states subject to environmental noise. In this work, we experimentally probe and characterize mixed-state phases on Quantinuum's H1 quantum computer using two measures: Renyi correlators and the coding performance of a quantum error-correcting code associated with the phase. As a concrete example, we probe the low-energy states of the critical transverse field Ising model under different dephasing noise channels. First, we employ shadow tomography to observe a newly proposed Renyi correlator in two distinct phases: one exhibiting power-law decay and the other long-ranged. Second, we investigate the decoding fidelity of the associated quantum error-correcting code using a variational quantum circuit, and we find that a shallow circuit is sufficient to distinguish the above-mentioned two mixed-state phases through the decoding performance quantified by entanglement fidelity. Our work is a proof of concept for the quantum simulation and characterization of mixed-state phases.</p>

            <p>We study a generic cavity QED setup under conditions where the coupling between the two-level systems and a single bosonic mode is significantly degraded by low-frequency noise. To overcome this problem, we identify pulsed dynamical decoupling strategies that suppress the effects of noise while still allowing for a coherent exchange of excitations between the individual subsystems. The corresponding pulse sequences can be further designed to realize either Jaynes-Cummings, anti-Jaynes-Cummings, or Rabi couplings, as well as different types of cavity-mediated interactions between the two-level systems. A detailed analysis of the residual imperfections demonstrates that this decoupling strategy can boost the effective cooperativity of the cavity QED system by several orders of magnitude and improve the fidelity of quantum-technologically relevant operations accordingly.</p>

            <p>Classical time-resolved optical spectroscopy experiments are performed using sequences of ultrashort light pulses, with photon fluxes incident on the sample which are many orders of magnitude higher than real-world conditions corresponding to sunlight illumination. Here we overcome this paradigm by exploiting quantum correlations to perform time-resolved spectroscopy with entangled photons. Starting from spontaneous parametric down-conversion driven by a continuous-wave laser, we exploit the temporal entanglement between randomly generated signal/idler pairs to obtain temporal resolution, and their spectral entanglement to select the excitation frequency. We also add spectral resolution in detection, using a Fourier transform approach which employs a common-path interferometer. We demonstrate the potential of our entangled-photon streak camera by resolving, at the single-photon level, excitation energy transfer cascades from LH2 to LH1 in the photosynthetic membrane and disentangling the lifetimes of two dyes in a mixture. We show that time-resolved spectroscopy with quantum light can be performed without compromising measurement time, recording a fluorescence time trace in less than a minute even for samples with low quantum yield, which can be reduced to sub-second times with acceptable signal-to-noise ratio. Our results provide a new approach to ultrafast optical spectroscopy, where experiments are performed under conditions comparable to real-world sunlight illumination.</p>

            <p>We study the evolution of quantum correlations in two-particle discrete-time non-unitary quantum walks on a line with gain and loss. The two particles are initially prepared in a maximally entangled state and evolve independently. Using numerically exact calculations of position probability densities, average interparticle distance, entanglement entropy, and concurrence, we examine how dissipation and particle-exchange symmetry of the state (symmetric or antisymmetric) influence the resulting correlations. Notably, we find that the entanglement entropy of the antisymmetric state decays slower than that of the symmetric state at the exceptional point of the model. We also show that, in the antisymmetric state, the concurrence measured on the one-particle reduced density operator is unaffected by dissipation. Furthermore, we discuss how these correlations indicate quantum-to-classical transitions through the appearance of Gaussian position probability densities, sub-linear growth of average interparticle distance after a few steps, and decay of the entanglement entropy. On the other hand, the robustness of the qubit entanglement entropy can differentiate the model's topological phases better than in the one-particle quantum walk scenario.</p>

            <p>Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has emerged as a significant material for quantum sensing, particularly due to its ability to host spin active defects, such as the negatively charged boron vacancy (V$_\mathrm{B}^-$ center). The optical addressability of the V$_\mathrm{B}^-$ center and hBN's 2D structure enable high spatial resolution and integration into various platforms. However, decoherence due to the strong magnetic noise in hBN imposes fundamental limitations on the sensitivity of V$_\mathrm{B}^-$ center-based applications. Understanding the phenomena behind decoherence and identifying parameter settings that provide the highest performance are essential for advancing V$_\mathrm{B}^-$ sensors. This study employs state-of-the-art computational methods to investigate the decoherence of the V$_\mathrm{B}^-$ center in hexagonal boron nitride across a wide range of magnetic field values from 0 T up to 3 T. The provided in-depth numerical and analytical analysis reveals an intricate interplay of various decoherence mechanisms. This study identifies five distinct magnetic field regions governed by different types of magnetic interactions with and within the abundant nuclear spin bath. In addition to magnetic field, the effects of zero-field splitting, nuclear polarization, and different hyperfine coupling terms are studied, representing an important step forward in utilizing V$_\mathrm{B}^-$ ensembles in sensing. In particular, this study proposes operation in the moderate $180-350$ mT magnetic field range in chemically pure h$^{11}$B$^{15}$N samples, where the coherence time can reach $1-20$ $\mu$s, significantly exceeding the $\mathcal{O}( 100~\text{ns})$ low-field $T_2$ values.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jaewook Lee, Hyunsu Kim, Huijin Park, Hosung Seo</p>
            <p>The negatively charged boron vacancy (VB-) in h-BN operates as an optically addressable spin qubit in two-dimensional materials. To further advance the spin into a versatile qubit platform, it is imperative to understand its spin decoherence precisely, which is currently one of the major limiting factors for the VB- spin. In this study, we employ a first-principles quantum many-body simulation to investigate the decoherence of the VB- spin in dense nuclear spin baths as a function of magnetic field from 100 G to 3 T, revealing several unique phenomena and their origin. We found that decoherence mechanism changes at a specific magnetic field, which we refer to as the transition boundary (TB). Below the TB, the decoherence occurs within submicrosecond and it is primarily governed by independent nuclear spin dynamics. Above the TB, pair-wise flip-flop transitions become the dominant decoherence source, leading to the decoherence time of tens of microseconds. Building upon this understanding, we developed a method to predict the TB depending on the isotopic composition of h-BN, leading to TBs at 5020 G for h-10B14N and 2050 G for h-11B14N, which is in excellent agreement with our numerical results. We show that the larger TB in h-10BN derives from the larger nuclear spin of 10B than that of 11B, giving rise to strong nuclear modulation effects over a wider range of magnetic field in 10BN than in 11BN. We also explain the microscopic origin of several unique features in the decoherence, such as magnetic-field insensitive fast modulation found below the TB. Our results provide essential insight on the role of the 100% dense nuclear spin environment with large nuclear spins in the VB- decoherence, opening a new avenue for advancing the spin qubit in h-BN as robust platform in quantum information science.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jia-Qi Li, Xin Wang</p>
            <p>Light-matter interactions are traditionally governed by two fundamental paradigms: spontaneous and stimulated radiation. However, in nonlinear multi-photon regimes, these classical mechanisms break down, revealing new possibilities for light emission. Here, we report the discovery of a novel mechanism, termed triggered emission, in which an emitter, largely detuned from single-photon states, is triggered by the quantum state of the environment to emit a highly correlated photon pair, doublon. By identifying two critical conditions, energy matching and wavefunction overlap, we demonstrate that the dynamics of the emitter are profoundly shaped by the environment's quantum state. Using this framework, we construct a novel superposition state comprising a localized single-photon state and a propagating, strongly correlated two-photon wavepacket. Furthermore, we realize the multi-photon unidirectional emission by modulating the emitter and the photon state. Our findings not only deepen the understanding of nonlinear emitter dynamics but also provide a versatile platform for quantum computing and quantum information processing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mikel Garcia-de-Andoin, Alatz Álvarez-Ahedo, Adrián Franco-Rubio, Mikel Sanz</p>
            <p>Digital-analog is a universal quantum computing paradigm which employs the natural entangling Hamiltonian of the system and single-qubit gates as resources. Here, we study the stability of these protocols against Hamiltonian characterization errors. For this, we bound the maximum separation between the target and the implemented Hamiltonians. Additionally, we obtain an upper bound for the deviation in the expected value of an observable. We further propose a protocol for mitigating calibration errors which resembles dynamical-decoupling techniques. These results open the possibility of scaling digital-analog to intermediate and large scale systems while having an estimation on the errors committed.</p>

            <h2>Observation of optical vortex generation via magnon-induced Brillouin light scattering</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryusuke Hisatomi, Alto Osada, Kotaro Taga, Haruka Komiyama, Takuya Takahashi, Shutaro Karube, Yoichi Shiota, Teruo Ono</p>
            <p>Exploration of physics involving orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light, first recognized in 1992, is essential for deepening our understanding of the interaction between light and matter and that opens up new applications. In systems with rotational symmetry, it is known that OAM can be exchanged between light and matter. One of the most common applications of such a phenomenon is manipulating the optical OAM through the exchange of OAM between light and a nematic liquid crystal-based spatial light modulator (SLM). It is already being used as a tool in many studies related to the optical OAM. However, the operation bandwidth is limited by the response speed 100 Hz of the liquid crystal, which hinders the applications of the optical OAM to spatial division multiplexing, quantum communication, and optical microscopy. The generation of optical vortex beams with the optical OAM in inelastic scattering by elementary excitations with gigahertz-order resonance may solve this problem, although it has not been studied so far. Here, we demonstrate the generation of the optical vortex beams using magnon-induced Brillouin light scattering. We observe scattering rules in the Brillouin light scattering which can be explained by conservation of total angular momentum including spins and orbits with photons and magnons. This work serves as a starting point for research into the interaction between optical vertices and magnons. It opens up devices with the novel mechanism of optical OAM generation together with high operation bandwidth.</p>

            <h2>Electrically Reconfigurable NbOCl$_2$ Metasurface for Quantum Technologies</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Omar A. M. Abdelraouf</p>
            <p>Entangled photon-pair sources are foundational to advancing quantum technologies, including secure communication, quantum sensing, and imaging. For deployment in space-constrained environments such as satellite-based quantum networks or portable devices, compact, reconfigurable, and efficient entanglement sources are essential. Here, we present an electrically tunable entangled photon-pair source utilizing a nanostructured NbOCl$_2$ crystal, engineered for operation in the telecommunication C-band. The inherent non-centrosymmetric lattice symmetry of NbOCl$_2$ enables direct generation of polarization-entangled Bell states without the need for post-selection, leveraging its exceptional second-order nonlinear susceptibility, which surpasses conventional nonlinear materials. By nanopatterning NbOCl$_2$ into a high-quality-factor metasurface, we achieve three orders of magnitude enhancement in photon-pair generation efficiency via resonant excitation of bound states in the continuum resonance, which intensify light-matter interactions. Furthermore, we demonstrate in situ electrical tunability of the photon-pair emission wavelength over a 250 nm range from 1450 nm to 1700 nm by dynamically modulating surrounding liquid crystal layer. Remarkably, the decoupling of photon-pair generation rate and spectral tunability ensures high brightness, above 10,000 coincidences, under active tuning. The air stability and mechanical robustness of NbOCl$_2$ further enhance its practicality for real-world deployment. This work establishes NbOCl$_2$ as a superior material for scalable, on-chip quantum light sources, paving the way for integrated quantum communication systems, adaptive sensors, and portable quantum devices.</p>

            <p>Creating highly spin-squeezed states for quantum metrology surpassing the standard quantum limit is a topic of great interest. Spin squeezing has been achieved by either entangling different atoms in an ensemble, or by controlling the multi-level internal spin state of an atom. Here, we experimentally demonstrate combined internal and collective spin squeezing in a hot atomic ensemble with $\sim 10^{11}$ rubidium atoms. By synergistically combining these two types of squeezing and carefully aligning their squeezing quadratures, we have achieved a metrologically relevant spin squeezing of $-6.21\pm0.84$ dB, significantly outperforming the results obtained by utilizing either type of squeezing alone. Our approach provides a new perspective on fully harnessing the degrees of freedom inherent in quantum states of an atomic ensemble.</p>

            <p>Quantum emitters driven by resonant two-photon excitation are a leading source for deterministically generated entangled photon pairs, essential for scalable photonic quantum technologies. However, conventional resonant schemes are highly sensitive to laser power fluctuations and pose additional experimental challenges for emitters with small biexciton binding energies. Here, we demonstrate how biexciton preparation schemes with significantly improved robustness and reduced laser filtering requirements can be identified using a novel design principle beyond resonant and adiabatic driving: ultrafast single-shot Floquet driving. This is achieved by employing two strongly and symmetrically detuned dichromatic pulses, whose superposition generates a stroboscopic Hamiltonian that enables direct coupling between ground and biexciton states. Moreover, a pulse delay serves as a tuning knob, introducing an effective magnetic field that concentrates the Bloch sphere trajectory at the biexciton state for a wide range of parameters, making biexciton preparation particularly robust. Experimentally, we achieve a biexciton occupation exceeding 96% and preserve photon-pair entanglement with a fidelity of 93.4%. Our scheme highlights the great impact of Floquet-engineered multicolour excitation protocols for on-demand quantum light sources.</p>

            <h2>Fidelity and efficiency analysis for heralded entanglement swapping in lossy channels: linear and nonlinear optical approaches</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kejie Fang, Elizabeth A. Goldschmidt</p>
            <p>Bell state measurements (BSMs) of photonic qubits are used for quantum networking protocols to herald the distribution and transfer of quantum information. However, standard BSMs based on linear optics (LO-BSMs) require identical photons and are susceptible to errors from multiphoton emissions, leading to reduced fidelity of protocols, particularly in the absence of postselection. To overcome these challenges, Bell state measurements based on nonlinear optics (NLO-BSMs) have been proposed and implemented, leveraging sum-frequency generation (SFG) to filter out multiphoton emissions and improve the fidelity without postselection. Here we analyze the fidelity of LO-BSM and NLO-BSM heralded entanglement swapping in lossy channels and compare their performance under realistic conditions. We also explore the impact of state-of-the-art nonlinear photonics platforms on SFG efficiency and highlight how advances in nanophotonics will enable practical, high-fidelity NLO-BSM-based quantum networking applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luca Lumia, Gianni Aupetit-Diallo, Jérôme Dubail, Mario Collura</p>
            <p>Unitary integrable models typically relax to a stationary Generalized Gibbs Ensemble (GGE), but in experimental realizations dissipation often breaks integrability. In this work, we use the recently introduced time-dependent GGE (t-GGE) approach to describe the open dynamics of a gas of bosons subject to atom losses and gains. We employ tensor network methods to provide numerical evidence of the exactness of the t-GGE in the limit of adiabatic dissipation, and of its accuracy in the regime of weak but finite dissipation. That accuracy is tested for two-point functions via the rapidity distribution, and for more complicated correlations through a non-Gaussianity measure. We combine this description with Generalized Hydrodynamics and we show that it correctly captures transport at the Euler scale. Our results demonstrate that the t-GGE approach is robust in both homogeneous and inhomogeneous settings.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Semra Gurtas Dogan, Kobra Hasanirokh, Omar Mustafa, Abdullah Guvendi</p>
            <p>This paper presents an analytical investigation into the dynamics of Weyl pairs within magnetized helicoidal graphene nanoribbons. By embedding a curved surface into flat Minkowski space-time, we derive a fully covariant two-body Dirac equation specific to this system. We begin by formulating a non-perturbative wave equation that governs the relative motion of the Weyl pairs and obtain exact solutions. Our results demonstrate the influence of the uniform magnetic field and the number of twists on the dynamics of Weyl pairs in graphene nanoribbons, providing precise energy values that lay a robust foundation for future research. Furthermore, we examine the material's response to perturbation fields by calculating the polarization function and investigating how twisting and magnetic fields affect this response. Our findings indicate that, in principle, the material's properties, which are crucial for practical applications, can be effectively controlled by precisely tuning the magnetic field and the number of twists in graphene nanoribbons.</p>

            <p>Quantum sensing and metrology present one of the most promising near-term applications in the field of quantum technologies, with quantum sensors enabling unprecedented precision in measurements of electric, magnetic or gravitational fields and displacements. Experimental loss at the detection stage remains one of the key obstacles to achieve a truly quantum advantage in many practical scenarios. Here we combine capabilities of Rydberg atoms to both sense external fields and to be used for quantum information processing to largely overcome the issue of detection losses. While using the large dipole moments of Rydberg atoms in an ensemble to achieve a $39\ \mathrm{nV}/\mathrm{cm}\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ sensitivity we employ the inter-atomic dipolar interactions to execute an error-correction protocol, that protects sensing information against conventional losses at the detection stage. Counterintuitively, the idea of the protocol is based on introduction of additional non-linear lossy quantum channel, which results in enhancement of Fisher information by a factor of 3.3. The presented results open up a path towards broader usage of quantum-information-inspired error correction in practical quantum metrology and communication, without the need for a general-purpose quantum computer.</p>

            <h2>Towards an experimental implementation of entanglement harvesting in superconducting circuits: effect of detector gap variation on entanglement harvesting</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adam Teixidó-Bonfill, Xi Dai, Adrian Lupascu, Eduardo Martín-Martínez</p>
            <p>Motivated by the prospect of experimental implementations of entanglement harvesting in superconducting circuits, we propose a model of variable-gap particle detector that aims to bridge some of the gaps between Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) models and realistic implementations. Using parameters tailored to potential experimental setups, we investigate entanglement harvesting in both spacelike-separated and causally connected scenarios. Our findings reveal that while variations in the energy gap reduce the ability to harvest entanglement for spacelike-separated detectors, detectors in causal contact can still become entangled through their interaction with the field. Notably, our analysis shows that (due to the derivative coupling nature of the model) even for causally connected detectors, the entanglement primarily originates from the field's correlations. This demonstrates the potential for genuine entanglement harvesting in the lab and opens the door to near-future entanglement harvesting experiments in superconducting circuits.</p>

Optimized for quantum dot emission at 925 nm, the device exhibits total insertion losses averaging only 4.35 dB, enabling its direct application in advanced multi-photon quantum experiments. Leveraging the versatility of FLW, we introduce suspended waveguides and precisely engineered 2D and 3D microstructures, significantly enhancing thermal isolation and minimizing power dissipation. As a result, our processor operates efficiently at less than 10 W, requiring only a simple thermo-electric cooler for stable thermal management. The device exhibits exceptional performance after calibration, implementing Haar-random unitary transformations with an amplitude fidelity of 99.5 %.

            <p>One of the promises of quantum computing is to simulate physical systems efficiently. However, the simulation of open quantum systems - where interactions with the environment play a crucial role - remains challenging for quantum computing, as it is impossible to implement deterministically non-unitary operators on a quantum computer without auxiliary qubits. The Stinespring dilation can simulate an open dynamic but requires a high circuit depth, which is impractical for NISQ devices. An alternative approach is parallel probabilistic block-encoding methods, such as the Sz.-Nagy and Singular Value Decomposition dilations. These methods result in shallower circuits but are hybrid methods, and we do not simulate the quantum dynamic on the quantum computer. In this work, we describe a divide-and-conquer strategy for preparing mixed states to combine the output of each Kraus operator dilation and obtain the complete dynamic on quantum hardware with a lower circuit depth. The work also introduces a balanced strategy that groups the original Kraus operators into an expanded operator, leading to a trade-off between circuit depth, CNOT count, and number of qubits. We perform a computational analysis to demonstrate the advantages of the new method and present a proof-of-concept simulation of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson dynamic on current quantum hardware.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiangwei Long, Jianxin Zhong, Lijun Meng</p>
            <p>We systematic study numerical method into constructing a universal quantum gate set for topological quantum computation using SU(2)k anyon models. The values of F-symbols and R-symbols were computed through the q-deformed representation theory of SU(2), enabling precise determination of elementary braiding matrices (EBMs) for SU(2)k anyon systems. Quantum gates were subsequently derived from these EBMs through systematic implementations. One-qubit gates were synthesized using a genetic algorithm-enhanced Solovay-Kitaev algorithm (GA-enhanced SKA), while two-qubit gates were constructed through brute-force search or GA optimization to approximate local equivalence classes of the CNOT gate. Implementing this framework for SU(2)5, SU(2)6, and SU(2)7 models successfully generated the canonical universal gate set {H-gate, T-gate, CNOT-gate}. Comparative benchmarking against the Fibonacci anyon model demonstrated that SU(2)5,6,7 implementations achieve comparable or superior fidelity in gate construction. These numerical results provide conclusive verification of the universal quantum computation capabilities inherent in SU(2)k anyon models. Furthermore, we get exact implementations of the local equivalence class [SWAP] using nine EBMs in each SU(2)5, SU(2)6, and SU(2)7 configuration.</p>

In every case a single sender injects an energy E0 that is then deterministically and decrementally harvested by several remote receivers, confirming that energy introduced at one node can be redistributed among many entangled subsystems at light-speed-limited classical latency.

            <p>This paper introduces the Quantum Molecular Autoencoder, a novel approach that integrates quantum computing with molecular representation learning. While conventional molecular representation methods face computational bottlenecks when processing high-dimensional data, quantum computing offers a promising alternative through its inherent parallelism and quantum superposition properties. We present a quantum circuit-based autoencoder architecture that maps SMILES molecular representations into quantum state space, employs parameterized quantum circuits for dimensional reduction, and utilizes SWAP tests to evaluate encoding quality. Theoretically, our approach preserves essential molecular features in exponentially smaller spaces while maintaining similarity relationships between molecules. Experimental results demonstrate that quantum autoencoders effectively capture molecular structures and chemical properties. The proposed framework not only establishes a quantum pathway for molecular representation learning but also opens new possibilities for applications in drug discovery and materials design. As the first investigation at the intersection of molecular representation learning and quantum computing, this research lays both theoretical and practical foundations for the advancement of cheminformatics.</p>

            <p>Non-Gaussian quantum states of mechanical motion exhibiting Wigner negativity offer promising capabilities for quantum technologies and tests of fundamental physics. Within the field of cavity quantum optomechanics, it is commonly held that deterministic preparation of mechanical Wigner negativity in the unresolved-sideband regime is not possible, as the intracavity interaction Hamiltonian is linear in mechanical position. Here, we show that, despite this, by accounting for the nonlinearity of the cavity response with mechanical position, mechanical Wigner negativity can be prepared deterministically in the unresolved-sideband regime, without additional nonlinearities, nonclassical drives, or conditional measurements. In particular, we find that Wigner negativity can be prepared with an optical pulse, even without single-photon strong coupling, and the negativity persists in the steady state of a continuously driven system. Our results deepen our understanding of cavity-enhanced radiation pressure and establish a pathway for deterministic preparation of nonclassical mechanical states in the unresolved sideband regime.</p>

            <p>The complementary features of different qubit platforms for computing and storage impose an intrinsic hardware heterogeneity in any quantum network, where nodes, while processing and storing quantum information, must also communicate through quantum links. Indeed, one of the most promising hardware platforms at quantum nodes for scalable and fast quantum computing is the superconducting technology, which operates at microwave frequencies. Whereas, for communicating at distances of practical interest beyond few meters, quantum links operate at optical frequencies. Therefore, to allow the interaction between superconducting and photonic technologies, a quantum interface, known as quantum transducer, able to convert one type of qubit to another is required. In this paper, we analyse the quantum transduction from a communication perspective, by shedding the light on its fundamental role within quantum network design and deployment. This analysis reveals that there exist different types of transduction, including the one allowing a transducer to act as entanglement source. From this standpoint, it is possible to conceive different source-destination link archetypes, where transduction plays a crucial role in the communication performances. The analysis also translates the quantum transduction process into a proper functional block within a new communication system model for a quantum network.</p>

Compared with the previous proposal, the whole process of our proposal are in tunable way and the universal holonomic quantum qubit gates can be made robust to systematic error and decay which pushes the gate fidelities in the presence of decoherence and systematic error to well high level.

            <p>The so-called state-carving protocol generates high-fidelity entangled states at an atom-cavity interface without requiring high cavity cooperativity. However, this protocol is limited to 50\% efficiency, which restricts its applicability. We propose a simple modification to the state-carving protocol to achieve efficient entanglement generation, with unit probability in principle. Unlike previous two-photon schemes, ours employs only one photon which interacts with the atoms twice - avoiding separate photon detections which causes irrecoverable probability loss. We present a detailed description and performance evaluation of our protocol under non-ideal conditions. High fidelity of 0.999 can be achieved with cavity cooperativity of only 34. Efficient state-carving paves the way for large-scale entanglement generation at cavity-interfaces for modular quantum computing, quantum repeaters and creating arbitrary shaped atomic graph states, essential for one-way quantum computing.</p>

            <h2>Chiral Gain-Induced Time-Reversal Symmetry Breaking in Quantum Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mário G. Silveirinha, Daigo Oue</p>
            <p>Structured light offers a powerful approach to tailor light-matter interactions in quantum systems with chiral properties. While chirality has been extensively studied in passive platforms, the role of optical gain in controlling chiral quantum dynamics remains largely unexplored. In this work, we develop a general theoretical framework to describe the dynamics of qubits interacting with structured gain environments, where amplification depends on the light's polarization or momentum. By quantizing the electromagnetic field in linear bianisotropic media with gain and extending the Lindblad formalism to these settings, we derive a master equation governing the qubit's irreversible evolution. We show that chiral gain can break time-reversal symmetry and drive the system toward a symmetry-broken steady state with nonreciprocal properties. This effect is illustrated in detail for moving plasmonic substrates, which exhibit inherently chiral gain that selectively amplifies transitions of a given handedness. Our results establish chiral gain as a novel mechanism for engineering nonreciprocal quantum steady states.</p>

            <h2>Angular Momentum-Dependent Spectral Shift in Chiral Vacuum Cavities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qing-Dong Jiang</p>
            <p>Based on a hybrid light-matter unitary transformation for cavity quantum electrodynamics, we investigate the spectral shift of an atom induced by quantum fluctuations in a chiral vacuum cavity. Remarkably, we find an intriguing angular momentum-dependent shift in the spectra of bound states. Our approach shows promise in going beyond traditional perturbative methods and demonstrates effectiveness even in the strong-coupling limit, as evidenced by our numerical benchmarks in the case of a two-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator. In addition, we establish a cavity-interaction picture for calculating the chiral vacuum Rabi oscillation in the strong-coupling limit for a generic central potential. The anomalous spectral shift revealed in this study possesses both fundamental and practical significance and could be readily observed in experiments.</p>

            <h2>Quantum network-entanglement measures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhen-Peng Xu, Julio I. de Vicente, Liang-Liang Sun, Sixia Yu</p>
            <p>Quantum networks are of high interest nowadays and a quantum internet has been long envisioned. Network-entanglement adapts the notion of entanglement to the network scenario and network-entangled states are considered to be a resource to overcome the limitations of a given network structure. In this work, we introduce measures of quantum network-entanglement that are well-defined within the general framework of quantum resource theories, which at the same time have a clear operational interpretation characterizing the extra resources necessary to prepare a targeted quantum state within a given network. In particular, we define the network communication cost and the network round complexity, which turn out to be intimately related to graph-theoretic parameters. We also provide methods to estimate these measures by introducing novel witnesses of network-entanglement.</p>

            <h2>Coherent State Assisted Entanglement Generation Between Quantum Memories</h2>

            <p>Generating entanglement deterministically at a capacity-approaching rate is critical for next-generation quantum networks. We propose weak-coherent-state-assisted protocols that can generate entanglement near-deterministically between reflective-cavity-based quantum memories at a success rate that exceeds the 50\% limit associated with single-photon-mediated schemes. The most pronounced benefit is shown in the low-channel-loss regime and persists even with moderate noise. We extend our protocols to entangle an array of memories in a GHZ state, and infer that it yields an exponential speed-up compared to previous single-photon-based protocols.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Owen Ekblad</p>
            <p>In this note, we prove that the index of primitivity of any primitive unital Schwarz map is at most $2(D-1)^2$, where $D$ is the dimension of the underlying matrix algebra. This inequality was first proved by Rahaman for Schwarz maps which were both unital and trace preserving. As we show, the assumption of unitality is basically innocuous, but in general not all primitive unital Schwarz maps are trace preserving. Therefore, the precise purpose of this note is to showcase how to apply the method of Rahaman to unital primitive Schwarz maps that don't preserve trace. As a corollary of this theorem, we show that the index of primitivity of any primitive 2-positive map is at most $2(D-1)^2$, so in particular this bound holds for arbitrary primitive completely positive maps. We briefly discuss of how this relates to a conjecture of Perez-Garcia, Verstraete, Wolf and Cirac.</p>

            <p>In this paper, the ladder operators and a quantum-like approach are used to construct an operatorial version of a model dubbed crimo-taxis. In a classical framework, the crimo-taxis model is represented by reaction-diffusion partial differential equations describing a population divided into three interacting subgroups (ordinary citizens, drug users/dealers, and law enforcement personnel). In this new framework, the agents of the subgroups are modeled using annihilation, creation, and number fermionic operators, and their time evolution is assumed to be ruled by a Hermitian time-independent Hamiltonian operator suitable to capture the interactions among the subgroups. Furthermore, a recent extension of the standard Heisenberg view, namely $(\mathcal{H},\rho)$--induced dynamics, is also taken into account. Two scenarios, characterized by different initial spatial distributions of the subgroups, are considered. The results of some numerical simulations in a one--dimensional setting are presented and discussed.</p>

            <p>Most quantum computers today are constrained by hardware limitations, particularly the number of available qubits, causing significant challenges for executing large-scale quantum algorithms. Circuit cutting has emerged as a key technique to overcome these limitations by decomposing large quantum circuits into smaller subcircuits that can be executed independently and later reconstructed. In this work, we introduce Qdislib, a distributed and flexible library for quantum circuit cutting, designed to seamlessly integrate with hybrid quantum-classical high-performance computing (HPC) systems. Qdislib employs a graph-based representation of quantum circuits to enable efficient partitioning, manipulation and execution, supporting both wire cutting and gate cutting techniques. The library is compatible with multiple quantum computing libraries, including Qiskit and Qibo, and leverages distributed computing frameworks to execute subcircuits across CPUs, GPUs, and quantum processing units (QPUs) in a fully parallelized manner. We present a proof of concept demonstrating how Qdislib enables the distributed execution of quantum circuits across heterogeneous computing resources, showcasing its potential for scalable quantum-classical workflows.</p>

            <p>Quantum games have attracted much attention in recent years due to their ability to solve decision-making dilemmas. The aim of this study is to extend previous work on quantum games by introducing a Mathematica package QEGS (Quantum Extension Game Solver) dedicated to the study of quantum extensions of classical $2\times2$ games based on the EWL scheme. The package generates all possible game extensions with one or two unitary strategies, which are invariant with respect to isomorphic transformations of the initial games. The package includes a number of functions to study these extensions, such as determining their Nash equilibria in pure strategies, eliminating dominated strategies, or computing maximin strategies. Independently of quantum extensions, these functions can also be used to analyze classical games. Reporting to a pdf is available. The discussion includes an outline of future research directions, such as the exploration of mixed-strategy Nash equilibria and potential real-world applications in fields like quantum computing and secure communications.</p>

            <h2>Optomechanical resource for fault-tolerant quantum computing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Margaret Pavlovich, Peter Rakich, Shruti Puri</p>
            <p>Fusion-based quantum computing with dual-rail qubits is a leading candidate for scalable quantum computing using linear optics. This paradigm requires single photons which are entangled into small resource states before being fed into a fusion network. The most common sources for single optical photons and for small entangled states are probabilistic and heralded. The realization of a single reliable deterministic source requires many redundant probabilistic sources and a complex optical network for rerouting and retiming probabilistic outputs. In this work, we show how optomechanics enables reliable production of resources for photonic quantum computing without the redundancy of the all-optical approach. This is achieved by using acoustic modes as caches of quantum resources, ranging from single-particle states to small entangled states, with on-demand read-out. The advantages of acoustic modes as optical quantum memories, compared to other technologies, include their intrinsically long lifetimes and that they are solid state, highly tailorable, and insensitive to electromagnetic noise. We show how the resource states can be prepared directly in the acoustic modes using optical controls. This is still probabilistic and heralded, as in the all-optical approach, but the acoustic modes act as a quantum memory which is integrated into the production of the states. The quantum states may be deterministically transferred from acoustic modes to optical modes, on demand, with another optical drive.</p>

            <p>We develop a theory for two quasiparticle-induced decoherence mechanisms of a driven superconducting qubit. In the first mechanism, an existing quasiparticle (QP) tunnels across the qubit's Josephson junction while simultaneously absorbing a qubit excitation and one (or several) photons from the drive. In the second mechanism, a qubit transition occurs during the non-linear absorption process converting multiple drive quanta into a pair of new QPs. Both mechanisms can remain significant in gap engineered qubits whose coherence is insensitive to QPs without the drive. Our theory establishes a fundamental limitation on fidelity of the microwave qubit operations, such as readout and gates, stemming from QPs.</p>

            <p>Microwave drives are commonly employed to control superconducting quantum circuits, enabling qubit gates, readout, and parametric interactions. As the drive frequencies are typically an order of magnitude smaller than (twice) the superconducting gap, it is generally assumed that such drives do not disturb the BCS ground state. However, sufficiently strong drives can activate multi-photon pair-breaking processes that generate quasiparticles and result in qubit errors. In this work, we present a theoretical framework for calculating the rates of multi-photon-assisted pair-breaking transitions induced by both charge- and flux-coupled microwave drives. Through illustrative examples, we show that drive-induced QP generation may impact novel high-frequency dispersive readout architectures, as well as Floquet-engineered superconducting circuits operating under strong driving conditions.</p>

            <h2>Enhancing Microwave-Optical Bell Pairs Generation for Quantum Transduction Using Kerr Nonlinearity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fangxin Li, Ming Yuan, Zhaoyou Wang, Changchun Zhong, Liang Jiang</p>
            <p>Microwave-optical quantum transduction can be achieved via quantum teleportation using microwave-optical photon Bell pairs. The standard spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) has to trade off between generation fidelity and probability due to unwanted higher-excitation pairs in the output. In this work, we propose a pulsed SPDC scheme that employs strong Kerr nonlinearity in the microwave mode. This nonlinearity causes significant detuning of higher excitations due to the anharmonicity of energy levels, and the system can be pulse-driven to produce single-photon pairs in the output. Our pulsed nonlinear approach can generate high-fidelity Bell pairs with high probability, alleviating the trade-off between fidelity and probability inherent in traditional SPDC schemes. We optimize both the pulse width and driving strength, demonstrating that our protocol outperforms the SPDC scheme in a realistic setting of finite nonlinearity and intrinsic photon loss.</p>

            <p>In contrast to the general argument that the spontaneous decay is intrinsically incoherent in nature and detrimental to quantum entanglement, here, we show that nearly perfect entanglement between two bright pump fields can be realized via spontaneous decay-induced destructive quantum interference in a closed double Lambda-type four-level atomic system with the energy separation of the excited doublet comparable to their decay rates. The high degree of bipartite entanglement results from the cancellation of spontaneous emission and subsequent elimination of the associated noise due to the destructive quantum interference between the two spontaneous emission pathways from the upper doublet to each of the two lower levels when the two strong pump fields are tuned to the particular frequencies where quantum interference takes place. This scheme is particularly suitable for the generation of entanglement between two bright light fields, and may find potential applications in realistic quantum information processing.</p>

By manipulating the dynamics of a superconducting qubit, we observe the full hierarchy of temporal quantum correlations. Moreover, we show that the rich dynamics of the temporal quantum correlations, such as sudden death or revival of temporal steering, provides a useful and unique measure for benchmarking qubits on a realistic circuit. Our work finds applications in identifying the casual structure in a quantum network, the non-Markovianity of open quantum systems, and the security bounds of quantum key distribution. As an example, we demonstrate the non-Markovianity of a single superconducting qubit on the quantum circuit.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander Ulanowski, Olivier Kuijpers, Benjamin Merkel, Adrian Holzäpfel, Andreas Reiserer</p>
            <p>Echo-based spectroscopy of the superhyperfine interaction of an electronic spin with nuclear spins in its surroundings enables detailed insights into the microscopic magnetic environment of spins in solids. Still, it is an outstanding challenge to resolve individual nuclear spins in a dense bath, in which many of them exhibit a comparable coupling strength. This simultaneously requires a high spectral resolution and a large signal-to-noise ratio. However, when probing spin ensembles, dipolar interactions between the dopants can lead to a concentration-dependent trade-off between resolution and signal. Here, we fully eliminate this limitation of previous optical-echo-envelope-modulation spectroscopy experiments by integrating the emitters into a high-finesse resonator, which allows for strong optical echoes even at very low concentrations. To demonstrate its potential, the technique is applied to erbium dopants in yttrium-orthosilicate (Er:YSO). Achieving an unprecedented spectral resolution enables precise measurements of the superhyperfine interaction with four of the Y nuclear spins densely surrounding each emitter. The achieved boost of the signal, enabled by the resonator, allows for extending the approach to the lowest concentration possible -- to the level of single dopants, thereby providing a tool for detecting and studying individual nuclear spins. Thus, our technique paves the way for an improved understanding of dense nuclear spin baths in solids.</p>

            <p>Pairs of entangled photons are crucial for photonic quantum technologies. The demand for integrability and multi-functionality suggests 'flat' platforms - ultrathin layers and metasurfaces - as sources of photon pairs. Despite the success in the demonstration of spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) from such sources, there are almost no works on spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) - an alternative process to generate photon pairs. Meanwhile, SFWM can be implemented in any nanostructures, including ones made of isotropic materials, which are easier to fabricate than crystalline SPDC sources. Here, we investigate photon pair generation through SFWM in subwavelength films of amorphous silicon nitride (SiN) with varying nitrogen content. For all samples, we demonstrate two-photon quantum correlations, indicated by the normalized second-order correlation function g(2)(0): it exceeds 2 and decays as the pump power increases. By observing two-photon interference between SFWM from the SiN films and the fused silica substrate, we find the third-order susceptibilities of films with different nitrogen content.</p>

In this work, we show that a variational wavefunction composed of a few hundred optimized non-orthogonal determinants can achieve energy accuracies comparable to the state of the art. This is obtained by introducing an optimization method that leverages the quadratic dependence of the variational energy on the orbitals of each determinant, enabling an exact iterative optimization, and uses an efficient tensor-contraction algorithm to evaluate the effective Hamiltonian with a computational cost that scales as the fourth power of the number of basis functions. We benchmark the accuracy of the proposed method with exact full-configuration interaction results where available, and we achieve lower variational energies than coupled cluster (CCSD(T)) for several molecules in the double-zeta basis.</p>

In this study, we evaluated the applicability of the Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) algorithm for biomarker-based classification of COVID-19.

The top- and bottom-ranked biomarker sets were then used to train and evaluate both classical SVM (CSVM) and QSVM models, serving as predictive and negative control inputs, respectively. The QSVM was implemented with multiple quantum kernels, including amplitude encoding, angle encoding, the ZZ feature map, and the projected quantum kernel. Across various experimental settings, QSVM consistently achieved classification performance that was comparable to or exceeded that of CSVM, while reflecting the importance rankings by ridge regression. Although the experiments were conducted in numerical simulation, our findings highlight the potential of QSVM as a promising approach for multi-omics data analysis in biomedical research.</p>

            <p>Dual-rail erasure qubits can substantially improve the efficiency of quantum error correction, allowing lower error rates to be achieved with fewer qubits, but each erasure qubit requires $3\times$ more transmons to implement compared to standard qubits. In this work, we introduce a hybrid-erasure architecture for surface code error correction where a carefully chosen subset of qubits is designated as erasure qubits while the rest remain standard. Through code-capacity analysis and circuit-level simulations, we show that a hybrid-erasure architecture can boost the performance of the surface code -- much like how a game of Minesweeper becomes easier once a few squares are revealed -- while using fewer resources than a full-erasure architecture. We study strategies for the allocation and placement of erasure qubits through analysis and simulations. We then use the hybrid-erasure architecture to explore the trade-offs between per-qubit cost and key logical performance metrics such as threshold and effective distance in surface code error correction. Our results show that the strategic introduction of dual-rail erasure qubits in a transmon architecture can enhance the logical performance of surface codes for a fixed transmon budget, particularly for near-term-relevant transmon counts and logical error rates.</p>

            <p>We study how probes of quantum scrambling dynamics respond to two kinds of imperfections -- unequal forward and backward evolutions and decoherence -- in a solvable Brownian circuit model. We calculate a ``renormalized'' out-of-time-order correlator (ROTOC) in the model with $N$ qubits, and we show that the circuit-averaged ROTOC is controlled by an effective probability distribution in operator weight space which obeys a system of $N$ non-linear equations of motion. These equations can be easily solved numerically for large system sizes which are beyond the reach of exact methods. Moreover, for an operator initially concentrated on weight one $w_0=1$, we provide an exact solution to the equations in the thermodynamic limit of many qubits that is valid for all times, all non-vanishing perturbation strengths $p\gtrsim 1/\sqrt{N}$, and all decoherence strengths. We also show that a generic initial condition $w_0 >1$ leads to a metastable state that eventually collapses to the $w_0=1$ case after a lifetime $\sim \log(N/w_0)$. Our results highlight situations where it is still possible to extract the unperturbed chaos exponent even in the presence of imperfections, and we comment on the applications of our results to existing experiments with nuclear spins and to future scrambling experiments.</p>

            <p>Matrix product states are useful representations for a large variety of naturally occurring quantum states. Studying their typical properties is important for understanding universal behavior, including quantum chaos and thermalization, as well as the limits of classical simulations of quantum devices. We show that the usual ensemble of sequentially generated random matrix product states (RMPS) using local Haar random unitaries is not uniform when viewed as a restriction of the full Hilbert space. As a result, the entanglement across the chain exhibits an anomalous asymmetry under spatial inversion. We show how to construct an unbiased measure starting from the left-canonical form and design a Metropolis algorithm for sampling random states. Some properties of this new ensemble are investigated both analytically and numerically, such as the resulting resolution of identity over matrix product states and the typical entanglement spectrum, which is found to differ from the sequentially generated case.</p>

            <h2>Efficient Learning Implies Quantum Glassiness</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eric R. Anschuetz</p>
            <p>We show a surprising relation between quantum learning theory and algorithmic hardness. We demonstrate that finding near-ground states of certain sparse disordered quantum systems is average-case hard for "Lipschitz" quantum algorithms if there exists an efficient, local learning algorithm -- such as the classical shadows algorithm -- for estimating the energy of a state of the system. A corollary of our result is that many standard quantum algorithms fail to find near-ground states of these systems, including short-time Lindbladian dynamics, short-time quantum annealing, phase estimation, and shallow-depth variational quantum algorithms. To achieve this, we introduce a topological property of quantum systems that we call the quantum overlap gap property (QOGP). This property is only satisfied by systems with an efficient local learning algorithm for the energy. We prove that systems which exhibit this topological property in their low-energy space are intractable for quantum algorithms whose outputs are stable under perturbations to their inputs. We then prove that the QOGP is satisfied for a sparsified variant of the quantum $p$-spin model, giving the first known algorithmic hardness-of-approximation result for quantum algorithms in finding the ground state of a non-stoquastic, noncommuting quantum system. Our resulting lower bound for quantum algorithms optimizing this model using Lindbladian evolution matches the best-known time lower bound for classical Langevin dynamics optimizing classical $p$-spin models. For this reason we suspect that finding ground states of typical quantum $p$-spin models using quantum algorithms is, in practice, as intractable as the classical $p$-spin model is for classical algorithms. Inversely, we show that the Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model does not exhibit the QOGP, consistent with previous evidence that the model is rapidly mixing at low temperatures.</p>

            <h2>Coherently mitigating boson samplers with stochastic errors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Deepesh Singh, Ryan J. Marshman, Nathan Walk, Jens Eisert, Timothy C. Ralph, Austin P. Lund</p>
            <p>Sampling experiments provide a viable route to show quantum advantages of quantum devices over classical computers in well-defined computational tasks. However, quantum devices such as boson samplers are susceptible to various errors, including stochastic errors due to fabrication imperfections. These cause the implemented unitary operations to deviate randomly from their intended targets, following distributions with finite variance. Whilst full-scale quantum error correction remains challenging in the near term, quantum error mitigation schemes have been devised to estimate expectation values, but it is unclear how these schemes would work for sampling experiments. In this work, we demonstrate that, given access to multiple stochastic unitaries, it is possible to mitigate the effect of these errors in sampling experiments. We adopt the unitary averaging protocol which employs multiple stochastic boson samplers to generate a distribution that approximates the ideal boson sampler distribution as the number of samplers increases. We derive a rigorous upper bound on the trace distance between the output probability distributions induced by invertible vacuum-heralded networks based on the Schur-Weyl duality. This result can be seen concretely as an error mitigation scheme in sampling experiments against stochastic errors. On a broader level, it suggests a path towards understanding error mitigation for sampling experiments and developing analysis tools for photonic circuits incorporating measurements and feed-forward. We further provide other applications of unitary averaging, including its use in implementing the linear combination of unitaries and benchmarking fabrication repeatability in linear optics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinxian Chen, Ignacio Franco</p>
            <p>We introduce an efficient method TTN-HEOM for exactly calculating the open quantum dynamics for driven quantum systems interacting with highly structured bosonic baths by combining the tree tensor network (TTN) decomposition scheme to the bexcitonic generalization of the numerically-exact hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM). The method yields a series of quantum master equations for all core tensors in the TTN that efficiently and accurately capture the open quantum dynamics for non-Markovian environments to all orders in the system-bath interaction. These master equations are constructed based on the time-dependent Dirac-Frenkel variational principle which isolates the optimal dynamics for the core tensors given the TTN ansatz. The dynamics converges to the HEOM when increasing the rank of the core tensors, a limit in which the TTN ansatz becomes exact. We introduce TENSO, Tensor Equations for Non-Markovian Structured Open systems, as a general-purpose Python code to propagate the TTN-HEOM dynamics. We implement three general propagators for the coupled master equations: Two fixed-rank methods that require a constant memory footprint during the dynamics, and one adaptive-rank method with variable memory footprint controlled by the target level of computational error. We exemplify the utility of these methods by simulating a two-level system coupled to a structured bath containing one Drude-Lorentzian component and eight Brownian oscillators, which is beyond what can presently be computed using the standard HEOM. Our results show that the TTN-HEOM is capable to simulate both dephasing and relaxation dynamics of driven quantum system interacting with structured baths, even those of chemical complexity, with affordable computational cost.</p>

            <h2>Toward Practical Quantum Machine Learning: A Novel Hybrid Quantum LSTM for Fraud Detection</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rushikesh Ubale, Sujan K.K., Sangram Deshpande, Gregory T. Byrd</p>
            <p>We present a novel hybrid quantum-classical neural network architecture for fraud detection that integrates a classical Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network with a variational quantum circuit. By leveraging quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement, our model enhances the feature representation of sequential transaction data, capturing complex non-linear patterns that are challenging for purely classical models. A comprehensive data preprocessing pipeline is employed to clean, encode, balance, and normalize a credit card fraud dataset, ensuring a fair comparison with baseline models. Notably, our hybrid approach achieves per-epoch training times in the range of 45-65 seconds, which is significantly faster than similar architectures reported in the literature, where training typically requires several minutes per epoch. Both classical and quantum gradients are jointly optimized via a unified backpropagation procedure employing the parameter-shift rule for the quantum parameters. Experimental evaluations demonstrate competitive improvements in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score relative to a conventional LSTM baseline. These results underscore the promise of hybrid quantum-classical techniques in advancing the efficiency and performance of fraud detection systems.

            <h2>A New Hybrid Quantum-Classical Algorithm for Solving the Unit Commitment Problem</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Willie Aboumrad, Phani R V Marthi, Suman Debnath, Martin Roetteler, Evgeny Epifanovsky</p>
            <p>Solving problems related to planning and operations of large-scale power systems is challenging on classical computers due to their inherent nature as mixed-integer and nonlinear problems. Quantum computing provides new avenues to approach these problems. We develop a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for the Unit Commitment (UC) problem in power systems which aims at minimizing the total cost while optimally allocating generating units to meet the hourly demand of the power loads. The hybrid algorithm combines a variational quantum algorithm (VQA) with a classical Bender's type heuristic. The resulting algorithm computes approximate solutions to UC in three stages: i) a collection of UC vectors capable meeting the power demand with lowest possible operating costs is generated based on VQA; ii) a classical sequential least squares programming (SLSQP) routine is leveraged to find the optimal power level corresponding to a predetermined number of candidate vectors; iii) in the last stage, the approximate solution of UC along with generating units power level combination is given. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented method, three different systems with 3 generating units, 10 generating units, and 26 generating units were tested for different time periods. In addition, convergence of the hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for select time periods is proven out on IonQ's Forte system.</p>

However, existing numerical models require solving a large set of coupled differential equations that is computationally intensive and lengthy to solve. We present an analytic approach that can be used to derive an impulse response function that allows up to two orders-of-magnitude reduction in computation time compared to the full time-dependent integration of the equations of motion. This approach can be used to enable rapid assessments of the Rydberg sensor's response to various waveforms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xue-Feng Pan, Peng-Bo Li</p>
            <p>Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond and superconducting qubits are two promising solid-state quantum systems for quantum science and technology, but the realization of controlled interfaces between individual solid-state spins and superconducting qubits remains fundamentally challenging. Here, we propose and analyze a hybrid quantum system consisting of a magnetic skyrmion, an NV center, and a superconducting qubit, where the solid-state qubits are both positioned in proximity to the skyrmion structure in a thin magnetic disk. We show that it is experimentally feasible to achieve strong magnetic (coherent or dissipative) coupling between the NV center and the superconducting qubit by using the \textit{quantized gyration mode of the skyrmion} as an intermediary. This allows coherent information transfer and nonreciprocal responses between the NV center and the superconducting qubit at the single quantum level with high controllability. The proposed platform provides a scalable pathway for implementing quantum protocols that synergistically exploit the complementary advantages of spin-based quantum memories, microwave-frequency superconducting circuits, and topologically protected magnetic excitations.</p>

            <p>With the rapid scaling of superconducting quantum processors, electronic control systems relying on commercial off-the-shelf instruments face critical bottlenecks in signal density, power consumption, and crosstalk mitigation. Here we present a custom dual-channel direct current (DC) source module (QPower) dedicated for large-scale superconducting quantum processors. The module delivers a voltage range of $\pm$7 V with 200 mA maximum current per channel, while achieving the following key performance benchmarks: noise spectral density of 20 nV/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ at 10 kHz, output ripple $<$500 $\mu$V$_{\mathrm{pp}}$ within 20 MHz bandwidth, and long-term voltage drift $<$5 $\mu$V$_{\mathrm{pp}}$ over 12 hours. Integrated into the control electronics of a 66-qubit quantum processor, QPower enables qubit coherence times of $T_1 = 87.6~\mu\mathrm{s}$ and Ramsey $T_2 = 5.1~\mu\mathrm{s}$, with qubit resonance frequency drift constrained to $\pm$40 kHz during 12-hour operation. This modular design is compact in size and efficient in energy consumption, providing a scalable DC source solution for intermediate-scale quantum processors with stringent noise and stability requirements, with potential extensions to other quantum hardware platforms and precision measurement.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryuya Fukuda, Masataka Iinuma, Yuto Matsumoto, Holger F. Hofmann</p>
            <p>It is generally assumed that the detection of a single photon as part of an interference pattern erases all possible which-path information. However, recent insights suggest that weak interactions can provide non-trivial experimental evidence for the physical delocalization of a single particle passing through an interferometer. Here, we present an experimental setup that can quantify the delocalization of individual photons using the rate of polarization flips induced by small rotations of polarization. The results show that photons detected in equal superpositions of the two paths are delocalized when detected in a high probability output port, and "super-localized" when detected in a low probability output port. We can thus confirm that delocalization depends on the detection of photons in the output of the interferometer, providing direct experimental evidence for the dependence of physical reality on the context established by a future measurement.</p>

            <p>Optically active quantum defects in solids, such as the nitrogen vacancy (NV) center in diamond, are a leading modality for micron-scale and nanoscale (ultralow-mass) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and imaging under ambient conditions. However, the spin and optical properties of NV centers degrade when closer than about 10 nm from the diamond surface, limiting NMR sensitivity as well as spectral and spatial resolution. Here we outline efforts to develop an alternative nanoscale NMR sensor using the negatively charged boron vacancy ($V_B^-$) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). As a van der Waals material, hBN's surface is free from dangling bonds and other sources of paramagnetic noise that degrade the performance of near surface NVs, allowing stable $V_B^-$ defects to exist $\sim1\,$nm from the material surface. We discuss the properties of boron vacancies as they apply to narrowband (AC) magnetic field sensing and outline experimental designs optimized for this system. We propose measurement protocols for $V_B^-$ NMR for both statistically and uniformly polarized samples at the nano- and micron-scales, including relevant pulse sequences, sensitivity calculations, and sample confinement strategies; and compare the expected performance to NV-NMR. We estimate back-action effects between the $V_B^-$ electronic spins and the sample nuclear spins at the nanoscale; and account for unconventional diffusion dynamics in the flow-restricted nanoscale regime, calculating its effects on the expected $V_B^-$ NMR signal. Lastly, we identify potential sample targets and operational regimes best suited for both nanoscale and micron-scale $V_B^-$ NMR.</p>

            <h2>A new approximate Eastin-Knill theorem</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rhea Alexander</p>
            <p>Transversal encoded gatesets are highly desirable for fault tolerant quantum computing. However, a quantum error correcting code which exactly corrects for local erasure noise and supports a universal set of transversal gates is ruled out by the Eastin-Knill theorem. Here we provide a new approximate Eastin-Knill theorem for the single-shot regime when we allow for some probability of error in the decoding. In particular, we show that a quantum error correcting code can support a universal set of transversal gates and approximately correct for local erasure if and only if the conditional min-entropy of the Choi state of the encoding and noise channel is upper bounded by a simple function of the worst-case error probability. Our no-go theorem can be computed by solving a semidefinite program, and, in the spirit of the original Eastin-Knill theorem, is formulated in terms of a condition that is both necessary and sufficient, ensuring achievability whenever it is passed. As an example, we find that with $n=100$ physical qutrits we can encode $k=1$ logical qubit in the $W$-state code, which admits a universal transversal set of gates and corrects for single subsystem erasure with error probability of $\varepsilon = 0.005$. To establish our no-go result, we leverage tools from the resource theory of asymmetry, where, in the single-shot regime, a single (output state-dependent) resource monotone governs all state purifications.</p>

We provide an analytical explanation for this singular behavior and establish a connection to the concept of ground state factorization observed in spin chains. Moreover, we analyze the open chain scenario and observe characteristic symmetry changes in the ground state corresponding to Majorana zero modes. These results demonstrate the power of complex network analysis in revealing hidden features in such systems.</p>

To minimize vibration noise from velocity-modulated sources, we implement a multistage vibration isolation system, achieving a vibration noise reduction exceeding 700-fold. We establish new constraints on vector-boson-mediated parity-violating interactions, improving experimental sensitivity by three orders of magnitude compared to previous limits.

Pairing our second-order adjoint method with a trust region optimizer (a type of Newton method), we show that it outperforms a first-order method, requiring significantly fewer iterations and wall time to find optimal controls for four molecular systems. Our derivation of the second-order adjoint method allows for arbitrary parameterizations of the controls.</p>

            <p>We investigate the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of quantum information in one-dimensional systems undergoing a quantum quench using a local perspective based on the information lattice. This framework provides a scale- and space-resolved decomposition of quantum correlations, enabling a hydrodynamic description of the information flow through well-defined local densities -- termed local information -- and currents. We apply this framework to three local quenches in noninteracting fermionic chains: (i) the release of a single particle into an empty tight-binding chain, (ii) the connection of two critical chains via the removal of a central barrier, and (iii) the coupling of a topological Kitaev chain to a critical chain. In each case, the information lattice reveals the local structure of correlation buildup and information interface effects, going beyond global measures such as the von Neumann entropy. In particular, through the information lattice we uncover the signatures in the local information flow associated with topological edge modes and analytically explain the fractional von Neumann entropy values observed in Majorana quench protocols. Our approach is general and applicable to interacting, disordered, and open systems, providing a powerful tool for characterizing quantum information dynamics.</p>

            <p>Quantum computers have great potential to solve problems which are intractable on classical computers. However, quantum processors have not yet reached the required scale to run applications which outperform traditional computers. Leading hardware platforms, such as superconducting qubit based processors, will soon become bottlenecked by the physical constraints of their low temperature environments, and the expansion of quantum computers will necessitate quantum links between multiple processor modules. Optical frequencies offer the most promising path for these links due to their resilience to noise even at ambient temperature and the maturity of classical optical networks. However, required microwave-to-optics transducers cannot operate deterministically yet, which has widely been seen as a key challenge for their integration into fault-tolerant quantum computers. In this work, we examine implementations of optical links between cryogenic units that surpass the performance of individual cryogenic modules even with the performance of existing or near-term microwave-to-optics transducers. We show methods for these transducers to provide on-demand entanglement between separated quantum processors with high fidelity and lay out key steps for adoption of the technology including scaling transducer numbers and integration with other hardware. Finally, we discuss a number of architectures comprised of these links which can drive the expansion of quantum data centers to utility scale.</p>

            <p>Lead-vacancy (PbV) centers in diamond with a large ground state splitting are expected to be a building block of quantum network nodes. Due to the heaviness of the Pb atom, it is challenging to fabricate high-quality PbV centers with a narrow inhomogeneous distribution and stable charge state. In this study, for the formation of the PbV centers, high temperature anneal up to 2300°C is performed after Pb ion implantation. At a lower temperature of 1800°C, the PbV centers show a large inhomogeneous distribution and spectral diffusion, while higher temperatures of 2200-2300°C leads to narrow inhomogeneous distributions with standard deviations of ~5 GHz. The charge state transition of the PbV centers formed at 2200°C occurs by capturing photo-carriers generated from surrounding defects under 532 nm laser irradiation. Finally, multiple stable PbV centers with nearly identical photon frequencies are obtained, which is essential for applications in quantum information processing.</p>

            <p>Computing the exact dynamics of many-body quantum systems becomes intractable as system size grows. Here, we present a symmetry-based method that provides an exponential reduction in the complexity of a broad class of such problems $\unicode{x2014}$ qubits coupled to one-dimensional electromagnetic baths. We identify conditions under which partial permutational symmetry emerges and exploit it to group qubits into collective multi-level degrees of freedom, which we term ''superspins.'' These superspins obey a generalized angular momentum algebra, reducing the relevant Hilbert space dimension from exponential to polynomial. Using this framework, we efficiently compute many-body superradiant dynamics in large arrays of qubits coupled to waveguides and ring resonators, showing that $\unicode{x2014}$ unlike in conventional Dicke superradiance $\unicode{x2014}$ the total spin length is not conserved. At long times, dark states become populated. We identify configurations where these states exhibit metrologically useful entanglement. Our approach enables exact treatment of complex dissipative dynamics beyond the fully symmetric limit and provides a rigorous benchmark for approximate numerical methods.</p>

            <p>Quantum random number generators (QRNGs) harness the inherent unpredictability of quantum mechanics to produce true randomness. Yet, in many optical implementations, the light source remains a potential vulnerability - susceptible to deviations from ideal behavior and even adversarial eavesdropping. Source-device-independent (SDI) protocols address this with a pragmatic strategy, by removing trust assumptions on the source, and instead rely on realistic modelling and characterization of the measurement device. In this work, we enhance an existing SDI-QRNG protocol by eliminating the need for a perfectly balanced beam splitter within the trusted measurement device, which is an idealized assumption made for the simplification of security analysis. We demonstrate that certified randomness can still be reliably extracted across a wide range of beam-splitting ratios, significantly improving the protocol's practicality and robustness. Using only off-the-shelf components, our implementation achieves real-time randomness generation rates of 0.347 Gbps. We also experimentally validate the protocol's resilience against adversarial attacks and highlight its self-testing capabilities. These advances mark a significant step toward practical, lightweight, high-performance, fully-passive, and composably secure QRNGs suitable for real-world deployment.</p>

            <p>The fidelity and quantum nondemolition character of the dispersive readout in circuit QED are limited by unwanted transitions to highly excited states at specific photon numbers in the readout resonator. This observation can be explained by multiphoton resonances between computational states and highly excited states in strongly driven nonlinear systems, analogous to multiphoton ionization in atoms and molecules. In this work, we utilize the multilevel nature of high-$E_J/E_C$ transmons to probe the excited-state dynamics induced by strong drives during readout. With up to 10 resolvable states, we quantify the critical photon number of ionization, the resulting state after ionization, and the fraction of the population transferred to highly excited states. Moreover, using pulse-shaping to control the photon number in the readout resonator in the high-power regime, we tune the adiabaticity of the transition and verify that transmon ionization is a Landau-Zener-type transition. Our experimental results agree well with the theoretical prediction from a semiclassical driven transmon model and may guide future exploration of strongly driven nonlinear oscillators.</p>

            <p>The study of multipartite entanglement is much less developed than the bipartite scenario. Recently, a string of results \cite{diPierro_2018, mengoni2019persistenthomologyanalysismultiqubit, bart2023, hamilton2023probing} have proposed using tools from Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to attach topological quantities to multipartite states. However, these quantities are not directly connected to concrete information processing tasks making their interpretations vague. We take the first steps in connecting these abstract topological quantities to operational interpretations of entanglement in two scenarios. The first is we provide a bound on the Integrated Euler Characteristic defined by Hamilton and Leditzky in \cite{hamilton2023probing} via an average distillable entanglement, which we develop as a generalization of the Meyer-Wallach entanglement measure studied by Scott in \cite{Scott_k-uniform}. This allows us to connect the distance of an error correcting code to the Integrated Euler Characteristic. The second is we provide a characterization of graph states via the birth and death times of the connected components and 1-dimensional cycles of the entanglement complex. In other words, the entanglement distance behavior of the first Betti number $\beta_1(\varepsilon)$ allows us to determine if a state is locally equivalent to a GHZ state, potentially providing new verification schemes for highly entangled states.</p>

            <p>A key challenge in achieving scalable fault tolerance in superconducting quantum processors is readout fidelity, which lags behind one- and two-qubit gate fidelity. A major limitation in improving qubit readout is measurement-induced transitions, also referred to as qubit ionization, caused by multiphoton qubit-resonator excitation occurring at specific photon numbers. Since ionization can involve highly excited states, it has been predicted that in transmons -- the most widely used superconducting qubit -- the photon number at which measurement-induced transitions occur is gate charge dependent. This dependence is expected to persist deep in the transmon regime where the qubit frequency is gate charge insensitive. We experimentally confirm this prediction by characterizing measurement-induced transitions with increasing resonator photon population while actively stabilizing the transmon's gate charge. Furthermore, because highly excited states are involved, achieving quantitative agreement between theory and experiment requires accounting for higher-order harmonics in the transmon Hamiltonian.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Circuit Overhead</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oskar Słowik, Piotr Dulian, Adam Sawicki</p>
            <p>We introduce a measure for evaluating the efficiency of finite universal quantum gate sets $\mathcal{S}$, called the Quantum Circuit Overhead (QCO), and the related notion of $T$-Quantum Circuit Overhead ($T$-QCO). The overhead is based on the comparison between the efficiency of $\mathcal{S}$ versus the optimal efficiency among all gate sets with the same number of gates. We demonstrate the usefulness of the ($T$-)QCO by extensive numerical calculations of its upper bounds, providing insight into the efficiency of various choices of single-qubit $\mathcal{S}$, including Haar-random gate sets and the gate sets derived from finite subgroups, such as Clifford and Hurwitz groups. In particular, our results suggest that, in terms of the upper bounds on the $T$-QCO, the famous T gate is a highly non-optimal choice for the completion of the Clifford gate set, even among the gates of order 8. We identify the optimal choices of such completions for both finite subgroups.</p>

            <h2>Quantum information engines: Bounds on performance metrics by measurement time</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Henning Kirchberg, Abraham Nitzan</p>
            <p>Information engines, sometimes referred to as Maxwell Demon engines, utilize information obtained through measurement to control the conversion of energy into useful work. Discussions around such devices often assume the measurement step to be instantaneous, assessing its cost by Landauer's information erasure within the measurement device. While this simplified perspective is sufficient for classical feedback-controlled engines, for nanoengines that often operate in the quantum realm, the overall performance may be significantly affected by the measurement duration (which may be comparable to the engine's cycle time) and cost (energy needed to create the system-meter correlation). In this study, we employ a generalized von-Neumann measurement model to highlight that obtaining a finite amount of information requires a finite measurement time and incurs an energetic cost. We investigate the crucial role of these factors in determining the engine's performance, particularly in terms of efficiency and power output. Furthermore, for the information engine model under consideration, we establish a precise relationship between the acquired information in the measurement process and the maximum energy extractable through the measurement. We also discuss ways to extend our considerations using these concepts, such as in measurement-enhanced photochemical reactions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuki Koizumi, Kaito Wada, Wataru Mizukami, Nobuyuki Yoshioka</p>
            <p>Achieving quantum advantage in efficiently estimating collective properties of quantum many-body systems remains a fundamental goal in quantum computing. While the quantum gradient estimation (QGE) algorithm has been shown to achieve doubly quantum enhancement in the precision and the number of observables, it remains unclear whether one benefits in practical applications. In this work, we present a generalized framework of adaptive QGE algorithm, and further propose two variants which enable us to estimate the collective properties of fermionic systems using the smallest cost among existing quantum algorithms. The first method utilizes the symmetry inherent in the target state, and the second method enables estimation in a single-shot manner using the parallel scheme. We show that our proposal offers a quadratic speedup compared with prior QGE algorithms in the task of fermionic partial tomography for systems with limited particle numbers. Furthermore, we provide the numerical demonstration that, for a problem of estimating fermionic 2-RDMs, our proposals improve the number of queries to the target state preparation oracle by a factor of 100 for the nitrogenase FeMo cofactor and by a factor of 500 for Fermi-Hubbard model of 100 sites.</p>

Furthermore, we analyze the performance of the quantum amplitude estimation algorithm, another variant of the Heisenberg-limited scaling algorithm, and show how the estimation error is minimized under the circuit structure that resembles the phase estimation algorithm. We finally describe the details for the numerical evaluation of the query complexity of the Heisenberg-limited algorithms and sampling-based methods to make a thorough comparison in the task of estimating fermionic $k$-RDMs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gregory D. Kahanamoku-Meyer, John Blue, Thiago Bergamaschi, Craig Gidney, Isaac L. Chuang</p>
            <p>When designing quantum circuits for a given unitary, it can be much cheaper to achieve a good approximation on most inputs than on all inputs. In this work we formalize this idea, and propose that such "optimistic quantum circuits" are often sufficient in the context of larger quantum algorithms. For the rare algorithm in which a subroutine needs to be a good approximation on all inputs, we provide a reduction which transforms optimistic circuits into general ones. Applying these ideas, we build an optimistic circuit for the in-place quantum Fourier transform (QFT). Our circuit has depth $O(\log (n / \epsilon))$ for tunable error parameter $\epsilon$, uses $n$ total qubits, i.e. no ancillas, is logarithmically local for input qubits arranged in 1D, and is measurement-free. The circuit's error is bounded by $\epsilon$ on all input states except an $O(\epsilon)$-sized fraction of the Hilbert space. The circuit is also rather simple and thus may be practically useful. Combined with recent QFT-based fast arithmetic constructions [arXiv:2403.18006], the optimistic QFT yields factoring circuits of nearly linear depth using only $2n + O(n/\log n)$ total qubits. Applying our reduction technique, we also construct the first approximate QFT to achieve the asymptotically optimal depth of $O(\log (n/\epsilon))$ with a sublinear number of ancilla qubits, well-controlled error on all inputs, and no intermediate measurements.</p>

            <p>Ideal spatial demultiplexing (SPADE) is proven to be a quantum-optimal tool for exoplanet detection, i.e., asymmetric source discrimination. However, recent investigations into the related problems of separation estimation and symmetric source discrimination showed its efficiency to be limited in the presence of noise. In this work, we use analytical tools to scrutinize the practical applicability of SPADE and derive the associated optimal decision strategy for exoplanet detection in the presence of experimental imperfections. On the one hand, we find that the probability of detection of noisy SPADE has the same scaling with planet-star separation and relative brightness as conventional techniques, such as direct imaging and coronagraphs. On the other hand, we prove that, due to a superior scaling coefficient under realistic noise conditions, SPADE remains the most efficient method for practical exoplanet detection in the sub-Rayleigh regime.</p>

            <p>Quantum Information Science and Engineering (QISE) is rapidly gaining interest across a wide range of disciplines. As QISE continues to evolve, engineering will play an increasingly critical role in advancing quantum technologies. While efforts to characterize introductory QISE courses are underway, a comprehensive understanding of QISE education across the United States remains lacking. Developing a broad understanding of the QISE education landscape is crucial for addressing the needs of the growing quantum industry and ensuring equitable access for a diverse range of participants. This paper presents part of an ongoing effort to characterize the current landscape of QISE courses and degree programs in higher education in the US. To achieve this, we used publicly available information from university and college websites to capture information on over 8000 courses that address quantum in some way and nearly 90 QISE specific programs (e.g., degrees, minors, certificates). The majority of these programs are interdisciplinary and include engineering; 14 of them are housed exclusively in engineering departments. We find most programs are offered at research intensive institutions. Our results showcase an opportunity for program developers at non-research intensive institutions to justify the creation of QISE programs, which would also address calls from different stakeholders in QISE education for a more diverse QISE workforce. We suggest strategies based on the findings of this study such as integrating QISE into existing engineering courses, investing in the development of QISE courses and programs at non-PhD-granting institutions, and making courses with QISE content accessible to students from a variety of majors.</p>

            <p>The gravitational constant (G) is the least precisely known fundamental constant of nature, with persistent and significant discrepancies between measurement methods. New techniques for measuring G with systematic effects different from commonly applied pendulum methods are required. Neutrons are convenient probes of gravitational forces as they are both massive and electrically neutral, properties that allowed a single-crystal neutron interferometer (NI) to achieve the first experimental demonstration of gravitationally induced quantum interference. Despite this, the limitation of single-crystal NIs to monoenergetic beams significantly reduces neutron flux, making precision gravitational measurements unfeasible. A new NI design called the phase-grating moiré interferometer (PGMI) has been shown to increase neutron flux by orders of magnitude while allowing grating separation that maintains similar interferometer area to previous NI devices. Here, we propose and describe an experiment to measure G using the PGMI to a precision comparable to measurements from the CODATA 2022 evaluation. A Monte Carlo model for incorporating nonlinear potentials into a PGMI is introduced. This model is used to evaluate sources of systematic uncertainty and quantify the uncertainty in G arising from these effects. The effect of lunar gravitation on a torsion pendulum experiment from CODATA 2022 is calculated, and the need for possible correction factors is demonstrated. This work demonstrates that a neutron PGMI can be used to measure G to $150$ parts-per-million in the near term with the potential to achieve greater precision in future experimental designs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shi Jin, Nana Liu, Chuwen Ma, Yue Yu</p>
            <p>The Schrödingerization method converts linear partial and ordinary differential equations with non-unitary dynamics into systems of Schrödinger-type equations with unitary evolution. It does so via the so-called warped phase transformation that maps the original equation into a Schrödinger-type equation in one higher dimension \cite{Schrshort,JLY22SchrLong}. We show that by employing a smooth initialization of the warped phase transform \cite{JLM24SchrBackward}, Schrödingerization can in fact achieve optimal scaling in matrix queries. This paper presents the detailed implementation of three smooth initializations for the Schrödingerization method: (a) the cut-off function, (b) the higher-order polynomial interpolation, and (c) the Fourier transform methods, that achieve optimality for (a) and near-optimality for (b) and (c). A detailed analysis of key parameters affecting time complexity is conducted.</p>

            <p>Infinite projected entangled-pair states (iPEPS) provide a powerful tool for studying strongly correlated systems directly in the thermodynamic limit. A core component of the algorithm is the approximate contraction of the iPEPS, where the computational bottleneck typically lies in the singular value or eigenvalue decompositions involved in the renormalization step. This is particularly true on GPUs, where tensor contractions are substantially faster than these decompositions. Here we propose a contraction scheme for $C_{4v}$-symmetric tensor networks based on combining the corner transfer matrix renormalization group (CTMRG) with QR-decompositions which are substantially faster -- especially on GPUs. Our approach achieves up to two orders of magnitude speedup compared to standard CTMRG and yields state-of-the-art results for the Heisenberg and $J_1$-$J_2$ models in about one hour on an H100 GPU.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Narayan Kundu, Meenakshi Rana, Aryya Ghosh, Dhananjay Nandi</p>
            <p>We present a kinematically complete study of dissociative electron attachment (DEA) in linear OCS molecules, focusing on how electrons resonantly attach and trigger dissociation. Near the Franck-Condon regime, DEA is dominated by molecular shape resonances, where transient OCS$^-$ states form with high vibrational amplitudes, spectroscopically evident as broad features in DEA cross-sections. As the electron beam energy increases from 5.5 to 6.0 eV, S$^-$ population shifts from lower to higher-energy highly dense bending vibrational states, reinforcing our findings on dipole-forbidden vibronic intensity borrowing. Our advanced potential energy curve calculations, employing the Equation-of-motion coupled cluster singles and doubles for electron attachment (EA-EOMCCSD) method, reveal that beyond the shape resonance, non-adiabatic resonant tunneling governs the avoided crossings, dynamically generating three mode-specific vibronic Feshbach resonances before complete dissociation into three distinct kinetic energy bands of S$^-$. Our theoretical results probe most of the experimental observations quantitatively and qualitatively. These insights deepen our fundamental understanding of resonance-mediated dissociation in electron-molecule resonant scattering, with broader implications for quantum mechanics, plasma physics, vibrational revival, astrochemistry, and radiation damage research.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Da-Chuan Lu, Fu Xu, Yi-Zhuang You</p>
            <p>In this paper, we construct strange correlators and string order parameters for non-invertible symmetry protected topological phases (NISPTs) in 1+1d quantum lattice spin models. The strange correlator exhibits long-range order when evaluated between two distinct NISPTs and decays exponentially otherwise. We show that strange charged operators inserted into the strange correlator are linked to the interface algebra (boundary tube algebra) and are non-trivial when all its irreducible representations have dimensions greater than one. We discuss the generalization to higher dimensions. The string order parameter is obtained by contracting the truncated symmetry operator with charge decoration operators, which are determined by the NISPT action tensors. We illustrate the above construction using the three NISPTs of $\text{Rep}(D_8)$ and demonstrate the extraction of categorical data via tensor networks, particularly through the ZX calculus. Finally, we show that the entanglement spectrum degeneracy is determined by the irreducible representations of the interface algebra when assuming non-invertible symmetry on-site condition.</p>

            <h2>Self-restricting Noise and Exponential Relative Entropy Decay Under Unital Quantum Markov Semigroups</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicholas LaRacuente</p>
            <p>States of open quantum systems often decay continuously under environmental interactions. Quantum Markov semigroups model such processes in dissipative environments. It is known that finite-dimensional quantum Markov semigroups with GNS detailed balance universally obey complete modified logarithmic Sobolev inequalities (CMLSIs), yielding exponential decay of relative entropy to a subspace of fixed point states. We analyze continuous processes that combine dissipative with Hamiltonian time-evolution, precluding this notion of detailed balance. First, we find counterexamples to CMLSI-like decay for these processes and determine conditions under which it fails. In contrast, we prove that despite its absence at early times, exponential decay re-appears for unital, finite-dimensional quantum Markov semigroups at finite timescales. Finally, we show that when dissipation is much stronger than Hamiltonian time-evolution, the rate of eventual, exponential decay toward the semigroup's decoherence-free subspace is bounded inversely in the decay rate of the dissipative part alone. Dubbed self-restricting noise, this inverse relationship arises when strong damping suppresses effects that would otherwise spread noise beyond its initial subspace.</p>

            <p>Quantum information processing faces a significant hurdle: noise. Different noise sources induce varying errors in quantum operations depending on the underlying dynamics. To gain a deeper understanding of these error mechanisms, we introduce the concept of Quantum Error Evolution Diagrams (QEED). These QEEDs establish a dual correspondence between driven noisy quantum dynamics and geometric space curves, offering quantitative geometric metrics to assess the severity of these errors. This theory provides a framework for designing universal robust quantum gates to correct the errors induced by generic noises. Furthermore, we present a protocol for constructing a universal set of single- and two-qubit robust quantum gates. These gates, designed with simple and smooth control pulses of arbitrary length, achieve fidelities exceeding 99.99\% across a wide range of noise strengths. This geometric approach offers significant advantages over existing methods. Overall, our work provides new insights into the geometric nature of noisy quantum dynamics and paves the way for the development of approaches to dynamically correct quantum errors.</p>

            <p>We propose a method for constructing $\texttt{PREPARE}$ circuits for quantum phase estimation of a molecular Hamiltonian in quantum chemistry by using variational optimization of quantum circuits solely on classical computers. The $\texttt{PREPARE}$ circuit generates a quantum state which encodes the coefficients of the terms in the Hamiltonian as probability amplitudes and plays a crucial role in the state-of-the-art efficient implementations of quantum phase estimation. We employ the automatic quantum circuit encoding algorithm [Shirakawa $\textit{et al.}$, arXiv:2112.14524] to construct $\texttt{PREPARE}$ circuits, which requires classical simulations of quantum circuits of $O(\log N)$ qubits with $N$ being the number of qubits of the Hamiltonian. The generated $\texttt{PREPARE}$ circuits do not need any ancillary qubit. We demonstrate our method by investigating the number of $T$-gates of the obtained $\texttt{PREPARE}$ circuits for quantum chemistry Hamiltonians of various molecules, which shows a constant-factor reduction compared to previous approaches that do not use ancillary qubits. Since the number of available logical qubits and $T$ gates will be limited at the early stage of the fault-tolerant quantum computing, the proposed method is particularly of use for performing the quantum phase estimation with such limited capability.</p>

            <p>We provide two improvements to Regev's recent quantum factoring algorithm (Journal of the ACM 2025), addressing its space efficiency and its noise-tolerance. Our first contribution is to improve the quantum space efficiency of Regev's algorithm while keeping the circuit size the same. Our main result constructs a quantum factoring circuit using $O(n \log n)$ qubits and $O(n^{3/2} \log n)$ gates. We achieve the best of Shor and Regev (upto a logarithmic factor in the space complexity): on the one hand, Regev's circuit requires $O(n^{3/2})$ qubits and $O(n^{3/2} \log n)$ gates, while Shor's circuit requires $O(n^2 \log n)$ gates but only $O(n \log n)$ qubits. As with Regev, to factor an $n$-bit integer $N$, we run our circuit independently $O(\sqrt{n})$ times and apply Regev's classical postprocessing procedure. Our optimization is achieved by implementing efficient and reversible exponentiation with Fibonacci numbers in the exponent, rather than the usual powers of 2, adapting work by Kaliski (arXiv:1711.02491) from the classical reversible setting to the quantum setting. This technique also allows us to perform quantum modular exponentiation that is efficient in both space and size without requiring significant precomputation, a result that may be useful for other quantum algorithms. A key ingredient of our exponentiation implementation is an efficient circuit for a function resembling in-place quantum-quantum modular multiplication. Our second contribution is to show that Regev's classical postprocessing procedure can be modified to tolerate a constant fraction of the quantum circuit runs being corrupted by errors. In contrast, Regev's analysis of his classical postprocessing procedure requires all $\approx \sqrt{n}$ runs to be successful. In a nutshell, we achieve this using lattice reduction techniques to detect and filter out corrupt samples.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tristan Le Roy-Deloison, Edwin Peter Lobo, Jef Pauwels, Stefano Pironio</p>
            <p>Photon losses are the main obstacle to fully photonic implementations of device-independent quantum key distribution (DIQKD). Motivated by recent work showing that routed Bell scenarios offer increased robustness to detection inefficiencies for the certification of long-range quantum correlations, we investigate DIQKD protocols based on a routed setup. In these protocols, in some of the test rounds, photons from the source are routed by an actively controlled switch to a nearby test device instead of the distant one. We show how to analyze the security of these protocols and compute lower bounds on the key rates using noncommutative polynomial optimization and the Brown-Fawzi-Fawzi method. We determine lower bounds on the asymptotic key rates of several simple two-qubit routed DIQKD protocols based on CHSH or BB84 correlations and compare their performance to standard protocols. For high-quality short-path tests, we find that routed DIQKD protocols are significantly more robust to losses, showing an improvement of approximately $30\%$ in the detection efficiency compared to their nonrouted counterparts. This translates to a large improvement in the distance over which nonzero key can be distilled in optical setups with near-perfect single-photon detectors, where the main source of loss in the setup is due to transmission in the fiber. Notably, the routed BB84 protocol achieves a positive key rate with a detection efficiency as low as $50\%$ for the distant device, the minimal threshold for any QKD protocol featuring two untrusted measurements. However, the advantages we find are highly sensitive to noise and losses affecting the short-range correlations involving the additional test device.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haijin Ding, Nina H. Amini, John E. Gough, Guofeng Zhang</p>
            <p>In this paper, we study both open-loop control and closed-loop measurement feedback control of non-Markovian quantum dynamics resulting from the interaction between a quantum system and its environment. We use the widely studied cavity quantum electrodynamics (cavity-QED) system as an example, where an atom interacts with the environment composed of a collection of oscillators. In this scenario, the stochastic interactions between the atom and the environment can introduce non-Markovian characteristics into the evolution of quantum states, differing from the conventional Markovian dynamics observed in open quantum systems. As a result, the atom's decay rate to the environment varies with time and can be described by nonlinear equations. The solutions to these nonlinear equations can be analyzed in terms of the stability of a nonlinear control system. Consequently, the evolution of quantum state amplitudes follows linear time-varying equations as a result of the non-Markovian quantum transient process. Additionally, by using measurement feedback through homodyne detection of the cavity output, we can modulate the steady atomic and photonic states in the non-Markovian process. When multiple coupled cavity-QED systems are involved, measurement-based feedback control can influence the dynamics of high-dimensional quantum states, as well as the resulting stable and unstable subspaces.</p>

Our results show that decoherence due to the nonequilibrium critical dynamics of the environment is amplified in the presence of uncorrelated and correlated Gaussian noise. We demonstrate that decoherence factor consistently signals the critical points, and exhibits exponential scaling with the system size, the square of noise intensity, and the noise correlation time at the critical points. We find that strong coupling between the qubit and the environment leads to partial revivals of decoherence, which diminish with increasing noise intensity or decreasing noise correlation time. In contrast, weak coupling leads to monotonic enhanced decoherence. The numerical results illustrate that, the revivals decay and scale exponentially with noise intensity. Moreover, the revivals increase and indicate linear or power law scaling with noise correlation time depends on how the correlated noise is fast or slow. Additionally, we explore the non-Markovianity of the dynamics, finding that it decays in the presence of noise but increases as the noise correlation time grows.</p>

            <h2>Effects of phase-gradient on the nonadiabatic dynamics and photon-phonon conversion in one-dimensional array of optomechanical cavities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Divya Mishra, Parvendra Kumar</p>
            <p>Manipulation of photonic and phononic coupling in the coupled cavities plays a crucial role in the development of nonreciprocal devices and photon-phonon conversion. Here, we theoretically investigate how the phase gradient of a driving laser affects the coupling between photonic and phononic modes. This, in turn, affects and offers the controllability of the nonadiabatic dynamics of the population of hybrid eigenmodes following a sudden change in the optomechanical coupling. We show that the controllable nonadiabatic dynamics can be attributed to the phase-induced alteration of the bandgaps in the hybrid eigenmodes. We further demonstrate that the phase-assisted control of the relative weight of photonic and phononic modes in the hybrid eigenmodes also contributes to the nonadiabatic dynamics. Finally, we investigate the effects of phase on the coherent conversion of photon-phonon in a finite-size array.</p>

            <p>We propose a polynomial-time algorithm for preparing the Gibbs state of the two-dimensional toric code Hamiltonian at any temperature, starting from any initial condition, significantly improving upon prior estimates that suggested exponential scaling with inverse temperature. Our approach combines the Lindblad dynamics using a local Davies generator with simple global jump operators to enable efficient transitions between logical sectors. Our proof also shows that the Lindblad dynamics with a digitally implemented low-temperature local Davies generator is able to efficiently drive the quantum state towards the ground state manifold.</p>

            <h2>Sample-Efficient Quantum State Tomography for Structured Quantum States in One Dimension</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhen Qin, Casey Jameson, Alireza Goldar, Michael B. Wakin, Zhexuan Gong, Zhihui Zhu</p>
            <p>While quantum state tomography (QST) remains the gold standard for benchmarking and verifying quantum devices, it requires an exponentially large number of measurements and classical computational resources for generic quantum many-body systems, making it impractical even for intermediate-size quantum devices. Fortunately, many physical quantum states often exhibit certain low-dimensional structures that enable the development of efficient QST. A notable example is the class of states represented by matrix product operators (MPOs) with a finite matrix/bond dimension, which include most physical states in one dimension and where the number of independent parameters describing the states only grows linearly with the number of qubits. Whether a sample efficient quantum state tomography protocol, where the number of required state copies scales only linearly as the number of parameters describing the state, exists for a generic MPO state still remains an important open question. In this paper, we answer this fundamental question affirmatively by using a class of informationally complete positive operator-valued measures (IC-POVMs) -- including symmetric IC-POVMs (SIC-POVMs) and spherical $t$-designs -- focusing on sample complexity while not accounting for the implementation complexity of the measurement settings. For SIC-POVMs and (approximate) spherical 2-designs, we show that the number of state copies to guarantee bounded recovery error of an MPO state with a constrained least-squares estimator depends on the probability distribution of the MPO under the POVM but scales only linearly with $n$ when the distribution is approximately uniform. For spherical $t$-designs with $t\geq 3$, we prove that only a number of state copies proportional to the number of independent parameters in the MPO is sufficient for a guaranteed recovery of any state represented by an MPO.</p>

            <h2>Efficient self-consistent learning of gate set Pauli noise</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Senrui Chen, Zhihan Zhang, Liang Jiang, Steven T. Flammia</p>
            <p>Understanding quantum noise is an essential step towards building practical quantum information processing systems. Pauli noise is a useful model that has been widely applied in quantum benchmarking, error mitigation, and error correction. Despite intensive study, most existing works focus on learning Pauli noise channels associated with some specific gates rather than treating the gate set as a whole. A learning algorithm that is self-consistent, complete, and efficient at the same time is yet to be established. In this work, we study the task of gate set Pauli noise learning, where a set of quantum gates, state preparation, and measurements all suffer from unknown Pauli noise channels with a customized noise ansatz. Using tools from algebraic graph theory, we analytically characterize the self-consistently learnable degrees of freedom for Pauli noise models with arbitrary linear ansatz, and design experiments to efficiently learn all the learnable information. Specifically, we show that all learnable information about the gate noise can be learned to relative precision, under mild assumptions on the noise ansatz. We then demonstrate the flexibility of our theory by applying it to concrete physically motivated ansatzs (such as spatially local or quasi-local noise) and experimentally relevant gate sets (such as parallel CZ gates). These results not only enhance the theoretical understanding of quantum noise learning, but also provide a feasible recipe for characterizing existing and near-future quantum information processing devices.</p>

            <h2>Adversarial Data Poisoning Attacks on Quantum Machine Learning in the NISQ Era</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Satwik Kundu, Swaroop Ghosh</p>
            <p>With the growing interest in Quantum Machine Learning (QML) and the increasing availability of quantum computers through cloud providers, addressing the potential security risks associated with QML has become an urgent priority. One key concern in the QML domain is the threat of data poisoning attacks in the current quantum cloud setting. Adversarial access to training data could severely compromise the integrity and availability of QML models. Classical data poisoning techniques require significant knowledge and training to generate poisoned data, and lack noise resilience, making them ineffective for QML models in the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. In this work, we first propose a simple yet effective technique to measure intra-class encoder state similarity (ESS) by analyzing the outputs of encoding circuits. Leveraging this approach, we introduce a \underline{Qu}antum \underline{I}ndiscriminate \underline{D}ata Poisoning attack, QUID. Through extensive experiments conducted in both noiseless and noisy environments (e.g., IBM\_Brisbane's noise), across various architectures and datasets, QUID achieves up to $92\%$ accuracy degradation in model performance compared to baseline models and up to $75\%$ accuracy degradation compared to random label-flipping. We also tested QUID against state-of-the-art classical defenses, with accuracy degradation still exceeding $50\%$, demonstrating its effectiveness. This work represents the first attempt to reevaluate data poisoning attacks in the context of QML.</p>

            <p>In two prior papers of this series, it was proposed that a wavefunction model of a heavy particle and a collection of light particles might generate ``Brownian-Motion-Like" trajectories as well as diffusive motion (displacement proportional to the square-root of time) of the heavy particle, but did not exhibit a concrete instance. Here we introduce a one-space-dimensional model which, granted a finite perturbation series, fulfills the criteria for BML trajectories and diffusion. We note that Planck's constant and the molecular mass of light particles make an appearance in the diffusion coefficient, which further differentiates the present theory from the work of Poincar{é} and Einstein in the previous century.</p>

            <h2>Aspects of Complexity in Quantum Evolutions on the Bloch Sphere</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Carlo Cafaro, Emma Clements, Abeer Alanazi</p>
            <p>We enhance our quantitative comprehension of the complexity associated with both time-optimal and time sub-optimal quantum Hamiltonian evolutions that connect arbitrary source and target states on the Bloch sphere, as recently presented in Nucl. Phys. B1010, 116755 (2025). Initially, we examine each unitary Schrodinger quantum evolution selected through various metrics, such as path length, geodesic efficiency, speed efficiency, and the curvature coefficient of the corresponding quantum-mechanical trajectory that connects the source state to the target state on the Bloch sphere. Subsequently, we evaluate the selected evolutions using our proposed measure of complexity, as well as in relation to the concept of complexity length scale. The choice of both time-optimal and time sub-optimal evolutions, along with the selection of source and target states, enables us to conduct pertinent sanity checks that seek to validate the physical relevance of the framework supporting our proposed complexity measure. Our research suggests that, in general, efficient quantum evolutions possess a lower complexity than their inefficient counterparts. However, it is important to recognize that complexity is not solely determined by length; in fact, longer trajectories that are adequately curved may exhibit a complexity that is less than or equal to that of shorter trajectories with a lower curvature coefficient.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jasper Johannes Postema, Servaas J.J.M.F. Kokkelmans</p>
            <p>Encoding quantum information in a quantum error correction (QEC) code offers protection against decoherence and enhances the fidelity of qubits and gate operations. One of the fundamental challenges of QEC is to construct codes with asymptotically good parameters, i.e. a non-vanishing rate and relative minimum distance. Such codes provide compact quantum memory with low overhead and enhanced error correcting capabilities, compared to state-of-the-art topological error correction codes such as the surface or colour codes. Recently, bivariate bicycle (BB) codes have emerged as a promising candidate for such compact memory, though the exact tradeoff of the code parameters $[[n,k,d]]$ remained unknown. In this Article, we explore these codes by leveraging their ring structure, and predict their dimension as well as conditions on their existence. Finally, we highlight asymptotic badness. Though this excludes this subclass of codes from the search towards practical good low-density parity check (LDPC) codes, it does not affect the utility of the moderately long codes that are known, which can already be used to experimentally demonstrate better QEC beyond the surface code.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yoshihito Kuno, Takahiro Orito, Ikuo Ichinose</p>
            <p>Discovering and categorizing quantum orders in mixed many-body systems are currently one of the most important problems. Target model in this study is an extended version of the cluster model in one dimension with $Z_2\otimes Z_2$ symmetry, and we investigate effects of decoherence applied to the ground state of the model, focusing on the symmetry aspect. By using a scheme that we propose, a strong symmetry protected topological (SPT) mixed state and double average SPT (ASPT) state are constructed through the pure gapless SPT order and the domain-wall duality. Among them, the double ASPT is categorized by coexisting orders, i.e., a strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking and ASPT defined by the remaining weak and strong symmetries. We make use of the doubled Hilbert space formalism for the construction scheme. We numerically demonstrate the emergence of the two mixed SPT states and find that a phase transition occurs between them tuned by the strength of decoherence. Finally, we discuss the coexistence of SPT and SWSSB in the double SPT state from the view point of symmetrically invertible property, and comment on the classification of ASPT proposed recently. Suitable multiple-decoherence channel applied to SPT states gives a broad possibility to induce rich ASPTs, possessing non-trivial internal entanglement properties from the view of doubled Hilbert space formalism.</p>

            <p>The area of quantum circuit simulation has attracted a lot of attention in recent years. However, due to the exponentially increasing computational costs, assessing and validating these models on large datasets poses significant obstacles. Despite plenty of research in quantum simulation, issues such as memory management, system adaptability, and execution efficiency remain unresolved. In this study, we introduce QEA, a state vector-based hardware accelerator that overcomes these difficulties with four key improvements: optimized memory allocation management, open PE, flexible ALU, and simplified CX swapper. To evaluate QEA's capabilities, we implemented and evaluated it on the AMD Alveo U280 board, which uses only 0.534 W of power. Experimental results show that QEA is extremely flexible, supporting a wide range of quantum circuits, has excellent fidelity, making it appropriate for standard quantum emulators, and outperforms powerful CPUs and related works up to 153.16x better in terms of normalized gate speed. This study has considerable potential as a useful approach for quantum emulators in future works.</p>

The quantum spectral sampling algorithm generalizes to estimating any quantity $\sum_j f(\lambda_j)$, where $\lambda_j$ are the matrix eigenvalues. For example, the algorithm allows the efficient estimation of the partition function $Z(\beta) =\sum_j e^{-\beta E_j}$ of a Hamiltonian system with energy eigenvalues $E_j$, and of the entropy $ S =-\sum_j p_j \log p_j$ of a density matrix with eigenvalues $p_j$.</p>

            <p>We propose a general framework for constructing self-dual one-dimensional quasiperiodic lattice models with arbitrary-range hoppings and multifractal behaviors. Our framework generates a broad spectrum of quasicrystals, ranging from the off-diagonal Aubry-André-Harper models on one end, to those with long-range power-law hoppings on another. Focusing on models with off-diagonal quasiperiodic hoppings with power-law decay, we exploit the fact that, when the self-dual condition is satisfied, the system must be in the critical state with multifractal properties. This enables the engineering of models with competing extended, critical, and localized phases, with rich mobility edges in between. As an outstanding example, we show that a limiting case of our family of self-dual quasicrystals can be implemented using Rydberg-atom arrays. Our work offers a systematic route toward self-duality and critical phases, and would facilitate their experimental simulation.</p>

            <p>Surface codes represent a leading approach for quantum error correction (QEC), offering a path towards universal fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC). However, efficiently implementing algorithms, particularly using Pauli-based computation (PBC) with lattice surgery, necessitates careful resource optimization. Prior work often employs static layouts and simplified error models. These typically fail to capture the full costs and dynamic nature of active computation, leading to resource bottlenecks and suboptimal architectural designs. To address this, we introduce SPARO. SPARO features a comprehensive logical error model based on a large corpus of numerical simulations encompassing active Pauli-based computation (PBC) operations-including Pauli product measurements (PPMs), idling qubits, and patch rotations. Our numerical models are integrated within an end-to-end compilation pipeline. SPARO analyzes algorithm-specific bottlenecks arising from constraints such as limited routing areas or magic-state factory throughput. SPARO then dynamically allocates available hardware resources, balancing compute, routing, and magic-state distillation, to minimize space-time overhead and logical error rates for specific workloads. Our simulations demonstrate that SPARO effectively identifies critical resource trade-offs. When evaluated on benchmark circuits, SPARO identifies resource configurations achieving up to 51.11% logical error rate reductions for 433-qubit ADDER circuits when compared to state-of-the-art static layouts using an identical total resource budget. This dynamic approach enables effective co-optimization of PBC execution and surface-code architectures, significantly improving overall resource efficiency. SPARO will be open sourced.</p>

            <p>We study the probability distribution of the first return time to the initial state of a quantum many-body system subject to global projective measurements at stroboscopic times. We show that this distribution can be mapped to a continuation of the canonical partition function of a classical spin chain with noninteracting domains at equilibrium, which is entirely characterized by the Loschmidt amplitude of the quantum many-body system. This allows us to conclude that this probability may decay either algebraically or exponentially at long times, depending on whether the spin chain displays a ferromagnetic or a paramagnetic phase. We illustrate this idea on the example of the return time of $N$ adjacent fermions in a tight-binding model, revealing a rich phase behavior, which can be tuned by scaling the probing time as a function of $N$. The analysis presented here provides an overarching understanding of many-body quantum first-detection problems in terms of equilibrium thermodynamic phases. Our theoretical predictions are in excellent agreement with exact numerical computations.</p>

We construct various types of topological feedback control by using topological Maxwell demons that achieve robust feedback-controlled chiral or helical transport against noise and decoherence. Topological feedback control thus offers a versatile tool for creating and controlling nonequilibrium topological phases in open quantum systems that are distinct from non-Hermitian and Lindbladian systems and should provide a guiding principle for topology-based design of quantum feedback control.</p>

The elements of these devices can correspond to structures of dimensions higher than three and can be arbitrarily connected and reconfigured at any moment. Moreover, our approach allows for the construction of a quantum computer, enabling quantum gate operations for all possible pairs of qubits.

            <p>Dipolar supersolids--quantum states that are simultaneously superfluid and solid--have had their superfluid nature rigorously tested, while its solid nature remains uncharted. Arguably, the defining characteristic of a solid is the existence of elastic shear waves. In this work, we investigate transverse wave packet propagation in dipolar supersolids with triangular and honeycomb structure. Remarkably, the honeycomb supersolid displays anomalous dispersion, supporting waves traveling faster than the transverse speed of sound: a supersonic shear wave. While the distinction between anomalous and normal dispersion appears subtle, it has a profound influence on both the transport and scattering properties. For both supersolid phases, we calculate the shear modulus, a key parameter that quantifies the material's rigidity. Our findings are pertinent to current experimental efforts scrutinizing the fundamental properties of supersolids.</p>

We show that this approach can be used to quantize the one-dimensional nonrelativistic harmonic oscillator, recovering the standard Hamiltonian as obtained by the canonical quantization.

We define a genuine $\mathtt{q}$-partite multi-entropy from a $\mathtt{q}$-partite multi-entropy by subtracting appropriate linear combinations of $\mathtt{\tilde{q}}$-partite multi-entropies for $\mathtt{\tilde{q}} < \mathtt{q}$, in such a way that the genuine $\mathtt{q}$-partite multi-entropy vanishes for all $\mathtt{\tilde{q}}$-partite entangled states. After studying several aspects, we apply it to black holes and holography. For the application to black holes, we see that such a genuine $\mathtt{q}$-partite multi-entropy is important only after the Page time. For the application to holography, we prove that non-bipartite multi-entropies are always positive and $\mathcal{O}\left({1/ G_N}\right)$, as long as boundary subregions are connected. This indicates that for holography, genuine multi-partite entanglement is not small and plays an important role.</p>

            <h2>Two-component atomic Fermi superfluid with spin-orbital coupling in thin spherical-shell geometry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yan He, Chih-Chun Chien</p>
            <p>We present a theory of two-component atomic Fermi superfluid with tunable pairing interaction in a thin spherical shell subject to spin-orbit coupling (SOC). By incorporating SOC into the Fermi superfluid in the BCS-Bose Einstein condensation (BEC) crossover, we obtain the energy spectrum and equations of state. While the order parameter and chemical potential are suppressed by SOC on the BCS side, the former remains positive but the latter may be pushed to negative values by SOC. Meanwhile, the compressibility exhibits kinks as the pairing interaction or SOC varies, indicating singular behavior of higher-derivatives of the free energy despite the presence of the superfluid order parameter. The minimum of the energy dispersion indicates a decoupling of the energy gap from the order parameter, and the compressibility kinks occur when the energy gap approaches zero. We found the particle-hole mixing in the Fermi superfluid essential for the compressibility kinks since a Fermi gas with the same SOC but no pairing interaction only exhibits complicated dispersions but no singular behavior. Therefore, our results show that a combination of superfluid, SOC, and geometry can lead to interesting phenomena. We also discuss possible experimental realizations and implications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tsuneya Yoshida, Emil J. Bergholtz, Tomáš Bzdušek</p>
            <p>Exceptional points at which eigenvalues and eigenvectors of non-Hermitian matrices coalesce are ubiquitous in the description of a wide range of platforms from photonic or mechanical metamaterials to open quantum systems. Here, we introduce a class of Hopf exceptional points (HEPs) that are protected by the Hopf invariants (including the higher-dimensional generalizations) and which exhibit phenomenology sharply distinct from conventional exceptional points. Saliently, owing to their $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant related to the Witten anomaly, three-fold HEPs and symmetry-protected five-fold HEPs act as their own ``antiparticles". Furthermore, based on higher homotopy groups of spheres, we predict the existence of multifold HEPs and symmetry-protected HEPs with non-Hermitian topology captured by a range of finite groups (such as $\mathbb{Z}_3$, $\mathbb{Z}_{12}$, or $\mathbb{Z}_{24}$) beyond the periodic table of Bernard-LeClair symmetry classes.</p>

            <p>The detection of genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) is a state-characterization task that can be viewed as a benchmark in that it confirms appropriate levels of coherence and the ability to control the system in the laboratory. However, many GME tests require joint measurements on all or the majority of the involved quantum systems, posing experimental challenges for platforms with restricted qubit connectivity such as typical setups for time-bin encoded qubits. Here we construct a family of versatile GME criteria that only require measurements of a small subset, i.e., $O(n^2)$ out of $2^n$, of (at most) $m$-body stabilizers of $n$-qubit target graph states, with $m$ bounded from above by twice the maximum degree of the underlying graph. We present analytical results for white-noise-added graph states and numerical simulations for graph states produced in microwave photonic qubits that demonstrate the versatility and performance of our GME criteria under realistic conditions.</p>

            <h2>Is Entanglement Necessary for the Typicality Argument in Statistical Mechanics?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pedro S. Correia, Gabriel Dias Carvalho, Thiago R. de Oliveira</p>
            <p>Typicality arguments replace the postulated mixed state ensembles of statistical mechanics with pure states sampled uniformly at random, explaining why most microstates of large systems exhibit thermal behavior. This paradigm has been revived in quantum contexts, where entanglement is deemed essential, but no clear quantitative link between entanglement structure and typicality has been established. Here, we study pure quantum states with controlled multipartite entanglement and show that when entanglement grows with system size $N$, fluctuations in macroscopic observables decay exponentially with $N$, whereas if entanglement remains finite, one recovers only the classical $1/\sqrt{N}$ suppression. Our work thus provides a quantitative connection between entanglement structure and the emergence of typicality, demonstrating that entanglement is crucial for thermalization in small quantum systems but unnecessary to justify equilibrium in macroscopic ensembles. This unifies classical and quantum foundations of statistical mechanics by pinpointing exactly when and why entanglement matters.</p>

            <h2>Optimized Quantum Embedding: A Universal Minor-Embedding Framework for Large Complete Bipartite Graph</h2>

            <p>Minor embedding is essential for mapping largescale combinatorial problems onto quantum annealers, particularly in quantum machine learning and optimization. This work presents an optimized, universal minor-embedding framework that efficiently accommodates complete bipartite graphs onto the hardware topology of quantum annealers. By leveraging the inherent topographical periodicity of the physical quantum adiabatic annealer processor, our method systematically reduces qubit chain lengths, resulting in enhanced stability, computational efficiency, and scalability of quantum annealing. We benchmark our embedding framework against Minorminer, the default heuristic embedding algorithm, for the Pegasus topology, demonstrating that our approach significantly improves embedding quality. Our empirical results show a 99.98% reduction in embedding time for a 120 x 120 complete bipartite graphs. Additionally, our method eliminates long qubit chains, which primarily cause decoherence and computational errors in quantum annealing. These findings advance the scalability of quantum embeddings, particularly for quantum generative models, anomaly detection, and large-scale optimization tasks. Our results establish a foundation for integrating efficient quantum-classical hybrid solutions, paving the way for practical applications in quantum-enhanced machine learning and optimization.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hanjing Xu, Xiaoyuan Liu, Alex Pothen, Ilya Safro</p>
            <p>The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is one of the promising variational approaches of quantum computing to solve combinatorial optimization problems. In QAOA, variational parameters need to be optimized by solving a series of nonlinear, nonconvex optimization programs. In this work, we propose a QAOA parameter transfer scheme using Graph Attention Networks (GAT) to solve Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problems. We prepare optimized parameters for graphs of 12 and 14 vertices and use GATs to transfer their parameters to larger graphs. Additionally, we design a hybrid distributed resource-aware algorithm for MIS (HyDRA-MIS), which decomposes large problems into smaller ones that can fit onto noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers. We integrate our GAT-based parameter transfer approach to HyDRA-MIS and demonstrate competitive results compared to KaMIS, a state-of-the-art classical MIS solver, on graphs with several thousands vertices.</p>

            <p>The rapid progress in quantum hardware is expected to make them viable tools for the study of quantum algorithms in the near term. The timeline to useful algorithmic experimentation can be accelerated by techniques that use many noisy shots to produce an accurate estimate of the observable of interest. One such technique is to encode the quantum circuit using an error detection code and discard the samples for which an error has been detected. An underexplored property of error-detecting codes is the flexibility in the circuit encoding and fault-tolerant gadgets, which enables their co-optimization with the algorthmic circuit. However, standard circuit optimization tools cannot be used to exploit this flexibility as optimization must preserve the fault-tolerance of the gadget. In this work, we focus on the $[[k+2, k, 2]]$ Iceberg quantum error detection code, which is tailored to trapped-ion quantum processors. We design new flexible fault-tolerant gadgets for the Iceberg code, which we then co-optimize with the algorithmic circuit for the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) using tree search. By co-optimizing the QAOA circuit and the Iceberg gadgets, we achieve an improvement in QAOA success probability from $44\%$ to $65\%$ and an increase in post-selection rate from $4\%$ to $33\%$ at 22 algorithmic qubits, utilizing 330 algorithmic two-qubit gates and 744 physical two-qubit gates on the Quantinuum H2-1 quantum computer, compared to the previous state-of-the-art hardware demonstration. Furthermore, we demonstrate better-than-unencoded performance for up to 34 algorithmic qubits, employing 510 algorithmic two-qubit gates and 1140 physical two-qubit gates.</p>

            <h2>Efficient Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption for Quantum Computer Programs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ben Goertzel</p>
            <p>We present a lattice-based scheme for homomorphic evaluation of quantum programs and proofs that remains secure against quantum adversaries. Classical homomorphic encryption is lifted to the quantum setting by replacing composite-order groups with Module Learning-With-Errors (MLWE) lattices and by generalizing polynomial functors to bounded natural super functors (BNSFs). A secret depolarizing BNSF mask hides amplitudes, while each quantum state is stored as an MLWE ciphertext pair. We formalize security with the qIND-CPA game that allows coherent access to the encryption oracle and give a four-hybrid reduction to decisional MLWE. The design also covers practical issues usually left open. A typed QC-bridge keeps classical bits produced by measurements encrypted yet still usable as controls, with weak-measurement semantics for expectation-value workloads. Encrypted Pauli twirls add circuit privacy. If a fixed knowledge base is needed, its axioms are shipped as MLWE "capsules"; the evaluator can use them but cannot read them. A rho-calculus driver schedules encrypted tasks across several QPUs and records an auditable trace on an RChain-style ledger. Performance analysis shows that the extra lattice arithmetic fits inside today's QPU idle windows: a 100-qubit, depth-10^3 teleportation-based proof runs in about 10 ms, the public key (seed only) is 32 bytes, and even a CCA-level key stays below 300 kB. A photonic Dirac-3 prototype that executes homomorphic teleportation plus knowledge-base-relative amplitude checks appears feasible with current hardware. These results indicate that fully homomorphic, knowledge-base-aware quantum reasoning is compatible with near-term quantum clouds and standard post-quantum security assumptions.</p>

            <h2>Capturing Quantum Snapshots from a Single Copy via Mid-Circuit Measurement and Dynamic Circuit</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Debarshi Kundu, Avimita Chatterjee, Archisman Ghosh, Swaroop Ghosh</p>
            <p>We propose Quantum Snapshot with Dynamic Circuit (QSDC), a hardware-agnostic, learning-driven framework for capturing quantum snapshots: non-destructive estimates of quantum states at arbitrary points within a quantum circuit, which can then be classically stored and later reconstructed. This functionality is vital for introspection, debugging, and memory in quantum systems, yet remains fundamentally constrained by the no-cloning theorem and the destructive nature of measurement. QSDC introduces a guess-and-check methodology in which a classical model, powered by either gradient-based neural networks or gradient-free evolutionary strategie, is trained to reconstruct an unknown quantum state using fidelity from the SWAP test as the sole feedback signal. Our approach supports single-copy, mid-circuit state reconstruction, assuming hardware with dynamic circuit support and sufficient coherence time. We validate core components of QSDC both in simulation and on IBM quantum hardware. In noiseless settings, our models achieve average fidelity up to 0.999 across 100 random quantum states; on real devices, we accurately reconstruct known single-qubit states (e.g., Hadamard) within three optimization steps.</p>

            <p>Based on the physical process of two-atom simultaneous excitation by single photon, we proposed a frequency dividing scheme in superconducting quantum circuit. The frequency division for a microwave photon consists of two quantum processes: firstly, two qubits share the energy of single photon in high-frequency resonator through the three-body interaction (two qubits and one photon); secondly, part energies of excited state qubits are transferred to corresponding low frequency resonators through two-body interactions (one qubit and one photon). By changing the parameters of pumping pulses, controllable output pulses can be realized through the superconducting frequency divider. The microwave and pulse signals created by the superconducting frequency divider can be used to pump or readout the superconducting qubits, which can greatly reduce the occupation amount of high-frequency cables in dilution refrigerator during the measurement of large scale superconducting quantum chip.</p>

            <h2>A Unified Variational Framework for Quantum Excited States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shi-Xin Zhang, Lei Wang</p>
            <p>Determining quantum excited states is crucial across physics and chemistry but presents significant challenges for variational methods, primarily due to the need to enforce orthogonality to lower-energy states, often requiring state-specific optimization, penalty terms, or specialized ansatz constructions. We introduce a novel variational principle that overcomes these limitations, enabling the \textit{simultaneous} determination of multiple low-energy excited states. The principle is based on minimizing the trace of the inverse overlap matrix multiplied by the Hamiltonian matrix, $\mathrm{Tr}(\mathbf{S}^{-1}\mathbf{H})$, constructed from a set of \textit{non-orthogonal} variational states $\{|\psi_i\rangle\}$. Here, $\mathbf{H}_{ij} = \langle\psi_i | H | \psi_j\rangle$ and $\mathbf{S}_{ij} = \langle\psi_i | \psi_j\rangle$ are the elements of the Hamiltonian and overlap matrices, respectively. This approach variationally optimizes the entire low-energy subspace spanned by $\{|\psi_i\rangle\}$ without explicit orthogonality constraints or penalty functions. We demonstrate the power and generality of this method across diverse physical systems and variational ansatzes: calculating the low-energy spectrum of 1D Heisenberg spin chains using matrix product states, finding vibrational spectrum of Morse potential using quantics tensor trains for real-space wavefunctions, and determining excited states for 2D fermionic Hubbard model with variational quantum circuits. In all applications, the method accurately and simultaneously obtains multiple lowest-lying energy levels and their corresponding states, showcasing its potential as a unified and flexible framework for calculating excited states on both classical and quantum computational platforms.</p>

            <p>We develop randomized quantum algorithms to simulate quantum collision models, also known as repeated interaction schemes, which provide a rich framework to model various open-system dynamics. The underlying technique involves composing time evolutions of the total (system, bath, and interaction) Hamiltonian and intermittent tracing out of the environment degrees of freedom. This results in a unified framework where any near-term Hamiltonian simulation algorithm can be incorporated to implement an arbitrary number of such collisions on early fault-tolerant quantum computers: we do not assume access to specialized oracles such as block encodings and minimize the number of ancilla qubits needed. In particular, using the correspondence between Lindbladian evolution and completely positive trace-preserving maps arising out of memoryless collisions, we provide an end-to-end quantum algorithm for simulating Lindbladian dynamics. For a system of $n$-qubits, we exhaustively compare the circuit depth needed to estimate the expectation value of an observable with respect to the reduced state of the system after time $t$ while employing different near-term Hamiltonian simulation techniques, requiring at most $n+2$ qubits in all. We compare the CNOT gate counts of the various approaches for estimating the Transverse Field Magnetization of a $10$-qubit XX-Heisenberg spin chain under amplitude damping. Finally, we also develop a framework to efficiently simulate an arbitrary number of memory-retaining collisions, i.e., where environments interact, leading to non-Markovian dynamics. Overall, our methods can leverage quantum collision models for both Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics on early fault-tolerant quantum computers, shedding light on the advantages and limitations of simulating open systems dynamics using this framework.</p>

            <p>Quantum imaging with spatially entangled photons offers advantages such as enhanced spatial resolution, robustness against noise, and counter-intuitive phenomena. In quantum adaptive optics, biphoton aberration correction has been achieved by using classical beams to detect the aberration source or scanning the correction phase on biphotons if the source is unreachable. Here, we introduce position-correlated biphoton Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensing, where the phase pattern added on photon pairs with a strong position correlation is reconstructed from their position centroid distribution at the focal plane of a microlens array. We experimentally demonstrate this method by performing phase measurement and adaptive imaging against the disturbance of a plastic film. Our method involves only one measurement step, so it is a more direct approach to biphoton phase measurement with a greatly improved efficiency, suitable for integration into quantum microscopy and communication.</p>

            <p>Detecting individual spins--including stable and metastable states--represents a fundamental challenge in quantum sensing with broad applications across condensed matter physics, quantum chemistry, and single-molecule magnetic resonance imaging. While nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have emerged as powerful nanoscale sensors, their performance for single-spin detection remains constrained by substantial environmental noise and restricted sensing volume. Here, we propose and demonstrate an entanglement-enhanced sensing protocol that overcomes these limitations through the strategic use of entangled NV pairs. Our approach achieves a 3.4-fold enhancement in sensitivity and a 1.6-fold reduction in spatial resolution relative to single NV centers under ambient conditions. The protocol employs carefully engineered entangled states that amplify target spin signals through quantum interference while suppressing environmental noise. Crucially, we extend these capabilities to resolve metastable single-spin dynamics, directly observing stochastic transitions between different spin states by identifying state-dependent coupling strengths. This dual functionality enables simultaneous detection of static and dynamic spin species for studying complex quantum systems. The achieved performance establishes entanglement-enhanced sensing as a viable pathway toward atomic-scale characterization of quantum materials and interface.</p>

            <p>Conventionally in quantum sensing, the goal is to estimate one or more unknown parameters that are assumed to be deterministic - that is, they do not change between shots of the quantum-sensing protocol. We instead consider the setting where the parameters are stochastic: each shot of the quantum-sensing protocol senses parameter values that come from independent random draws. In this work, we explore three examples where the stochastic parameters are correlated and show how using entanglement provides a benefit in classification or estimation tasks: (1) a two-parameter classification task, for which there is an advantage in the low-shot regime; (2) an $N$-parameter estimation task and a classification variant of it, for which an entangled sensor requires just a constant number (independent of $N$) shots to achieve the same accuracy as an unentangled sensor using exponentially many (${\sim}2^N$) shots; (3) classifying the magnetization of a spin chain in thermal equilibrium, where the individual spins fluctuate but the total spin in one direction is conserved - this gives a practical setting in which stochastic parameters are correlated in a way that an entangled sensor can be designed to exploit. We also present a theoretical framework for assessing, for a given choice of entangled sensing protocol and distributions to discriminate between, how much advantage the entangled sensor would have over an unentangled sensor. Our work motivates the further study of sensing correlated stochastic parameters using entangled quantum sensors - and since classical sensors by definition cannot be entangled, our work shows the possibility for entangled quantum sensors to achieve an exponential advantage over classical sensors, in contrast to the typical quadratic advantage.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stefano Longhi</p>
            <p>The Mpemba effect -- where hot systems cool faster than colder ones -- has intrigued both classical and quantum thermodynamics. As compared to classical systems, quantum systems add complexity due to quantum correlations. Recent works have explored anomalous relaxation and Mpemba-like effects in several quantum systems, considering isolated systems at zero temperature or open systems in contact with reservoirs under Markovian or non-Markovian dynamics. However, these models typically assume an initial unentangled system-bath state, overlooking the role of initial system-environment correlations. Here we propose a type of quantum Mpemba effect, distinct from the strong Mpemba effect, originating from initial system-bath entanglement solely. It is shown that the degree of initial entanglement significantly influences the early relaxation dynamics, with certain conditions causing backflow and retarded thermalization. As an example, we investigate the spontaneous emission of a two-level atom in a photonic waveguide at zero temperature, where an initial atom-photon entangled state results in delayed relaxation and pronounced Mpemba effect. These findings highlight the crucial role of quantum correlations in thermalization processes and open new avenues for identifying and engineering quantum Mpemba phenomena. Controlling relaxation dynamics through system-environment entanglement may have potential applications in quantum thermal machines, state initialization protocols, and quantum information processing, where precise control over thermalization is essential.</p>

            <p>We introduce two quantitative measures of the strength of causal relations in quantum theory and more general physical theories. These two measures, called the maximum and minimum causal effect, quantify the maximum and minimum changes in the output of a quantum process induced by changes in its input. The maximum and minimum causal effects possess useful properties, such as continuity and data-processing inequality. In quantum theory, they have close connections with quantum information tasks. The maximum quantum causal effect can be used to detect quantum channels with nonzero capacity for transmitting classical information. The minimum causal effect can be used to guarantee the recoverability of quantum information: every quantum process with a high value of the minimum quantum causal effect can be approximately inverted. Moreover, we show that the quantum causal effects satisfy a duality relation: if the minimum causal effect of a quantum system $A$ on another quantum system $B$ is high, then $A$ must have a low value of the maximum causal effect on any other quantum system $B'$ that is spacelike separated with $B$. This duality implies a monogamy relation for quantum causal effects and represents a fundamental difference between quantum and classical causal relations. We illustrate the application of the maximum causal effect to the analysis of two paradigmatic examples, the first involving a coherent superposition of direct cause and common cause, and the second involving a coherent superposition of multiple quantum processes.</p>

However, this complexity poses significant fabrication challenges, particularly in achieving high yield and junction uniformity with traditional methods. Here, we introduce an overlap process for Josephson junction fabrication that achieves nearly 100% yield and maintains uniformity across a 2-inch wafer with less than 5% variation for the phase slip junction and less than 2% for the entire junction array. We use a compact junction array design that achieves state-of-the-art dielectric loss tangents and flux noise levels, as confirmed by multiple devices.

            <p>Spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) is crucial to the occurrence of phase transitions. Once a phase transition occurs, a quantum system presents degenerate eigenstates that lack the symmetry of the Hamiltonian. After crossing the critical point, the system is essentially evolved to a quantum superposition of these eigenstates until decoherence sets in. Despite the fundamental importance and potential applications in quantum technologies, such quantum-mechanical SSB phenomena have not been experimentally explored in many-body systems. We here present an experimental demonstration of the SSB process in the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, governed by the competition between the individual driving and intra-qubit interaction. The model is realized in a circuit quantum electrodynamics system, where 6 Xmon qubits are coupled in an all-to-all manner through virtual photon exchange mediated by a resonator. The observed nonclassical correlations among these qubits in the symmetry-breaking region go beyond the conventional description of SSB, shedding new light on phase transitions for quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <p>Designing an operational architecture for the Quantum Internet is challenging in light of both fundamental limits imposed by physics laws and technological constraints. Here, we propose a method to abstract away most of the quantum-specific elements and formulate a best-effort quantum network architecture based on packet switching, akin to that of the classical Internet. This reframing provides an opportunity to exploit the many available and well-understood protocols within the Internet context. As an illustration, we tailor and adapt classical congestion control and active queue management protocols to quantum networks, employing an architecture wherein quantum end and intermediate nodes effectively regulate demand and resource utilization, respectively. Results show that these classical networking tools can be effective in managing quantum memory decoherence and maintaining end-to-end fidelity around a target value.</p>

            <h2>Scalable and modular generation of multipartite entangled states through memory-enhanced fusion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jixuan Shi, Sheng Zhang, Yukai Wu, Yuedong Sun, Yibo Liang, Hai Wang, Yunfei Pu, Luming Duan</p>
            <p>Efficient generation of large-scale multipartite entangled states is a critical but challenging task in quantum information processing. Although generation of multipartite entanglement within a small set of individual qubits has been demonstrated, further scale-up in system size requires the connection of smaller entangled states into a larger state in a scalable and modular manner. Here we achieve this goal by implementing memory-enhanced fusion of two multipartite entangled states via photonic interconnects. Through asynchronous preparation of two tripartite W-state entanglements in two spatially-separated modules of atomic quantum memories and on-demand fusion via single-photon interference, we demonstrate the creation of a four-partite W-state entanglement shared by two remote quantum memory modules in a heralded way. We further transfer the W state from the memory qubits to the photonic qubits, and confirm the genuine four-partite entanglement through witness measurements. We then demonstrate memory-enhanced scaling in efficiencies in the entanglement fusion. The demonstrated scalable generation and fusion of multipartite entangled states pave the way towards realization of large-scale distributed quantum information processing in the future.</p>

            <h2>The fundamental localization phases in quasiperiodic systems: A unified framework and exact results</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xin-Chi Zhou, Bing-Chen Yao, Yongjian Wang, Yucheng Wang, Yudong Wei, Qi Zhou, Xiong-Jun Liu</p>
            <p>The disordered quantum systems host three types of quantum states, the extended, localized, and critical, which bring up various distinct fundamental phases, including the pure phases and coexisting ones with mobility edges. The quantum phases involving critical states are of particular importance, but are less understood compared with the other ones, and the different phases have been separately studied in different quasiperiodic models. Here we propose a unified framework based on a spinful quasiperiodic system which unifies the realizations of all the fundamental Anderson phases, with the exact and universal results being obtained for these distinct phases. Through the duality transformation and renormalization group method, we show that the pure phases are obtained when the chiral symmetry preserves in the proposed spin-1/2 quasiperiodic model, which provides a criterion for the emergence of the pure phases or the coexisting ones with mobility edges. Further, we uncover a new universal mechanism for the critical states that the emergence of such states is protected by the generalized incommensurate matrix element zeros in the spinful quasiperiodic model, as a nontrivial generalization of the mechanism in the spinless systems. We also show with the Avila's global theory the criteria of exact solvability for the present unified quasiperiodic system, with which we identify several new quasiperiodic models hosting exactly solvable Anderson phases. We particularly reach two novel models, with one hosting all basic types of mobility edges and the other hosting all the seven fundamental phases of Anderson localization. Finally, an experimental scheme is proposed to realize these models using quasiperiodic optical Raman lattices.</p>

            <p>The last two decades has seen quantum thermodynamics become a well established field of research in its own right. In that time, it has demonstrated a remarkably broad applicability, ranging from providing foundational advances in the understanding of how thermodynamic principles apply at the nano-scale and in the presence of quantum coherence, to providing a guiding framework for the development of efficient quantum devices. Exquisite levels of control have allowed state-of-the-art experimental platforms to explore energetics and thermodynamics at the smallest scales which has in turn helped to drive theoretical advances.

            <h2>Generalized Pulse Design in Floquet Engineering: Application to Interacting Spin Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryan Scott, Bryce Gadway, V. W. Scarola</p>
            <p>Floquet engineering in quantum simulation employs externally applied high frequency pulses to dynamically design steady state effective Hamiltonians. Such protocols can be used to enlarge the space of Hamiltonians but approximations often limit pulse profile shapes and therefore the space of available effective Hamiltonians. We consider a non-stroboscopic high frequency expansion formalism for Floquet engineering. We generalize the pulse profiles available by rigorously keeping all necessary terms to lowest order in inverse frequency expansions used to derive the effective Hamiltonians. Our approach allows wide tunability in application of external driving fields. We apply our method to long-range interacting XXZ spin Hamiltonians. We model an example application where we derive conditions on specific pulse shapes to engineer effective Ising models from XXZ models. Our method allows the space of continuous pulse profiles, relevant to experimental control fields, to better and more accurately explore possible effective Hamiltonians available for Floquet engineering.</p>

            <p>Here we present an approach to the problem of superradiance in dense atomic samples, when dipolar interactions arise between atoms. Our treatment consists of the sequential use of the Holstein-Primakoff and mean-field approximations, from which we derive master equations for the strong and weak couplings of the sample with the reservoir. We find, in both cases, that the radiation emission presents remarkable features, with characteristic emission times much shorter and intensities much higher than those of Dicke superradiance. In particular, for strong sample-reservoir coupling, a whole comb of superpulses occurs within an envelope with the above-mentioned characteristic emission times much shorter and intensities much higher than those of Dicke superradiance.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dylan van Eeden, Marc M. Dignam</p>
            <p>We present an efficient and accurate method for modeling the generation and propagation of quantum states of light in lossy coupled-cavity systems. We apply our approach to the design and modeling of a multimode photonic crystal coupled-cavity system for the generation of entangled squeezed states of light on-chip. The system consists of a three-mode, three-defect resonant structure coupled to three coupled-resonator optical waveguides (CROWs) in a square lattice silicon photonic crystal slab. We model the system using a basis of 184 non-orthogonal lossy quasi-modes. A two-mode squeezed thermal state of light is generated via degenerate spontaneous four-wave mixing in the resonant structure, which is pumped with a Gaussian pulse via a pump-CROW. The generated entangled signal and idler pulses of light are coupled out of the resonant structure into the two output-CROWs. Due to careful design of the resonant structure and the CROWs, the signal and idler light in the two output CROWs remains entangled even after propagating tens of cavities down the CROWs. Our approach is general and computationally efficient and thus can be applied to modeling the generation and propagation of quantum states of light in a wide variety of coupled-cavity photonic structures.</p>

            <p>Generating entanglement deterministically at a capacity-approaching rate is critical for next-generation quantum networks. We propose weak-coherent-state-assisted protocols that can generate entanglement near-deterministically between reflective-cavity-based quantum memories at a success rate that exceeds the 50\% limit associated with single-photon-mediated schemes. The most pronounced benefit is shown in the low-channel-loss regime and persists even with moderate noise. We extend our protocols to entangle an array of memories in a GHZ state, and infer that it yields an exponential speed-up compared to previous single-photon-based protocols.</p>

            <p>The Petz recovery map provides a near-optimal reversal of quantum noise, yet proposals for its implementation are only recent. We propose a physical realization of the exact state-specific Petz map in an ion trap for qubit decoherence channels. Our circuit constructions require at most $1 (2)$ ancilla qubits and $3 (20)$ CNOT gates for channels with Kraus rank $2 (>2)$. We analyze typical ion trap errors and construct corresponding Petz maps, simulating their performance under realistic noise modeled by residual spin-motion coupling. Quantum circuits are provided for depolarizing, dephasing, and amplitude damping channels. Focusing on single-shot recovery, suited for present-day devices, we also quantify the precision of prior knowledge required to achieve a recovery error below 0.01 across varying decoherence levels and state purities.</p>

            <p>Photonic cluster states are highly entangled states that allow for photonic quantum computing and memory-less quantum repeaters. Their generation has been recently demonstrated using semiconductor quantum dots emitting at the 900 nm wavelength range. However, a similar demonstration at the communication-optimal telecom range has remained elusive. A key ingredient that is still missing is an appropriate optical excitation method. A central requirement of such a method is to allow an arbitrary spin initialization of quantum dot excitonic complexes. In this work, we report on developing such a method based on a quasi-resonant p-shell excitation for a telecom-C-band-emitting quantum dot. We show qubit writing of a neutral exciton and spin-preserving excitation of a negative trion. Using the Larmor precession of the negative trion under an externally applied magnetic field, we determine the in-plane g-factors of both the electron and the hole in the investigated quantum dot. In addition, we measure a lower bound on the hole coherence time, $T_{2}^{*}>6.4$ ns, boosting its candidacy as a sound photon entangler for more advanced quantum photonic schemes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lucas Borges, Thomas Schnappinger, Markus Kowalewski</p>
            <p>Polaritonic chemistry investigates the possible modification of chemical and photochemical reactions by means of strong light-matter coupling in optical cavities, as demonstrated in numerous experiments over the last few years. These experiments are typically interpreted in terms of the Jaynes-Cummings or Tavis-Cummings models under the assumption that the molecular ensemble is only excited by a single photon. In such a model, two polariton states compete with an overwhelming number of dark states, inhibiting polaritonic reactions entropically. We analyze the higher excitation manifolds of the Tavis-Cummings model along with a three-level system that resembles photochemical reactions. We demonstrate that allowing for more than a single excitation makes the reaction of the involved polaritons entropically more favorable.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> P. R. Berman (1), A. Kuzmich (1), P. W Milonni (2) ((1) University of Michigan, (2) University of Rochester)</p>
            <p>A Schrödinger-picture approach is used to calculate the field energy and angular momentum radiated by an atom undergoing spontaneous emission. The calculation is carried out using both the rotating-wave approximation (RWA) and Weisskopf-Wigner approximation (WWA). It is shown that a consistent application of the WWA leads to expressions for both the energy and angular momentum in the field that are finite for all times, in contrast to the results for a classical point dipole oscillator. Moreover, it is shown that the total angular momentum in the field is a sum of its spin and orbital components, again in contrast to the analogous results for a classical point dipole oscillator. Analytic expressions for the energy, spin angular momentum, and orbital angular momentum in the field are obtained for an atom undergoing spontaneous emission from a state having angular momentum H to a state having angular momentum G via an electric dipole transition. It is shown that the spin and orbital angular momenta in the field are equal, independent of the values of H and G. With a slight modification of the WWA, it can also be shown that the energy density in the field, the Poynting vector of the field, and the angular momentum flux of the field do not diverge at the origin.</p>

            <p>Quantum communication has the potential to revolutionize information processing, providing unparalleled security and increased capacity compared to its classical counterpart by using the principles of quantum mechanics. However, the presence of noise remains a major barrier to realizing these advantages. While strategies like quantum error correction and mitigation have been developed to address this challenge, they often come with substantial overhead in physical qubits or sample complexity, limiting their practicality for large-scale information transfer. Here, we present an alternative approach: applying machine learning frameworks from natural language processing to enhance the performance of noisy quantum communications, focusing on superdense coding. By employing bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), a model known for its capabilities in natural language processing, we demonstrate improvements in information transfer efficiency without resorting to conventional error correction or mitigation techniques. These results mark a step toward the practical realization of a scalable and resilient quantum internet.</p>

            <p>We provide a complete characterization of the class of multimode quantum Gaussian states that can be reduced to a tensor product of thermal states using only a passive unitary operator. We call these states \textit{passive unitary normalizable} (PUN) Gaussian states. The characterization of PUN Gaussian states is given in three different ways: $(i)$ in terms of their covariance matrices, $(ii)$ using gauge-invariance (a special class of Glauber--Sudarshan $p$-functions), and $(iii)$ with respect to the recently obtained $(A,\Lambda)$ parametrization of Gaussian states in [J. Math. Phys. 62, 022102 (2021)]. In terms of the covariance matrix, our characterization states that an $n$-mode quantum Gaussian state is PUN if and only if its $2n\times 2n$ quantum covariance matrix $S$ commutes with the standard symplectic matrix $J$. It is well-known that the so-called gauge-invariant Gaussian states are PUN, but whether the converse is true is not known in the literature to the best of our knowledge. We establish the converse in affirmation. Lastly, in terms of the $(A,\Lambda)$-parameterization, we show that a Gaussian state with parameters $(A,\Lambda)$ is PUN if and only if $A=0$.</p>

Drawing parallels with single-particle flat-band localization and Aharonov-Bohm cages, we identify conditions under which similar interference effects in the many-body domain produce Fock space cages (FSCs)-highly localized many-body eigenstates. By interpreting Fock space as a graph where nodes represent bitstring basis states and edges denote non-zero transition amplitudes of the Hamiltonian, we analyze different kinetically constrained models. The FSCs cause non-ergodic dynamics when the system is initialized within their support, highlighting a universal interference-driven localization mechanism in many-body systems.</p>

            <p>Linear optical architectures have been extensively investigated for quantum computing and quantum machine learning applications. Recently, proposals for photonic quantum machine learning have combined linear optics with resource adaptivity, such as adaptive circuit reconfiguration, which promises to enhance expressivity and improve algorithm performances and scalability. Moreover, linear optical platforms preserve some subspaces due to the fixed number of particles during the computation, a property recently exploited to design a novel quantum convolutional neural networks. This last architecture has shown an advantage in terms of running time complexity and of the number of parameters needed with respect to other quantum neural network proposals. In this work, we design and experimentally implement the first photonic quantum convolutional neural network (PQCNN) architecture based on particle-number preserving circuits equipped with state injection, an approach recently proposed to increase the controllability of linear optical circuits. Subsequently, we experimentally validate the PQCNN for a binary image classification on a photonic platform utilizing a semiconductor quantum dot-based single-photon source and programmable integrated photonic interferometers comprising 8 and 12 modes. In order to investigate the scalability of the PQCNN design, we have performed numerical simulations on datasets of different sizes. We highlight the potential utility of a simple adaptive technique for a nonlinear Boson Sampling task, compatible with near-term quantum devices.</p>

The structure of phase-locking domains in the dynamical system on torus is mapped into the band-gap structure of the Hill equation. For the parametric oscillator, we provide the relation between the non-adiabatic Hannay angle and the Poincare rotation number of the corresponding dynamical system. In terms of quantum mechanics, the integer rotation number is connected to the quantization number via the Milne quantization approach and exact WKB. Using recent results concerning the exact WKB approach in quantum mechanics, we discuss the possible non-perturbative effects in the dynamical systems on the torus and for parametric oscillator. The semiclassical WKB is interpreted in the framework of a slow-fast dynamical system. The link between the classification of the coadjoint Virasoro orbits and the Hill equation yields a classification of the phase-locking domains in the parameter space in terms of the classification of Virasoro orbits.

            <p>We consider a spinning primordial black hole (PBH) described by the Kerr metric in Kerr-Schild polar coordinates (KSP). We derive an analytical expression for the four-vector gravitational potential in the underlying Hermitian Dirac Hamiltonian using these coordinates. This gravitational potential introduces an axial vector term in the Dirac equation in curved spacetime. We find that the magnitudes of the temporal and spatial components of the four-vector gravitational potential are significantly affected by the angle of the position vector of the spinor with respect to the spin axis of the PBH, its radial distance from the PBH, and the strength of the specific angular momentum of the PBH. These potentials modify the effective mass matrix of the neutrino-antineutrino system and significantly affect the transition probabilities during the flavor oscillation of the neutrino-antineutrino system. We then use the transition probability to investigate the quantum speed limit time (QSLT) bound ratio for the two-flavor oscillation of the neutrino-antineutrino system in curved spacetime. This helps us estimate how quickly the initial neutrino flavor state evolves over time under the influence of the gravitational field. Finally, we discuss quantum correlations such as entanglement entropy during the two-flavor oscillation of the neutrino-antineutrino system near a spinning PBH.</p>

            <p>Distributed quantum computing (DQC) that allows a large quantum circuit to be executed simultaneously on multiple quantum processing units (QPUs) becomes a promising approach to increase the scalability of quantum computing. It is natural to envision the near-future DQC platform as a multi-tenant cluster of QPUs, called a Quantum Cloud. However, no existing DQC work has addressed the two key problems of running DQC in a multi-tenant quantum cloud: placing multiple quantum circuits to QPUs and scheduling network resources to complete these jobs. This work is the first attempt to design a circuit placement and resource scheduling framework for a multi-tenant environment. The proposed framework is called CloudQC, which includes two main functional components, circuit placement and network scheduler, with the objectives of optimizing both quantum network cost and quantum computing time. Experimental results with real quantum circuit workloads show that CloudQC significantly reduces the average job completion time compared to existing DQC placement algorithms for both single-circuit and multi-circuit DQC. We envision this work will motivate more future work on network-aware quantum cloud.</p>

            <p>Non-Hermiticity appears ubiquitously in various open classical and quantum systems and enriches classification of topological phases. However, the role of nonsymmorphic symmetry, crystalline symmetry accompanying fractional lattice translations, has remained largely unexplored. Here, we systematically classify non-Hermitian topological crystalline phases protected by nonsymmorphic symmetry and reveal unique phases that have no counterparts in either Hermitian topological crystalline phases or non-Hermitian topological phases protected solely by internal symmetry. Specifically, we elucidate the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\mathbb{Z}_4$ non-Hermitian topological phases and their associated anomalous boundary states characterized by distinctive complex-valued energy dispersions.</p>

            <h2>Hybrid Quantum Recurrent Neural Network For Remaining Useful Life Prediction</h2>

            <p>Predictive maintenance in aerospace heavily relies on accurate estimation of the remaining useful life of jet engines. In this paper, we introduce a Hybrid Quantum Recurrent Neural Network frame- work, combining Quantum Long Short-Term Memory layers with classical dense layers for Remaining Useful Life forecasting on NASA's Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation dataset. Each Quantum Long Short-Term Memory gate replaces conventional linear transformations with Quantum Depth-Infused circuits, allowing the network to learn high-frequency components more effectively. Experimental results demonstrate that, despite having fewer trainable parameters, the Hybrid Quantum Recurrent Neural Network achieves up to a 5% improvement over a Recurrent Neural Network based on stacked Long Short-Term Memory layers in terms of mean root mean squared error and mean absolute error. Moreover, a thorough comparison of our method with established techniques, including Random Forest, Convolutional Neural Network, and Multilayer Perceptron, demonstrates that our approach, which achieves a Root Mean Squared Error of 15.46, surpasses these baselines by approximately 13.68%, 16.21%, and 7.87%, respectively. Nevertheless, it remains outperformed by certain advanced joint architectures. Our findings highlight the poten- tial of hybrid quantum-classical approaches for robust time-series forecasting under limited data conditions, offering new avenues for enhancing reliability in predictive maintenance tasks.</p>

            <h2>Optical Activity of Group III-V Quantum Dots Directly Embedded in Silicon</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Gawełczyk, K. Gawarecki</p>
            <p>Optically active III-V group semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are the leading element of the upcoming safe quantum communication. However, the entire electronic and IT infrastructure relies on silicon-based devices, with silicon also providing a natural platform for photonic integration. Combining semiconductor optics with silicon electronics is thus a major technological challenge. This obstacle cannot be directly solved because silicon is optically inactive. Interfacing III-V quantum dots with silicon is thus a sought-after solution. A radical approach is to embed III-V material grains directly into silicon. The first realization of such technology was developed, and it gave InAs and core-shell InAs/GaAs QDs embedded in Si with bright and narrow single-QD emission lines. No theory has been given, though, and, as we show here, it is not even obvious if and how such QDs can be optically active. We first use general arguments, also supported by atomistic calculations, that InAs/Si QDs cannot confine both carrier types unless the structural strain is mostly relaxed, meaning many defects at the interface. This explains the lack of light emission from those dots. Then we show that the InAs/GaAs/Si QDs can confine both carrier types. Their electron states are, however, highly influenced by $k$-space valley mixing, which impacts emission spectra and deteriorates optical properties. We propose to overcome this by adding an additional wider-bandgap material layer.</p>

            <p>We propose a procedure to identify and classify genuine tripartite entanglement in pure 3-qubit states via the Activated Bipartite Entanglement (ABE), which is defined here as the difference between the Entanglement of Assistance and the Entanglement of Formation. We show that for pure states belonging to one of the two inequivalent classes of genuine tripartite entanglement, i.e., GHZ or W states, the ABE is always greater than zero. For separable and biseparable states it is always null. In addition, our approach is capable to distinguish between genuine tripartite entangled states, those belonging to the GHZ-class from those belonging to the W-class. We also present an experimental proposal, by using linear optical circuits and internal degrees of freedom of a single photon, to measure the ABE and to verify the characterization via activated entanglement. The circuit simulation shows an excellent agreement with theoretical prediction for a wide class of GHZ and W states.</p>

            <p>Qubit noise spectroscopy is an important tool for the experimental investigation of open quantum systems. However, conventional techniques for noise spectroscopy are time-consuming, because they require measurements of the noise spectral density at many different frequencies. Here we describe an alternative approach to noise spectroscopy, which requires fewer resources, and relies on direct measurement of arbitrary linear functionals of the noise spectral density. This method uses random pulse sequences with carefully-controlled correlations, which are chosen using algorithms for phase retrieval. These measurements allow us to reconstruct sparse noise spectra via compressed sensing. Our simulations of the performance of the random pulse sequences on a realistic physical system, self-assembled quantum dots, reveal a speedup of an order of magnitude in extracting the noise spectrum, compared to conventional dynamical decoupling approaches.</p>

            <h2>The Overlap Gap Property limits limit swapping in QAOA</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mark Xin Hong Goh</p>
            <p>The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a quantum algorithm designed for Combinatorial Optimization Problem (COP). We show that if a local algorithm is limited in performance at logarithmic depth for a spin glass type COP with an underlying Erdös--Rényi hypergraph, then a random regular hypergraph exhibits it as well. As such, we re-derived the fact that the average-case value obtained by QAOA for the Max-$q$-XORSAT for even $q\ge 4$ is bounded away from optimality even when the algorithm runs indefinitely if optimised using the so-called tree parameters due to the presence of the Overlap Gap Property (OGP). While this result was proven before, the proof is rather technical compared to ours. In addition, we show that the earlier result implicitly also implies limitation at logarithmic depth $p \le \epsilon \log n$ providing an improvement over limitation at constant depth. Lastly, the results suggests that even when sub-optimised, the performance of QAOA on spin glass is equal in performance to classical algorithms in solving the mean field spin glass problem providing further evidence that the conjecture of getting the exact solution under limit swapping for the Sherrington--Kirkpatrick model to be true.</p>

            <p>In this study, we present a comprehensive evaluation of popular SDK-to-SDK quantum transpilers (that is transpilers that takes a quantum circuit from an initial SDK and output a quantum circuit in another SDK), focusing on critical metrics such as correctness, failure rate, and transpilation time. To ensure unbiased evaluation and accommodate diverse quantum computing scenarios, we developed two dedicated tools: RandomQC, for generating random quantum circuits across various types (pure random, VQE-like, and SDK-specific circuits), and Benchmarq, to streamline the benchmarking process. Using these tools, we benchmarked prominent quantum transpilers as of February 2024. Our results highlight the superior performance of the qiskit-braket-provider, a specialized transpiler from Qiskit to Braket, achieving a remarkably low failure rate of 0.2%. The qBraid-SDK, offering generalized transpilation across multiple SDKs, demonstrated robust but slower performance. The pytket extensions, while fast, faced limitations with complex circuits due to their one-to-one transpilation approach. In particular, the exceptional performance of the qiskit-bracket-provider stems not only from its specialization but also from its architecture, which combines one-to-one transpilation with gate decomposition for unsupported gates, enhancing both speed and capability. This study aims to provide practical guidelines to users of SDK-to-SDK quantum transpilers and guidance to developers for improving the design and development of future tools.</p>

            <p>An efficient implementation of the Toffoli gate is of conceptual importance for running various quantum algorithms, including Grover's search and Shor's integer factorization. However, direct implementation of the Toffoli gate either entails a prohibitive increase in the number of two-qubit gates or requires ancilla qubits, whereas both of these resources are limited in the current generation of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a scalable $N$-qubit Toffoli gate improvement using $^{171}$Yb$^{+}$ trapped-ion-based optical-metastable-ground encoded qutrits for the cases of up to $N$=10. With the use of the Molmer-Sorensen gate as a basic entangling operation, we compare the standard qubit decomposition with the qutrit approach, where upper levels are used as this http URL presented decomposition requires only global control of the ancilla levels, which simplifies experimental implementation of the proposed approach. Using the example of a three-qubit Grover's search, we also demonstrate an increase in the algorithm's accuracy by monitoring the leakage from the qubit subspace during a qutrit-based Toffoli gate implementation.</p>

            <p>Analyzing and developing new quantum error-correcting schemes is one of the most prominent tasks in quantum computing research. In such efforts, introducing time dynamics explicitly in both analysis and design of error-correcting protocols constitutes an important cornerstone. In this work, we present a graphical formalism based on tensor networks to capture the logical action and error-correcting capabilities of any Clifford circuit with Pauli measurements. We showcase the formalism on new Floquet codes derived from topological subsystem codes, which we call XYZ ruby codes. Based on the projective symmetries of the building blocks of the tensor network we develop a framework of Pauli flows. Pauli flows allow for a graphical understanding of all quantities entering an error correction analysis of a circuit, including different types of QEC experiments, such as memory and stability experiments. We lay out how to derive a well-defined decoding problem from the tensor network representation of a protocol and its Pauli flows alone, independent of any stabilizer code or fixed circuit. Importantly, this framework applies to all Clifford protocols and encompasses both measurement- and circuit-based approaches to fault tolerance. We apply our method to our new family of dynamical codes which are in the same topological phase as the 2+1d color code, making them a promising candidate for low-overhead logical gates. In contrast to its static counterpart, the dynamical protocol applies a Z3 automorphism to the logical Pauli group every three timesteps. We highlight some of its topological properties and comment on the anyon physics behind a planar layout. Lastly, we benchmark the performance of the XYZ ruby code on a torus by performing both memory and stability experiments and find competitive circuit-level noise thresholds of 0.18%, comparable with other Floquet codes and 2+1d color codes.</p>

            <p>Block Encoding (BE) is a crucial subroutine in many modern quantum algorithms, including those with near-optimal scaling for simulating quantum many-body systems, which often rely on Quantum Signal Processing (QSP). Currently, the primary methods for constructing BEs are the Linear Combination of Unitaries (LCU) and the sparse oracle approach. In this work, we demonstrate that QSP-based techniques, such as Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) and Quantum Eigenvalue Transformation for Unitary Matrices (QETU), can themselves be efficiently utilized for BE implementation. Specifically, we present several examples of using QSVT and QETU algorithms, along with their combinations, to block encode Hamiltonians for lattice bosons, an essential ingredient in simulations of high-energy physics. We also introduce a straightforward approach to BE based on the exact implementation of Linear Operators Via Exponentiation and LCU (LOVE-LCU). We find that, while using QSVT for BE results in the best asymptotic gate count scaling with the number of qubits per site, LOVE-LCU outperforms all other methods for operators acting on up to $\lesssim11$ qubits, highlighting the importance of concrete circuit constructions over mere comparisons of asymptotic scalings. Using LOVE-LCU to implement the BE, we simulate the time evolution of single-site and two-site systems in the lattice $\varphi^4$ theory using the Generalized QSP algorithm and compare the gate counts to those required for Trotter simulation.</p>

            <p>Quantum control plays a crucial role in enhancing precision scaling for quantum sensing. However, most existing protocols require perfect control, even though real-world devices inevitably have control imperfections. Here, we consider a fundamental setting of quantum sensing with imperfect clocks, where the duration of control pulses and the interrogation time are all subject to uncertainty. Under this scenario, we investigate the task of frequency estimation in the presence of a non-Markovian environment. We design a control strategy and prove that it outperforms any control-free strategies, recovering the optimal Heisenberg scaling up to a small error term that is intrinsic to this model. We further demonstrate the advantage of our control strategy via experiments on a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) platform. Our finding confirms that the advantage of quantum control in quantum sensing persists even in the presence of imperfections.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alex E. Bernardini, Orfeu Bertolami</p>
            <p>Extending the phase-space description of the Weyl-Wigner quantum mechanics to a subset of non-linear Hamiltonians in position and momentum, gaussian functions are identified as the quantum ground state. Once a Hamiltonian, $H^{W}(q,\,p)$, is constrained by the $\partial ^2 H^{W} / \partial q \partial p = 0$ condition, flow properties for generic $1$-dim systems can be analytically obtained in terms of Wigner functions and Wigner currents. For gaussian statistical ensembles, the exact phase-space profile of the quantum fluctuations over the classical trajectories are found, so to interpret them as a suitable Hilbert space state configuration for confronting quantum and classical regimes. In particular, a sort of {\em quantum camouflage} where the stationarity of classical statistical ensembles can be camouflaged by the stationarity of gaussian quantum ensembles is identified. Besides the broadness of the framework worked out in some previous examples, our results provide an encompassing picture of quantum effects on non-linear dynamical systems which can be interpreted as a first step for finding the complete spectrum of non-standard Hamiltonians.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chengsi Mao, Changhao Yi, Huangjun Zhu</p>
            <p>Shadow estimation is a sample-efficient protocol for learning the properties of a quantum system using randomized measurements, but the current understanding of qudit shadow estimation is quite limited compared with the qubit setting. Here we clarify the sample complexity of qudit shadow estimation based on the Clifford group, where the local dimension $d$ is an odd prime. Notably, we show that the overhead of qudit shadow estimation over the qubit counterpart is only $\mathcal{O}(d)$, independent of the qudit number $n$, although the set of stabilizer states may deviate exponentially from a 3-design with respect to the third moment operator. Furthermore, by adding one layer of magic gates, we propose a simple circuit that can significantly boost the efficiency. Actually, a single magic gate can already eliminate the $\mathcal{O}(d)$ overhead in qudit shadow estimation and bridge the gap from the qubit setting.</p>

            <p>Recent advancements in space science and technologies offer exciting prospects for investigating novel research that is unattainable within terrestrial laboratories. Here we propose the implementation of space-based quantum sensing to explore ultralight new particles beyond the standard model. The central idea involves probing long-range interactions between spin ensembles of space quantum sensors and the particles residing within Earth, mediated by ultralight particles. We show that such interactions can be substantially enhanced in space platforms and thus increase the search sensitivity. In contrast to their terrestrial counterparts, space-based quantum searches exhibit remarkable velocity enhancements, approaching the first cosmic speed, and thus enables the exploration of unexplored parameter space concerning ultralight new particles. Furthermore, the substantial abundance of electrons and nucleons within Earth plays a crucial role in extending the scope of our mission. Our projected search sensitivity can surpass the sensitivities of both terrestrial experiments and proposals by up to approximately 7 orders of magnitude. We also briefly discuss other space mission, including ``space-ground integrated" network of quantum sensors for dark matter searches.</p>

            <p>Trapped ion systems present non-classical characteristics such as squeezed states that show a quantum advantage in quantum sensing, quantum information processing and quantum thermodynamics. We analyze the non-classical characteristics of a system described by a single ion trapped by a periodic potential field. Within the regime of non-adiabatic manipulation of the potential field, the dynamics of motion of the center of mass of the ion can be described by a dimensionless parameter called the non-adiabatic parameter $Q^{*}$. This parameter allows us to distinguish the classical and non-classical characteristics of the system. Using the equations of motion of observables in the Heisenberg picture, we propose an analysis of the unitary time evolution operator and discuss the squeezing behavior in the state of motion of the ion. The results shown can serve as a basis to discuss the presence of squeezing as a resource in quantum thermodynamics in the non-adiabatic regime in actual achievable experimental limitations.</p>

            <p>Microwave-optical entanglement is essential for efficient quantum communication, secure information transfer, and integrating microwave and optical quantum systems to advance hybrid quantum technologies. In this work, we demonstrate how the magnon Kerr effect can be harnessed to generate and control nonreciprocal entanglement in cavity optomagnomechanics (COMM). This effect induces magnon frequency shifts and introduces pair-magnon interactions, both of which are tunable through the magnetic field direction, enabling nonreciprocal behavior. By adjusting system parameters such as magnon frequency detuning, we show that magnon-phonon, microwave-optical photon-photon, and optical photon-magnon entanglement can be nonreciprocally enhanced and rendered more robust against thermal noise. Additionally, the nonreciprocity of entanglement can be selectively controlled, and ideal nonreciprocal entanglement is achievable. This work paves the way for designing nonreciprocal quantum devices across the microwave and optical regimes, leveraging the unique properties of the magnon Kerr effect in COMM.</p>

            <p>Locality is a transversal principle that governs quantum dynamics of many-body systems. However, for cavity embedded systems, such fundamental notion is hindered by the presence of non-local cavity modes, leaving space for new possible dynamical behaviors. Here, we investigate the real-time dynamics of low-energy excitations in one dimensional Rydberg atom arrays coupled to a global cavity mode. We derive an effective description in terms of a Tavis-Cummings-Ising model, whose phase diagram features ordered and disordered phases. The non-local nature of the cavity mode drastically affects the emergent meson and string dynamics. Mesons hybridize coherently with the cavity photons, leading to composite meson-polaritons excitations. Strings, differently from local interacting theories, acquire a finite kinetic energy thanks to non-local cavity-mediated interactions between the underlying domain-walls. We then conclude by presenting a new concrete experimental blueprint for a cavity QED Rydberg atom array simulator where the physics outlined in this work can be realized.</p>

            <p>Macroscopic entanglement, as a critical quantum resource in quantum information science, has been extensively studied in coherent optomechanics over the past decades. However, entanglement in dissipative optomechanics, where the cavity linewidth depends on the position of the mechanical resonator, remains largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate quantum entanglement in a dissipative optomechanical system realized by a Michelson-Sagnac interferometer with a movable membrane. This configuration enables the switching between coherent and dissipative optomechanical couplings at will. With experimentally feasible parameters, we demonstrate that the steady-state mechanical displacement exhibits a nonlinear (linear) dependence on the driving power under coherent (dissipative) coupling. Furthermore, we show that the quantum entanglement generated via dissipative coupling is significantly stronger and more robust to noise than that generated via coherent coupling. When both coherent and dissipative couplings are simultaneously present, the entanglement is weakened due to quantum interference. Our results indicate that dissipative optomechanical coupling can be a promising route for engineering strong and noise-resilient quantum entanglement.</p>
