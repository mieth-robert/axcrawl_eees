            <h2>Randomness from causally independent processes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martin Sandfuchs, Carla Ferradini, Renato Renner</p>
            <p>We consider a pair of causally independent processes, modelled as the tensor product of two channels, acting on a possibly correlated input to produce random outputs X and Y. We show that, assuming the processes produce a sufficient amount of randomness, one can extract uniform randomness from X and Y. This generalizes prior results, which assumed that X and Y are (conditionally) independent. Note that in contrast to the independence of quantum states, the independence of channels can be enforced through spacelike separation. As a consequence, our results allow for the generation of randomness under more practical and physically justifiable assumptions than previously possible. We illustrate this with the example of device-independent randomness amplification, where we can remove the constraint that the adversary only has access to classical side information about the source.</p>

            <h2>Self-dual bivariate bicycle codes with transversal Clifford gates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zijian Liang, Yu-An Chen</p>
            <p>Bivariate bicycle codes are promising candidates for high-threshold, low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum memories. Meanwhile, color codes are the most prominent self-dual CSS codes, supporting transversal Clifford gates that have been demonstrated experimentally. In this work, we combine these advantages and introduce a broad family of self-dual bivariate bicycle codes. These codes achieve higher encoding rates than surface and color codes while admitting transversal CNOT, Hadamard, and $S$ gates. In particular, we enumerate weight-8 self-dual bivariate bicycle codes with up to $n \leq 200$ physical qubits, realized on twisted tori that enhance code distance and improve stabilizer locality. Representative examples include codes with parameters $[[n,k,d]]$: $[[16,4,4]]$, $[[40,6,6]]$, $[[56,6,8]]$, $[[64,8,8]]$, $[[120,8,12]]$, $[[152,6,16]]$, and $[[160,8,16]]$.</p>

            <h2>Fault-tolerant interfaces for modular quantum computing on diverse qubit platforms</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Frederik K. Marqversen, Gefen Baranes, Maxim Sirotin, Johannes Borregaard</p>
            <p>Modular architectures offer a scalable path toward fault-tolerant quantum computing by interconnecting smaller quantum processing units (QPUs) provided that high-rate, fault-tolerant interfaces can be realized across modules. We present a comprehensive analysis and comparison of known and new methods for establishing such interfaces, including lattice surgery, transversal gates, and novel grow-and-distil protocols based on code growing and logical distillation. Using the surface code, we identify optimal interface strategies across a wide range of hardware parameters, such as gate fidelities, entangling rates, and memory resources, and estimate the requirements to achieve logical error rates of $10^{-6}$ and $10^{-12}$. Our results establish when the interface become a bottleneck in the computation and provide guidance for experimental implementations with superconducting, atomic, and solid-state hardware.</p>

            <h2>Peaked quantum advantage using error correction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhinav Deshpande, Bill Fefferman, Soumik Ghosh, Michael Gullans, Dominik Hangleiter</p>
            <p>A key issue of current quantum advantage experiments is that their verification requires a full classical simulation of the ideal computation. This limits the regime in which the experiments can be verified to precisely the regime in which they are also simulatable. An important outstanding question is therefore to find quantum advantage schemes that are also classically verifiable. We make progress on this question by designing a new quantum advantage proposal--Hidden Code Sampling--whose output distribution is conditionally peaked. These peaks enable verification in far less time than it takes for full simulation. At the same time, we show that exactly sampling from the output distribution is classically hard unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses, and we propose a plausible conjecture regarding average-case hardness. Our scheme is based on ideas from quantum error correction. The required quantum computations are closely related to quantum fault-tolerant circuits and can potentially be implemented transversally. Our proposal may thus give rise to a next generation of quantum advantage experiments en route to full quantum fault tolerance.</p>

            <h2>Levitated optomechanics with cylindrically polarized vortex beams</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Felipe Almeida, Peter Barker</p>
            <p>Optically levitated and cooled nanoparticles are a new quantum system whose application to the creation of non-classical states of motion and quantum limited sensing is fundamentally limited by recoil and bulk heating. We study the creation of stable 3D optical traps using optical cylindrically polarized vortex beams with radial and azimuthal polarization and show that a significant reduction in recoil heating by up to an order of magnitude can be achieved when compared with conventional single Gaussian beam tweezers. Additionally these beams allow trapping of larger particles outside the Rayleigh regime using both bright and dark tweezer trapping with reduced recoil heating. By changing the wavelength of the trapping laser, or the size of the particles, non-linear and repulsive potentials of interest for the creation of non-classical states of motion can also be created.</p>

            <h2>Observation of Genuine Tripartite Non-Gaussian Entanglement from a Superconducting Three-Photon Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion Source</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benjamin Jarvis-Frain, Andy Schang, Fernando Quijandr√≠a, Ibrahim Nsanzineza, Dmytro Dubyna, C. W. Sandbo Chang, Franco Nori, C.M. Wilson</p>
            <p>The generation of entangled photons through Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC) is a critical resource for many key experiments and technologies in the domain of quantum optics. Historically, SPDC was limited to the generation of photon pairs. However, the use of the strong nonlinearities in circuit quantum electrodynamics has recently enabled the observation of Three-Photon SPDC (3P-SPDC). Despite great interest in the entanglement structure of the resultant states, entanglement between photon triplets produced by a 3P-SPDC source has still has not been confirmed. Here, we report on the observation of genuine tripartite non-Gaussian entanglement in the steady-state output field of a 3P-SPDC source consisting of a superconducting parametric cavity coupled to a transmission line. We study this non-Gaussian tripartite entanglement using an entanglement witness built from three-mode correlation functions, and observe a maximum violation of the bound by 23 standard deviations of the statistical noise. Furthermore, we find strong agreement between the observed and the analytically predicted scaling of the entanglement witness. We then explore the impact of the temporal function used to define the photon mode on the observed value of the entanglement witness.</p>

            <h2>Photoswitchable radicals as reporter spins for quantum sensing with spin defects in diamond</h2>

            <p>The rapid decay of target signal strength with distance from the sensor presents a key challenge in nanoscale magnetic sensing with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, limiting both sensitivity and spatial resolution. Here we introduce a strategy to overcome this limitation by using radical anions formed from rhodamine-derived dyes as reporter spins localized to the diamond surface. These radicals, generated through photoreduction, are optically identifiable and stable on timescales exceeding an hour. We experimentally demonstrate their coherent manipulation and detection using single, shallow NV centers for readout. We observe heterogeneity in the local magnetic environments of the photoactivated spins from site to site, likely due to variations in inter-radical couplings across our measurements. Looking forward, our approach enables correlative nanoscale magnetic and optical imaging, and opens new pathways toward single-molecule magnetic resonance studies.</p>

            <h2>AC magnetometry in the strong drive regime with NV centers in diamond</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Katrijn Everaert, Saipriya Satyajit, Jiashen Tang, Zechuan Yin, Xiechen Zheng, Jner Tzern Oon, Connor A. Hart, John W. Blanchard, Ronald L. Walsworth</p>
            <p>Magnetic response measurements in the presence of AC drive fields provide critical insight into the properties of magnetic and conductive materials, such as phase transitions in two-dimensional van der Waals magnets, the heating efficiency of magnetic nanoparticles in biological environments, and the integrity of metals in eddy current testing. Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are a commonly-used platform for such studies, due to their high spatial resolution and sensitivity, but are typically limited to weak-drive conditions, i.e., AC drive fields well below the NV microwave (MW) pulse Rabi strength. Once the AC drive field grows comparable to or larger than the Rabi strength, the induced MW pulse detuning suppresses NV sensitivity to the out-of-phase magnetic response, which encodes dissipation and conductivity in materials of interest. Here, we introduce a phase modulation protocol that cancels MW pulse detuning to leading order, and extends NV AC magnetometry into the strong drive field regime. The protocol, termed SIPHT (Signal Isolation through PHase Tuning), is experimentally demonstrated using an NV ensemble. By directly comparing SIPHT to the conventional Hahn echo AC sensing protocol, we quantify the preservation of NV magnetometry contrast for an out-of-phase signal. We further showcase SIPHT by detecting eddy current-induced magnetic fields from Cu, Al, and Ti samples, with the measured response field phase delays reflecting their distinct conductivities. SIPHT extends NV AC magnetometry to regimes inaccessible to standard dynamical decoupling measurement protocols, unlocking novel utility, e.g., in the study of magnetic hyperthermia and nondestructive testing of conductors.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Regression Theory and Efficient Computation of Response Functions for Non-Markovian Open Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiantao Li, Chunhao Wang</p>
            <p>Linear response functions are a cornerstone concept in physics as they enable efficient estimation of many dynamical properties. In addition to predicting dynamics of observables under perturbations without resimulating the system, these response functions lead to electric conductivity, magnetic susceptibility, dielectric constants, etc. Estimating two-time correlation functions is a key ingredient of measuring linear response functions. However, for open quantum systems, simulating the reduced density operator with a quantum master equation only yields \emph{one-point} observables and is insufficient for this task. In this paper, we develop a memoryless, system-only formulation of two-point correlations for open quantum systems that extends the standard quantum regression theorem (QRT) beyond the Markov limit. We further incorporate the spectral property of the bath and express the time propagators in the response function as the memoryless generators in Lindblad-type forms. The resulting expressions recast the total response function into evolutions generated by time-dependent Hamiltonian and Lindblad primitives together with the more challenging propagation of commutators and anti-commutators. In addition to the derivation of the new QRT, we present quantum algorithms for these primitives and obtain an estimator for two-time correlations whose cost scales poly-logarithmically in the system dimension and $1/\epsilon^{1.25}$ in the target accuracy $\epsilon$. The framework removes the separability (Born-Markov) assumption and offers a pathway to efficient computation of nonequilibrium properties from open quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>A general dark-state theory for arbitrary multilevel quantum systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xuan Zhao, Le-Man Kuang, Jie-Qiao Liao</p>
            <p>The dark-state effect, caused by destructive quantum interference, is an important physical effect in atomic physics and quantum optics. It not only deepens the understanding of light-atom interactions, but also has wide application in quantum physics and quantum information. Therefore, how to efficiently and conveniently determine the number and form of the dark states in multilevel quantum systems with complex transitions is an important and interesting topic in this field. In this work, we present a general theory for determining the dark states in multilevel quantum systems with any coupling configuration using the arrowhead-matrix method. To confirm the dark states in a multilevel system, we first define the upper- and lower-state subspaces, and then diagonalize the Hamiltonians restricted within the two subspaces to obtain the dressed upper and lower states. By further expressing the transitions between the dressed upper and lower states, we can map the multilevel system to a bipartite-graph network, in which the nodes and links are acted by the dressed states and transitions, respectively. Based on the coupling configurations of the network, we can determine the lower dark states with respect to the upper-state subspace. As examples, we analyze the dark states in three-, four-, and five-level quantum systems, for all possible configurations through the classification of the numbers of upper and lower states. Further, we extend the framework to multilevel quantum systems and discuss the existence of dark states in some typical configurations. We also recover the results of the dark-state polaritons in driven three-level systems with the arrowhead-matrix method. Our theory paves the way for manipulating and utilizing the dark states of multilevel quantum systems in modern quantum science and technology.</p>

            <h2>Quantum interference between autonomous dissimilar quantum light sources for hybrid quantum networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kyu-Young Kim, Heewoo Kim, Dong Hyun Park, Jinhyuk Bea, Gyeongmin Ju, Suk In Park, Jin Dong Song, Je-Hyung Kim, Han Seb Moon</p>
            <p>Hybrid quantum systems play a crucial role in advancing scalable and versatile quantum networks as they combine the strengths of different quantum platforms. An important challenge for the development of hybrid quantum networks lies in interfacing heterogeneous quantum nodes and distributing entanglement among them. Single photons emitted from these dissimilar quantum nodes typically show distinct spectral and temporal properties. Therefore, they necessitate spectral filtering and temporal synchronization, which introduce significant photon losses and require additional resources. In this work, we successfully generate indistinguishable photons from two distinct quantum systems of a warm atomic ensemble and a solid-state quantum dot. Remarkably, quantum interference between dissimilar sources is achieved without additional spectral filtering and time synchronization, which enables autonomous quantum nodes for a hybrid quantum network. 133Cs atomic ensemble can efficiently generate heralded single photons at the wavelength of 917 nm of the 6P_(3/2)-6D_(5/2) transition, while the single photons emitted from an InAs/GaAs quantum dot can be tuned to match the 133Cs transition wavelength. Our dense warm atomic ensemble and cavity-coupled quantum dot can efficiently generate bright and resonant single photons at detection rates approaching MHz, respectively. More importantly, these single photons exhibit inherent spectral similarities not only in the wavelength but also in the spectral linewidth, achieving a high spectral overlap of 0.92. Such intrinsic compatibility between dissimilar quantum sources is essential to leverage the advantages of different quantum platforms, paving the way toward a large-scale and functional hybrid quantum network.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement dynamics and performance of two-qubit gates for superconducting qubits under non-Markovian effects</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kiyoto Nakamura, Joachim Ankerhold</p>
            <p>Within a numerically exact simulation technique, the dissipative dynamics of a two-qubit architecture is considered in which each qubit couples to its individual noise source (reservoir). The goal is to reveal the role of subtle qubit-reservoir correlations including non-Markovian processes as a prerequisite to guide further improvements of quantum computing devices. This paper addresses the following three topics. First, we examine the validity of the rotating wave approximation imposed previously on the qubit-reservoir coupling with respect to the disentanglement dynamics. Second, generation of the entanglement as well as destruction are analyzed by monitoring the reduced dynamics during and after application of a $\sqrt{\mbox{iSWAP}^\dagger}$ gate, also focusing on memory effects caused by reservoirs. Finally, the performance of a Hadamard + CNOT sequence is analyzed for different gate decomposition schemes. In all three cases, various types of noise sources and qubit parameters are considered.</p>

            <h2>Fast and Robust Non-Adiabatic Holonomic Gates for Qutrit Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jie Lu, Jie-Dong Huang, Yang Qian, Ying Yan</p>
            <p>Motivated by shortcuts to adiabaticity, we develop a framework that combines inverse engineering with time-dependent perturbation theory to implement non-adiabatic holonomic quantum computing (NHQC) in qutrit systems under realistic error sources. We derive analytical conditions that suppress second-order Rabi errors through tailored pulse parameters and eliminate detuning errors via a compensation pulse. Our analysis reveals the cancellation from the compensation pulse, which ensures robust gate operations. The proposed approach, broadly applicable to superconducting qubits, trapped ions, and atom-based platforms, provides a pathway to fast and error-resilient holonomic gates, potentially for scalable quantum computing.</p>

            <h2>Quantumness and its hierarchies in PT-symmetric down-conversion models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jan Pe≈ôina Jr., Karol Bartkiewicz, Grzegorz Chimczak, Anna Kowalewska-Kudlaszyk, Adam Miranowicz, Joanna K. Kalaga, Wies≈Çaw Leonski</p>
            <p>We investigate the hierarchy of quantum correlations in a quadratic bosonic parity-time-symmetric system (PTSS) featuring distinct dissipation and amplification channels. The hierarchy includes global nonclassicality, entanglement, asymmetric quantum steering, and Bell nonlocality. We elucidate the interplay between the system physical nonlinearity -- which serves as a source of quantumness -- and the specific dynamics of bosonic PTSSs, which are qualitatively influenced by their damping and amplification characteristics. Using a set of quantifiers -- including local and global nonclassicality depths, negativity, steering parameters, and the Bell parameter -- we demonstrate that the standard PTSS typically exhibits weaker quantumness than its counterparts affected solely by damping or solely by amplification. Both the maximum values attained by these quantifiers and the speed and duration of their generation are generally lower in the standard PTSS. A comparative analysis of three two-mode PTSSs -- standard, passive, and active -- with identical eigenvectors and real parts of eigenfrequencies, but differing in their damping and amplification strengths, reveals the crucial role of quantum fluctuations associated with gain and loss. Among them, the passive PTSS yields the most strongly nonclassical states. Nevertheless, under suitable conditions, the standard PTSS can also generate highly nonclassical states. The supremacy of the passive PTSS is further supported by its fundamental advantages in practical realizations.</p>

            <h2>Scalable accuracy gains from postselection in quantum error correcting codes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongkun Chen, Daohong Xu, Grace M. Sommers, David A. Huse, Jeff D. Thompson, Sarang Gopalakrishnan</p>
            <p>Decoding stabilizer codes such as the surface and toric codes involves evaluating free-energy differences in a disordered statistical mechanics model, in which the randomness comes from the observed pattern of error syndromes. We study the statistical distribution of logical failure rates across observed syndromes in the toric code, and show that, within the coding phase, logical failures are predominantly caused by exponentially unlikely syndromes. Therefore, postselecting on not seeing these exponentially unlikely syndrome patterns offers a scalable accuracy gain. In general, the logical error rate can be suppressed from $p_f$ to $p_f^b$, where $b \geq 2$ in general; in the specific case of the toric code with perfect syndrome measurements, we find numerically that $b = 3.1(1)$. Our arguments apply to general topological stabilizer codes, and can be extended to more general settings as long as the decoding failure probability obeys a large deviation principle.</p>

            <h2>Exact Quench Dynamics from Thermal Pure Quantum States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hui-Huang Chen</p>
            <p>We present an exact solution for a quantum quench in an integrable system that reveals a new, coherent pathway to thermalization. In chaotic systems, thermalization is understood via the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), which implies that a quench from a thermal pure quantum (TPQ) state should exhibit trivial dynamics. In contrast, integrable systems are expected to retain memory of their initial conditions in a non-thermal generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE). We show that a quench from a TPQ state in the integrable spin-1/2 XX chain defies both expectations. The system thermalizes to a canonical Gibbs ensemble, yet the entanglement dynamics are highly non-trivial, exhibiting a "double plateau" structure. We solve this process exactly using techniques in two-dimensional (2D) conformal field theories (CFT), an exact numerical method based on the matrix Riccati equation, and an asymptotically exact quasiparticle picture. We prove that the non-trivial dynamics are the macroscopic signature of the coherent dephasing of the initial state's anomalous pairing correlations.</p>

            <p>We explore the molecular beam epitaxy synthesis of superconducting aluminum thin films grown on c-plane sapphire substrates at cryogenic temperatures of 6 K and compare their behavior with films synthesized at room temperature. We demonstrate that cryogenic growth increases structural disorder, producing crystalline grains that modify the optical, electrical, and superconducting properties of aluminum. We observe that cryogenic deposition changes the color of aluminum from fully reflective to yellow and correlate the pseudo-dielectric function and reflectance with structural changes in the film. We find that smaller grain sizes enhance the superconductivity of aluminum, increasing its critical temperature and critical field. We then estimate the superconducting gap and coherence length of Cooper pairs in aluminum in the presence of disorder. Finally, we fabricate superconducting microwave resonators on these films and find that, independently of the growth temperature, the system is dominated by two-level system loss with similar quality factors in the high and low power regimes. We further measure a higher kinetic inductance in the cryogenically grown films.</p>

            <p>Quantum simulations of many-body systems are among the most promising applications of quantum computers. In particular, models based on strongly-correlated fermions are central to our understanding of quantum chemistry and materials problems, and can lead to exotic, topological phases of matter. However, due to the non-local nature of fermions, such models are challenging to simulate with qubit devices. Here we realize a digital quantum simulation architecture for two-dimensional fermionic systems based on reconfigurable atom arrays. We utilize a fermion-to-qubit mapping based on Kitaev's model on a honeycomb lattice, in which fermionic statistics are encoded using long-range entangled states. We prepare these states efficiently using measurement and feedforward, realize subsequent fermionic evolution through Floquet engineering with tunable entangling gates interspersed with atom rearrangement, and improve results with built-in error detection. Leveraging this fermion description of the Kitaev spin model, we efficiently prepare topological states across its complex phase diagram and verify the non-Abelian spin liquid phase by evaluating an odd Chern number. We further explore this two-dimensional fermion system by realizing tunable dynamics and directly probing fermion exchange statistics. Finally, we simulate strong interactions and study dynamics of the Fermi-Hubbard model on a square lattice. These results pave the way for digital quantum simulations of complex fermionic systems for materials science, chemistry, and high-energy physics.</p>

            <h2>Efficient Magic State Cultivation on the Surface Code</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yotam Vaknin, Shoham Jacoby, Arne Grimsmo, Alex Retzker</p>
            <p>Magic state cultivation is a newly proposed protocol that represents the state of the art in magic state generation. It uses the transversality of the $H_{XY}$ gate on the 2D triangular color-code, together with a novel grafting mechanism to transform the color-code into a matchable code with minimal overhead. Still, the resulting code has a longer cycle time and some high weight stabilizers. Here, we introduce three new cultivation protocols, each yielding a different magic state. These protocols avoid grafting by exploiting transversal operations on the surface code using non-local connectivity, allowing for a much lower post-selection rates in the expansion process. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that our protocol achieves state-of-the-art infidelities and acceptance rates for magic state generation, on par with another recent proposal on the $\mathbb{RP}^2$ code, while still preserving the local geometry of the surface code. Moreover, in platforms such as cold atoms and trapped ions, where idle error rates are lower than two-qubit gate errors, we demonstrate that cultivation exhibits an even greater advantage, yielding an additional order-of-magnitude reduction in resource requirements. Lastly, we analyze the effect of erasure qubits on cultivation and show that \emph{algorithmically-relevant} infidelities can be achieved using only 9 erasure qubits on a distance-2 surface code with a single cultivation round.</p>

            <h2>Optomagnonic continuous-variable quantum teleportation enhanced by non-Gaussian distillation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zi-Xu Lu, Xuan Zuo, Zhi-Yuan Fan, Jie Li</p>
            <p>The capability of magnons to coherently couple with various quantum systems makes them an ideal candidate to build hybrid quantum systems. The optomagnonic coupling is essential for constructing a hybrid magnonic quantum network, as the transmission of quantum information among remote quantum nodes must be accomplished using light rather than microwave field. Here we provide an optomagnonic continuous-variable quantum teleportation protocol, which enables the transfer of an input optical state to a remote magnon mode. To overcome the currently relatively weak coupling in the experiment, we introduce non-Gaussian distillation operations to enhance the optomagnonic entanglement and thus the fidelity of the teleportation. An auxiliary microwave cavity is adopted to realize the non-Gaussian and displacement operations on magnons. We show that a series of optical states, such as coherent, single-photon, squeezed and cat states, can be teleported to the magnon mode. The work provides guidance for the experimental realization of magnonic quantum repeaters and quantum networks and a new route to prepare diverse magnonic quantum states exploiting the photon-to-magnon quantum teleportation.</p>

            <h2>Finite temperature dopant-induced spin reorganization explored via tensor networks in the two-dimensional $t$-$J$ model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yintai Zhang, Aritra Sinha, Marek M. Rams, Jacek Dziarmaga</p>
            <p>Doped Mott insulators host intertwined spin-charge phenomena that evolve with temperature and can culminate in stripe order or superconductivity at low temperatures. The two-dimensional $t$-$J$ model captures this interplay yet finite-temperature, infinite-size calculations remain difficult. Using purification represented by a tensor network - an infinite projected entangled-pair state (iPEPS) ansatz - we simulate the $t$-$J$ model at finite temperature directly in the thermodynamic limit, reaching temperatures down to one tenth of the hopping rate and hole concentrations up to one quarter of the lattice sites. Beyond specific heat, uniform susceptibility, and compressibility, we introduce dopant-conditioned multi-point correlators that map how holes reshape local exchange. Nearest-neighbor hole pairs produce a strong cooperative response that reinforces antiferromagnetism on the adjacent parallel bonds, and single holes weaken nearby antiferromagnetic bonds; d-wave pairing correlations remain short-ranged over the same window. These results provide experiment-compatible thermodynamic-limit benchmarks and establish dopant-conditioned correlators as incisive probes of short-range spin-texture reorganization at finite temperature.</p>

            <h2>Mechanisms for Quantum Advantage in Global Optimization of Nonconvex Functions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dylan Herman, Guneykan Ozgul, Anuj Apte, Junhyung Lyle Kim, Anupam Prakash, Jiayu Shen, Shouvanik Chakrabarti</p>
            <p>We present new theoretical mechanisms for quantum speedup in the global optimization of nonconvex functions, expanding the scope of quantum advantage beyond traditional tunneling-based explanations. As our main building-block, we demonstrate a rigorous correspondence between the spectral properties of Schr√∂dinger operators and the mixing times of classical Langevin diffusion. This correspondence motivates a mechanism for separation on functions with unique global minimum: while quantum algorithms operate on the original potential, classical diffusions correspond to a Schr√∂dinger operators with a WKB potential having nearly degenerate global minima. We formalize these ideas by proving that a real-space adiabatic quantum algorithm (RsAA) achieves provably polynomial-time optimization for broad families of nonconvex functions. First, for block-separable functions, we show that RsAA maintains polynomial runtime while known off-the-shelf algorithms require exponential time and structure-aware algorithms exhibit arbitrarily large polynomial runtimes. These results leverage novel non-asymptotic results in semiclassical analysis. Second, we use recent advances in the theory of intrinsic hypercontractivity to demonstrate polynomial runtimes for RsAA on appropriately perturbed strongly convex functions that lack global structure, while off-the-shelf algorithms remain exponentially bottlenecked. In contrast to prior works based on quantum tunneling, these separations do not depend on the geometry of barriers between local minima. Our theoretical claims about classical algorithm runtimes are supported by rigorous analysis and comprehensive numerical benchmarking. These findings establish a rigorous theoretical foundation for quantum advantage in continuous optimization and open new research directions connecting quantum algorithms, stochastic processes, and semiclassical analysis.</p>

            <h2>Quantum feature-map learning with reduced resource overhead</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonas J√§ger, Philipp Els√§sser, Elham Torabian</p>
            <p>Current quantum computers require algorithms that use limited resources economically. In quantum machine learning, success hinges on quantum feature maps, which embed classical data into the state space of qubits. We introduce Quantum Feature-Map Learning via Analytic Iterative Reconstructions (Q-FLAIR), an algorithm that reduces quantum resource overhead in iterative feature-map circuit construction. It shifts workloads to a classical computer via partial analytic reconstructions of the quantum model, using only a few evaluations. For each probed gate addition to the ansatz, the simultaneous selection and optimization of the data feature and weight parameter is then entirely classical. Integrated into quantum neural network and quantum kernel support vector classifiers, Q-FLAIR shows state-of-the-art benchmark performance. Since resource overhead decouples from feature dimension, we train a quantum model on a real IBM device in only four hours, surpassing 90% accuracy on the full-resolution MNIST dataset (784 features, digits 3 vs 5). Such results were previously unattainable, as the feature dimension prohibitively drives hardware demands for fixed and search costs for adaptive ans√§tze. By rethinking feature-map learning beyond black-box optimization, this work takes a concrete step toward enabling quantum machine learning for real-world problems and near-term quantum computers.</p>

            <p>Precision sensing and imaging of weak static magnetic fields are crucial for a variety of emerging nanoscale applications. While nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond provide exceptional AC magnetic field sensitivity with nanoscale spatial resolution, their sensitivity to static (DC) magnetic fields is fundamentally limited by the short dephasing time (T2*) due to spin-spin interactions. In this work, we present a novel hybrid sensing approach that integrates a soft ferromagnetic microwire with a single near-surface NV center to amplify its response to external static magnetic fields. This hybrid configuration achieves a DC magnetic field sensitivity of 63 nT/sqrt(Hz) for a single NV center - about 500 times greater than conventional inhomogeneous broadening- or T2*-limited magnetometry, with potential for further enhancement. The compact and highly sensitive nature of this sensor opens new opportunities for quantum sensing applications involving the detection of static or slowly varying magnetic fields across diverse scientific and technological domains.</p>

            <p>Partial differential equations (PDEs) are central to computational electromagnetics (CEM) and photonic design, but classical solvers face high costs for large or complex structures. Quantum Hamiltonian simulation provides a framework to encode PDEs into unitary time evolution and has potential for scalable electromagnetic analysis. We formulate Maxwell's equations in the potential representation and embed governing equations, boundary conditions, and observables consistently into Hamiltonian form. A key bottleneck is the exponential growth of Hamiltonian terms for complex geometries; we examine this issue and show that logical compression can substantially mitigate it, especially for periodic or symmetric structures. As a proof of concept, we simulate optical wave propagation through a metalens and illustrate that the method can capture wavefront shaping and focusing behavior, suggesting its applicability to design optimization tasks. This work highlights the feasibility of Hamiltonian-based quantum simulation for photonic systems and identifies structural conditions favorable for efficient execution.</p>

            <p>The diamond sensor has emerged as a promising platform for quantum sensing, enabling the estimation of physical quantities -- such as microwave~(MW) field -- with precision unattainable by classical counterpart. However, traditional diamond sensors suffer severe precision degradation when the signal MW is not resonant with the sensor transition frequency. Here, we propose and demonstrate a Floquet diamond sensor~(FDS) for high-precision off-resonant MW amplitude sensing without attenuating the strength of the signal MW. The periodic driven field effectively induces an quasi-energy shift that matches the off-resonant MW frequency. The measurement precision of FDS is characterized by quantum Fisher information, which approaches the ultimate precision -- Heisenberg limit -- within the coherent time. Furthermore, the FDS exhibits robust tolerance to practical control errors and is compatible with dynamical coupling protocol, enabling a robust and high-sensitivity magnetic sensing. Our results confirm the quantum advantage of quantum sensing and provide a practical technology for high-precision off-resonant MW sensing.</p>

            <p>Broadband nonlinear optical devices play a critical role in both classical and quantum optics. Here, we design and fabricate a 6.82-mm-long step-chirped periodically poled lithium niobate~(CPPLN) waveguide on lithium niobate on insulator, which enables quasi-phase matching over a broad bandwidth for second-harmonic generation~(SHG) and spontaneous parametric down-conversion~(SPDC). The SHG achieves an average efficiency of 54.4\%/W/cm$^2$ over the first-harmonic wavelength range of 1510~nm-1620~nm, paving the way for realizing SPDC across a wide range of pump wavelengths. For SPDC, by tuning the pump wavelength to 775~nm, 780~nm, and 785~nm, we achieve broadband photon-pair generation with a maximum full bandwidth and brightness up to 99~THz~(846~nm) and 20~GHz/mW/nm, respectively. Our findings provide an efficient and experiment-friendly approach for generating broadband photon pairs, which holds significant promise for advancing applications in quantum metrology.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xu-Jie Peng, Ling-Xuan Kong, He Lu</p>
            <p>The polarization-entangled photon source (PEPS) at non-degenerated wavelengths is pivotal to connect quantum systems working at different wavelengths, with the assistance of quantum teleportation. Here, a compact Sagnac-type photon source is designed and demonstrated, in which two photons with wavelengths at 810 and 1550~nm are highly entangled in polarization degree of freedom. The two photons are generated from a periodically poled lithium niobate crystal pumped with a 532~nm continuous-wave laser, via type-0 nondegenerate spontaneous parametric down-conversion. The polarization of three lights is rotated by a single periscope, which makes the Sagnac interferometer compact and stable. The generated two photons are with high brightness of $3\times10^4$ pairs/s/mW, which are highly entangled with fidelity of $0.985\pm0.002$. The entanglement is verified by violating the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality with $\mathcal S =2.756\pm0.007$. Finally, teleportation is demonstrated with this nondegenerate source, in which photonic states at 810~nm is teleported to 1550~nm with fidelity of $0.955\pm0.003$.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samuel B. Steakley, Elia Zanoni, Carlo Maria Scandolo</p>
            <p>Quantum resources exist in a hierarchy of multiple levels. At order zero, quantum states are transformed by linear maps (channels, or gates) in order to perform computations or simulate other states. At order one, gates and channels are transformed by linear maps (superchannels) in order to simulate other gates. To develop a full hierarchy of quantum resources, beyond those first two orders, and to account for the fact that quantum protocols can interconvert resources of different orders, we need a theoretical framework that addresses all orders in a uniform manner. We introduce a framework based on a system of types, which label the different kinds of objects that are present at different orders. We equip the framework with a parallel product operation that modifies and generalizes the tensor product so as to be operationally meaningful for maps of distinct and arbitrary orders. Finally, we introduce a family of convex cones that generalize the notion of complete positivity to all orders, with the aim of characterizing the objects that are physically admissible, facilitating an operational treatment of quantum objects at any order.</p>

We also showed that this improvement is possible in both SID and HD schemes. In addition, to discuss the maximum sensitivity achieved by our proposed model, we have calculated the quantum Cram√©r-Rao bound (QCRB) within the framework and found that our proposed model approaches the QCRB. Therefore, we believe that our findings offer a promising new approach to improve phase sensitivity through photon recycling.</p>

            <h2>Metasurface-Based Dual-Basis Polarization Beam Splitter for efficient entanglement witnessing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohamed ElKabbash</p>
            <p>Entanglement witnessing is essential for quantum technologies such as computing, key distribution, and networking. Conventional bulk-optics methods require sequential reconfiguration across multiple polarization bases, limiting efficiency and scalability. We propose a metasurface-based analyzer that performs dual-basis (\sigma_z and \sigma_y) projections simultaneously by mapping them to orthogonal spatial modes. This allows direct access to the commuting two-photon correlators \langle \sigma_z \otimes \sigma_z \rangle and \langle \sigma_y \otimes \sigma_y \rangle required for entanglement witnessing. The metasurface design employs meta-atoms engineered to impart independent linear and circular phase delays through anisotropy and geometric control, resulting in polarization-dependent beam deflection that separates H/V and R/L components. This approach halves the measurement overhead compared to sequential analysis while offering a compact, integrable platform for chip-scale quantum photonics. The proposed scheme provides a path toward efficient entanglement verification with applications in quantum key distribution, quantum repeaters, and scalable quantum networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ilyoung Jung, Frank G. Schroer, Philip Richerme</p>
            <p>Laser-driven operations are a common approach for engineering one- and two-qubit gates in trapped-ion arrays. Measuring key parameters of these lasers, such as beam sizes, intensities, and polarizations, is central to predicting and optimizing gate speeds and stability. Unfortunately, it is challenging to accurately measure these properties at the ion location within an ultra-high vacuum chamber. Here, we demonstrate how the ions themselves may be used as sensors to directly characterize the laser beams needed for quantum gate operations. Making use of the four-photon Stark Shift effect in $^{171}$Yb$^+$ ions, we measure the profiles, alignments, and polarizations of the lasers driving counter-propagating Raman transitions. We then show that optimizing the parameters of each laser individually leads to higher-speed Raman-driven gates with smaller susceptibility to errors. Our approach demonstrates the capability of trapped ions to probe their local environments and to provide useful feedback for improving system performance.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yexiong Zeng, Fernando Quijandr√≠a, Clemens Gneiting, Franco Nori</p>
            <p>Bosonic codes, leveraging infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces for redundancy, offer great potential for encoding quantum information. However, the realization of a practical continuous-variable bosonic code that can simultaneously correct both single-photon loss and dephasing errors remains elusive, primarily due to the absence of exactly orthogonal codewords and the lack of an experiment-friendly state preparation scheme. Here, we propose a code based on the superposition of squeezed Fock states with an error-correcting capability that scales as $\propto\exp(-7r)$, where $r$ is the squeezing level. The codewords remain orthogonal at all squeezing levels. The Pauli-X operator acts as a rotation in phase space is an error-transparent gate, preventing correctable errors from propagating outside the code space during logical operations. In particular, this code achieves high-precision error correction for both single-photon loss and dephasing, even at moderate squeezing levels. Building on this code, we develop quantum error correction schemes that exceed the break-even threshold, supported by analytical derivations of all necessary quantum gates. Our code offers a competitive alternative to previous encodings for quantum computation using continuous bosonic qubits.</p>

The detection is based on balanced homodyne detectors on the same photonic chip with a bandwidth of up to 12.5 GHz, which allows room-temperature operation. A loss-equivalent analysis method compensates for optical losses and system noises. Experimental results quantify an entangled state fidelity of 92% in quantum state tomography and a Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) violation lower bound of 2.59. These results establish a viable path toward fully integrated, high-bandwidth, room-temperature quantum photonic systems, with potential applications in on-chip quantum optics and quantum random number generation.</p>

            <p>Three-qubit gates are highly beneficial operations in quantum computing, enabling compact implementations of quantum algorithms and efficient generation of multipartite entangled states. However, realizing such gates with high fidelity remains challenging due to crosstalk, complex control requirements, and the overhead of parametric or tunable couplers. In this work, we propose and analyze the implementation of fast, high-fidelity three-qubit gates using giant atoms--artificial atoms coupled to a waveguide at multiple spatially separated points. By leveraging interference effects intrinsic to the giant-atom architecture, we demonstrate that native three-qubit gates, such as the controlled-CZ-SWAP (CCZS) and the dual-iSWAP (DIV), can be realized through simple frequency tuning, without the need for complex pulse shaping or additional hardware. We evaluate gate performance under realistic decoherence and show that fidelities exceeding 99.5% are achievable with current experimental parameters in superconducting circuits. As an application, we present a scalable protocol for preparing three- and five-qubit GHZ states using minimal gate depth, achieving high state fidelity within sub-300ns timescales. Our results position giant-atom systems as a promising platform for entangled-state preparation and low-depth quantum circuit design in near-term quantum computers and quantum simulators.</p>

            <p>Quantum entanglement and squeezing associated with the motions of massive mechanical oscillators play an essential role in both fundamental science and emerging quantum technologies, yet realizing such macroscopic nonclassical states remains a formidable challenge. In this paper, we investigate how to achieve strong optomechanical entanglement and mechanical squeezing in a membrane-embedded cavity optomechanical system incorporating a coherent feedback loop, where the membrane interacts with the cavity mode through both linear and quadratic optomechanical couplings. This hybrid optomechanical architecture offers a flexible tunability of intrinsic system parameters, thus allowing the membrane to be stiffened or softened through tuning the sign of quadratic optomechanical coupling and the cavity decay rate to be reduced via feedback control. Exploiting these unique features, we demonstrate that optomechanical entanglement can be substantially enhanced with positive coupling sign and suitable feedback parameters, while strong mechanical squeezing beyond the 3dB limit is simultaneously achieved over a broad parameter range with negative coupling sign, reaching squeezing degree above 10dB under optimized conditions. Our proposal, establishing an all-optical method for generating highly entangled or squeezed states in cavity optomechanical systems, opens up a new route to explore macroscopic quantum effects and to advance quantum information processing.</p>

            <p>Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) is a leading tail-risk measure in finance, central to both regulatory and portfolio optimization frameworks. Classical estimation of CVaR and its gradients relies on Monte Carlo simulation, incurring $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ sample complexity to achieve $\epsilon$-accuracy. In this work, we design and analyze a quantum subgradient oracle for CVaR minimization based on amplitude estimation. Via a tripartite proposition, we show that CVaR subgradients can be estimated with $O(1/\epsilon)$ quantum queries, even when the Value-at-Risk (VaR) threshold itself must be estimated. We further quantify the propagation of estimation error from the VaR stage to CVaR gradients and derive convergence rates of stochastic projected subgradient descent using this oracle. Our analysis establishes a near-quadratic improvement in query complexity over classical Monte Carlo. Numerical experiments with simulated quantum circuits confirm the theoretical rates and illustrate robustness to threshold estimation noise. This constitutes the first rigorous complexity analysis of quantum subgradient methods for tail-risk minimization.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fuyuki Kitagawa, Ryo Nishimaki, Nikhil Pappu</p>
            <p>Secure key leasing (SKL) enables the holder of a secret key for a cryptographic function to temporarily lease the key using quantum information. Later, the recipient can produce a deletion certificate, which proves that they no longer have access to the secret key. The security guarantee ensures that even a malicious recipient cannot continue to evaluate the function, after producing a valid deletion certificate. Most prior work considers an adversarial recipient that obtains a single leased key, which is insufficient for many applications. In the more realistic collusion-resistant setting, security must hold even when polynomially many keys are leased (and subsequently deleted). However, achieving collusion-resistant SKL from standard assumptions remains poorly understood, especially for functionalities beyond decryption. We improve upon this situation by introducing new pathways for constructing collusion-resistant SKL. Our main contributions are as follows: - A generalization of quantum-secure collusion-resistant traitor tracing called multi-level traitor tracing (MLTT), and a compiler that transforms an MLTT scheme for a primitive X into a collusion-resistant SKL scheme for primitive X. - The first bounded collusion-resistant SKL scheme for PRFs, assuming LWE. - A compiler that upgrades any single-key secure SKL scheme for digital signatures into one with unbounded collusion-resistance, assuming OWFs. - A compiler that upgrades collusion-resistant SKL schemes with classical certificates to ones having verification-query resilience, assuming OWFs.</p>

We identify a non-Abelian contribution to the energy and entropy balances, without which these relations would be violated. The latter term can be controlled to enhance both work extraction and nonequilibrium currents compared to what is obtained in commuting thermodynamics.

            <p>We consider the problem of imaging two partially coherent sources and derive the ultimate quantum limits for estimating all relevant parameters, namely their separation, relative intensity, as well as their coherence factor. We show that the separation of the two sources can be super-resolved over the entire range of all other pertinent parameters (with the exception of fully coherent sources), with anti-correlated sources furnishing the largest possible gain in estimation precision, using a binary spatial mode demultiplexing measurement positioned at the center of intensity of the joint point spread function for the two sources. In the sub-Rayleigh limit, we show that both the relative intensity, as well as the real part of the coherence factor, can be optimally estimated by a simple boson counting measurement, making it possible to optimally estimate the separation, relative intensity and real coherence factor of the sources simultaneously. Within the same limit, we show that the imaging problem can be effectively reduced to one where all relevant parameters are encoded in the Bloch vector of a two-dimensional system. Using such a model we find that indirect estimation schemes, which attempt to extract estimates of the separation of the two sources by measuring the purity of the corresponding state of the two-level system, yield suboptimal estimation precision for all non-zero values of the coherence factor.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryotaro Honma, Tan Van Vu</p>
            <p>The thermodynamic uncertainty relation quantifies a trade-off between the relative fluctuations of trajectory currents and the thermodynamic cost, indicating that the current precision is fundamentally constrained by entropy production. In classical bipartite systems, it has been shown that information flow between subsystems can enhance the current precision alongside thermodynamic dissipation. In this study, we investigate how information flow, local dissipation, and quantum effects jointly constrain current fluctuations within a subsystem of interacting quantum systems. Unlike classical bipartite systems, quantum subsystems can exhibit simultaneous state changes and maintain quantum coherence, which fundamentally alters the precision-dissipation trade-off. For this general setting, we derive a quantum thermokinetic uncertainty relation for interacting multipartite systems, establishing a thermodynamic trade-off between current fluctuations, information flow, local dissipation, and quantum effects. Our analysis shows that, in addition to local dissipation, both information exchange and quantum coherence play essential roles in suppressing current fluctuations. These results have important implications for the performance of quantum thermal machines, such as information-thermodynamic engines and quantum clocks. We validate our theoretical findings through numerical simulations on two representative models: an autonomous quantum Maxwell's demon and a quantum clock. These results extend uncertainty relations to multipartite open quantum systems and elucidate the functional role of information flow in fluctuation suppression.</p>

In this paper, we examine the simple question of whether two distinct levels, each consisting of multiply degenerate sub-states, could serve as a practical quantum bit. We explore this idea using a well-characterized atomic system of the kind employed in several quantum computing implementations. We approximate the atom as a two-level system without degeneracy lifting in the magnetic quantum number while using the angular momentum addition rules to select the desired state transition. We find that, in the continuous presence of the field, the atom still undergoes Rabi oscillations, which are suitable for quantum gate construction. In addition, we compute the average fidelity in quantum gate performance for a single degenerate atom and postulate the required form of two-atom interaction to construct a controlled Z gate.</p>

            <p>The commutative depth model allows gates that commute with each other to be performed in parallel. We show how to compute Clifford operations in constant commutative depth more efficiently than was previously known. Bravyi, Maslov, and Nam [Phys. Rev. Lett. 129:230501, 2022] showed that every element of the Clifford group (on $n$ qubits) can be computed in commutative depth 23 and size $O(n^2)$. We show that the Prefix Sum problem can be computed in commutative depth 16 and size $O(n \log n)$, improving on the previous depth 18 and size $O(n^2)$ bounds. We also show that, for arbitrary Cliffords, the commutative depth bound can be reduced to 16. Finally, we show some lower bounds: that there exist Cliffords whose commutative depth is at least 4; and that there exist Cliffords for which any constant commutative depth circuit has size $\Omega(n^2)$.</p>

            <h2>Efficient Quantum Hermite Transform</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Siddhartha Jain, Vishnu Iyer, Rolando D. Somma, Ning Bao, Stephen P. Jordan</p>
            <p>We present a new primitive for quantum algorithms that implements a discrete Hermite transform efficiently, in time that depends logarithmically in both the dimension and the inverse of the allowable error. This transform, which maps basis states to states whose amplitudes are proportional to the Hermite functions, can be interpreted as the Gaussian analogue of the Fourier transform. Our algorithm is based on a method to exponentially fast forward the evolution of the quantum harmonic oscillator, which significantly improves over prior art. We apply this Hermite transform to give examples of provable quantum query advantage in property testing and learning. In particular, we show how to efficiently test the property of being close to a low- degree in the Hermite basis when inputs are sampled from the Gaussian distribution, and how to solve a Gaussian analogue of the Goldreich-Levin learning task efficiently. We also comment on other potential uses of this transform to simulating time dynamics of quantum systems in the continuum.</p>

            <h2>Leveraging Analog Neutral Atom Quantum Computers for Diversified Pricing in Hybrid Column Generation Frameworks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> C√©drick Perron, Yves B√©rub√©-Lauzi√®re, Victor Drouin-Touchette</p>
            <p>In this work, we develop new pulse designs and embedding strategies to improve the analog quantum subroutines of hybrid column generation (CG) algorithms based on neutral-atoms quantum computers (NAQCs). These strategies are designed to improve the quality and diversity of the samples generated. We apply these to an important combinatorial optimization (CO) problem in logistics, namely the fleet assignment. Depending on the instance tested, our quantum protocol has a performance that is either comparable or worse than the best classical method tested, both in terms of the number of iterations and final objective value. We identify the cause of these suboptimal solutions as a result of our quantum protocol often generating high-quality but degenerate samples. We address this limitation by introducing a greedy post-processing technique, Make\_Diff, which applies bit-wise modifications to degenerate samples in order to return a non-degenerate set. With this modification, our quantum protocol becomes competitive with an exact solver for the subproblem, all the while being resilient to state preparation and measurements (SPAM) errors. We also compare our CG scheme with a Gurobi solver and find that it performs better on over 50\% of our synthetic instances and that, despite Gurobi having a more extensive runtime. These improvements and benchmarks herald the potential of deploying hybrid CG schemes on NISQ devices for industrially relevant CO problems.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Filtering at Finite Temperature</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> John Gough</p>
            <p>We pose and solve the problem of quantum filtering based on continuous-in-time quadrature measurements (homodyning) for the case where the quantum process is in a thermal state. The standard construction of quantum filters involves the determination of the conditional expectation onto the von Neumann algebra generated by the measured observables with the non-demolition principle telling us to restrict the domain (the observables to be estimated) to the commutant of the algebra. The finite-temperature case, however, has additional structure: we use the Araki-Woods representation for the measured quadratures, but the Tomita-Takesaki theory tells us that there exists a separate, commuting representation and therefore the commutant will have a richer structure than encountered in the Fock vacuum case. We apply this to the question of quantum trajectories to the Davies-Fulling-Unruh model. Here, the two representations are interpreted as the fields in the right and left Rindler wedges.</p>

            <h2>Quantum walks through generalized graph composition</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arjan Cornelissen</p>
            <p>In this work, we generalize the recently-introduced graph composition framework to the non-boolean setting. A quantum algorithm in this framework is represented by a hypergraph, where each hyperedge is adjacent to multiple vertices. The input and output to the quantum algorithm is represented by a set of boundary vertices, and the hyperedges act like switches, connecting the input vertex to the output that the algorithm computes. Apart from generalizing the graph composition framework, our new proposed framework unifies the quantum divide and conquer framework, the decision-tree framework, and the unified quantum walk search framework. For the decision trees, we additionally construct a quantum algorithm from an improved weighting scheme in the non-boolean case. For quantum walk search, we show how our techniques naturally allow for amortization of the subroutines' costs. Previous work showed how one can speed up ``detection'' of marked vertices by amortizing the costs of the quantum walk. In this work, we extend these results to the setting of ``finding'' such marked vertices, albeit in some restricted settings. Along the way, we provide a novel analysis of irreducible, reversible Markov processes, by linear-algebraically connecting its effective resistance to the random walk operator. This significantly simplifies the algorithmic implementation of the quantum walk search algorithm, achieves an amortization speed-up for quantum walks over Johnson graphs, avoids the need for quantum fast-forwarding, and removes the log-factors from the query complexity statements.</p>

            <h2>Less is More: On Copy Complexity in Quantum Cryptography</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Prabhanjan Ananth, Eli Goldin</p>
            <p>Quantum cryptographic definitions are often sensitive to the number of copies of the cryptographic states revealed to an adversary. Making definitional changes to the number of copies accessible to an adversary can drastically affect various aspects including the computational hardness, feasibility, and applicability of the resulting cryptographic scheme. This phenomenon appears in many places in quantum cryptography, including quantum pseudorandomness and unclonable cryptography. To address this, we present a generic approach to boost single-copy security to multi-copy security and apply this approach to many settings. As a consequence, we obtain the following new results: -One-copy stretch pseudorandom state generators (under mild assumptions) imply the existence of t-copy stretch pseudorandom state generators, for any fixed polynomial t. -One-query pseudorandom unitaries with short keys (under mild assumptions) imply the existence of t-query pseudorandom unitaries with short keys, for any fixed polynomial t. -Assuming indistinguishability obfuscation and other standard cryptographic assumptions, there exist identical-copy secure unclonable primitives such as public-key quantum money and quantum copy-protection.</p>

            <h2>Correcting quantum errors using a classical code and one additional qubit</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tenzan Araki, Joseph F. Goodwin, Zhenyu Cai</p>
            <p>Classical error-correcting codes are powerful but incompatible with quantum noise, which includes both bit-flips and phase-flips. We introduce Hadamard-based Virtual Error Correction (H-VEC), a protocol that empowers any classical bit-flip code to correct arbitrary Pauli noise with the addition of only a single ancilla qubit and two layers of controlled-Hadamard gates. Through classical post-processing, H-VEC virtually filters the error channel, projecting the noise into pure Y-type errors that are subsequently corrected using the classical code's native decoding algorithm. We demonstrate this by applying H-VEC to the classical repetition code. Under a code-capacity noise model, the resulting protocol not only provides full quantum protection but also achieves an exponentially stronger error suppression (in distance) than the original classical code, and even larger improvements over the surface code while using much fewer qubits, simpler checks and straight-forward decoding. H-VEC comes with a sampling overhead due to its post-processing nature. It represents a new hybrid quantum error correction and mitigation framework that redefines the trade-offs between physical hardware requirements and classical processing for error suppression.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bruno Cavalar, Eli Goldin, Matthew Gray, Taiga Hiroka, Tomoyuki Morimae</p>
            <p>One of the most fundamental problems in the field of hypothesis testing is the identity testing problem: whether samples from some unknown distribution $\mathcal{G}$ are actually from some explicit distribution $\mathcal{D}$. It is known that when the distribution $\mathcal{D}$ has support $[N]$, the optimal sample complexity for the identity testing problem is roughly $O(\sqrt{N})$. However, many distributions of interest, including those which can be sampled efficiently, have exponential support size, and therefore the optimal identity tester also requires exponential samples. In this paper, we bypass this lower bound by considering restricted settings. The above $O(\sqrt{N})$ sample complexity identity tester is constructed so that it is not fooled by any (even inefficiently-sampled) distributions. However, in most applications, the distributions under consideration are efficiently sampleable, and therefore it is enough to consider only identity testers that are not fooled by efficiently-sampled distributions. In that case, we can focus on efficient verification with efficient identity testers. We investigate relations between efficient verifications of classical/quantum distributions and classical/quantum cryptography, and show the following results: (i) Every quantumly samplable distribution is verifiable with a $\mathbf{P^{PP}}$ algorithm. (ii) If one-way functions exist, then no sufficiently random classically samplable distribution is efficiently verifiable. (iii) If one-way functions do not exist, then every classically samplable distribution is efficiently verifiable. (iv) If QEFID pairs exist, then there exists a quantumly samplable distribution which is not efficiently verifiable. (v) If one-way puzzles do not exist, then it is possible to verify sampling-based quantum advantage with a efficient quantum computer.</p>

            <h2>The role of entropy production and thermodynamic uncertainty relations in the thermalization of open quantum systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> √Ålvaro Tejero</p>
            <p>The asymmetry between heating and cooling in open quantum systems is a hallmark of nonequilibrium dynamics, yet its thermodynamic origin has remained unclear. Here, we investigate the thermalization of a quantum system weakly coupled to a thermal bath, focusing on the entropy production rate and the quantum thermokinetic uncertainty relation (TKUR). We derive an analytical expression for the entropy production rate, showing that heating begins with a higher entropy production, which drives faster thermalization than cooling. The quantum TKUR links this asymmetry to heat current fluctuations, demonstrating that larger entropy production suppresses fluctuations, making heating more stable than cooling. Our results reveal the thermodynamic basis of asymmetric thermalization and highlight uncertainty relations as key to nonequilibrium quantum dynamics.</p>

            <p>The quantum control of spin-correlated radical pairs (SCRPs) holds promise for the targeted manipulation of magnetic field effects, with potential applications ranging from the design of noise-resilient quantum information processors to genetically encodable quantum sensors. However, achieving precise handles over the intricate interplay between coherent electron spin dynamics and incoherent relaxation processes in photoexcited radical-pair reactions requires tractable approaches for numerically obtaining controls for large, complex open quantum systems. Employing techniques relying on full Liouville-space propagators becomes computationally infeasible for large spin systems of realistic complexity. Here, we demonstrate how a control engineering approach based on the Pontryagin Maximum Principle (PMP) can offer a viable alternative by reporting on the successful application of PMP-optimal control to steer the coherent and incoherent spin dynamics of noisy radical pairs. This enables controls for prototypical radical-pair models that exhibit robustness in the face of relevant noise sources and paves the way to incoherent control of radical-pair spin dynamics.</p>

            <p>In this work, we study the hardness required to achieve proofs of quantumness (PoQ), which in turn capture (potentially interactive) quantum advantage. A ``trivial'' PoQ is to simply assume an average-case hard problem for classical computers that is easy for quantum computers. However, there is much interest in ``non-trivial'' PoQ that actually rely on quantum hardness assumptions, as these are often a starting point for more sophisticated protocols such as classical verification of quantum computation (CVQC). We show several lower-bounds for the hardness required to achieve non-trivial PoQ, specifically showing that they likely require cryptographic hardness, with different types of cryptographic hardness being required for different variations of non-trivial PoQ. In particular, our results help explain the challenges in using lattices to build publicly verifiable PoQ and its various extensions such as CVQC.</p>

            <p>The technique of combining multiple votes to enhance the quality of a decision is the core of boosting algorithms in machine learning. In particular, boosting provably increases decision quality by combining multiple weak learners-hypotheses that are only slightly better than random guessing-into a single strong learner that classifies data well. There exist various versions of boosting algorithms, which we improve upon through the introduction of QuantumBoost. Inspired by classical work by Barak, Hardt and Kale, our QuantumBoost algorithm achieves the best known runtime over other boosting methods through two innovations. First, it uses a quantum algorithm to compute approximate Bregman projections faster. Second, it combines this with a lazy projection strategy, a technique from convex optimization where projections are performed infrequently rather than every iteration. To our knowledge, QuantumBoost is the first algorithm, classical or quantum, to successfully adopt a lazy projection strategy in the context of boosting.</p>

            <p>Simulating time evolution under fermionic Hamiltonians is a compelling application of quantum computers because it lies at the core of predicting the properties of materials and molecules. Fermions can be simulated on qubit-based quantum computers using a fermion-to-qubit mapping, subject to an overhead -- the circuit depth on a qubit quantum computer divided by that on a quantum computer built from native fermionic modes -- at worst scaling linearly with the number of modes $N$. Existing approaches that lower this depth overhead usually trade it for space, using $O(N)$ ancilla qubits. We exponentially reduce the worst-case overhead of ancilla-free fermion-to-qubit mappings to $O(\log^2 N)$ by constructing circuits that perform any fermionic permutation on qubits in the Jordan-Wigner encoding in depth $O(\log^2 N)$. We also show that our result generalizes to permutations in any product-preserving ternary tree fermionic encoding. When introducing $O(N)$ ancillas and mid-circuit measurement and feedforward, the overhead reduces to $O(\log N)$. Finally, we show that our scheme can be used to implement the fermionic fast Fourier transform, a key subroutine in chemistry simulation, with overhead $\Theta(\log N)$ without ancillas and $\Theta(1)$ with ancillas, improving exponentially over the best previously known ancilla-free algorithm with overhead scaling linearly with $N$. Our results show that simulating fermions with qubit quantum computers comes at a much lower asymptotic overhead than previously thought.</p>

            <p>The orbital motion of chargeless bosons, unlike that of electrons, does not generate a magnetic moment and thus cannot directly interact with magnetic fields. Utilizing the Aharonov-Casher effect and perturbation theory, we formulate a proper theory for the magnon orbital angular momentum (OAM) at finite temperatures, explicitly identifying both self-rotation and topological contributions, analogous to the electronic counterpart but with correct bosonic statistics. Comparing with previous studies on magnon OAM, the magnon spin Nernst effect can only be correctly reproduced using the proper theory for magnon OAM. In a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice, we show that the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction induces a large magnon OAM in both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic ground states. Our formulation provides a foundation for studying orbital dynamics of chargeless bosons with intrinsic spin.</p>

We systematically explore the dependence of the drain population and the current on the source bias potential and the strength of the interatomic interaction. Our simulations reveal signatures of resonant tunneling when the source chemical potential aligns with discrete energy levels in the gate well, leading to coherent matter-wave emission in the drain. Contrary to previous many-body studies that predicted interaction-induced current gain via coupling to gate well modes, our results suggest that coherence in the drain is primarily governed by single-particle resonances, with no evident broadening from nonlinear coupling.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chenhaoyue Wang, Carlos J. Garcia-Cervera, Amartya S. Banerjee</p>
            <p>Bloch oscillations (BOs) describe the coherent oscillatory motion of electrons in a periodic lattice under a constant external electric field. Deviations from pure harmonic wave packet motion or irregular Bloch oscillations can occur due to Zener tunneling (Landau-Zener Transitions or LZTs), with oscillation frequencies closely tied to interband coupling strengths. Motivated by the interplay between flat-band physics and interband coupling in generating irregular BOs, here we investigate these oscillations in Lieb and Kagome lattices using two complementary approaches: coherent transport simulations and scattering matrix analysis. In the presence of unavoidable band touchings, half-fundamental and fundamental BO frequencies are observed in Lieb and Kagome lattices, respectively -- a behavior directly linked to their distinct band structures. When avoided band touchings are introduced, distinct BO frequency responses to coupling parameters in each lattice are observed. Scattering matrix analysis reveals strong coupling and potential LZTs between dispersive bands and the flat band in Kagome lattices, with the quadratic band touching enhancing interband interactions and resulting in BO dynamics that is distinct from systems with linear crossings. In contrast, the Lieb lattice -- a three level system -- shows independent coupling between the flat band and two dispersive bands, without direct LZTs occurring between the two dispersive bands themselves. Finally, to obtain a unifying perspective on these results, we examine BOs during a strain-induced transition from Kagome to Lieb lattices, and link the evolution of irregular BO frequencies to changes in band connectivity and interband coupling.</p>

We found these artifacts to be caused by resistive crosstalk and by intensity variations of the calibration laser. For phase-IV of the BeEST experiment, we have removed the crosstalk by designing the STJ array so that each pixel has its own ground wire. We now also use a more stable UV laser for calibration. The new STJ arrays were fabricated at STAR Cryoelectronics and tested at LLNL and FRIB. They have the same high energy resolution of $\sim$1\textendash2~eV in the energy range of interest below 100~eV as before, and they no longer exhibit the earlier calibration artifacts.

            <p>High-spin states hold significant promise for classical and quantum information storage and emerging magnetic memory technologies. Here, we present a systematic framework for engineering such high-spin magnetic states in dopant clusters formed from substitutional impurities in semiconductors. In single-valley materials such as gallium arsenide, impurity states are hydrogenic and exchange interactions generally favor low-spin configurations, except in special geometries. In contrast, multivalley semiconductors exhibit oscillatory form factors in their exchange couplings, enabling the controlled suppression of selected hopping processes and exchange couplings. Exploiting this feature, we demonstrate how carefully arranged impurities in aluminum arsenide, germanium, and silicon can stabilize ground states with a net spin that scale extensively with system size. Within effective mass theory and the tight-binding approximation for hopping, we construct explicit examples ranging from finite clusters to extended lattices and fractal-like tilings. In two dimensions, we identify several favorable dopant geometries supporting a net spin equal to around half of the fully polarized value in the thermodynamic limit, including one which achieves over $70\%$ polarization. Our results provide a general design principle for harnessing valley degeneracy in semiconductors to construct robust high-spin states and outline a pathway for their experimental realization via precision implantation of dopants.</p>

In this work, we characterize the effect of annealing at temperatures >1200¬∞C in high vacuum on the quality factors of diamond microdisk resonators. We investigate the optical losses associated with a non-diamond layer formed during annealing, and use Raman spectroscopy to analyze the resonator surface morphology and demonstrate that tri-acid cleaning can restore their optical quality factors. These results show the viability of creating defects in pre-fabricated diamond resonators without degrading their optical properties.</p>

In particular, we focus on Abelian topological order in two dimensions, which spontaneously breaks a 1-form symmetry. Using the toric code as a primary example, we compute the entanglement asymmetry and compare it to the topological entanglement entropy. We find that while the two quantities are not strictly equivalent, both are sub-leading corrections to the area law and can serve as order parameters for the topological phase. We generalize our results to non-chiral Abelian topological order and express the maximal entanglement asymmetry in terms of the quantum dimension. Finally, we discuss how the scaling of entanglement asymmetry correctly detects topological order in the deformed toric code, where 1-form symmetry breaking persists even in a trivial phase.</p>

Qubits and qudits have been encoded on donor nuclei, with successful demonstrations of Bell states and quantum memories on the spin-1/2 $^{31}$P and cat-qubits on the spin-7/2 $^{123}$Sb nuclei. Isoelectronic nuclear spins coupled to gate-defined quantum dots, such as the naturally occurring $^{29}$Si isotope, possess no additional charge and allow for the coupled electron to be shuttled without destroying the nuclear spin coherence. Here, we demonstrate the coupling and readout of a spin-9/2 $^{73}$Ge nuclear spin to a gate-defined quantum dot in SiMOS. The $^{73}$Ge nucleus was implanted by isotope-selective ion-implantation. We observe the hyperfine interaction (HFI) to the coupled quantum dot electron and are able to tune it from 180 kHz to 350 kHz, through the voltages applied to the lateral gate electrodes.

            <p>Motivated by the profound connection between quantum mechanics and spacetime geometry, particularly the conjectured correspondence between wormholes and quantum entanglement as proposed in the ER=EPR framework, this study aims to investigate the influence of wormhole geometries on quantum information extraction. We examine the correlation-specifically mutual information (MI) and entanglement-extracted by two Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detectors from the quantum vacuum field in the presence of a BTZ wormhole featuring a null-like throat, also known as an Einstein-Rosen bridge. First, we analyze how the detector's position relative to the wormhole throat and the throat's size affect the extracted MI. Our results indicate that the wormhole enhances MI extraction, with maximal MI achieved when the detectors are located at specific image-symmetric points connected by the wormhole. By analyzing the behavior of the nonlocal contribution term and the classical noise term, it is found that the correlations extracted contain genuine non-classical components. This work highlights the feasibility of extracting quantum correlations through null-like wormhole geometries and provides a novel perspective for probing the potential relationship between spacetime topology and the nonlocal characteristics of quantum mechanics.</p>

A key ingredient in our analysis is the open two-mode squeezed state formalism and the generalized Lanczos algorithm. To numerically compute the Krylov complexity, we are the first time to derive the evolution equations for the parameters $r_k$ and $\phi_k$ within an open two-mode squeezed state. Our results indicate that the Krylov complexity exhibits a similar trend in both the standard case and the case with non-trivial sound speed. To distinguish between these two scenarios, we also investigate the Krylov entropy for completeness. The evolution of the Krylov entropy shows a clear difference between the standard case and the non-trivial sound speed case. Furthermore, based on the behavior of the Lanczos coefficients, we find that the case of non-trivial sound speed behaves as a maximally chaotic system. However, our numerical results suggest that the Krylov complexity does not saturate to a constant value due to the huge expansion of spacetime background. This study offers a new perspective for exploring the early universe through the quantum information.</p>

            <h2>Operator dependence and robustness of spacetime-localized response in a quantum critical spin chain</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daichi Imagawa, Keiju Murata, Daisuke Yamamoto</p>
            <p>We investigate the phenomenon of spacetime-localized response in a quantum critical spin system, with particular attention to how it depends on the spatial profile and operator content of the applied perturbation, as well as its robustness against increase of amplitude and temporal discretization. Motivated by recent theoretical proposals linking such response patterns to the anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory correspondence, we numerically analyze the real-time dynamics of the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model at criticality using the time-evolving block decimation algorithm. We find that sharply localized and periodically recurring responses emerge only for specific types of perturbations, namely those that correspond to local density fields in the continuum limit. In contrast, perturbations involving other spin components produce conventional propagating excitations without localization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the response remains qualitatively robust when the time-dependent perturbation is approximated by a piecewise-linear function, highlighting the practical relevance of our findings for quantum simulation platforms with limited temporal resolution. Our results clarify the operator dependence of emergent bulk-like dynamics in critical spin chains and offer guidance for probing holographic physics in experimental settings.</p>

            <p>Gluing theorem for random unitaries [Schuster, Haferkamp, Huang, QIP 2025] have found numerous applications, including designing low depth random unitaries [Schuster, Haferkamp, Huang, QIP 2025], random unitaries in ${\sf QAC0}$ [Foxman, Parham, Vasconcelos, Yuen'25] and generically shortening the key length of pseudorandom unitaries [Ananth, Bostanci, Gulati, Lin EUROCRYPT'25]. We present an alternate method of combining Haar random unitaries from the gluing lemma from [Schuster, Haferkamp, Huang, QIP 2025] that is secure against adversaries with inverse query access to the joined unitary. As a consequence, we show for the first time that strong pseudorandom unitaries can generically have their length extended, and can be constructed using only $O(n^{1/c})$ bits of randomness, for any constant $c$, if any family of strong pseudorandom unitaries exists.</p>

            <p>Localized quantum emitters in transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have recently emerged as solid-state candidates for on-demand sources of single photons. Due to the role of strain in the site-selective creation of TMD emitters, their hybrid integration into photonic structures such as cavities and waveguides is possible using pick-and-place methods. Here we investigate quantum emission from a hybrid structure consisting of a monolayer of WSe2 interfaced with horizontally aligned InP nanowires (NWs). Our experiments reveal multiple narrow and bright emission peaks in the 715-785 nm spectral range and g(2)(0) as low as 0.049, indicating strong antibunching and good single photon purity. The faceted nature of III-V NWs provides unique opportunities for strain engineering, including the potential for placement of emitters on the top surface for optimal coupling. Our findings pave the way for realizing hybrid quantum light sources for integrated quantum photonics that could combine III-V quantum dots with TMD emitters into a single platform.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kamila Kowalska, Enrico Maria Sessolo</p>
            <p>In the context of entanglement in relativistic $2\to 2$ scattering described by a perturbative $S$-matrix, we derive analytically the concurrence for a mixed final state of two qubits corresponding to a discrete quantum number of the scattered particles. Given an initial product state, the derived concurrence depends at the leading order on the real part of the inelastic forward amplitude and the initial state only. We also point out that the real part of the forward amplitude provides a subleading correction to the linearized entropy, reducing it by an amount that, for a computational-basis state, is equivalent to the relative entropy of coherence. We illustrate our findings with two examples of phenomenological interest: high-energy scattering of two scalar fields in the two-Higgs doublet model, and high-energy electron-positron annihilation.</p>

            <h2>Integrable Floquet Time Crystals in One Dimension</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rahul Chandra, Mahbub Rahaman, Soumyabroto Majumder, Analabha Roy, Sujit Sarkar</p>
            <p>We demonstrate the realization of a discrete-time crystal (DTC) phase in a family of periodically driven, one-dimensional quadratic lattice Hamiltonians that can be obtained using spin chains. These interactions preserve integrability while opening controllable gaps at resonant quasienergies and pinning the emergent quasienergy modes that are responsible for subharmonics. We demonstrate that the DTC phase is rigid in the parameter space of transverse field and an additional interaction like NNN coupling strength, with the drive frequency optimized to produce the strongest subharmonic response. We also provide a detailed phase portrait of the model, exhibiting a variety of new dynamical phases, such as a fragile time crystal and both spin-liquid and paramagnetic phases, as well as sharp quantum phase transitions between them. Finite-size scaling of the Floquet quasienergy splitting between the emergent subharmonic mode and its conjugate shows that the DTC lifetime diverges exponentially with system size. Our work thus establishes a novel mechanism for realizing robust, long-lived DTCs in one dimension, and paves the way for their experimental realization in near-term quantum simulators. Motivation for this work stems from the limitations of disorder-based stabilization schemes that rely on many-body localization and exhibit only prethermal or finite-lived plateaus, eventually restoring ergodicity. Disorder-free routes are therefore highly desirable. Integrable (or Floquet-integrable) systems provide an attractive alternative because their extensive set of conserved quantities and constrained scattering strongly restrict thermalization channels. Our construction exploits these integrable restrictions together with short-range NNN engineering to produce a clean, robust DTC that avoids the prethermal fragility of disordered realizations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shao-cheng Hou, Si-wen Li</p>
            <p>Using the gauge-gravity duality, we study the electromagnetic instability of vacuum with instantons in holographic plasma. The model we employ is the D(-1)-D3 brane system in which the D(-1)-branes correspond to the instantons in holography. To take into account the flavored quarks, the coincident probe D7-branes as flavors are embedded into the bulk geometry so that the effective electromagnetic Lagrangian with flavors corresponds to the action of the D7-branes according to gauge-gravity duality. We numerically evaluate the vacuum decay rate, the critical electric field and the V-A curve of the vacuum by using the D7-brane action with various values of the electromagnetic field. It implies the particles in the plasma acquire an effective mass in the presence of instantons as it is expected in the quantum field theory, and the plasma trends to become insulating when the electric field is small. This work reveals the relation between electromagnetic and instantonic properties of the vacuum in the plasma.</p>

            <p>We present the first construction of a computational Certified Deletion Property (CDP) achievable with classical communication, derived from the compilation of the non-local Magic Square Game (MSG). We leverage the KLVY compiler to transform the non-local MSG into a 2-round interactive protocol, rigorously demonstrating that this compilation preserves the game-specific CDP. Previously, the quantum value and rigidity of the compiled game were investigated. We emphasize that we are the first to investigate CDP (local randomness in [Fu and Miller, Phys. Rev. A 97, 032324 (2018)]) for the compiled game. Then, we combine this CDP with the framework [Kitagawa, Morimae, and Yamakawa, Eurocrypt 2025] to construct Secure Key Leasing with classical Lessor (cSKL). SKL enables the Lessor to lease the secret key to the Lessee and verify that a quantum Lessee has indeed deleted the key. In this paper, we realize cSKL for PKE, PRF, and digital signature. Compared to prior works for cSKL, we realize cSKL for PRF and digital signature for the first time. In addition, we succeed in weakening the assumption needed to construct cSKL.</p>

            <p>The simplest, algebraic quantum-electrodynamical corrections, due to the double-negative energy subspace and instantaneous interactions, are computed to the no-pair Dirac-Coulomb(-Breit) energy of two-spin-1/2-fermion systems. Numerical results are reported for two-electron atoms with a clamped nucleus and positronium-like genuine two-particle systems. The Bethe-Salpeter equation provides the theoretical framework, and numerical methods have been developed for its equal-time time-slice. In practice, it requires solving a sixteen-component eigenvalue equation with a two-particle Dirac Hamiltonian, including the appropriate interaction. The double-pair corrections can either be included in the interaction part of the eigenvalue equation or treated as a perturbation to the no-pair Hamiltonian. The numerical results have an $\alpha$ fine-structure constant dependence that is in excellent agreement with the known $\alpha^3E_\mathrm{h}\$-order double-pair correction of non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics.</p>

From its inception, the PPP Hamiltonian has helped in the development of new computational approaches in instances where compute is constrained due to its inherent approximations that allow for an efficient representation and calculation of many systems of chemical and technological interest. The crucial influence of electron correlation on the validity of these approximations is discussed, and we review how PPP model exact calculations have enabled a deeper understanding of conjugated polymer systems. More recent usage of the PPP Hamiltonian includes its application in high-throughput screening activities to the inverse design problem, which we illustrate here for two specific fields of technological interest: singlet fission and singlet-triplet inverted energy gap molecules. Finally, we conjecture how utilizing the PPP model in quantum computing applications could be mutually beneficial.</p>

            <p>Doped Mott insulators host intertwined spin-charge phenomena that evolve with temperature and can culminate in stripe order or superconductivity at low temperatures. The two-dimensional $t$-$J$ model captures this interplay yet finite-temperature, infinite-size calculations remain difficult. Using purification represented by a tensor network - an infinite projected entangled-pair state (iPEPS) ansatz - we simulate the $t$-$J$ model at finite temperature directly in the thermodynamic limit, reaching temperatures down to one tenth of the hopping rate and hole concentrations up to one quarter of the lattice sites. Beyond specific heat, uniform susceptibility, and compressibility, we introduce dopant-conditioned multi-point correlators that map how holes reshape local exchange. Nearest-neighbor hole pairs produce a strong cooperative response that reinforces antiferromagnetism on the adjacent parallel bonds, and single holes weaken nearby antiferromagnetic bonds; d-wave pairing correlations remain short-ranged over the same window. These results provide experiment-compatible thermodynamic-limit benchmarks and establish dopant-conditioned correlators as incisive probes of short-range spin-texture reorganization at finite temperature.</p>

            <p>Horn's problem is concerned with characterizing the eigenvalues $(a,b,c)$ of Hermitian matrices $(A,B,C)$ satisfying the constraint $A+B=C$ and forming the edges of a triangle in the space of Hermitian matrices. It has deep connections to tensor product invariants, Littlewood-Richardson coefficients, geometric invariant theory and the intersection theory of Schubert varieties. This paper concerns the tetrahedral Horn problem which aims to characterize the tuples of eigenvalues $(a,b,c,d,e,f)$ of Hermitian matrices $(A,B,C,D,E,F)$ forming the edges of a tetrahedron, and thus satisfying the constraints $A+B=C$, $B+D=F$, $D+C=E$ and $A+F=E$. Here we derive new inequalities satisfied by the Schur-polynomials of such eigenvalues and, using eigenvalue estimation techniques from quantum information theory, prove their satisfaction up to degree $k$ implies the existence of approximate solutions with error $O(\ln k / k)$. Moreover, the existence of these tetrahedra is related to the semiclassical asymptotics of the $6j$-symbols for the unitary group $U(n)$, which are maps between multiplicity spaces that encode the associativity relation for tensor products of irreducible representations. Using our techniques, we prove the asymptotics of norms of these $6j$-symbols are either inverse-polynomial or exponential depending on whether there exists such tetrahedra of Hermitian matrices.</p>

By integrating automatic differentiation, our approach enables direct variational energy minimization on this lattice geometry. In contrast to conventional approaches that map the triangular lattice onto a square lattice with diagonal next-nearest-neighbour interactions, our native formulation yields improved variational results at the same bond dimension. This improvement stems from a more faithful and physically informed representation of the entanglement structure in the tensor network and an increased number of variational parameters. We apply our method to the antiferromagnetic nearest-neighbour Heisenberg model on the triangular and kagome lattice, and benchmark our results against previous numerical studies.</p>

We present interactive electronic dice that simulate core quantum ideas through haptic interaction and visual feedback. Each die represents a six state system with a superposition display and basis dependent measurement. A pair of dice can be prepared in an entangled mode that yields anti correlated outcomes which sum to seven when measured in the same colour basis while remaining uncorrelated across different bases. The platform supports classroom demonstrations from basic superposition and measurement to simplified quantum key distribution with single die and entanglement based protocols. The design uses standard components, two custom PCBs, orientation sensing, cryptographic quality randomness, and low power wireless proximity detection. All hardware files and code are open source to enable adoption. Initial implementations with university and secondary school audiences suggest that the tangible and visual nature of the dice helps learners form intuitive models of superposition, measurement, and entanglement correlations.</p>

            <p>Vacuum cavity control of quantum materials is the engineering of quantum materials systems through electromagnetic zero-point fluctuations. In this work we articulate a generic mechanism for vacuum optical control of correlated electronic order: Casimir control, where the zero-point energy of the electromagnetic continuum, the Casimir energy, depends on the properties of the material system. To assess the experimental viability of this mechanism we focus on the Casimir stabilization of fluctuating nematic order. In nematic Fermi liquids, different orientations of the electronic order are often energetically degenerate. Thus, while local domains of fixed orientation may form, thermal disordering inhibits long range order. By engineering the electromagnetic environment of the electronic system, however, we show that the Casimir energy can be used as a tool to preferentially stabilize particular orientations of the nematic order. As a concrete example, we examine the interplay between a birefringent crystal -- which sources an anisotropic electromagnetic environment -- and a quantum Hall stripe system, an archetypal nematic Fermi fluid. We show that for experimentally feasible setups, the anisotropy induced by the orientation dependent Casimir energy can be $10^4$ times larger than other mechanisms known to stabilize quantum Hall stripes. This finding convincingly implies that our setting may be realized with currently available experimental technology. Having demonstrated that the Casimir energy can be used to stabilize fluctuating nematic order, we close by discussing the implications for recent terahertz cavity experiments on quantum Hall stripes, as well as pave the road towards broader Casimir control of competing correlated electronic phases.</p>

Unlike the classical information geometry, the e-connection has non-vanishing torsion, which brings various mathematical difficulties. The notion of e-autoparallel submanifolds is regarded as a quantum version of exponential families in classical statistics, which is known to be characterized as statistical models having efficient estimators (unbiased estimators uniformly achieving the equality in the Cramer-Rao inequality). As quantum extensions of this classical result, we present two different forms of estimation-theoretical characterizations of the e-autoparallel submanifolds. We also give several results on the e-autoparallelity, some of which are valid for the autoparallelity w.r.t. an affine connection in a more general geometrical situation.</p>

In this work, we explore the use of dynamical decoupling (DD) in characterizing and suppressing undesired two-qubit couplings as well as the underlying single-qubit decoherence, both significant hurdles to achieving precise quantum control and realizing quantum computing on many hardware prototypes. Through discrete search of dynamical decoupling sequences, we identify sequences that protect against decoherence and selectively target unwanted two-qubit interactions of general form. On a transmon-qubit-based superconducting quantum device, we identify separate white and 1/f noise components underlying the single-qubit decoherence and a static ZZ coupling between pairs of qubits. A family of syncopated dynamical decoupling sequences is found and their efficiency demonstrated in two-qubit benchmarking experiments. The syncopated decoupling technique significantly boosts performance in a realistic algorithmic quantum circuit.</p>

            <p>Quantum circuits for loading probability distributions into quantum states are essential subroutines in quantum algorithms used in physics, finance engineering, and machine learning. The ability to implement these with high accuracy in low-depth quantum circuits is a critical issue. We propose a novel quantum state preparation method for probability distribution with reflection symmetry using matrix product states. By considering reflection symmetry, our method reduces the entanglement of probability distributions and improves the accuracy of approximations by matrix product states. As a result, we improved the accuracy by two orders of magnitude over existing methods using matrix product states. Our approach, characterized by linear scalability with qubit count, is highly advantageous for noisy quantum devices. Also, our demonstration results reveal that the approximation accuracy in tensor networks depends heavily on the bond dimension, with minimal reliance on the number of qubits. Our method is demonstrated for a normal distribution encoded into 10 and 20 qubits on a real quantum processor.</p>

            <p>Quantum computing is rapidly advancing, harnessing the power of qubits' superposition and entanglement for computational advantages over classical systems. However, scalability poses a primary challenge for these machines. By implementing a hybrid workflow between classical and quantum computing instances, D-Wave has succeeded in pushing this boundary to the realm of industrial use. Furthermore, they have recently opened up to mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problems, expanding their applicability to many relevant problems in the field of optimisation. However, the extent of their suitability for diverse problem categories and their computational advantages remains unclear. This study conducts a comprehensive examination by applying a selection of diverse case studies to benchmark the performance of D-Wave's hybrid solver against that of industry-leading solvers such as CPLEX, Gurobi, and IPOPT. The findings indicate that D-Wave's hybrid solver is currently most advantageous for integer quadratic objective functions and shows potential for quadratic constraints. To illustrate this, we applied it to a real-world energy problem, specifically the MILP unit commitment problem. While D-Wave can solve such problems, its performance has not yet matched that of its classical counterparts.</p>

            <p>We study the size and shape statistics of ground state fuzzy spheres when projected onto the transverse plane, utilizing the regularized SU(N=2) matrix model in D=(1+3)-dimensional spacetime. We show that they appear as ellipses, from matrix/membrane correspondence. With our numerical and analytical approximation for the ground state wavefunction, we provide estimations for their expectation surface areas, perimeters, eccentricities, and shape-parameters. These geometric constants of quantum membranes deviate drastically from classical mechanics.</p>

            <h2>Entanglemons: Cross-platform protected qubits from entanglement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nilotpal Chakraborty, Roderich Moessner, Benoit Doucot</p>
            <p>A crucial ingredient for scalable fault-tolerant quantum computing is the construction of logical qubits with low error rates and intrinsic noise protection. We propose a cross-platform construction for such hardware-level noise-protection in which the qubits are protected from depolarizing (relaxation) and dephasing errors induced by local noise. These logical qubits arise from the entanglement between two internal degrees of freedom, hence - entanglemons. Our construction is based on the emergence of collective degrees of freedom from a generalized coherent state construction, similar in spirit to spin coherent states, of a set of such internally entangled units. These degrees of freedom, for a finite number of units, parametrize the quantized version of complex projective space $\mathbb{C}$P(3). The noise protection of the entanglemon qubit is then a consequence of a weakly coupled emergent degree of freedom arising due to the non-linear geometry of complex projective space. We present two simple models for entanglemons which are platform agnostic, provide varying levels of protection and in which the qubit basis states are the two lowest energy states with a higher energy gap to other states. We end by commenting on how entanglemons could be realized in platforms ranging from superconducting circuits and trapped ion platforms to possibly also quantum Hall skyrmions in graphene and quantum dots in semiconductors. The inherent noise protection in our models combined with the platform agnosticism highlights the potential of encoding information in additional weakly coupled emergent degrees of freedom arising in non-linear geometrical spaces and curved phase spaces, thereby proposing a different route to achieve scalable fault-tolerance.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eli Goldin, Tomoyuki Morimae, Saachi Mutreja, Takashi Yamakawa</p>
            <p>We construct a unitary oracle relative to which $\mathbf{BQP}=\mathbf{QCMA}$ but quantum-computation-classical-communication (QCCC) commitments and QCCC multiparty non-interactive key exchange exist. We also construct a unitary oracle relative to which $\mathbf{BQP}=\mathbf{QMA}$, but quantum lightning (a stronger variant of quantum money) exists. This extends previous work by Kretschmer [Kretschmer, TQC22], which showed that there is a quantum oracle relative to which $\mathbf{BQP}=\mathbf{QMA}$ but pseudorandm unitaries exist. We also show that (poly-round) QCCC key exchange, QCCC commitments, and two-round quantum key distribution can all be used to build one-way puzzles. One-way puzzles are a version of ``quantum samplable'' one-wayness and are an intermediate primitive between pseudorandom state generators and EFI pairs, the minimal quantum primitive. In particular, one-way puzzles cannot exist if $\mathbf{BQP}=\mathbf{PP}$. Our results together imply that aside from pseudorandom state generators, there is a large class of quantum cryptographic primitives which can exist even if $\mathbf{BQP} = \mathbf{QCMA}$, but are broken if $\mathbf{BQP} = \mathbf{PP}$. Furthermore, one-way puzzles are a minimal primitive for this class. We denote this class ``CountCrypt''.</p>

            <p>We utilize the symmetry groups of regular tessellations on two-dimensional surfaces of different constant curvatures, including spheres, Euclidean planes and hyperbolic planes, to encode a qubit or qudit into the physical degrees of freedom on these surfaces, which we call tessellation codes. We show that tessellation codes exhibit decent error correction properties by analysis via geometric considerations and the representation theory of the isometry groups on the corresponding surfaces. Interestingly, we demonstrate how this formalism enables the implementation of certain logical operations through geometric rotations of surfaces in real space, opening a new approach to logical quantum computation. We provide a variety of concrete constructions of such codes associated with different tessellations, which give rise to different logical groups. This formalism sheds a new light on quantum code and logical operation construction.</p>

            <h2>A General Quantum Duality for Representations of Groups with Applications to Quantum Money, Lightning, and Fire</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> John Bostanci, Barak Nehoran, Mark Zhandry</p>
            <p>Aaronson, Atia, and Susskind (2020) established that efficiently mapping between quantum states $|\psi\rangle$ and $|\phi\rangle$ is computationally equivalent to distinguishing their superpositions $|\psi\rangle \pm |\phi\rangle$. We generalize this insight into a broader duality principle, wherein manipulating quantum states in one basis is equivalent to extracting their value in a complementary basis. This general duality principle states that the ability to implement a unitary representation of a group is computationally equivalent to the ability to perform a Fourier subspace extraction from its irreducible representations. Building on our duality principle, we present the following applications: * We extend the construction of publicly-key quantum money of Zhandry (2024) from Abelian group actions to a construction of quantum lightning from non-Abelian group actions, and eliminate Zhandry's reliance on a black-box model for justifying security. Instead, we prove a direct reduction to a computational assumption -- the pre-action security of cryptographic group actions. Our construction is realizable with symmetric group actions, including those implicit in the McEliece cryptosystem. * We provide an alternative quantum lightning construction from one-way homomorphisms, with security holding under certain conditions. This scheme shows equivalence among four security notions: quantum lightning security, worst-case and average-case cloning security, and security against preparing a canonical state. * We formalize the notion of quantum fire, states that are efficiently clonable, but not efficiently telegraphable. These states can be spread like fire, provided they are kept alive quantumly and do not decohere. The only previously known construction relied on a unitary quantum oracle, whereas we present the first candidate construction of quantum fire using a classical oracle.</p>

            <p>We introduce a systematic study of "symmetric quantum circuits", a new restricted model of quantum computation that preserves the symmetries of the problems it solves. This model is well-adapted for studying the role of symmetry in quantum speedups, extending a central notion of symmetric computation studied in the classical setting. Our results establish that symmetric quantum circuits are fundamentally more powerful than their classical counterparts. First, we give efficient symmetric circuits for key quantum techniques such as amplitude amplification, phase estimation and linear combination of unitaries. In addition, we show how the task of symmetric state preparation can be performed efficiently in several natural cases. Finally, we demonstrate an exponential separation in the symmetric setting for the problem XOR-SAT, which requires exponential-size symmetric classical circuits but can be solved by polynomial-size symmetric quantum circuits.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mourad Halla</p>
            <p>The efficient optimization of variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) is critical for their successful application in quantum computing. The Quantum Natural Gradient (QNG) method, which leverages the geometry of quantum state space, has demonstrated improved convergence compared to standard gradient descent [Quantum 4, 269 (2020)]. In this work, we introduce the Modified Conjugate Quantum Natural Gradient (CQNG), an optimization algorithm that integrates QNG with principles from the nonlinear conjugate-gradient method. Unlike QNG, which employs a fixed learning rate, CQNG dynamically adjusts its hyperparameters at each step, enhancing both efficiency and flexibility. Numerical simulations show that CQNG achieves faster convergence and reduces quantum-resource requirements compared to QNG across various optimization scenarios, even when strict conjugacy conditions are not fully satisfied--hence the term ``Modified Conjugate.'' These results highlight CQNG as a promising optimization technique for improving the performance of VQAs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anthony Micciche, Feroz Ahmed Mian, Anasua Chatterjee, Andrew McGregor, Stefan Krastanov</p>
            <p>The ability to physically move qubits within a register allows the design of hardware-specific error-correction codes, which can achieve fault-tolerance while respecting other constraints. In particular, recent advancements have demonstrated the shuttling of electron and hole spin qubits through a quantum dot array with high fidelity. It is therefore timely to explore error correction architectures consisting merely of two parallel quantum dot arrays, an experimentally validated architecture compatible with classical wiring and control constraints. Upon such an architecture, we develop a suite of heuristic methods for compiling any Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) error-correcting code's syndrome-extraction circuit to run with a reduced number of shuttling operations. We demonstrate how column-regular qLDPC codes can be compiled in a provably minimal number of shuttles that is exactly equal to the column weight of the code when Shor-style syndrome extraction is used. We provide tables stating the number of required shuttles for many contemporary codes of interest. In addition, we provide a proof of the NP hardness of minimizing the number of shuttle operations for general codes, even when using Shor syndrome extraction. We also discuss how one could get around this by placing blanks in the ancilla array to achieve minimal shuttles with Shor syndrome extraction on any CSS code, at the cost of longer ancilla arrays</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anthony P. Thompson, Arie Soeteman, Chris Cade, Ido Niesen</p>
            <p>Understanding the effects of noise on quantum computations is fundamental to the development of quantum hardware and quantum algorithms. Simulation tools are essential for quantitatively modelling these effects, yet unless artificial restrictions are placed on the circuit or noise model, accurately modelling noisy quantum computations is an extremely challenging task due to unfavourable scaling of required computational resources. Tensor network methods offer a viable solution for simulating computations that generate limited entanglement or that have noise models which yield low gate fidelities. However, in the most interesting regime of entangling circuits (with high gate fidelities) relevant for error correction and mitigation tensor network simulations often achieve poor accuracy. In this work we develop and numerically test a method for significantly improving the accuracy of tensor network simulations of noisy quantum circuits in the low-noise (i.e. high gate-fidelity) regime. Our method comes with the advantages that it (i) allows for the simulation of quantum circuits under generic types of noise model, (ii) is especially tailored to the low-noise regime, and (iii) retains the benefits of tensor network scaling, enabling efficient simulations of large numbers of qubits. We build upon the observations that adding extra noise to a quantum circuit makes it easier to simulate with tensor networks, and that the results can later be reliably extrapolated back to the low-noise regime of interest. These observations form the basis for a novel emulation technique that we call non-zero noise extrapolation, in analogy to the quantum error mitigation technique of zero-noise extrapolation.</p>

            <p>We present EHands, a quantum-native protocol for implementing multivariable polynomial transformations on quantum processors. The protocol introduces four fundamental, reversible operators: multiplication, addition, negation, and parity flip, and employs the Expectation Value ENcoding (EVEN) scheme to represent real numbers as quantum states. Unlike discretization or binary encoding methods, EHands operates directly on vectorized real-valued inputs prepared in the initial state and applies a shallow quantum circuit that depends only on the polynomial coefficients. The result is obtained from the expectation value measured on a single qubit, enabling efficient parallel evaluation of a polynomial across multiple data points using a single circuit. We introduce both a reversible implementation for degree-$d$ polynomials, requiring $3d$ qubits, and a non-reversible variant that uses qubit resets to reduce the requirements to $d+1$ qubits. Both implementations exhibit linear depth scaling in $d$ and are explicitly decomposed into one- and two-qubit gates for direct execution on current quantum processing units. The protocol's effectiveness is demonstrated through experimental validation on IBM's Heron-class quantum processors, showing reliable polynomial approximations of functions like ReLU and arctan.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongshun Yao, Xin Wang</p>
            <p>Retrieving classical information from quantum systems is central to quantum information processing. As a more general task than quantum state discrimination, which focuses on identifying the exact state, quantum state exclusion only requires ruling out options, revealing fundamental limits of information extraction from quantum systems. In this work, we study the conclusive exclusion of quantum states generated by group actions, establishing explicit criteria for when such exclusion is possible. For systems with complex symmetries, including finite and compact Lie groups, we derive a sufficient condition for conclusive exclusion based on the initial state's amplitudes and the group's structure. As applications to special groups such as Abelian groups, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for conclusive state exclusion and generalize the Pusey-Barrett-Rudolph result to a wider range of scenarios. Finally, we explore zero-error communication via conclusive exclusion of quantum states and derive a lower bound on the feedback-assisted and non-signalling-assisted zero-error capacity of classical-quantum channels generated by group actions.</p>

            <h2>Electromagnetically Induced Transparency Effect Improves Quantum Battery Lifetime</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jin-Tian Zhang, Cheng-Ge Liu, Qing Ai</p>
            <p>Quantum battery (QB) is an application of quantum thermodynamics which uses quantum effects to store and transfer energy, overcoming the limitations of classical batteries and potentially improving performance. However, due to the interaction with the external environment, it will lead to decoherence and thus reduce the lifetime of QBs. Here, we propose suppressing the environmental dissipation in the energy-storage process of the QB by exploiting the electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT) and bound states. By constructing a hybrid system composed of a four-level atom and a coupled-cavity array, two bound states are formed in the system when the energy of the QB is in the energy band of the cavity array. Due to the bound states and the EIT effect, the ambient dissipation is significantly suppressed, which improves the lifetime of the QB. In addition, we show that when the energy of the QB is in resonance with the cavity, the ergotropy of the QB reaches the maximum. Furthermore, there exists an optimal coupling strength between two neighbouring cavities which helps improve the performance of the QB. These discoveries may shed the light on the design of high-efficiency QBs.</p>

            <h2>(FAPP) Infinity Does Macroscopic Irreversibility From Microscopic Reversibility</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Karl Svozil</p>
            <p>Infinity is central to deriving macroscopic irreversibility from reversible microscopic laws across mathematics, theoretical computer science and physics. In analysis, infinite processes - such as Dedekind cuts and Cauchy sequences - construct real numbers as equivalence classes of rational approximations, bridging discrete rationals to the continuous real line. In quantum mechanics, infinite tensor products model nested measurements, where sectorization partitions the Hilbert space into equivalence classes, reconciling unitary evolution with wavefunction collapse. In statistical mechanics, macrostates emerge as equivalence classes of microstates sharing identical macroscopic properties, providing the statistical basis for thermodynamic irreversibility despite reversible dynamics. Equivalence relations formalize For-All-Practical-Purposes (FAPP) indistinguishability, reflecting operational limits on precision and observation. Together, these examples reveal a unified framework where infinity and equivalence underpin emergent macroscopic behavior from microscopic reversibility.</p>

            <p>Quantum Max Cut (QMC) problem for systems of qubits is an example of a 2-local Hamiltonian problem, and a prominent paradigm in computational complexity theory. This paper investigates the algebraic structure of a higher-dimensional analog of the QMC problem for systems of qudits. The Quantum Max d-Cut (d-QMC) problem asks for the largest eigenvalue of a Hamiltonian on a graph with n vertices whose edges correspond to swap operators acting on $(\mathbb C^d)^{\otimes n}$. The algebra generated by the swap operators is identified as a quotient of a free algebra modulo symmetric group relations and a single additional relation of degree d. This presentation leads to a tailored hierarchy of semidefinite programs, leveraging noncommutative polynomial optimization (NPO) methods, that converges to the solution of the d-QMC problem. For a large class of complete bipartite graphs, exact solutions for the d-QMC problem are derived using the representation theory of symmetric groups and Littlewood-Richardson coefficients. Lastly, the paper addresses a refined d-QMC problem focused on finding the largest eigenvalue within each isotypic component (irreducible block) of the graph Hamiltonian. It is shown that the spectrum of the star graph Hamiltonian distinguishes between isotypic components of the 3-QMC problem. For general d, low-degree relations for separating isotypic components are presented, enabling adaptation of the global NPO hierarchy to efficiently compute the largest eigenvalue in each isotypic component.</p>

In this way, one arrives at pre-Floquet states that relate to the actual many-body Floquet states in a manner similar to the relation of site-localized Wannier states to lattice-extended Bloch states in solid-state physics. It is argued that even high-order subharmonic response can be systematically engineered, and be observed experimentally, with weakly interacting Floquet condensates comprising a sufficiently large number of particles.</p>

            <p>Semiconductors are among the most promising platforms to implement large-scale quantum computers, as advanced manufacturing techniques allow fabrication of large quantum dot arrays. Various qubit encodings can be used to store and manipulate quantum information on these quantum dot arrays. Regardless of qubit encoding, precise control over the exchange interaction between electrons confined in quantum dots in the array is critical. Furthermore, it is necessary to execute high-fidelity quantum operations concurrently to make full use of the limited coherence of individual qubits. Here, we demonstrate the parallel operation of two exchange-only qubits, consisting of six quantum dots in a linear arrangement. Using randomized benchmarking techniques, we show that issuing pulses on the five barrier gates to modulate exchange interactions in a maximally parallel way maintains the quality of qubit control relative to sequential operation. The techniques developed to perform parallel exchange pulses can be readily adapted to other quantum-dot based encodings. Moreover, we show the first experimental demonstrations of an iSWAP gate and of a charge-locking Pauli spin blockade readout method. The results are validated using cross-entropy benchmarking, a technique useful for performance characterization of larger quantum computing systems; here it is used for the first time on a quantum system based on semiconductor technology.</p>

            <p>Two-photon states are essential for quantum technologies such as metrology, lithography, and communication. One of the primary methods of two-photon generation is based on parametric down-conversion, but this suffers from low efficiency and a large footprint. This work is a detailed investigation of an alternative approach: two-photon generation from an emitter in a doubly resonant cavity. The system is modeled by the Lindblad Master Equation, and an approximate analytical solution is derived to determine the practically achievable limits on efficiency and brightness. Additionally, the optimal cavity parameters for achieving these limits are also identified. For experimentally feasible parameters, the maximum efficiency is approximately $35\%$, which is several times larger than that of parametric down-conversion-based methods. The optimal rate and efficiency for two-photon generation are achieved when the outcoupling rate of the cavity mode at the two-photon emission frequency matches the single-photon atom-field coupling strength. Moreover, the outcoupling rate of the cavity mode at the one-photon emission frequency for single photons should be minimized. The cavity field properties are also examined by studying the second-order correlation function at zero time delay and the Mandel Q parameter, revealing highly bunched two-photon emission and super-Poissonian statistics. The quantum-jump framework, combined with Monte Carlo simulations, is used to characterize the mechanism of two-photon emission and the emission spectra of the cavity. Two-photon emission is demonstrated to be a rapid cascade process of quantum jumps, and its spectrum consists of three prominent peaks corresponding to transitions between the dressed states of the system.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oliver Lunt, Thomas Kriecherbauer, Kenneth T-R McLaughlin, Curt von Keyserlingk</p>
            <p>The high complexity of many-body quantum dynamics means that essentially all approaches either exploit special structure or are approximate in nature. One such approach--the memory function formalism--involves a carefully chosen split into fast and slow modes. An approximate model for the fast modes can then be used to solve for Green's functions $G(z)$ of the slow modes. Using a formulation in operator Krylov space known as the recursion method, we prove the emergence of a universal random matrix description of the fast mode dynamics. This is captured by the level-$n$ Green's function $G_n (z)$, which we show approaches universal scaling forms in the fast limit $n\to\infty$. Notably, this emergent universality can occur in both chaotic and non-chaotic systems, provided their spectral functions are smooth. This universality of $G_n (z)$ is precisely analogous to the universality of eigenvalue correlations in random matrix theory (RMT), even though there is no explicit randomness present in the Hamiltonian. At finite $z$ we show that $G_n (z)$ approaches the Wigner semicircle law, while if $G(z)$ is the Green's function of certain hydrodynamical variables, we show that at low frequencies $G_n (z)$ is instead governed by the Bessel universality class from RMT. As an application of this universality, we give a numerical method--the spectral bootstrap--for approximating spectral functions from Lanczos coefficients. Our proof involves a map to a Riemann-Hilbert problem which we solve using a steepest-descent-type method, rigorously controlled in the $n\to\infty$ limit. We are led via steepest-descent to a Coulomb gas optimization problem, and we discuss how a recent conjecture--the `Operator Growth Hypothesis--is linked to a confinement transition in this Coulomb gas. These results elevate the recursion method to a theoretically principled framework with universal content.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuchen Tang, Yimu Bao</p>
            <p>Floquet code is a dynamical quantum memory with a periodically evolving logical space. As a defining feature, the code exhibits an anyon automorphism after each period, giving rise to a non-trivial evolution of each logical state. In this paper, we study the Floquet code under local decoherence and perfect measurements and demonstrate that below the decoherence threshold, the code is in a robust phase characterized by the anyon automorphism. We first derive the 3D statistical mechanics model for the maximum likelihood decoder of the 2D Floquet code under local Pauli decoherence. We identify a class of two-qubit Pauli channels under which the 3D statistical mechanics model becomes decoupled 2D models and obtain the threshold for such decoherence channels. We then propose a diagnostic of the anyon automorphism in the presence of local decoherence. We analytically show that this diagnostic distinguishes the Floquet code from the toric code under repeated syndrome measurements and undergoes a phase transition at the threshold.</p>

            <h2>A Note on Instantons in a 1D Same-Level Asymmetric Double Well</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Klaus Bering</p>
            <p>We prove formulas for the multi-instanton corrections to the overlap and energies of a 1D same-level asymmetric double well using the Euclidean path integral. Both the odd and even instanton sectors are summed to all orders. The double well is same-level asymmetric in the sense that the potentials at neighboring wells have the same bottom level but can have different Hessians/curvatures/frequencies, which modify Coleman's original formulas. This for instance implies that the reference model used to calculate the functional determinant of quantum fluctuations must now interpolate between simple harmonic oscillators of different frequencies. Examples of symmetric double and triple wells are worked out.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Swagat Kumar, Jan-Nico Zaech, Colin Michael Wilmott, Luc Van Gool</p>
            <p>Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are a promising approach to leverage Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers. However, choosing optimal quantum circuits that efficiently solve a given VQA problem is a non-trivial task. Quantum Architecture Search (QAS) algorithms enable automatic generation of quantum circuits tailored to the provided problem. Existing QAS approaches typically adapt classical neural architecture search techniques, training machine learning models to sample relevant circuits, but often overlook the inherent quantum nature of the circuits they produce. By reformulating QAS from a quantum perspective, we propose a sampling-free differentiable QAS algorithm that models the search process as the evolution of a quantum mixed state, which emerges from the search space of quantum circuits. The mixed state formulation also enables our method to incorporate generic noise models, for example the depolarizing channel, which cannot be modeled by state vector simulation. We validate our method by finding circuits for state initialization and Hamiltonian optimization tasks, namely the variational quantum eigensolver and the unweighted max-cut problems. We show our approach to be comparable to, if not outperform, existing QAS techniques while requiring significantly fewer quantum simulations during training, and also show improved robustness levels to noise.</p>

Applying this framework to cases like NMR, multireference chemistry, and radicals reveals both significant opportunities and key barriers on the path to practical advantage.

            <h2>Quantum thermalization and average entropy of a subsystem</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Smitarani Mishra, Shaon Sahoo</p>
            <p>Page's seminal result on the average von Neumann (VN) entropy does not immediately apply to realistic many-body systems which are restricted to physically relevant smaller subspaces. We investigate here the VN entropy averaged over the pure states in the subspace $\mathcal{H}_E$ corresponding to a narrow energy shell centered at energy $E$. We find that the average entropy is $\overline{S}_{1} \simeq \ln d_1$, where $d_1$ represents first subsystem's effective number of states relevant to the energy scale $E$. If $d_E = \dim{(\mathcal{H}_E)}$ and $D$ ($D_1$) is the Hilbert space dimension of the full system (first subsystem), we estimate that $d_1 \simeq D_1^\gamma$, where $\gamma = \ln (d_E) / \ln (D)$ for nonintegrable (chaotic) systems and $\gamma < \ln (d_E) / \ln (D)$ for integrable systems. This result can be reinterpreted as a volume-law of entropy, where the volume-law coefficient depends on the density-of-states for nonintegrable systems, and remains below the maximal possible value for integrable systems. We numerically analyze a spin model to substantiate our main results.</p>

            <p>Optically active spin defects in van der Waals (vdW) materials have recently emerged as versatile quantum sensors, enabling applications from nanoscale magnetic field detection to the exploration of novel quantum phenomena in condensed matter systems. Their ease of exfoliation and compatibility with device integration make them promising candidates for future quantum technologies. Here we report the observation and room-temperature coherent control of spin defects in the high-temperature crystalline phase of germanium disulfide ($\beta$-GeS2), a two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor with low nuclear spin density. The observed spin defects exhibit spin-1/2 behavior, and their spin dynamics can be explained by a weakly coupled spin-pair model. We implement dynamical decoupling techniques to extend the spin coherence time (T$_2$) by a factor of 20. Finally, we use density functional theory (DFT) calculations to estimate the structure and spin densities of two possible spin defect candidates. This work will help expand the field of quantum sensing with spin defects in van der Waals materials.</p>

            <p>We present an end-to-end quantum algorithm for simulating nonlinear dynamics described by a system of stochastic dissipative differential equations with a quadratic nonlinearity. The stochastic part of the system is modeled by a Gaussian noise in the equation of motion and in the initial conditions. Our algorithm can approximate the expected value of any correlation function that depends on $O(1)$ variables with rigorous bounds on the approximation error. The runtime scales polynomially with $\log{N}$, $t$, $J$, and $\lambda_1^{-1}$, where $N$ is the total number of variables, $t$ is the evolution time, $J$ is the nonlinearity strength, and $\lambda_1$ is the smallest dissipation rate. However, the runtime scales exponentially with a parameter quantifying inverse relative error in the initial conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first rigorous quantum algorithm capable of simulating strongly nonlinear systems with $J\gg \lambda_1$ at the cost poly-logarithmic in $N$ and polynomial in $t$. The considered simulation problem is shown to be BQP-complete, providing a strong evidence for a quantum advantage. We benchmark the quantum algorithm via numerical experiments by simulating a vortex flow in the 2D Navier Stokes equation.</p>

            <p>We study the interactions mediated by symmetric superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID), their renormalizations, and applicability of the anharmonic oscillator model for a coupled phase qubit. The coupling SQUID can switch between single- or two-photon interaction in situ. We consider a coupled resonator and an rf SQUID. The latter dwells in the vicinity of its metastable well holding a number of anharmonic energy states and acts as an artificial atom known as the phase qubit. Apart from the linear and two-photon couplings, interactions of optomechanical type and a cross-Kerr coupling arise. Near the two-photon resonance, we calculate the renormalizations due to nonresonant interactions, which are more prominent with the higher Josephson energy of the coupler. We interpret the renormalizations by depicting some of the virtual processes involved. That also allows us to determine the minimal amount of metastable states in the phase qubit for the renormalization formulas to hold.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chanaprom Cholsuk, Sujin Suwanna, Tobias Vogl</p>
            <p>Quantum emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have gained significant attention due to a wide range of defects that offer high quantum efficiency and single-photon purity at room temperature. Most theoretical studies on hBN defects simulate monolayers, as this is computationally cheaper than calculating bulk structures. However, most experimental studies are carried out on multilayer to bulk hBN, which creates additional possibilities for discrepancies between theory and experiment. In this work, we present an extended database of hBN defects that includes a comprehensive set of bulk hBN defects along with their excited-state photophysical properties. The database features over 120 neutral defects, systematically evaluated across charge states ranging from -2 to 2 (600 defects in total). For each defect, the most stable charge and spin configurations are identified and used to compute the zero-phonon line, photoluminescence spectrum, absorption spectrum, Huang-Rhys (HR) factor, interactive radiative lifetimes, transition dipole moments, and polarization characteristics. Our analysis reveals that the electron-phonon coupling strength is primarily influenced by the presence of vacancies, which tend to induce stronger lattice distortions and broaden phonon sidebands. Additionally, correlation analysis shows that while most properties are independent, the HR factor strongly correlates with the configuration coordinates. All data are publicly available at this https URL, along with a new application programming interface (API) to facilitate integration with machine learning workflows. This database is therefore designed to bridge the gap between theory and experiment, aid in the reliable identification of quantum emitters, and support the development of machine-learning-driven approaches in quantum materials research.</p>

We first propose two new measures of quantum-state texture and introduce a specific functional form for constructing such measures via the convex roof method. Then, we determine the maximum probability of quantum state transformation under free operations. Finally, we establish connections between quantum-state texture and other prominent quantum resources, such as coherence, imaginarity, and predictability.

The proposed geometric measure satisfies this framework's conditions for both quantum coherence and entanglement, and it precisely quantifies the minimal disadvantage of a given state compared to maximal resource states in subchannel discrimination under certain conditions.

            <h2>A Modular, Adaptive, and Scalable Quantum Factoring Algorithm</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alok Shukla, Prakash Vedula</p>
            <p>Shor's algorithm for integer factorization offers an exponential speedup over classical methods but remains impractical on Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware due to the need for many coherent qubits and very deep circuits. Building on our recent work on adaptive and windowed phase-estimation methods, we have developed a modular, windowed formulation of Shor's algorithm that mitigates these limitations by restructuring phase estimation into shallow, independent circuit blocks that can be executed sequentially or in parallel, followed by lightweight classical postprocessing. This approach allows for a reduction in the size of the phase (or counting) register from a large number of qubits down to a small, fixed block size of only a few qubits (for example, three or four phase qubits were sufficient for the computational examples considered in this work), while leaving the work register requirement unchanged. The independence of the blocks allows for parallel execution and makes the approach more compatible with near-term hardware than the standard Shor's formulation. An additional feature of the framework is the overlap mechanism, which introduces redundancy between blocks and enables robust reconstruction of phase information, though zero-overlap configurations can also succeed in certain regimes. Numerical simulations verify the correctness of the modular formulation while also showing substantial reductions in counting qubits per block.</p>

            <h2>Certified Pruning from Counterfactual Consistency: Exact Certificates and Structured SAT Families</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maximilian Ralph Peter von Liechtenstein</p>
            <p>We introduce a certified pruning framework that consolidates the principles of counterfactual consistency and their networked extensions into a single operational model, with consequences for both quantum foundations and cryptographic hardness. First, we formalize epsilon-counterfactual instrumentation and epsilon-stability, capturing noisy but testable constraints in laboratory contextuality experiments. Second, we extend these constraints to networks of contexts, yielding contextuality-type inequalities that apply globally across a CNF-SAT instance. Third, we implement a propagate-and-prune solver in which every learned clause is certified by a dual Farkas certificate verified in exact arithmetic. This guarantees soundness while enabling sub-exponential pruning: if the induced network provides a per-variable pruning rate rho in (0,1) under epsilon-stable propagation, the search runs in time (2-rho)^n. These bounds do not contradict ETH or SETH: the worst case remains exponential, but structured families admit provable speedups. In cryptography, the results highlight how such reductions could affect hardness margins in idealized primitives; in foundations, they motivate laboratory tests of counterfactual bounds as potential probes of computational complexity. We explicitly distinguish experimental epsilon, which quantifies laboratory visibility, from numerical epsilon, which is a solver tolerance. This builds directly on our earlier framework for epsilon-instrumentation, here integrated into certified pruning with dual certificates.</p>

            <h2>Stabilizer-Shannon Renyi Equivalence: Exact Results for Quantum Critical Chains</h2>

            <p>Shannon-Renyi and stabilizer entropies are key diagnostics of structure, non-stabilizerness, phase transitions, and universality in quantum many-body states. We establish an exact correspondence for quadratic fermions: for any nondegenerate Gaussian eigenstate, the stabilizer Renyi entropy equals the Shannon-Renyi entropy of a number-conserving free-fermion eigenstate on a doubled system, evaluated in the computational basis. Specializing to the transverse-field Ising (TFI) chain, the TFI ground state stabilizer entropies maps to the Shannon-Renyi entropies of the XX-chain ground state of length $2L$. Building on this correspondence, together with other exact identities we prove, closed expressions for the stabilizer entropy at indices $\alpha=\frac{1}{2},2,4$ for a broad class of critical closed free-fermion systems were derived. Each of these can be written with respect to the universal functions of the TFI chain. We further obtain conformal-field-theory scaling laws for the stabilizer entropy under both periodic and open boundaries at arbitrary Renyi index for these critical systems.</p>

            <p>Monitored dynamics in quantum circuits provide tunable platforms for the realization of novel non-equilibrium phases. Motivated by recent advances in monitored Kitaev circuits, we investigate the monitored dynamics of the qudit ($d=4$) generalizations of the Kitaev model on the honeycomb and square lattices. In the absence of additional perturbations, the measurement-only dynamics of these models map onto multi-flavor loop models and display either critical or area-law entanglement scaling. Magnetic field terms couple different flavors and when measured with sufficiently large probability, they enhance the stability of the area-law phase that hosts the logical qubits. In a circuit picture, these terms correspond to single-qubit measurements and can be interpreted as errors. We also examine the impact of two-qubit measurements that commute with the plaquette operator, which induce effective non-quadratic interactions between Majorana fermions. These interactions can drive a transition to a volume-law-entangled phase and, for sufficiently strong coupling, stabilize a distinct area-law phase with an additional logical qubit for the square lattice model. Our results reveal a rich interplay between quantum spin liquids and monitored circuit dynamics, highlighting new mechanisms for engineering and controlling entanglement phases in multi-flavor Majorana systems.</p>

            <h2>Functional Information in Quantum Darwinism: An Operational Measure of Objectivity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arda Batin Tank</p>
            <p>This paper investigates the emergence of classical objectivity in quantum systems through the measure of Functional Information in Quantum Darwinism ($FI_{QD}$). The goal is to quantify objectivity as the abundance of environment fragments that independently contain sufficient information about a system's pointer states. The method relies on the Holevo quantity -- an upper bound on accessible information -- and introduces a tolerance criterion called $\delta$-adequacy, where fragments are considered adequate if they retain at least $(1-\delta)H_S$ bits of pointer information. Numerical simulations of a dephasing model with fragment sampling reveal three robust features: (i) an early-time regime where $\log R_\delta(t)$ grows approximately linearly, (ii) capacity-limited plateaus determined by fragment size and environment dimension, and (iii) stability of the onset criterion under different sampling strategies and overlap corrections. These results establish $FI_{QD}$ as a practical and conservative yardstick for operational objectivity. Beyond numerical findings, the analysis links redundancy growth to thermodynamic costs of record formation and interprets $FI_{QD}$ as a resource monotone under noisy dynamics. The study suggests that classical objectivity emerges not as an assumption but as a quantifiable, resource-limited abundance of redundant records.</p>

            <p>The Mpemba effect is the phenomenon whereby systems farther from equilibrium may relax faster. In this work, we show that this counterintuitive behavior appears in the very measures that define quantum complexity. Using the framework of quantum resource theories, we study the dynamics of coherence, imaginarity, non-Gaussianity, and magic state resources in random circuit models. Our results reveal that coherence and imaginarity display a quantum Mpemba effect when the system is initialized in resourceful product states, while non-Gaussianity and magic do not. Strikingly, all four resources exhibit the so-called Pontus-Mpemba effect: an initial "preheating" stage accelerates relaxation compared to direct "cooling" dynamics. Taken together, our findings show that Mpemba physics extends beyond thermodynamics and asymmetry, emerging broadly in the resource theories that capture aspects of quantum complexity.</p>

            <p>We establish the conditions under which a conservation law associated with a non-invertible operator may be realized as a symmetry in quantum mechanics. As established by Wigner, all quantum symmetries must be represented by either unitary or antiunitary transformations. Relinquishing an implicit assumption of invertibility, we demonstrate that the fundamental invariance of quantum transition probabilities under the application of symmetries mandates that all non-invertible symmetries may only correspond to {\it projective} unitary or antiunitary transformations, i.e., {\it partial isometries}. This extends the notion of physical states beyond conventional rays in Hilbert space to equivalence classes in an {\it extended, gauged Hilbert space}, thereby broadening the traditional understanding of symmetry transformations in quantum theory. We discuss consequences of this result and explicitly illustrate how, in simple model systems, whether symmetries be invertible or non-invertible may be inextricably related to the particular boundary conditions that are being used.</p>

            <p>Quantum random access memories (QRAMs) are pivotal for data-intensive quantum algorithms, but existing general-purpose and domain-specific architectures are hampered by a critical bottleneck: a heavy reliance on non-Clifford gates (e.g., T-gates), which are prohibitively expensive to implement fault-tolerantly. To address this challenge, we introduce the Stabilizer-QRAM (Stab-QRAM), a domain-specific architecture tailored for data with an affine Boolean structure ($f(\mathbf{x}) = A\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{b}$ over $\mathbb{F}_2$), a class of functions vital for optimization, time-series analysis, and quantum linear systems algorithms. We demonstrate that the gate interactions required to implement the matrix $A$ form a bipartite graph. By applying K√∂nig's edge-coloring theorem to this graph, we prove that Stab-QRAM achieves an optimal logical circuit depth of $O(\log N)$ for $N$ data items, matching its $O(\log N)$ space complexity. Critically, the Stab-QRAM is constructed exclusively from Clifford gates (CNOT and X), resulting in a zero $T$-count. This design completely circumvents the non-Clifford bottleneck, eliminating the need for costly magic state distillation and making it exceptionally suited for early fault-tolerant quantum computing platforms. We highlight Stab-QRAM's utility as a resource-efficient oracle for applications in discrete dynamical systems, and as a core component in Quantum Linear Systems Algorithms, providing a practical pathway for executing data-intensive tasks on emerging quantum hardware.</p>

            <p>Quantum generalizations of the Fisher information are important in quantum information science, with applications in high energy and condensed matter physics and in quantum estimation theory, machine learning, and optimization. One can derive a quantum generalization of the Fisher information matrix in a natural way as the Hessian matrix arising in a Taylor expansion of a smooth divergence. Such an approach is appealing for quantum information theorists, given the ubiquity of divergences in quantum information theory. In contrast to the classical case, there is not a unique quantum generalization of the Fisher information matrix, similar to how there is not a unique quantum generalization of the relative entropy or the R√©nyi relative entropy. In this paper, I derive information matrices arising from the log-Euclidean, $\alpha$-$z$, and geometric R√©nyi relative entropies, with the main technical tool for doing so being the method of divided differences for calculating matrix derivatives. Interestingly, for all non-negative values of the R√©nyi parameter $\alpha$, the log-Euclidean R√©nyi relative entropy leads to the Kubo-Mori information matrix, and the geometric R√©nyi relative entropy leads to the right-logarithmic derivative Fisher information matrix. Thus, the resulting information matrices obey the data-processing inequality for all non-negative values of the R√©nyi parameter $\alpha$ even though the original quantities do not. Additionally, I derive and establish basic properties of $\alpha$-$z$ information matrices resulting from the $\alpha$-$z$ R√©nyi relative entropies. For parameterized thermal states and time-evolved states, I establish formulas for their $\alpha$-$z$ information matrices and hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for estimating them, with applications in quantum Boltzmann machine learning.</p>

            <h2>Quantum steering for different types of Bell-like states in gravitational background</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Si-Han Li, Si-Han Shang, Shu-Min Wu</p>
            <p>In a relativistic framework, it is generally accepted that quantum steering of maximally entangled states provide greater advantages in practical applications compared to non-maximally entangled states. In this paper, we investigate quantum steering for four different types of Bell-like states of fermionic modes near the event horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole. In some parameter spaces, the peak of steering asymmetry corresponds to a transition from two-way to one-way steerability for Bell-like states under the influence of the Hawking effect. It is intriguing to find that the fermionic steerability of the maximally entangled states experiences sudden death with the Hawking temperature, while the fermionic steerability of the non-maximally entangled states maintains indefinite persistence at infinite Hawking temperature. In contrast to prior research, this finding suggests that quantum steering of non-maximally entangled states is more advantageous than that of maximally entangled states for processing quantum tasks in the gravitational background. This surprising result overturns the traditional idea of ``the advantage of maximally entangled steering in the relativistic framework" and provides a new perspective for understanding the Hawking effect of the black hole.</p>

            <h2>Robust purely optical signatures of Floquet states in laser-dressed crystals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vishal Tiwari, Roman Korol, Ignacio Franco</p>
            <p>Strong light-matter interactions can create non-equilibrium materials with on-demand novel functionalities. For periodically driven solids, the Floquet theorem provides the natural states to characterize the physical properties of these laser-dressed systems. However, signatures of the Floquet states are needed, as common experimental conditions, such as pulsed laser excitation and dissipative many-body dynamics, can disrupt their formation and survival. Here, we identify a tell-tale signature of Floquet states in the linear optical response of laser-dressed solids that remains prominent even in the presence of strong spectral congestion of bulk matter. To do so, we introduce a computationally efficient strategy based on the Floquet formalism to finally capture the full frequency-dependence in the optical response properties of realistic laser-dressed crystals, and use it investigate the Floquet engineering in a first-principle model for ZnO of full dimensionality. The computations reveal intense, spectrally isolated, laser-controllable, absorption/stimulated emission features at mid-infrared energies present for a wide range of laser-driving conditions that arise due to the hybridization of the Floquet states. As such, these spectral features open a purely optical pathway to investigate the birth and survival of Floquet states while avoiding the experimental challenges of fully reconstructing the band structure.</p>

            <h2>QuIC: Quantum-Inspired Compound Adapters for Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Snehal Raj, Brian Coyle</p>
            <p>Scaling full finetuning of large foundation models strains GPU memory and training time. Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods address this issue via adapter modules which update only a small subset of model parameters. In this work, we introduce Quantum-Inspired Compound Adapters (QuIC Adapters), a PEFT approach inspired from Hamming-weight preserving quantum circuits that can effectively finetune a model using less than 0.02\% memory footprint of the base model. QuIC adapters preserve pretrained representations by enforcing orthogonality in weight parameters, and have native deployment mechanisms on quantum computers. We test QuIC adapters by finetuning large language models like LLaMA and vision transformers on language, math, reasoning and vision benchmarks. In its first-order configuration, QuIC recovers the performance of existing orthogonal methods, while higher-order configurations enable substantial parameter compression (over 40x smaller than LoRA) for a modest performance trade-off, unlocking applications in highly resource-constrained environments. Through ablation studies, we determine that combining multiple Hamming-weight orders with orthogonality and matrix compounding are essential for performant finetuning. Our findings suggest that QuIC adapters offers a promising direction for efficient finetuning of foundation models in resource-constrained environments.</p>

            <h2>Beyond holography: the entropic quantum gravity foundations of image processing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ginestra Bianconi</p>
            <p>Recently, thanks to the development of artificial intelligence (AI) there is increasing scientific attention in establishing the connections between theoretical physics and AI. Traditionally, these connections have been focusing mostly on the relation between string theory and image processing and involve important theoretical paradigms such as holography. Recently G. Bianconi has formulated the Gravity from Entropy (GfE) approach to quantum gravity in which gravity is derived from the geometric quantum relative entropy (GQRE) between two metrics associated with the Lorentzian spacetime. Here it is demonstrated that the famous Perona-Malik algorithm for image processing is the gradient flow that maximizes the GfE action in its simple warm-up scenario. Specifically, this algorithm is the outcome of the maximization of the GfE action calculated between two Euclidean metrics: the one of the support of the image and the one induced by the image. As the Perona-Malik algorithm is known to preserve sharp contours, this implies that the GfE action, does not in general lead to uniform images upon iteration of the gradient flow dynamics as it would be intuitively expected from entropic actions maximising classical entropies. Rather, the outcome of the maximization of the GfE action is compatible with the preservation of complex structures. These results provide the geometrical and information theory foundations for the Perona-Malik algorithm and might contribute to establish deeper connections between GfE, machine learning and brain research.</p>

            <p>Optical lattice clocks (OLCs) are at the forefront of precision metrology, operating near a standard quantum limit (SQL) set by quantum noise. Harnessing quantum entanglement offers a promising route to surpass this limit, yet there remain practical roadblocks concerning scalability and measurement resolution requirements. Here, we adapt the holonomic quantum-gate concept to develop a novel Rabi-type "global-phase spectroscopy" (GPS) that utilizes the detuning-sensitive global Aharanov-Anandan phase. With this approach, we are able to demonstrate quantum-amplified time-reversal spectroscopy in an OLC that achieves 2.4(7) dB metrological gain without subtracting the laser noise, and 4.0(8) dB improvement in laser noise sensitivity beyond the SQL. We further introduce rotary echo to protect the dynamics from inhomogeneities in light-atom coupling and implement a laser-noise-canceling differential measurement through symmetric phase encoding in two nuclear spin states. Our technique is not limited by measurement resolution, scales easily owing to the global nature of entangling interaction, and exhibits high resilience to typical experimental imperfections. We expect it to be broadly applicable to next-generation atomic clocks and other quantum sensors approaching the fundamental quantum precision limits.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mikolaj Roguski, Aleksandr Shlykov, Ziv Meir, Stefan Willitsch</p>
            <p>Quantum-logic spectroscopy has become an increasingly important tool for the state detection and readout of trapped atomic and molecular ions which do not possess easily accessible closed-cycling optical transitions. In this approach, the internal state of the target ion is mapped onto a co-trapped auxiliary ion. This mapping is typically mediated by normal modes of motion of the two-ion Coulomb crystal in the trap. The present study investigates the role of spectator modes not directly involved in a measurement protocol relying on a state-dependent optical-dipole force. We identify a Debye-Waller-type effect that modifies the response of the two-ion string to the force. We show that cooling the spectator modes of the string allows for the detection of the rovibrational ground state of an N$_2^+$ molecular ion with a computed statistical fidelity exceeding 99.99%, improving on previous experiments by more than an order of magnitude while also halving the experimental time. This enhanced sensitivity enables the simultaneous identification of multiple rotational states with markedly weaker signals.</p>

            <p>Donor-acceptor pairs (DAPs) in wide-bandgap semiconductors are promising platforms for the realization of quantum technologies, due to their optically controllable, long-range dipolar interactions. Specifically, Al-N DAPs in bulk silicon carbide (SiC) have been predicted to enable coherent coupling over distances exceeding 10 nm. However, their practical implementations require an understanding of the properties of these pairs near surfaces and interfaces. Here, using first principles calculations we investigate how the presence of surfaces influence the stability and optical properties of Al-N DAPs in SiC, and we show that they retain favorable optical properties comparable to their bulk counterparts, despite a slight increase in electron-phonon coupling. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of surface-defect pairs (SDPs), where an electron-hole pair is generated between a near-surface defect and an occupied surface state located in the bandgap of the material. We show that vanadium-based SDPs near OH-terminated 4H-SiC surfaces exhibit dipoles naturally aligned perpendicular to the surface, greatly enhancing dipole-dipole coupling between SDPs. Our results also reveal significant polarization-dependent modulation in the stimulated emission and photoionization cross sections of V-based SDPs, which are tunable by two orders of magnitude via the polarization angle of the incident laser light. The near-surface defects investigated here provide novel possibilities for the development of hybrid quantum-classical interfaces, as they can be used to mediate information transfer between quantum nodes and integrated photonic circuits.</p>

            <p>Floquet engineering of electronic states by light is a central topic in modern experiments. However, the impact of many-body interactions on the single-electron properties remains unclear in this non-equilibrium situation. We propose that interaction effects could be reasonably understood by performing perturbative expansion in both the pump field and the electron-electron interaction when computing physical quantities. As an example, we apply this approach to semiconductors and show analytically that excitonic effects, i.e., effects of electron-hole interaction, lead to dramatic corrections to the single-electron Floquet spectra even when the excitons are only virtually excited by the pump light. We compute these effects in phosphorene and monolayer MoS$_2$ for time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and ultrafast optical experiments.</p>

            <p>We show that an effective gravitational field naturally emerges in quantum materials with long-wavelength spin (or pseudospin) textures. When the itinerant electrons' spin strongly couples to the background spin texture, it effectively behaves as a spinless particle in a curved space, with the curvature arising from quantum corrections to the electron's spin orientation. The emergent curved space gives rise to the electron lensing effect, an analog of the gravitational lensing. The lensing effect can appear in systems without (emergent) magnetic fields, such as those with coplanar spin textures. Our work shows that novel ``gravitational'' phenomena generically appear in quantum systems due to nonadiabaticity, opening new research directions in quantum physics.</p>

We study the decay rate for the thermal fluctuation scenarios and its dependence on the potential shape, and found that the false vacuum decay occurs following an exponentially decay rate, and the speed of vacuum decay decreases when the initial energy of the system decreases and the potential height increase. The discrepancy between the simulation results and the theoretical prediction of finite temperature effective field theory is observed.</p>

            <h2>On the electronic path integral normal modes of the Meyer-Miller-Stock-Thoss representation of nonadiabatic dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lauren E. Cook, Timothy J. H. Hele (University College London)</p>
            <p>Accurate and efficient simulation of nonadiabatic dynamics is highly desirable for understanding charge and energy transfer in complex systems. A key criterion for obtaining an accurate method is conservation of the Quantum Boltzmann Distribution (QBD). For a single surface, Matsubara dynamics is known to conserve the QBD, as a consequence of truncating the dynamics in the higher normal modes of the imaginary-time path integral. Recently, a nonadiabatic Matsubara (NA-Mats) dynamics has been proposed (J. Chem. Phys., 2021, 154, 124124) which truncates in the normal modes of the nuclear variables but not in the electronic variables, which are described with the Meyer-Miller-Stock-Thoss (MMST) representation. Surprisingly, this NA-Mats method does not appear to conserve the QBD for a general system. This poses the question of the effect of truncating the higher path integral normal modes of the electronic variables in the MMST representation. In this article, we present what we believe is the first study of electronic normal modes of the MMST representation. We find that observables are not usually a function of a finite number of normal modes and that the higher normal modes are not constrained by the distribution, unlike in conventional nuclear normal modes. Furthermore, truncating the dynamics in MMST normal modes leads to inaccurate correlation functions and while the QBD appears conserved for an ensemble of trajectories, it is not for a single trajectory. Overall, this suggests that MMST path integral normal modes are not optimal for obtaining an accurate, QBD conserving nonadiabatic dynamics method.</p>

However, most ML approaches rely on access to large, representative datasets designed to capture the full spectrum of data quality encountered in practice, with both high- and low-quality data for training, benchmarking, and validation, with labels capturing key features of the device state. Collating such datasets experimentally is challenging due to limited data availability, slow measurement bandwidths, and the labor-intensive nature of labeling. QDFlow is an open-source physics simulator for multi-QD arrays that generates realistic synthetic data with ground-truth labels. QDFlow combines a self-consistent Thomas-Fermi solver, a dynamic capacitance model, and flexible noise modules to simulate charge stability diagrams and ray-based data closely resembling experiments. With an extensive set of parameters that can be varied and customizable noise models, QDFlow supports the creation of large, diverse datasets for ML development, benchmarking, and quantum device research.</p>

Here, we compute the polarizations required for electric- and magnetic-dipole induced transitions through spin-Hamiltonian models of molecular spin triangles. We show that the polarization allows a clear discrimination between the two kinds of transitions. In addition, it allows one to identify the physical origin of the zero-field splitting in the ground multiplet, a debated issue with significant implications on the coherence properties of the spin qubit implemented in molecular spin triangles.</p>

            <p>We characterize novel probability distributions for CSS codes. Such classes of error correcting codes, originally introduced by Calderbank, Shor, and Steane, are of great significance in advancing the fidelity of Quantum computation, with implications for future near term applications. Within the context of Quantum key distribution, such codes, as examined by Ostrev in arXiv: 2109.06709 along with two-universal hashing protocols, have greatly simplified Quantum phases of computation for unconditional security. To further examine novel applications of two-universal hashing protocols, particularly through the structure of parity check matrices, we demonstrate how being able to efficiently compute functions of the parity check matrices relates to marginals of a suitably defined probability measure supported over random matrices. The security of the two-universal QKD hashing protocol will be shown to depend upon the computation of purified states of random matrices, which relates to probabilistic collision bounds between two hashing functions. Central to our approach are the introduction of novel real, simulator, and ideal, isometries, hence allowing for efficient computations of functions of the two parity check matrices. As a result of being able to perform such computations involving parity check matrices, the security of the two-universal hashing protocol is a factor of $2^{ \frac{5}{2} ( 5 - \frac{3}{2} ) + \mathrm{log}_2 \sqrt{C}}$ less secure, for some strictly positive constant $C$.</p>

To further assess the quality of the variational states, we evaluate the magnetization in the x and z directions for the quantum Ising models and compute the topological entanglement entropy for the Kitaev honeycomb model. Finally, we prepare approximate ground states of the Kitaev honeycomb model with 48 qubits, in both the gapped and gapless regimes, on Quantinuum's System Model H2 quantum computer using parametrized circuits obtained from Pauli Path simulation.

            <p>Non-Hermitian quantum systems, governed by nonunitary evolution, offer powerful tools for manipulating quantum states through engineered loss. A prime example is coherent absorption, where quantum states undergo phase-dependent partial or complete absorption in a lossy medium. Here, we demonstrate a fully programmable implementation of nonunitary transformations that emulate coherent absorption of quantum light using a programmable integrated linear photonic circuit, with loss introduced via coupling to an ancilla mode [Phys. Rev. X 8, 021017; 2018]. Probing the circuit with a single-photon dual-rail state reveals phase-controlled coherent tunability between perfect transmission and perfect absorption. A two-photon NOON state input, by contrast, exhibits switching between deterministic single-photon and probabilistic two-photon absorption. Across a range of input phases and circuit configurations, we observe nonclassical effects such as anti-coalescence and bunching, along with continuous and coherent tuning of output Fock state probability amplitudes. Classical Fisher information analysis reveals phase sensitivity peaks of 0.79 for single-photon states and 3.7 for NOON states, exceeding the shot-noise limit of 2 and approaching the Heisenberg limit of 4.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muhib Ullah, Muhammad Idrees, Said Mikki</p>
            <p>Quantum entanglement is a fundamental phenomenon in quantum information science and a crucial resource for quantum technologies such as precision sensing, secure communication, and computation. In hybrid cavity magno-optomechanical systems, entanglement among cavity photons, magnons, and phonons enables manipulation of quantum states across different modes via radiation pressure-based light-matter interaction. We propose a hybrid optomechanical cavity-magnonic setup with Yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere allowing magnons to couple with photons via magnetic-dipole interaction. The system also uses optomechanical and electrostatic interactions to entangle cavity photons and mechanical resonators. We focus on how the magnon nonlinear Kerr effect and varying coupling strengths influence entanglement dynamics. By analysing nonlinear effects alongside other coupling parameters, we identify optimal conditions for initiating and sustaining robust entanglement between the motional modes (phonons) of two Coulomb-coupled mechanical resonators. Our model predicts that adding Coulomb interaction and magnon coupling enhances the degree and tunability of entanglement, making it more resilient to thermal baths at 3 K. This study addresses how to optimize and sustain phonon-phonon entanglement in complex hybrid quantum systems. These findings offer insights relevant to developing quantum memories for continuous variable quantum information processing and other quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Any type of spectroscopy can be efficiently simulated on a quantum computer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liam P. Flew, Ivan Kassal</p>
            <p>Spectroscopy is the most important method for probing the structure of molecules. However, predicting molecular spectra on classical computers is computationally expensive, with the most accurate methods having a cost that grows exponentially with molecule size. Quantum computers have been shown to simulate simple types of optical spectroscopy efficiently -- with a cost polynomial in molecule size -- using methods such as time-dependent simulations of photoinduced wavepackets. Here, we show that any type of spectroscopy can be efficiently simulated on a quantum computer using a time-domain approach, including spectroscopies of any order, any frequency range, and involving both electric and magnetic transitions. Our method works by computing any spectroscopic correlation function based on the corresponding double-sided Feynman diagram, the canonical description of spectroscopic interactions. The approach can be used to simulate spectroscopy of both closed and open molecular systems using both digital and analog quantum computers.</p>

            <h2>Quantum sensing with discrete time crystals in the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick Model</h2>

            <p>Quantum phase transitions have been shown to be highly beneficial for quantum sensing, owing to diverging quantum Fisher information close to criticality. In this work we consider a periodically modulated Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model to show that discrete time crystal (DTC) phase transition in this setup can enable us to achieve quantum-enhanced high-precision sensing of field strength. We employ a detailed finite-size scaling analysis and a time-averaged Inverse Participation Ratio analysis to determine the critical properties of this second-order phase transition. Our studies provide a comprehensive understanding of how quantum criticality in DTCs involving long-range interactions can be harnessed for advanced quantum sensing applications.</p>

            <h2>Testing Quantum Mechanics with Quantum Computers: Qubit Information Capacity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tim Palmer</p>
            <p>Motivated by John Wheeler's assertion that the continuum nature of Hilbert Space conceals the information-theoretic nature of the quantum wavefunction, a specific discretisation of complex Hilbert Space is proposed, leading to the notion of qubit information capacity $N_{\mathrm{max}}$: for any $N \ge N_{\mathrm{max}}$-qubit state, there is insufficient information in the $N$ qubits to allocate even one bit to each of the $2^{N+1}-2$ degrees of freedom demanded by complex Hilbert Space and hence unitary quantum mechanics. Using gravitised quantum mechanics, it is estimated that, for typical qubits in a quantum computer, $N_{\mathrm{max}} \approx 500-1,000$. By contrast, $N_{\mathrm{max}}=\infty$ in quantum mechanics. On this basis, it is predicted that the exponential speed up of algorithms such as Shor's will have saturated in quantum computers which use more than about 1,000 logical qubits. This predicted breakdown of quantum mechanics should be testable within the coming decade. If verified, factoring 2048-RSA integers using quantum computers will for all practical purposes be impossible. The existence of a finite qubit information capacity has profound implications for reimagining the foundations of quantum physics (including the measurement problem, complementarity and nonlocality) and for developing novel theories which synthesise quantum and gravitational physics.</p>

            <h2>Universal classical-quantum channel resolvability and private channel coding</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Takaya Matsuura, Masahito Hayashi, Min-Hsiu Hsieh</p>
            <p>We address the problem of constructing fully universal private channel coding protocols for classical-quantum (c-q) channels. Previous work constructed universal decoding strategies, but the encoder relied on random coding, which prevents fully universal code construction. In this work, we resolve this gap by identifying an explicit structural property of codebooks -- namely, the spectral expansion of an associated Schreier graph -- that guarantees universal channel resolvability. Our analysis reveals how this property can be related to channel resolvability through the theory of induced representation. Our main technical result shows that when the transition matrix of a graph associated with a codebook has a large spectral gap, the channel output induced by uniformly sampled codewords is asymptotically indistinguishable from the target output distribution, independently of the channel. This establishes the first deterministic, channel-independent construction of resolvability codebooks. Building on this, we construct a fully universal private channel coding protocol by combining it with universal c-q channel coding based on the Schur-Weyl duality. With appropriate modifications to the requirements on codebooks of universal c-q channel coding, we show that our fully universal private channel coding achieves the known optimal rate. This work thus sheds new light on the expander property of a graph in the context of secure communication.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Namasi G Sankar, Georgios Miliotis, Simon Caton</p>
            <p>Quantum Annealing (QA) and QAOA are promising quantum optimisation algorithms used for finding approximate solutions to combinatorial problems on near-term NISQ systems. Many NP-hard problems can be reformulated as Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimisation (QUBO), which maps naturally onto quantum Hamiltonians. However, the limited qubit counts of current NISQ devices restrict practical deployment of such algorithms. In this study, we present the Hamiltonian Auto-Decomposition Optimisation Framework (HADOF), which leverages an iterative strategy to automatically divide the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimisation (QUBO) Hamiltonian into sub-Hamiltonians which can be optimised separately using Hamiltonian based optimisers such as QAOA, QA or Simulated Annealing (SA) and aggregated into a global solution. We compare HADOF with Simulated Annealing (SA) and the CPLEX exact solver, showing scalability to problem sizes far exceeding available qubits while maintaining competitive accuracy and runtime. Furthermore, we realise HADOF for a toy problem on an IBM quantum computer, showing promise for practical applications of quantum optimisation.</p>

            <p>We present a modular atom-array quantum computing architecture with space-time hybrid multiplexing (MAQCY), a dynamic optical tweezer-based protocol for fully connected and scalable universal quantum computation. By extending the concept of globally controlled static dual-species Rydberg atom wires [1], we develop an entirely new approach using Q-Pairs, which consist of globally controlled and temporally multiplexed dual-species Rydberg blockaded atom and superatom pairs. Space-time hybrid multiplexing of Q-Pairs achieves O(N) linear scaling in the number of required physical qubits, while preserving coherence and mitigating circuit-depth limitations through in-situ atom replacement. To demonstrate MAQCY's versatility, we implement a three-qubit quantum Fourier transform using only global operations and atom transport. We also propose a concrete implementation using ytterbium isotopes, paving the way toward large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computing.</p>

            <p>Quasi-optical experiments are emerging as a powerful technique to probe magnetic transitions in molecular spin systems. However, the simultaneous presence of the electric- and magnetic-dipole induced transitions poses the challenge of discriminating between these two contributions. Besides, the identification of the spin-electric transitions can hardly rely on the peak intensity, because of the current uncertainties on the value of the spin-electric coupling in most molecular compounds. Here, we compute the polarizations required for electric- and magnetic-dipole induced transitions through spin-Hamiltonian models of molecular spin triangles. We show that the polarization allows a clear discrimination between the two kinds of transitions. In addition, it allows one to identify the physical origin of the zero-field splitting in the ground multiplet, a debated issue with significant implications on the coherence properties of the spin qubit implemented in molecular spin triangles.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jacob Ngaha, Scott Parkins, Howard J. Carmichael</p>
            <p>In this work, we consider a three-level ladder-type atom driven by a coherent field, inspired by the experimental work of Gasparinetti et al. [Phys. Rev. A 100, 033802 (2019)]. When driven on two-photon resonance, the atom is excited into its highest energy state $| f \rangle$ by absorbing two photons simultaneously. The atom then de-excites via a cascaded decay $| f \rangle \rightarrow | e \rangle \rightarrow | g \rangle$. Here we present a theoretical study of the atomic fluorescence spectrum where, upon strong coherent driving, the spectrum exhibits seven distinct frequencies corresponding to transitions amongst the atomic dressed states. We characterize the quantum statistics of the emitted photons by investigating the second-order correlation functions of the emitted field. We do so by considering the total field emitted by the atom and focusing on each of the dressed-state components, taking in particular a secular-approximation and deriving straightforward, transparent analytic expressions for the second-order auto- and cross-correlations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Souvik Bandyopadhyay, Anushya Chandran, Philip JD Crowley</p>
            <p>Chiral quantum state circulation is the unidirectional transfer of a quantum state from one subsystem to the next. It is essential to the working of a quantum computer; for instance, for state preparation and isolation. We propose a cavity-QED architecture consisting of three cavities coupled to a qubit, in which \emph{any} photonic state of cavity 1 with sufficiently many photons circulates to cavity 2 after a fixed time interval, and then to cavity 3 and back to 1. Cavity-state circulation arises from topologically protected chiral boundary states in the associated photon lattice and is thus robust to perturbation. We compute the circulation period in the semi-classical limit, demonstrate that circulation persists for time-scales diverging with the total photon number, and provide a Floquet protocol to engineer the desired Hamiltonian. Superconducting qubits offer an ideal platform to build and test these devices in the near term.</p>

            <p>We propose and analyze a robust implementation of Rydberg antiblockade based on rapid adiabatic passage. Although Rydberg antiblockade offers key opportunities in quantum information processing and sensing, its sensitivity to position disorder and parameter imperfections has posed a central roadblock. By adiabatically sweeping across the interaction-shifted resonance, our approach is unaffected by realistic levels of disorder and parameter variations. As a straightforward application case, we show that it naturally gives rise to avalanche excitation growth in both one- and two-dimensional arrays. This avalanche process yields high gain with exceptionally low background, making it promising for rare-event detection. These results establish a practical route to robust Rydberg antiblockade dynamics, paving the way for future experimental and technological applications.</p>

            <p>Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) is a cornerstone algorithm for fault-tolerant quantum computation, especially for electronic structure calculations of chemical systems. To accommodate the diverse characteristics of quantum chemical systems, numerous variants of QPE have been developed, each with distinct qubit and gate cost implications. In this paper, we quantify the impact of three key parameters on the overall quantum resource costs for the QPE algorithm: the choice between trotterization and qubitization, the use of molecular orbitals versus plane-wave basis-sets, and the selection of the fermion-to-qubit encoding scheme. From this, we establish clear performance trade-offs and delineate specific parameter regimes that minimize resource costs for relevant molecular systems. When performing phase estimation on large molecules in the fault-tolerant setting, we found the first-quantized qubitization circuit using the plane-wave basis to be the most efficient, with a gate cost scaling of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}([N^{4/3}M^{2/3}+N^{8/3}M^{1/3}]/\varepsilon)$ for a system of $N$ electrons and $M$ orbitals, which is the best known scaling to date. On the other hand, when only noisy intermediate-scale or near-term fault-tolerant systems are available, the phase estimation of small molecules can be performed with gate cost of $\mathcal{O}(M^{7}/\varepsilon^{2})$ via trotterization in the MO basis. Furthermore, we provide numerical estimations of qubit and T gate costs required to perform QPE for several real-world molecular systems under these different parameter choices.</p>

            <p>Manifesting across all time, mass and length scales, nonlinearities lie at the core of numerous physical phenomena. Next-generation quantum applications, such as quantum sensing, require the combination of nonlinearity with non-classical correlations. This necessitates the search for an experimental platform which enables a nonlinear response at ultra-low excitation levels in a system with practical sensing potential and quantum compatibility. Here, we report the observation and theoretical modeling of nonlinear dynamics in a mechanical system driven at the single-excitation level. We achieve this using a cavity-optomechanical platform with large single-photon coupling rates and a nonlinear microwave resonator. Specifically, the large Kerr nonlinearity of our superconducting microwave circuit reduces the threshold for the observation of nonlinear dynamics by four orders of magnitude, making this regime experimentally accessible at the few-photon level. The parameter-based quantitative predicative power of the theoretical description underlines our deep understanding of the physics involved and that this device concept paves the way for experiments with non-classical microwave drive schemes.</p>

            <p>Rydberg-cavity systems are emerging as promising platforms for quantum simulation and quantum information processing. These hybrid architectures combine two complementary interaction mechanisms: cavity photons mediate collective long-range couplings, while Rydberg excitations generate strong short-range interactions. Together, they offer a setting for engineering many-body phases characterized by a hierarchy of interactions across widely different length scales. In this work, we introduce a minimal and scalable model for such systems. Focusing on the strong Rydberg blockade regime, we restrict the Hilbert space to the subspace enforced by the blockade, yielding a kinetically constrained long-range model in one spatial dimension. This approach both captures the physics of Rydberg-cavity experiments in the regime of strong Rydberg interactions and provides a conceptually transparent framework for studying the interplay of long-range and short-range interactions. At equilibrium, in addition to paramagnetic and N√©el-ordered phases, the system supports a blockaded ferromagnetic/superradiant phase, distinct from the conventional superradiant phase. Out of equilibrium, we identify long-range quantum many-body scars, which are atypical nonthermal eigenstates that evade the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, and giving rise to slow entanglement growth. In contrast to the linear-in-time entanglement growth characteristic of short-range scarred models, these long-range scars exhibit logarithmic entanglement dynamics. Our results establish a minimal yet versatile framework for Rydberg-cavity systems, and provide a stepping stone for future theoretical and experimental studies of this frontier platform in quantum many-body physics.</p>

We validate our model by examining commercial fiber specifications, fiber-paddle measurements, and published PMD statistics for deployed fiber links, and we showcase BIFROST's predictive power by considering wavelength-division-multiplexed PMD compensation schemes for polarization-encoded quantum networks. BIFROST's physical grounding enables investigations into such questions as the sensitivity of fiber sensors, the evaluation of PMD mitigation strategies in quantum networks, and many more applications across fiber technologies.</p>

            <p>Single photons in Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) beams, which carry orbital angular momentum (OAM), could enable more robust and efficient photonic quantum communication and information processing, as well as enhanced sensitivity in quantum metrology and imaging. However, as most implementations are indirect or require additional mode-shaping elements, direct generation of single photons with OAM has received growing interest. Colloidal lead halide perovskite quantum dots (QDs) have recently emerged as a versatile material that can produce indistinguishable single photons quasi-deterministically at high rate. Here, we integrate single CsPbBr$_3$ QDs into an open Fabry-Perot microcavity with a nanofabricated Gaussian-shaped deformation, demonstrating Purcell-enhanced single-photon generation into individual cavity modes with up to 18.1 $\pm$ 0.2 times accelerated decay, down to tens of picoseconds. By in-situ tuning of the cavity resonance, we can selectively couple a single QD to different LG modes carrying OAM and observe the spatial patterns of the generated single-photon beams emitted from the cavity. Our findings open the door to high photon rate sources that directly generate single-photon LG beams for advanced quantum photonic applications.</p>

Harnessing phonons to control these effects and enable quantum technologies is therefore of great interest. However, most existing phonon control strategies rely on external driving fields or anharmonic interactions, limiting their applicability. Here, we realize multimode ultrastrong light--matter coupling and theoretically show the modulation of phonon emission. This regime is realized by coupling two optical phonon modes in lead halide perovskites to a nanoslot array functioning as a single-mode cavity. The small mode volume of the nanoslots enables high coupling strengths in the phonon-polariton system. We show theoretically that the nanoslot resonator mediates an effective interaction between phonon modes, leading to superthermal phonon bunching in thermal equilibrium between distinct modes. Our findings are well described by a multimode Hopfield model. This work establishes a pathway for engineering phononic properties for light-harvesting and light-emitting technologies.</p>

            <p>The decoy-state method is a prominent approach to enhance the performance of quantum key distribution (QKD) systems that operate with weak coherent laser sources. Due to the limited transmissivity of single photons in optical fiber, current experimental decoy-state QKD setups increase their secret key rate by raising the repetition rate of the transmitter. However, this usually leads to correlations between subsequent optical pulses. This phenomenon leaks information about the encoding settings, including the intensities of the generated signals, which invalidates a basic premise of decoy-state QKD. Here we characterize intensity correlations between the emitted optical pulses in two industrial prototypes of decoy-state BB84 QKD systems and show that they significantly reduce the asymptotic key rate. In contrast to what has been conjectured, we experimentally confirm that the impact of higher-order correlations on the intensity of the generated signals can be much higher than that of nearest-neighbour correlations.</p>

By expanding this Lindbladian exponential into the Taylor series, we propose a generic method for integrating Lindblad master equations. In this method, the series is truncated, retaining a finite number of terms, and the iterative actions of Lindbladian on the density matrix follow the corresponding master equation. Our method offers significant improvements in numerical efficiencies both in memory cost and computation time, especially for systems with many degrees of freedom. Moreover, our proposed method can be integrated seamlessly with tensor networks. Two illustrative examples, a two-level system exhibiting damped Rabi oscillations and a driven dissipative Heisenberg chain, are used to demonstrate the validity of our method.

As the disorder strength increases, the emergence of nonchaotic dynamics is qualitatively captured through the suppressed growth of Krylov complexity, and quantitatively identified through the reciprocity breaking of Krylov space. We further find that the localization in Krylov space generates another transition in the weak disorder regime, suggesting a weak ergodicity breaking. Our results closely align with conventional methods, such as the entanglement entropy and complex level spacing statistics, and pave the way to explore non-Hermitian phase transitions using Krylov complexity and associated metrics.</p>

            <p>The quantum sensing landscape has been revolutionized by advanced technologies like superconducting circuits and qubit-based systems which have furthered the ability to probe and understand fundamental properties of quantum matter. Here, we propose an integrated photonic device where a transmon qubit capacitively couples to a microwave cross-resonator, and the setup is employed for sensing of time reversal broken order in materials. In this sensing scheme, the transmon qubit plays a dual role as both a control element and a passive detector, while the photonic cross-resonator serves as the host for the sample, enabling a contact-free spectroscopic method suitable for studying materials where reliable electrical contacts are challenging to obtain, e.g., in van der Waal 2D heterostructures. We show that by tuning the coupling strength and phase between the transmon and the cross-resonator, the system allows selective control over the interaction dynamics and leads to a highly sensitive detection method that can be compactly understood in terms of evolution of excited state population and quantum metric of the resonator-transmon hybrid state. This architecture has the potential to host a wide range of quantum phenomena that can be precisely encoded in the dynamics of the transmon qubit and, in this way, potentially allows access to elusive aspects of correlated materials.</p>

            <h2>Quantum reservoir computing using Jaynes-Cummings model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sreetama Das, Gian Luca Giorgi, Roberta Zambrini</p>
            <p>We investigate quantum reservoir computing (QRC) using a hybrid qubit-boson system described by the Jaynes-Cummings (JC) Hamiltonian and its dispersive limit (DJC). These models provide high-dimensional Hilbert spaces and intrinsic nonlinear dynamics, making them powerful substrates for temporal information processing. We systematically benchmark both reservoirs through linear and nonlinear memory tasks, demonstrating that they exhibit an unusual superior nonlinear over linear memory capacity. We further test their predictive performance on the Mackey-Glass time series, a widely used benchmark for chaotic dynamics and show comparable forecasting ability. We also investigate how memory and prediction accuracy vary with reservoir parameters, and show the role of higher-order bosonic observables and time multiplexing in enhancing expressivity, even in minimal spin-boson configurations. Our results establish JC- and DJC-based reservoirs as versatile platforms for time-series processing and as elementary units that overcome the setting of equivalent qubit pairs and offer pathways towards tunable, high-performance quantum machine learning architectures.</p>

            <p>Photons are a ubiquitous carrier of quantum information: they are fast, suffer minimal decoherence, and do not require huge cryogenic facilities. Nevertheless, their intrinsically weak photon-photon interactions remain a key obstacle to scalable quantum computing. This review surveys hybrid photonic quantum computing, which exploits multiple photonic degrees of freedom to combine the complementary strengths of discrete and bosonic encodings, thereby significantly mitigating the challenge of weak photon-photon interactions. We first outline the basic principles of discrete-variable, native continuous-variable, and bosonic-encoding paradigms. We then summarise recent theoretical advances and state-of-the-art experimental demonstrations with particular emphasis on the hybrid approach. Its unique advantages, such as efficient generation of resource states and nearly ballistic (active-feedforward-free) operations, are highlighted alongside remaining technical challenges. To facilitate a clear comparison, we explicitly present the error thresholds and resource overheads required for fault-tolerant quantum computing. Our work offers a focused overview that clarifies how the hybrid approach enables scalable and compatible architectures for quantum computing.</p>

            <h2>Phase Transitions and Noise Robustness of Quantum Graph States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tatsuya Numajiri, Shion Yamashika, Tomonori Tanizawa, Ryosuke Yoshii, Yuki Takeuchi, Shunji Tsuchiya</p>
            <p>Graph states are entangled states that are essential for quantum information processing, including measurement-based quantum computation. As experimental advances enable the realization of large-scale graph states, efficient fidelity estimation methods are crucial for assessing their robustness against noise. However, calculations of exact fidelity become intractable for large systems due to the exponential growth in the number of stabilizers. In this work, we show that the fidelity between any ideal graph state and its noisy counterpart under IID Pauli noise can be mapped to the partition function of a classical spin system, enabling efficient computation via statistical mechanical techniques, including transfer matrix methods and Monte Carlo simulations. Using this approach, we analyze the fidelity for regular graph states under depolarizing noise and uncover the emergence of phase transitions in fidelity between the pure-state regime and the noise-dominated regime governed by both the connectivity (degree) and spatial dimensionality of the graph state. Specifically, in 2D, phase transitions occur only when the degree satisfies $d\ge 6$, while in 3D they already appear at $d\ge 5$. However, for graph states with excessively high degree, such as fully connected graphs, the phase transition disappears, suggesting that extreme connectivity suppresses critical behavior. These findings reveal that robustness of graph states against noise is determined by their connectivity and spatial dimensionality. Graph states with lower degree and/or dimensionality, which exhibit a smooth crossover rather than a sharp transition, demonstrate greater robustness, while highly connected or higher-dimensional graph states are more fragile. Extreme connectivity, as the fully connected graph state possesses, restores robustness.</p>

            <h2>Flexible Catalysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M√°t√© Weisz, Sergii Strelchuk</p>
            <p>In quantum information and computation, a central challenge is to determine which quantum states can be transformed into one another under restricted sets of free operations. While many transformations are impossible directly, catalytic processes can enable otherwise forbidden conversions: an auxiliary quantum state (the catalyst) facilitates the transformation while remaining unchanged. In this work, we introduce flexible catalysis, a generalization in which the catalyst is allowed to transform into a different auxiliary state, provided it remains a valid catalyst. We show that this framework subsumes both standard catalytic and multicopy transformations, and we analyze its advantages across several classes of free operations. In particular, we prove that when the free operations are local unitaries or permutation matrices, flexible catalysis enables state extractions that are unattainable with standard catalysis alone.</p>

            <h2>A Contextual Seven-Valued Logic (\emph{Saptabhangƒ´naya}) for Quantum Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Partha Ghose</p>
            <p>The quantum measurement problem is often presented as a conflict between unitary evolution and non-unitary collapse. Drawing on Wittgenstein's later philosophy of language and Bohr's principle of complementarity, we argue that this conflict is a grammatical illusion arising from cross-context conflations. To address this, we introduce a contextual seven-valued logic modeled on the Jaina doctrine of \emph{saptabhangƒ´naya} (sevenfold predication). In one formulation, each proposition is assigned a triplet $(t,f,u)$ indicating its status as true, false, or unsayable within a given context, with paraconsistent rules blocking triviality. In another, contexts are explicitly formalized through quantified conditionals, aligning directly with Bohr's view that meaning derives from experimental arrangements. By comparing these two complementary approaches, we show how canonical paradoxes--including Schr√∂dinger's cat and Wigner's friend--dissolve once context is made explicit. The result is a flexible logical framework that reconciles Wittgensteinian conceptual therapy, Bohr's complementarity, and the Jaina pluralistic tradition, offering a coherent semantics for quantum discourse.</p>

            <p>Practical implementation of quantum error correction is currently limited by near-term quantum hardware. In contrast, quantum error mitigation has demonstrated strong promise for improving the performance of noisy quantum circuits without the requirement of full fault tolerance. In this work, we develop a hybrid error suppression protocol that integrates Pauli twirling, probabilistic error cancellation, and the $[[n, n-2, 2]]$ quantum error detecting code. In addition, to reduce overhead from error mitigation components of our method, we modify Pauli twirling by lowering the number of Pauli operators in the twirling set, and apply probabilistic error cancellation at the end of the encoded circuit to remove undetectable errors. Finally, we demonstrate our protocol on a non-Clifford variational quantum eigensolver circuit that estimates the ground state energy of $\rm H_2$ using both \texttt{qiskit} AerSimulator and the IBM quantum processor \texttt{ibm\_brussels}.</p>

            <p>A general spin-resolved momentum distribution of electron-positron pairs produced in strong external fields is derived by combining the covariant spin projection operator and the Dirac-Heisenberg-Wigner (DHW) formalism. The result shows that the spin-resolved and helicity-resolved momentum distributions given in previous literature are actually two special cases of it. For any spin-direction unit vector, numerical investigations demonstrate that when the $z$-component of the unit vector vanishes, the number density of produced spin-up and spin-down particles is equal, while their momentum distributions have some asymmetry. For a nonzero $z$-component of the unit vector, there is a difference of $1-3$ orders of magnitude in the number density of spin-up and spin-down particles induced by angular momentum transfer in multiphoton absorption. Moreover, as the electric field strength increases and/or the field frequency decreases, the asymmetry between the spin-up and spin-down particle number density decreases rapidly. These results offer an approach to study general spin states in vacuum pair production, and enhance our understanding of angular momentum transfer from fields to matter in extreme environments.</p>

            <p>The optimal chirped field for enhancing electron-positron (EP) pair production is explored using a quantum kinetic approach. First, the momentum spectrum and number density of EP pairs produced by Gaussian chirped fields are investigated. The results show that the momentum spectrum exhibits distinct interference patterns, while the number density grows monotonically with chirp parameters but oscillates with the carrier angular frequency. Moreover, the number density increases by four orders of magnitude compared to chirp-free fields. The results are further compared with those from four other chirped fields: frequency-modulated, linear, quadratic, and sinusoidal chirp. The analysis reveals that the maximum number density for sinusoidally chirped fields is the highest, followed by Gaussian, frequency-modulated, quadratically, and linearly chirped fields. This ranking also applies to the maximum enhancement factors for these chirped fields. Notably, the number density for sinusoidally chirped fields improves nine orders of magnitude compared to chirp-free fields. These results not only deepen our understanding of pair production in chirped fields but also provide significant optimization strategies for future vacuum pair production experiments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ki Won Jeong, Jae Yeon Seo, Sunghyun Lim, Jae Min Hong, Hyeon Jun Ryu, Jongseok Byeon, Kyungsun Moon, Nara Lee, Young Jai Choi</p>
            <p>The intrinsic equivalence between electron spin and qubit offers a natural foundation for quantum simulations of magnetic materials. However, incorporating magnetocrystalline anisotropy (MCA), a key feature of real magnets, remains a major challenge. Here, we develop a quantum simulation framework for MCA in CuSb2O6, a spin-1/2 antiferromagnet with alternating ferromagnetic chains arising from frustrated, anisotropic exchange interactions in a nearly square lattice. The $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$ spin network is modeled as a four-qubit square lattice, with four paired ancilla qubits introduced to encode angle-dependent MCA. This two-qubit representation per spin site resolves the limitation that squared Pauli operators yield only the identity, enabling MCA terms to be faithfully embedded into quantum circuits. Using the variational quantum eigensolver, we determine an exceptionally small easy-axis MCA constant, just 0.00022% of the nearest-neighbor exchange interaction, yet sufficient to drive a spin-flop transition with $90^{\circ}$ spin reorientation and strong angular variation in magnetic torque. Beyond this regime, the simulations uncover a half-saturated magnetic phase at ultra-high fields, stabilized by anisotropic next-nearest-neighbor interactions. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of resource-efficient quantum simulations of complex magnetic phenomena in real materials.</p>

            <p>This paper presents a systematic comparative analysis of Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC) configurations for financial fraud detection, encompassing three distinct quantum encoding techniques and comprehensive architectural variations. Through empirical evaluation across multiple entanglement patterns, circuit depths, and optimization strategies,quantum advantages in fraud classification accuracy are demonstrated, achieving up to 94.3 % accuracy with ZZ encoding schemes. The analysis reveals significant performance variations across entanglement topologies, with circular entanglement consistently outperforming linear (90.7) %) and full connectivity (92.0 %) patterns, achieving optimal performance at 93.3 % accuracy. The study introduces novel visualization methodologies for quantum circuit analysis and provides actionable deployment recommendations for practical quantum machine learning implementations. Notably, systematic entanglement pattern analysis shows that circular connectivity provides superior balance between expressivity and trainability while maintaining computational efficiency. These researches offer initial benchmarks for quantum enhanced fraud detection systems and propose potential benefits of quantum machine learning in financial security applications.</p>

            <p>Current quantum computers are limited by errors, but have not yet achieved the scale required to benefit from active error correction in large computations. We show how simulations of open quantum systems can benefit from error detection. In particular, we use Quantinuum's H2 quantum computer to perform logical simulations of a non-equilibrium phase transition using the [[4,2,2]] code. Importantly, by converting detected errors into random resets, which are an intended part of the dissipative quantum dynamics being studied, we avoid any post-selection in our simulations, thereby eliminating the exponential cost typically associated with error detection. The encoded simulations perform near break-even with unencoded simulations at short times.</p>

            <h2>Krylov Winding and Emergent Coherence in Operator Growth Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rishik Perugu, Bryce Kobrin, Michael O. Flynn, Thomas Scaffidi</p>
            <p>The operator wavefunction provides a fine-grained description of quantum chaos and of the irreversible growth of simple operators into increasingly complex ones. Remarkably, at finite temperature this wavefunction can acquire a phase that increases linearly with the size of operator, a phenomenon called $\textit{size winding}$. Although size winding occurs naturally in a holographic setting, the emergence of a coherent phase in a scrambled operator remains mysterious from the standpoint of a thermalizing quantum many-body system. In this work, we elucidate this phenomenon by introducing the related concept of $\textit{Krylov winding}$, whereby the operator wavefunction has a phase which winds linearly with the Krylov index. We argue that Krylov winding is a generic feature of quantum chaotic systems. It gives rise to size winding under two additional conditions: (i) a low-rank mapping between the Krylov and size bases, which ensures phase alignment among operators of the same size, and (ii) the saturation of the ``chaos-operator growth'' bound $\lambda_L \leq 2 \alpha$ (with $\lambda_L$ the Lyapunov exponent and $\alpha$ the growth rate), which ensures a linear phase dependence on size. For systems which do not saturate this bound, with $h = \lambda_L / 2\alpha <1$, the winding with Pauli size $\ell$ becomes $\textit{superlinear}$, behaving as $\ell^{1/h}$. We illustrate these results with two microscopic models: the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model and a disordered $k$-local spin model.</p>

            <p>Continuous-wave (CW) interferometry has stood at the frontier of precision measurement science since its inception, where it was used to search for the luminiferous ether, to the present day, where it forms the basis of interferometric gravitational-wave detection. Quantum theory predicts that this frontier can be expanded more rapidly by employing certain quantum resources, compared with the case of using only classical resources. In the quantum case, we can achieve ``Heisenberg scaling'', which manifests as a quadratic improvement over the best possible classical precision scaling. Although Heisenberg scaling has been demonstrated in pulsed operation, it has not been demonstrated for continuous operation. The challenge in doing so is two-fold: continuous measurements capable of Heisenberg scaling were previously unknown, and the requisite CW quantum states are fragile. Here we overcome these challenges and demonstrate the first CW interferometer exhibiting resource efficiency approaching Heisenberg scaling. Our scheme comprises a Mach-Zehnder interferometer illuminated with a pair of squeezed light sources, followed by a nonlinear estimator of the output homodyne record to estimate a differential phase modulation signal that drives the interferometer. We observe that this signal can be extracted with a precision that scales faster than what is allowed classically, and approaches the Heisenberg scaling limit.</p>

            <h2>Barnett Effect-Induced Nonreciprocal Entanglement in Magnomechanics with Optical Parametric Amplifier</h2>

            <p>Nonreciprocity is a powerful tool in quantum technologies. It allows signals to be sent in one direction but not the other. In this article, we propose a method for achieving non-reciprocal entanglement via the Barnett effect in a spinning ferrimagnetic yttrium-iron-garnet sphere coupled to a microwave cavity that interacts with an optical parametric amplifier (OPA). Due to the Barnett effect, giant nonreciprocal entanglement can emerge. All entanglements with ideal nonreciprocity can be achieved by tuning the photon frequency detuning, appropriately choosing the cavity-magnon coupling regime, the nonlinear gain, and the phase shift of the OPA. Interestingly, the amount of entanglement nonreciprocity and its resilience to thermal occupation are remarkably enhanced by increasing the gain of the OPA. This nonreciprocity can be significantly enhanced even at relatively high temperatures. Our research offers a pathway for the realization of nonreciprocal single-phonon devices, with potential applications in quantum information processing and quantum communication. This proposed scheme could pave the way for the development of novel nonreciprocal devices that remain robust under thermal fluctuations.</p>

            <p>Solving the electronic Schr√∂dinger equation for strongly correlated systems remains one of the grand challenges in quantum chemistry. Here we demonstrate that Transformer architectures can be adapted to capture the complex grammar of electronic correlations through neural network backflow. In this approach, electronic configurations are processed as token sequences, where attention layers learn non-local orbital correlations and token-specific neural networks map these contextual representations into backflowed orbitals. Application to strongly correlated iron-sulfur clusters validates our approach: for $\left[\mathrm{Fe}_2 \mathrm{~S}_2\left(\mathrm{SCH}_3\right)_4\right]^{2-}$ ([2Fe-2S]) (30e,20o), the ground-state energy within chemical accuracy of DMRG while predicting magnetic exchange coupling constants closer to experimental values than all compared methods including DMRG, CCSD(T), and recent neural network approaches. For $\left[\mathrm{Fe}_4 \mathrm{S}_4\left(\mathrm{SCH}_3\right)_4\right]^{2-}$ ([4Fe-4S]) (54e,36o), we match DMRG energies and accurately reproduce detailed spin-spin correlation patterns between all Fe centers. The approach scales favorably to large active spaces inaccessible to exact methods, with distributed VMC optimization enabling stable convergence. These results establish Transformer-based backflow as a powerful variational ansatz for strongly correlated electronic structure, achieving superior magnetic property predictions while maintaining chemical accuracy in total energies.</p>

            <p>Resonance fluorescence from a single two-level system is a cornerstone of quantum optics. In the strong driving regime, its emission spectrum exhibits the iconic Mollow triplet, with each spectral component corresponding to a transition between distinct atom-photon dressed states. Here, we experimentally study the resonance fluorescence spectrum under a novel driving configuration in which a second gigahertz-frequency field drives the Rabi transition between two atom-photon dressed states. Our experiment is performed on a single semiconductor quantum dot strongly driven by a laser and a surface acoustic wave. We observe emission spectra that are significantly altered from the standard Mollow triplet, including the dynamical cancellation of resonance fluorescence at the central emission frequency. These spectra are explained by a theoretical model that incorporates the hybridization of the two-level system, the optical field, and the acoustic field. Motivated by this model, we experimentally validate the condition for optimal cooling of acoustic phonons in an emitter-optomechanical system. Our results offer new insights into the quantum interactions among single two-level systems, optical fields, and acoustic fields in the strong driving limit, with important applications in nonclassical acoustic state generation, quantum transduction, and quantum sensing of thermal motions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guo-Qiang Zhang, Si-Yan Lin, Wei Feng, Yi-Hao Kang, Wei Xiong</p>
            <p>Recently, proposals for realizing a nonreciprocal superradiant quantum phase transition (SQPT) have been put forward, based on either nonreciprocal interactions between two spin ensembles or the Sagnac-Fizeau shift in a spinning cavity. However, experimental implementation of such a nonreciprocal SQPT remains challenging. This motivates the search for new mechanisms capable of producing a nonreciprocal SQPT. Here, we propose an alternative approach to realize a nonreciprocal SQPT, induced by the magnon Kerr effect (MKE), in a cavity magnonic system, where magnons in a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere are coupled to cavity photons. The Kerr coefficient $K$ is positive (negative), i.e., $K>0$ ($K<0$), when the bias magnetic field is aligned along the crystallographic axis [100] ([110]) of the YIG sphere. We show that the steady-state phase diagrams differ significantly for both cases with $K > 0$ and $K < 0$, which is the origin of the nonreciprocal SQPT. By further studying the steady-state magnon occupation and its fluctuations versus the parametric drive strength, we demonstrate that the SQPT becomes nonreciprocal, characterized by distinct critical thresholds for $K > 0$ and $K < 0$. Moreover, we introduce a bidirectional contrast ratio to quantify this nonreciprocal behavior. Our work provides a new mechanism for realizing the nonreciprocal SQPT, with potential applications in designing nonreciprocal quantum devices.</p>

            <p>The ability to extend the lifetime of a logical qubit beyond that of the best physical qubit available within the same system, i.e., the break-even point, is a prerequisite for building practical quantum computers. So far, this point has been exceeded through active quantum error correction (QEC) protocols, where a logical error is corrected by measuring its syndrome and then performing an adaptive correcting operation. Autonomous QEC (AQEC), without the need for such resource-consuming measurement-feedback control, has been demonstrated in several experiments, but none of which has unambiguously reached the break-even point. Here, we present an unambiguous demonstration of beyond-break-even AQEC in a circuit quantum electrodynamics system, where a photonic logical qubit encoded in a superconducting microwave cavity is protected against photon loss through autonomous error correction, enabled by engineered dissipation. Under the AQEC protection, the logical qubit achieves a lifetime surpassing that of the best physical qubit available in the system by 18\%. We further employ this AQEC protocol to enhance the precision for measuring a slight frequency shift, achieving a metrological gain of 6.3 dB over that using the most robust Fock-state superposition. These results illustrate that the demonstrated AQEC procedure not only represents a crucial step towards fault-tolerant quantum computation but also offers advantages for building robust quantum sensors.</p>

The theory was reduced then to high-order perturbation theory, while treating matter and light in a quantum manner. With the advent of chirped pulse amplification developed by D. Strickland and G.

Contemporary attoscience (AS), and more generally ultrafast laser physics, awarded the Nobel Prize in 2023 to P. Agostini, F. Krausz, and A. L'Huillier, commonly uses the classical description of EM fields while keeping a fully quantum description of matter. The progress and successes of AS in the last 40 years have been spectacular, with an enormous amount of fascinating investigations in basic research and technology. Yet a central question remains: can ultrafast laser physics continue to advance without reintroducing quantum electrodynamics and quantum optics into its description of light-matter interactions?

            <p>A quantum critical point develops when matter undergoes a continuous transformation between distinct ground states at absolute zero. It hosts pronounced quantum fluctuations, which render the system highly susceptible to external perturbations. While light-matter coupling has rapidly moved forward as a means to probe and control quantum materials, the capacity of quantum critical fluctuations in the photon-mediated responses has been largely unexplored. Here we advance the notion that directly coupling a quantum critical mode to a quantized cavity field dramatically facilitates the onset of superradiance. When the coupling between the two fields is bilinear, the transition is found to occur at vanishingly small light-matter coupling and is accompanied by strongly enhanced intrinsic squeezing. Our results identify a particularly favorable setting for realizing the elusive superradiant state, and point to a general principle by which quantum criticality amplifies photon-matter entanglement and enhances the associated metrological performance.</p>

            <p>The superradiant phenomenon, usually described by the Dicke model, is a hallmark of strong light-matter interaction. We explore how matter-matter interactions influence this phenomenon by performing ground-state simulations of Dicke-like models with both isotropic and anisotropic spin couplings. We find that Ising-type interactions produce two qualitatively distinct phase boundaries, one of which gives rise to an antiferromagnetic-normal phase connected to the superradiant regime via a first-order phase transition. Under anisotropic couplings, we uncover a strongly correlated phase where in-plane spin order coexists with superradiance, exhibiting sublinear scaling of the photon occupation per site and power-law decay of spin correlations. Furthermore, superradiance can be strengthened by tuning either isotropic or anisotropic interactions, highlighting the role of intrinsic many-body correlations in shaping light-matter quantum phases.</p>

            <h2>Beyond Entanglement: Diagnosing quantum mediator dynamics in gravitationally mediated experiments</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> P. George Christopher, S. Shankaranarayanan (IIT Bombay)</p>
            <p>No experimental test to date has provided conclusive evidence on the quantum nature of gravity. Recent proposals, such as the BMV experiment, suggest that generating entanglement could serve as a direct test. Motivated by these proposals, we study a system of three-harmonic oscillator system, with the mediator oscillator operating in two distinct parameter regimes: a heavy mediator regime and a light mediator regime. These regimes induce qualitatively different entanglement dynamics between the terminal oscillators. Crucially, distinguishing these regimes experimentally remains challenging when relying solely on entanglement measures. We demonstrate that the dynamical fidelity susceptibility offers a viable and sensitive probe to contrast the regimes in practice. Our results provide testable signatures for optomechanical and trapped-ion platforms simulating gravitational interactions, and provide new avenues to characterize quantum-gravity-inspired systems beyond entanglement-based protocols.</p>

            <p>The intersection of quantum computing and quantum chemistry represents a promising frontier for achieving quantum utility in domains of both scientific and societal relevance. Owing to the exponential growth of classical resource requirements for simulating quantum systems, quantum chemistry has long been recognized as a natural candidate for quantum computation. This perspective focuses on identifying scientifically meaningful use cases where early fault-tolerant quantum computers, which are considered to be equipped with approximately 25--100 logical qubits, could deliver tangible impact. While recent advances in classical computing have pushed the boundaries of tractable simulations to unprecedented scales, this logical-qubit regime represents the first window where quantum devices can pursue qualitatively distinct strategies, such as polynomial-scaling phase estimation, direct simulation of quantum dynamics, and active-space embedding, that remain challenging for classical solvers, for instance, multireference charge-transfer and conical-intersection states central to photochemistry and materials design. We highlight near-term opportunities in algorithm and software design, discuss representative chemical problems suited for quantum acceleration, and propose strategic roadmaps and collaborative pathways for advancing practical quantum utility in quantum chemistry.</p>

            <h2>Simultaneous Quantization and Reduction of Constrained Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jianhao M. Yang</p>
            <p>We present a novel framework for quantizing constrained quantum systems in which the processes of quantization and constraint enforcement are performed simultaneously. The approach is based on an extension of the stationary action principle, incorporating an information-theoretic term arising from vacuum fluctuations. Constraints are included directly in the Lagrangian via Lagrange multipliers, allowing the subsequent variational procedure to yield the quantum dynamics without ambiguity regarding the order of quantization and reduction. We demonstrate the method through two examples: (i) a one-dimensional system with vanishing local momentum, where the simultaneous approach produces the time-independent Schr√∂dinger equation while conventional reduced and Dirac quantization yield only trivial states, and (ii) a bipartite system with global translational invariance, where all three methods agree. These results show that the proposed framework generalizes standard quantization schemes and provides a consistent treatment of systems with constraints that cannot be expressed as linear operators acting on the wave function. In addition to a unified variational principle for constrained quantum systems, the formalism also offers an information-theoretic perspective on quantum effects arising from vacuum fluctuations.</p>

            <h2>Supervised Machine Learning for Predicting Open Quantum System Dynamics and Detecting Non-Markovian Memory Effects</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ali Abu-Nada, Subhashish Banerjee</p>
            <p>We present a \emph{novel} and scalable supervised machine learning framework to predict open-quantum system dynamics and detect non-Markovian memory using only local ancilla measurements. A system qubit is coherently coupled to an ancilla via a symmetric XY Hamiltonian; the ancilla interacts with a noisy environment and is the only qubit we measure. A feedforward neural network, trained on short sliding windows of supplementary data from the past, forecasts the observable system $\langle Z_{(S)}(t)\rangle$ without state tomography or knowledge of the bath. To quantify memory, we introduce a normalized revival-based metric that counts upward 'turn-backs' in \emph{predicted} $\langle Z_{(S)}(t)\rangle$ and reports the fraction of evaluated samples that exceeds a small threshold. This bounded score provides an interpretable, model-independent indicator of non-Markovianity. We demonstrate the method on two representative noise channels, non-unital amplitude damping and unital dephasing from random telegraph noise (RTN). Under matched conditions, the model accurately reproduces the dynamics and flags memory effects, with RTN exhibiting a larger normalized revival score than amplitude damping. Overall, the approach is experimentally realistic and readily extensible, enabling real-time, interpretable non-Markovian diagnostics from accessible local measurements.</p>

            <h2>Cost-aware Photonic Graph State Generation: A Graphical Framework</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sobhan Ghanbari, Hoi-Kwong Lo</p>
            <p>Photonic graph states are essential resources for quantum computation and communication. Deterministic emitter-based generation of graph states overcomes the scalability issues of probabilistic approaches, but their experimental realization is constrained by technological demands, often expressed by the number of two-qubit gates and the depth and/or width of the quantum circuits used to model the generation process. We introduce a cost-aware framework for the generation of photonic graph states of arbitrary size and shape, built on a complete set of necessary and sufficient conditions and a universal set of elementary graph operations that govern the evolution of the state toward the target. Within this framework, we develop Graph Builder, a deterministic generation algorithm that achieves substantial reductions (up to an order of magnitude) in two-qubit gate usage for both random and structured graphs, compared with alternative approaches. The algorithm uses the minimum number of emitters possible for a fixed emission sequence, while also supporting the use of extra emitters for controlled trade-offs between emitter count and other cost metrics. Moreover, by systematically identifying the degrees of freedom at each stage of the generation process, this framework fully characterizes the optimization landscape, enabling analytic, heuristic, or exhaustive strategies for further cost reductions. Our approach provides a general and versatile tool for designing and optimizing emitter-based photonic graph state generation protocols, essential for scalable and resource-efficient photonic quantum information processing.</p>

            <p>Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometry is an effective tool for precision sensing, but it faces a fundamental trade-off between dynamic range and measurement precision. To overcome this limitation, we sample the frequencies of two interfering photons, which extends the sensitivity in the time domain. This enhances the dynamic range of optical delay estimation by up to twenty times compared to the non-resolved estimates. We demonstrate this approach with independent photon sources and show the precision scaling with the detector frequency resolution. This technique enables scan-free nanometre resolution depth sensing over a millimetre-scale range, with applications in biological and nanomaterial imaging.</p>

            <p>We experimentally demonstrate efficient interfacing of a large number of atoms to an optical nanofiber using an optical lattice with tunable spacing ($0.88-1.5~\mu$m) [1] projected onto the nanofiber. The lattice beam and reflections from the nanofiber yield trap potentials that provide tight confinement in all motional degrees of freedom $\approx 220$ nm above the nanofiber surface, enabling efficient atom-photon coupling. We achieved trapping of $\approx1300$ atoms in periodic trap sites with a trap lifetime of $\approx15$ ms. We also observe the effect of varied lattice period on the atomic motional frequencies. Our new scheme is adaptable to other nanophotonic cold-atom systems and provides a versatile and scalable platform for studying photon-mediated long-range collective interactions. Our tunable lattice-nanofiber system could be seamlessly integrated with optical tweezers, allowing both the scalable atom-photon interface and individual single-atom access, and its intrinsic connectivity to conventional fiber provides a significant advantage towards quantum networks.</p>

            <p>Entanglement is central to quantum science and technology. Atomic defects in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) materials offer exciting prospects for quantum sensing, with spatial resolution reaching 1 nm demonstrated using scanning probe techniques. However, entangling qubits in vdW materials remains elusive. Here we report room-temperature quantum entanglement between an optically addressable electron spin and a strongly coupled $^{13}$C nuclear spin in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). We extend the electron spin coherence to 38 $\mu$s with dynamical decoupling, and create maximally entangled Bell states with a fidelity up to 0.89. We further use the nuclear spin as a long-lived quantum memory to enhance AC magnetic field sensing via correlation spectroscopy. These results establish entangled spin qubits in hBN as a robust platform for advanced quantum technologies based on 2D materials.</p>

Our theoretical framework provides a general methodology for analyzing cavity-enhanced nonlinear processes and highlights the versatility of optical resonators as powerful tools for engineering quantum light.</p>

            <h2>Magnon squeezing near a quantum critical point in a cavity-magnon-qubit system</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gang Liu, Gen Li, Rong-Can Yang, Wei Xiong, Jie Li</p>
            <p>Preparing magnon nonclassical states is a central topic in the study of quantum magnonics. Here we propose to generate magnon squeezed states in a hybrid cavity-magnon-qubit system by engineering an effective Rabi-type magnon-qubit interaction. This is achieved by adiabatically eliminating the cavity mode and driving the qubit with two microwave fields, of which the driving frequencies and amplitudes are properly selected. By operating the system around the critical point associated with the ground-state superradiant phase transition in the normal phase, a magnon parametric amplification-like interaction is induced, leading to a dynamical magnon squeezing. We further analyze the effects of the dissipation, dephasing, and thermal noise on the magnon squeezing. Our results indicate that a moderate degree of squeezing can be produced using currently available parameters in the experiments.</p>

            <p>Hereby, we study the generation of pairs of polarization-entangled photons at telecom C-band by biexciton-exciton cascade from non-resonantly excited epitaxial InAs/InP quantum dots (QDs). It is realized without external tuning of the fine structure splitting (FSS), which does not exceed 10 $\mu$eV in as-grown nanostructures, due to their high in-plane symmetry. Excitonic complexes are identified by means of excitation power-dependent and polarization-resolved magneto)microphotoluminescence. Their origin from different carrier configurations confined in the same QD is confirmed by time correlations of emitted photons. Experimental results are supported by 8-band kp calculations, followed by the configuration interaction method to include excitonic effects. This comparison reveals the structure of higher energy states, allowing for the reconstruction of the QD structural parameters. To verify and quantify the entanglement, we perform quantum state tomography and reconstruct the two-photon density matrix. Its diagonalization allows a detailed analysis of the entangled state and reveals an unfavourable interplay between phase accumulation and decoherence, pointing to a clear route for boosting entanglement by using a XX resonant, pulsed excitation scheme and shortening the radiative lifetimes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cheng-Yun Ding, Wan-Fang Liu, Li-Hua Zhang, Jian Zhou, Zheng-Yuan Xue</p>
            <p>Due to its fast and robust characteristics, nonadiabatic geometric quantum computation with various optimized techniques has received much attention. However, these strategies either require precise pulse control or can only mitigate partial systematic errors, hindering their experimental development. Here, we propose a scheme for optimized composite nonadiabatic geometric quantum gates (OCNGQGs), which can further enhance the gate performance of the composite nonadiabatic geometric scheme. Specifically, by optimizing the path parameter, our scheme effectively resists systematic errors in both directions, i.e., Rabi frequency and detuning errors, while preserving the flexibility of pulse shapes. Numerical simulations demonstrate that our scheme offers superior gate robustness against these two types of errors compared to conventional schemes. Additionally, we propose to implement our scheme on superconducting transmon qubits, where the numerical results show the robustness of universal gates remaining evident within current technology. Therefore, our proposal provides a promising approach to achieve robust quantum gates for future scalable quantum computation.</p>

            <h2>The Quantum Decoding Problem : Tight Achievability Bounds and Application to Regev's Reduction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Agathe Blanvillain, Andr√© Chailloux, Jean-Pierre Tillich</p>
            <p>We consider the quantum decoding problem. It consists in recovering a codeword given a superposition of noisy versions of this codeword. By measuring the superposition, we get back to the classical decoding problem. It appears for the first time in Chen, Liu and Zhandry's work showing a quantum advantage for the Short Integer Solution (SIS) problem for the $l_\infty$ norm. In a recent paper, Chailloux and Tillich proved that when we have a noise following a Bernoulli distribution, the quantum decoding problem can be solved in polynomial time and is therefore easier than classical decoding for which the best known algorithms have an exponential complexity. They also give an information theoretic limit for the code rate at which this problem can be solved which turns out to be above the Shannon limit. In this paper, we generalize the last result to all memoryless noise models. We also show similar results in the rank metric case which corresponds to a noise model which is not memoryless. We analyze the Pretty Good Measurement, from which we derive an information theoretic limit for this problem. By using the algorithm for the quantum decoding problem together with Regev's reduction, we derive a quantum algorithm sampling codewords from the dual code according to a probability distribution which is the dual of the original noise. It turns out that at the information theoretic limit, we get the most likely nonzero codeword of the dual code. When the distribution is a decreasing function of the weight, we find minimal nonzero codewords. Note that Regev's reduction used together with classical decoding is much less satisfying since it is not able to output those minimum weight codewords.</p>

            <p>We study Semi-Quantum Key Distribution (SQKD) with a focus on finite-size security bounds, developed through three complementary perspectives. (i) Spectral disturbance: wrong-basis L√ºders updates produce closed-form spectra and purity loss, which serve as basis-independent indicators of disturbance. (ii) Operator-theoretic reduction: in Z/Z-sifted rounds, intercept-resend attacks can be represented as an effective depolarizing channel, characterized by a fidelity-QBER relation. (iii) Entropic trade-offs: Maassen-Uffink and memory-assisted uncertainty relations certify security through X tests and reflection rounds, even when the sifted QBER is low. The exposition provides step-by-step derivations supported by physically interpretable figures, and the framework concludes with finite-size estimates based on concentration inequalities that are suited for practical parameter estimation.</p>

            <p>We investigate the apparent thermality of Hawking radiation in the semi-classical limit of quantum black holes using the mean-field limit of a chiral spin-chain simulator, which models fermions propagating on a black hole space-time in the continuum. In this free-theory regime, no genuine thermalisation occurs. Nevertheless, we show that a bipartition across the event horizon yields a reduced density matrix whose mode occupations follow an apparent thermal Fermi-Dirac distribution. In contrast, partitions away from the horizon do not exhibit thermal behaviour, reflecting the absence of true equilibration. Our results demonstrate that Hawking radiation appears thermal only with respect to horizon bipartitions in free theories, while true thermal behaviour emerges only in the presence of interactions deep in the black hole interior.</p>

            <p>We study the conditions required to distinguish laser-induced nonlinear quantum electrodynamics (QED) effects in vacuum from competing signals due to interactions of laser pulses with ionized residual gas. The latter is inevitably present in vacuum chambers where experiments are performed because the vacuum is never perfect and there is always some residual pressure. The rarefied gas contribution is modeled statistically using the 1D-1V Vlasov-Maxwell system, while vacuum nonlinearities are described within the weak-field expansion of the Heisenberg-Euler effective action. In both cases, photon spectra from wave-mixing processes are evaluated by solving numerically the resulting partial differential equations using a semi-Lagrangian scheme. We consider short pulses in co- and counter-propagating configurations, allowing us to identify the laser intensities and vacuum pressures for which the vacuum signal dominates. These results provide quantitative guidance for future all-optical experiments aiming to detect light-by-light scattering in vacuum.</p>

            <p>We study a generalization of `Yukawa models' in which Majorana fermions, interacting via all-to-all random couplings as in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, are parametrically coupled to disordered bosonic degrees of freedom described by a quantum $p-$spin model. The latter has its own non-trivial dynamics leading to quantum paramagnetic (or liquid) and glassy phases. At low temperatures, this setup results in SYK behavior within each metastable state of a rugged bosonic free energy landscape, the effective fermionic couplings being different for each metastable state. We show that the boson-fermion coupling enhances the stability of the quantum spin-glass phase and strongly modifies the imaginary-time Green's functions of both sets of degrees of freedom. In particular, in the quantum spin glass phase, the imaginary-time dynamics is turned from a fast exponential decay characteristic of a gapped phase into a much slower dynamics. In the quantum paramagnetic phase, on the other hand, the fermions' imaginary-time dynamics get strongly modified and the critical SYK behavior is washed away.</p>

            <p>We investigate the relativistic quantum dynamics of amassless electron in graphene in a two-dimensional noncommutative (NC) plane under a constant background magnetic field. To address the issue of gauge invariance, we employ an effective massless NC Dirac field theory, incorporating the Seiberg-Witten (SW) map alongside the Moyal star product. Using this framework, we derive a manifestly gauge-invariant Hamiltonian for a massless Dirac particle, which serves as the basis for studying the relativistic Landau problem in graphene in NC space. Specifically, we analyze the motion of a relativistic electron in monolayer graphene within this background field and compute the energy spectrum of the NC Landau system. The NC-modified energy levels are then used to explore the system's thermodynamic response. Notably, in the low-temperature limit, spatial noncommutativity leads to a spontaneous magnetization-a distinct signature of NC geometry in relativistic condensed matter systems like graphene.</p>

We introduce a perturbative black brane solution in AdS spacetime up to the first order of the non-minimal coupling. Because the model exhibits the resistivity proportional to the temperature, it could describe strange metals. The complexity of the solution could be characterized by three quantities: the conserved charge, the non-minimal coupling and the generalized term in the complexity. The generalized term is chosen to be $C^2$, the Weyl squared tensor, $R^2F^2$ and $F^2$. The physical interpretation of the three quantities has been provided where the generalized term is interpreted as a bulk penalty factor, the non-minimal coupling and the conserved charge as an effective scrambling time of the dual theory which contains the choice of the generalization parameter.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wirawat Kokaew, Thiparat Chotibut, Areeya Chantasri</p>
            <p>Finding controls for open quantum systems needs to take into account effects from unwanted environmental noise. Since actual realizations or states of the noise are typically unknown, the usual treatment for the quantum system's decoherence dynamics is via the so-called Lindblad master equation, which in essence describes an average evolution (mean path) of the system's state affected by the unknown noise. We here consider an alternative view of a noise-affected open quantum system, where the average dynamics can be unravelled into hypothetical noisy quantum trajectories, and propose a control strategy for the state-preparation problem based on the likelihood of noise occurrence. We formulate a stochastic path integral for noise variables whose extremum yields control functions associated with a most-likely noise to achieve target states. As a proof of concept, we apply our method to a qubit-state preparation under dephasing noise and analytically solve for controlled Rabi drives for arbitrary target states. Since the method is constructed based on the probability of noise, we also introduce a fidelity success rate as a measure of the state preparation. We benchmark against the mean-path approaches, e.g., GRAPE and CRAB controls, using both average fidelity and a success-rate metric. While standard mean-path controls maximize average fidelity, most-likely controls achieve higher success rates, especially at strong dephasing.</p>

            <p>This work presents a new approach for simulating the HHL linear systems of equations solver algorithm with tensor networks. First, a novel HHL in the qudits formalism, the generalization of qubits, is developed, and then its operations are transformed into an equivalent classical HHL, taking advantage of the non-unitary operations that they can apply. The main novelty of this proposal is to perform a classical simulation of the HHL as efficiently as possible to benchmark the algorithm steps according to its input parameters and the input matrix. The algorithm is applied to three classical simple simulation problems, comparing it with an exact inversion algorithm, and its performance is compared against an implementation of the original HHL simulated in the Qiskit framework, providing both codes. It is also applied to study the sensitivity of the HHL algorithm with respect to its hyperparameter values, reporting the existence of saturation points and maximal performance values. The results show that this approach can achieve a promising performance in computational efficiency to simulate the HHL process without quantum noise, providing a higher bound for its performance.</p>

            <p>Quantum coherence has been shown to impact the operational capabilities of quantum systems performing thermodynamic tasks in a significant way, and yet the possibility and conditions for genuine coherence-enhanced thermodynamic operation remain unclear. Introducing a comparison with classical machines using the same set of thermodynamic resources, we show that for steady-state quantum thermal machines -- both autonomous and externally driven -- that interact weakly with thermal reservoirs and work sources, the presence of coherence induced by perturbations in the machine Hamiltonian guarantees a genuine thermodynamic advantage under mild conditions. This advantage applies to both cases where the induced coherence is between levels with different energies or between degenerate levels. On the other hand, we show that engines subjected to noise-induced coherence can be outperformed by classical stochastic engines using exactly the same set of (incoherent) resources. We illustrate our results with three prototypical models of heat engines and refrigerators: the three-level amplifier, the three-qubit autonomous refrigerator, and a noise-induced-coherence machine.</p>

            <h2>Achieving quantum advantage in a search for a violations of the Goldbach conjecture, with driven atoms in tailored potentials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oleksandr V. Marchukov, Andrea Trombettoni, Giuseppe Mussardo, Maxim Olshanii</p>
            <p>The famous Goldbach conjecture states that any even natural number $N$ greater than $2$ can be written as the sum of two prime numbers $p^{\text{(I)}}$ and $p^{\text{(II)}}$. In this article we propose a quantum analogue device that solves the following problem: given a small prime $p^{\text{(I)}}$, identify a member $N$ of a $\mathcal{N}$-strong set even numbers for which $N-p^{\text{(I)}}$ is also a prime. A table of suitable large primes $p^{\text{(II)}}$ is assumed to be known a priori. The device realizes the Grover quantum search protocol and as such ensures a $\sqrt{\mathcal{N}}$ quantum advantage. Our numerical example involves a set of 51 even numbers just above the highest even classical-numerically explored so far [T. O. e Silva, S. Herzog, and S. Pardi, Mathematics of Computation {\bf 83}, 2033 (2013)]. For a given small prime number $p^{\text{(I)}}=223$, it took our quantum algorithm 5 steps to identify the number $N=4\times 10^{18}+14$ as featuring a Goldbach partition involving $223$ and another prime, namely $p^{\text{(II)}}=4\times 10^{18}-239$. Currently, our algorithm limits the number of evens to be tested simultaneously to $\mathcal{N} \sim \ln(N)$: larger samples will typically contain more than one even that can be partitioned with the help of a given $p^{\text{(I)}}$, thus leading to a departure from the Grover paradigm.</p>

            <p>Scaling superconducting quantum processors to large qubit counts faces challenges in control signal delivery, thermal management, and hardware complexity, particularly in achieving microwave signal multiplexing and long-distance quantum information routing at millikelvin (mK) temperatures. We propose a space-time modulated Josephson Junction (JJ) metasurface architecture to generate and multiplex microwave control signals directly at mK temperatures. Theoretical and numerical results demonstrate the generation of multiple frequency tones with controlled parameters, enabling efficient and scalable qubit control while minimizing thermal loads and wiring overhead. We derive the nonlinear wave equation governing this system, simulate beam steering and frequency conversion, and discuss the feasibility of experimental implementation.</p>

            <h2>Sample-based Hamiltonian and Lindbladian simulation: Non-asymptotic analysis of sample complexity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Byeongseon Go, Hyukjoon Kwon, Siheon Park, Dhrumil Patel, Mark M. Wilde</p>
            <p>Density matrix exponentiation (DME) is a quantum algorithm that processes multiple copies of a program state $\sigma$ to realize the Hamiltonian evolution $e^{-i \sigma t}$. Wave matrix Lindbladization (WML) similarly processes multiple copies of a program state $\psi_L$ in order to realize a Lindbladian evolution. Both algorithms are prototypical sample-based quantum algorithms and can be used for various quantum information processing tasks, including quantum principal component analysis, Hamiltonian simulation, and Lindbladian simulation. In this work, we present detailed sample complexity analyses for DME and sample-based Hamiltonian simulation, as well as for WML and sample-based Lindbladian simulation. In particular, we prove that the sample complexity of DME is no larger than $4t^2/\varepsilon$ for evolution time $t$ and imprecision level $\varepsilon$ quantified by the normalized diamond distance. We also establish a fundamental lower bound on the sample complexity of sample-based Hamiltonian simulation, which matches our DME sample complexity bound up to a constant multiplicative factor. Additionally, we prove that the sample complexity of WML is no larger than $3t^2d^2/\varepsilon$, where $d$ is the dimension of the space on which the Lindblad operator acts nontrivially, and we prove a lower bound of $10^{-4} t^2/\varepsilon$ on the sample complexity of sample-based Lindbladian simulation. These results prove that WML is optimal for sample-based Lindbladian simulation whenever the Lindblad operator acts nontrivially on a constant-sized system. Finally, we point out that the DME sample complexity analysis in [Kimmel et al., npj Quantum Information 3, 13 (2017)] and the WML sample complexity analysis in [Patel and Wilde, Open Systems \& Information Dynamics 30, 2350010 (2023)] appear to be incomplete, highlighting the need for the results presented here.</p>

            <p>The Dicke-Ising model, one of the few paradigmatic models of matter-light interaction, exhibits a superradiant quantum phase transition above a critical coupling strength. However, in natural optical systems, its experimental validation is hindered by a "no-go theorem''.

We analyze the system's free energy landscape using field-theoretical methods and develop a digital-analog quantum algorithm that disentangles qubit and photon degrees of freedom through a parity-measurement protocol. This disentangling enables the emulation of a photonic Schr√∂dinger cat state, which is a hallmark of the superradiant ground state in finite-size systems and can be unambiguously probed through the Wigner tomography of the resonator's field.</p>

            <p>Developing a dark matter detector with wide mass tunability is an immensely desirable property, yet it is challenging due to maintaining strong sensitivity. Resonant cavities for dark matter detection have traditionally employed mechanical tuning, moving parts around to change electromagnetic boundary conditions. However, these cavities have proven challenging to operate in sub-Kelvin cryogenic environments due to differential thermal contraction, low heat capacities, and low thermal conductivities. Instead, we develop an electronically tunable cavity architecture by coupling a superconducting 3D microwave cavity with a DC flux tunable SQUID. With a flux delivery system engineered to maintain high coherence in the cavity, we perform a hidden-photon dark matter search below the quantum-limited threshold. A microwave photon counting technique is employed through repeated quantum non-demolition measurements using a transmon qubit. With this device, we perform a hidden-photon search and constrain the kinetic mixing angle to ${\varepsilon}< 8.2\times 10^{-15}$ in a tunable band from 5.672 GHz to 5.694 GHz. By coupling multimode tunable cavities to the transmon, wider hidden-photon searching ranges are possible.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Speed Limit and Quantum Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relation under Feedback Control</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hayato Yunoki, Yoshihiko Hasegawa</p>
            <p>Fundamental trade-off relations, such as quantum speed limit and quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relation, describe the performance limits of quantum systems by imposing that improvements in speed or precision necessitate a substantial thermodynamic cost. Quantum feedback control, which is a pivotal technique for manipulating quantum dynamics based on measurement outcomes, is widely employed to enhance system performance. Nevertheless, its impact on these fundamental bounds remains an open question. This work elucidates this influence by establishing a theoretical framework for quantum speed limit and quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relation under a paradigmatic Markovian feedback protocol. We derive general inequalities incorporating the effects of feedback control on speed and precision. Through numerical simulations on a simple two-level system and quantum error correction, a key application of quantum feedback control, we validate our derived bounds and demonstrate that feedback control can indeed improve both speed and precision beyond those achievable limits in uncontrolled systems. Next, to elucidate the mechanism behind these improvements and the qualitative difference from uncontrolled dynamics, we analyze the governing thermodynamic costs, which are the fundamental quantities that constrain speed and precision, within a simple model. Our analysis reveals that feedback can improve the time scaling order of these costs. This modification of the dynamical scaling is the origin of the qualitative performance gain, signifying that the feedback-induced improvements of performance are not merely quantitative but represent a fundamental shift. Consequently, our work offers a comprehensive understanding of how feedback control impacts the fundamental limits on the speed and precision of quantum systems, providing crucial insights for designing high-performance quantum technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vaibhav Sharma, Kaden R. A. Hazzard</p>
            <p>Quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories is an important avenue to gain insights into both particle physics phenomena and constrained quantum many-body dynamics. There is a growing interest in probing analogs of high energy collision phenomena in lattice gauge theories that can be implemented on current quantum simulators. Motivated by this, we characterize the confined mesons that originate from a local high energy excitation in a particle-conserving 1D $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory. We focus on a simple, experimentally accessible setting that does not require preparation of colliding wavepackets and isolates the effects of gauge field confinement strength and initial state energy on the nature of propagating excitations. We find that the dynamics is characterized by the propagation of a superposition of differently sized mesons. The linear confinement leads to meson size oscillations in time. The average meson size and oscillation frequency are controlled by the strength of the gauge field confinement. At a constant confinement field, the average meson length is controlled by the initial excitation's energy. Higher energies produce longer mesons and their effective mass depends strongly on their size: longer mesons propagate more slowly out of the central excitation. Mesons of different sizes get spatially filtered with time due to different speeds. We show that this phenomenology is a consequence of linear confinement and remains valid in both the strong and weak confinement limit. We present simple explanations of these phenomena supported by exact numerics.</p>

We demonstrate 10% increase in pulse energy when exposing the laser diode to 1310-nm, 1.6-mW cw laser light via its fiber pigtail. This may allow an eavesdropper to steal the secret key. A possible countermeasure is to install broadband optical filters and isolators at the source's output and characterise them during the security certification.</p>

            <h2>No Practical Quantum Broadcasting: Even Virtually</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yunlong Xiao, Xiangjing Liu, Zhenhuan Liu</p>
            <p>Quantum information cannot be broadcast -- an intrinsic limitation imposed by quantum mechanics. However, recent advances in virtual operations offer new insights into the no-broadcasting theorem. Here, we focus on the practical utility and introduce sample efficiency as a fundamental constraint, requiring any practical broadcasting protocol perform no worse than the na√Øve approach of direct preparation and distribution. We prove that no linear process -- whether quantum or beyond -- can simultaneously uphold sample efficiency, unitary covariance, permutation invariance, and classical consistency. This leads to a no-practical-broadcasting theorem, which places strict limits on the practical distribution of quantum information. By applying Schur-Weyl duality, we establish the uniqueness of the canonical 1-to-$N$ virtual broadcasting map that satisfies the latter three conditions, provide its construction, and determine its sample complexity through semidefinite programming. Finally, we explore the interplay between virtual broadcasting and a quantum spacetime framework, known as the pseudo-density operator, showing that their correspondence holds only in the 1-to-2 case, underscoring the fundamental asymmetry between spatial and temporal statistics in the quantum world.</p>

            <p>Bosonic two-mode squeezed states are paradigmatic entangled states with broad applications in quantum information processing and metrology. In this work, we propose a two-mode squeezing scheme within a hybrid three-mode cavity optomechanical system, wherein a mechanical resonator is coupled to two microwave (or optical) photon modes. By applying and modulating strong driving pulses to the photon modes, we construct an effective Hamiltonian that describes two-photon squeezing mediated by the mechanical mode. This effective Hamiltonian is validated through the diagonalization of the system's Liouvillian superoperator. With the effective Hamiltonian, we provide a rigorous theoretical solution for the dynamical process of squeezing generation within the open-quantum-system framework. Our analysis reveals that stable two-mode squeezing can be obtained by optimizing the squeezing quadrature operator, even in unstable system dynamics. Moreover, the squeezing level can surpass the maximum achievable under stable system conditions. Our work provides an extendable approach for generating two-mode squeezed states between indirectly coupled Gaussian modes.</p>

            <p>Mechanisms that give rise to coherent quantum dynamics, such as quantum many-body scars, have recently attracted much interest as a way of controlling quantum chaos. However, identifying the presence of quantum scars in general many-body Hamiltonians remains an outstanding challenge. Here we introduce ScarFinder, a variational framework that reveals possible scar-like dynamics without prior knowledge of scar states or their algebraic structure. By iteratively evolving and projecting states within a low-entanglement variational manifold, ScarFinder isolates scarred trajectories by suppressing thermal contributions. We validate the method on the analytically tractable spin-1 XY model, recovering the known scar dynamics, as well as the mixed field Ising model, where we capture and generalize the initial conditions previously associated with ``weak thermalization''. We then apply the method to the PXP model of Rydberg atom arrays, efficiently characterizing its mixed phase space and finding a previously unknown trajectory with nearly-perfect revival dynamics in the thermodynamic limit. Our results establish ScarFinder as a powerful, model-agnostic tool for identifying and optimizing coherent dynamics in quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <h2>Distillation of multipartite entangled states for arbitrary subsets of parties in noisy quantum networks of increasing size</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aitor Balmaseda, Julio I. de Vicente</p>
            <p>Quantum network states are multipartite states built from distributing pairwise entanglement among parties and underpin the paradigm of quantum networks for quantum information processing. In this work we introduce the problem of partial distillability in noisy quantum networks. This corresponds to the possibility of distilling by local operations and classical communication an arbitrary pure state for an arbitrary subset of parties starting from a single copy of a quantum network state of an increasing number of parties that share noisy (i.e. mixed) bipartite entangled states. Here, distillation means that the target state is obtained with fidelity as close to 1 as desired as the size of the network increases when the pairwise entangled links support a constant amount of noise. While we prove an obstruction to multipartite distillation protocols after teleportation with channels with constant noise, we show that partial distillability is indeed possible if certain well-established graph-theoretic parameters that measure the connectivity in the network grow fast enough with its size. We give necessary as well as sufficient conditions for partial distillability in terms of these parameters and we moreover provide explicit constructions of networks with partial distillability and a relatively slow connectivity growth.</p>

While previous studies of the quantum Mpemba effect (QME) have largely focused on isolated systems with global symmetries, we argue that the QME is ubiquitous in generic, non-integrable many-body systems lacking such symmetries, including U(1) charge conservation, spatial symmetries, and even energy conservation. Using paradigmatic models such as the quantum Ising model with transverse and longitudinal fields, we show that the QME can be understood through the energy density of initial states and their inverse participation ratio in the energy eigenbasis. Our findings provide a unified framework for the QME, linking it with classical thermal relaxation.</p>

            <p>Complex quantum networks are not only hard to establish, but also difficult to simulate due to the exponentially growing state space and noise-induced imperfections. In this work, we propose an alternative approach that leverage quantum computers and noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices as simulators for quantum networks, including noisy quantum devices, channels, and protocols. Rather than considering noise as an undesired property that needs to be mitigated, we demonstrate how imperfections in quantum hardware can be utilized to simulate real-world communication devices under realistic conditions beyond classical simulation capabilities. Our approach allows NISQ devices with modest noise to simulate devices with more significant imperfections enabling large-scale, detailed simulations of quantum networks, where exact error models can be treated. It also improves over direct implementation and benchmarking of real networks, as waiting times for information transmission, locality, and memory restrictions do not apply. This framework can offer advantages in flexibility, scalability, and precision, demonstrating that NISQ devices can serve as natural testbeds for complex quantum networks, and paving the way for more efficient quantum network simulations.</p>

            <p>Quantum coherence, encoded in the off-diagonal elements of a system's density matrix, is a key resource in quantum thermodynamics, fundamentally limiting the maximum extractable work known as ergotropy. While previous experiments have isolated coherence-related contributions to work extraction, it remains unclear how coherence can be harnessed in a controllable and energy-efficient manner. Here, we experimentally investigate the role of initial-state coherence in work extraction from a superconducting transmon qubit. By preparing a variety of pure states and implementing three complementary extraction protocols, we reveal how coherence governs the partitioning of ergotropy. We find that the choice of initial state depends on the dominant decoherence channel-energy relaxation or dephasing. By further accounting for thermodynamic costs, we identify optimal initial states that maximize the efficiency. Our results demonstrate that the initial-state design provides a scalable approach to coherence control and advances the development of efficient quantum thermodynamic devices.</p>

QSP is an algorithm that uses single-qubit dynamics to perform a polynomial function transformation.

We can map parameters from QSP to AIM to implement QSP-like evolution with nonadiabatic, high-amplitude external drives. By choosing AIM parameters that control non-adiabatic transition parameters (such as driving amplitude $A$, frequency $\omega$, and signal timing), one can achieve polynomial approximations and increase robustness in quantum circuits. The analogy presented here between QSP and AIM can be useful as a way to directly implement the QSP algorithm on quantum systems and obtain all the benefits from the fast Landau-Zener-Stuckelberg-Majotana (LZSM) quantum logic gates.</p>

We generalize this to arbitrary integer $D$ by introducing local unitaries beyond the Clifford group, enabling decomposition of prime-power qudit stabilizer states into $p$-level GHZ states, EPR pairs, and unentangled qudits.

Using quantum perturbation theory for Heisenberg operators, we find the solution for the material electric polarization and show that a four-wave mixing-like correlated SaS scattering appears in the first order of perturbation and completely characterizes the non-resonant SaS photon pair production. We also discuss how to construct the third-order non-linear optical susceptibility for the SaS scattering from the quantum formalism, and show that it coincides with the one derived for classical fields in stimulated Raman.</p>

To accelerate optimization and reduce quantum resource usage, we investigate a range of strategies that enable knowledge transfer between related tasks.

We propose and evaluate several methods, including warm-start initialization, parameter estimation via first-order Taylor expansion, hierarchical clustering with D-level trees, and deep learning-based transfer. Our experimental results, using parameterized quantum circuits implemented with PennyLane, demonstrate that transfer techniques significantly reduce the number of required iterations while maintaining an acceptable cost value.

            <p>In this exploratory numerical study, we assess the suitability of Quantum Linear Solvers (QLSs) toward providing a quantum advantage for Networks-based Linear System Problems (NLSPs). NLSPs are of importance as they are naturally connected to real-world applications. In an NLSP, one starts with a graph and arrives at a system of linear equations. The advantage that one may obtain with a QLS for an NLSP is determined by the interplay between three variables: the scaling of condition number and sparsity functions of matrices associated with the graphs considered, as well as the function describing the system size growth. We recommend graph families that can offer potential for an exponential advantage (best graph families) and those that offer sub-exponential but at least polynomial advantage (better graph families), with the HHL algorithm considered relative to an efficient classical linear solver. Within the scope of our analyses, we observe that only 4% of the 50 considered graph families offer prospects for an exponential advantage, whereas about 20% of the considered graph families show a polynomial advantage. Furthermore, we observe and report some interesting cases where some graph families not only fare better with improved algorithms such as the Childs-Kothari-Somma algorithm but also graduate from offering no advantage to promising a polynomial advantage, graph families that exhibit futile exponential advantage, etc. Given the limited number of graph families that one can survey through numerical studies, we discuss an interesting case where we unify several graph families into one superfamily, and show the existence of infinite best and better graphs in it. Lastly, we very briefly touch upon some practical issues that one may face even if the aforementioned graph theoretic requirements are satisfied, including quantum hardware challenges.</p>

            <p>Recent advances in quantum error-correction (QEC) have shown that it is often beneficial to understand fault-tolerance as a dynamical process, a circuit with redundant measurements that help correct errors, rather than as a static code equipped with a syndrome extraction circuit. Spacetime codes have emerged as a natural framework to understand error correction at the circuit level while leveraging the traditional QEC toolbox. Here, we introduce a framework based on chain complexes and chain maps to model spacetime codes and transformations between them. We show that stabilizer codes, quantum circuits, and decoding problems can all be described using chain complexes, and that the equivalence of two spacetime codes can be characterized by specific maps between chain complexes, the fault-tolerant maps, that preserve the number of encoded qubits, fault distance, and minimum-weight decoding problem. As an application of this framework, we extend the foliated cluster state construction from stabilizer codes to any spacetime code, showing that any Clifford circuit can be transformed into a measurement-based protocol with the same fault-tolerant properties. To this protocol, we associate a chain complex which encodes the underlying decoding problem, generalizing previous cluster state complex constructions. Our method enables the construction of cluster states from non-CSS, subsystem, and Floquet codes, as well as from logical Clifford operations on a given code.</p>

            <h2>Quantum error correction beyond $SU(2)$: spin, bosonic, and permutation-invariant codes from convex geometry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arda Aydin, Victor V. Albert, Alexander Barg</p>
            <p>We develop a framework for constructing quantum error-correcting codes and logical gates for three types of spaces -- composite permutation-invariant spaces of many qubits or qudits, composite constant-excitation Fock-state spaces of many bosonic modes, and monolithic nuclear state spaces of atoms, ions, and molecules. By identifying all three spaces with discrete simplices and representations of the Lie group $SU(q)$, we prove that many codes and their gates in $SU(q)$ can be inter-converted between the three state spaces. We construct new code instances for all three spaces using classical $\ell_1$ codes and Tverberg's theorem, a classic result from convex geometry. We obtain new families of quantum codes with distance that scales almost linearly with the code length $N$ by constructing $\ell_1$ codes based on combinatorial patterns called Sidon sets and utilizing their Tverberg partitions. This improves upon the existing designs for all the state spaces. We present explicit constructions of codes with shorter length or lower total spin/excitation than known codes with similar parameters, new bosonic codes with exotic Gaussian gates, as well as examples of short codes with distance larger than the known constructions.</p>

This representation enables rigorous calculation of spectra for local dissipation such as dephasing and incoherent hopping, and yields proofs of gaplessness, absence of residual spectrum and a condition for convergence of finite volume spectra to their infinite volume counterparts. The analysis relies on new results on the spectra of direct integrals of non-normal operators which may be of independent interest.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas Katsekpor, Lat√©vi M. Lawson, Prince K. Osei, Ibrahim Nonkan√©</p>
            <p>Position deformation of a Heisenberg algebra and Hilbert space representation of both maximal length and minimal momentum uncertainties may lead to loss of Hermiticity of some operators that generate this algebra. Consequently, the Hamiltonian operator constructed from these operators are also not Hermitian. In the present paper, with an appropriate positive-definite Dyson map, we establish the Hermiticity of these operators by means of a quasi-similarity transformation. We then construct Hilbert space representations associated with these quasi-Hermitian operators that generate a quasi-Hermitian Heisenberg algebra. With the help of these representations we establish the path integral formulation of any systems in this quasi-Hermitian algebra. Finally, using the path integral of a free particle as an example, we demonstrate that the Euclidean propagator, action, and kinetic energy of this system are constrained by the standard classical mechanics limits.</p>

            <h2>Spectral decomposition and high-accuracy Greens functions: Overcoming the Nyquist-Shannon limit via complex-time Krylov expansion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sebastian Paeckel</p>
            <p>The accurate computation of low-energy spectra of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems, typically accessed via Greens-functions, is a long-standing problem posing enormous challenges to numerical methods. When the spectral decomposition is obtained from Fourier transforming a time series, the Nyquist-Shannon theorem limits the frequency resolution $\Delta\omega$ according to the numerically accessible time domain size $T$ via $\Delta\omega = 2/T$. In tensor network methods, increasing the domain size is exponentially hard due to the ubiquitous spread of correlations, limiting the frequency resolution and thereby restricting this ansatz class mostly to one-dimensional systems with small quasi-particle velocities. Here, we show how this fundamental limitation can be overcome using complex-time Krylov spaces. At the example of the critical $S-1/2$ Heisenberg model and light bipolarons in the two-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, we demonstrate the enormous improvements in accuracy, which can be achieved using this method.</p>

Both descriptions take into account energetics of the interaction of magnetic moments with inhomogeneous magnetic fields. We show how magnetic moment effects are included in either version of electrodynamics and that these apparently different formulations can give consistent results. In either case, we express the interactions in terms of electromagnetic fields only, avoiding use of a vector potential.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Toshiya Hikihara, Hiroshi Ueda, Kouichi Okunishi, Kenji Harada, Tomotoshi Nishino</p>
            <p>Numerical methods based on tensor networks have been extensively explored in the research of quantum many-body systems in recent years. It has been recognized that the ability of tensor networks to describe a quantum many-body state crucially depends on the spatial structure of the network. In the previous work [Hikihara et al., Phys. Rev. Res. 5, 013031 (2023)], we proposed an algorithm based on tree tensor networks (TTNs) that automatically optimizes the structure of TTN according to the spatial profile of entanglement in the state of interest. In this paper, we apply the algorithm to the random XY-exchange model under random magnetic fields and the Richardson model in order to analyze how the performance of the algorithm depends on the detailed updating schemes of the structural optimization. We then find that for the random XY model, on the one hand, the algorithm achieves improved accuracy, and the stochastic algorithm, which selects the local network structure probabilistically, is notably effective. For the Richardson model, on the other hand, the resulting numerical accuracy subtly depends on the initial TTN and the updating schemes. In particular, the algorithm without the stochastic updating scheme certainly improves the accuracy, while the one with the stochastic updates results in poor accuracy due to the effect of randomizing the network structure at the early stage of the calculation. These results indicate that the algorithm successfully improves the accuracy of the numerical calculations for quantum many-body states, while it is essential to appropriately choose the updating scheme as well as the initial TTN structure, depending on the systems treated.</p>

            <h2>Error bounds on the universal Lindblad equation in the thermodynamic limit</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Teruhiro Ikeuchi, Takashi Mori</p>
            <p>It is a central problem in various fields of physics to elucidate the behavior of quantum many-body systems subjected to bulk dissipation. In this context, several microscopic derivations of the Lindblad quantum master equation for many-body systems have been proposed so far. Among them, the universal Lindblad equation derived by Nathan and Rudner is fascinating because it has the desired locality and its derivation seems to rely solely on the assumption that the bath correlation time is much shorter than the dissipation time, which is the case in the weak-coupling limit or the singular-coupling limit. However, it remains elusive whether errors from several approximations in deriving the universal Lindblad equation remain small during the time evolution in the thermodynamic limit. Here, rigorous error bounds on the time evolution of a local quantity are given, and it is shown that, under the assumption of accelerated dissipation in bulk-dissipated systems, those errors vanish in the weak-coupling limit or the singular-coupling limit after taking the thermodynamic limit.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martina Gisti, David J. Luitz, Maxime Debertolis</p>
            <p>We extend the concept of operator charge in the context of an abelian U (1) symmetry and apply this framework to symmetry-preserving matrix product operators (MPOs), enabling the description of operators projected onto specific sectors of the corresponding symmetry. Leveraging this representation, we study the effect of interactions on the scrambling of information in an integrable Heisenberg spin chain, by controlling the number of particles. Our focus lies on out-of-time order correlators (OTOCs) which we project on sectors with a fixed number of particles. This allows us to link the non-interacting system to the fully-interacting one by allowing more and more particle to interact with each other, keeping the interaction parameter fixed. While at short times, the OTOCs are almost not affected by interactions, the spreading of the information front becomes gradually faster and the OTOC saturate at larger values as the number of particle increases. We also study the behavior of finite-size systems by considering the OTOCs at times beyond the point where the front hits the boundary of the system. We find that in every sector with more than one particle, the OTOCs behave as if the local operator was rotated by a random unitary matrix, indicating that the presence of boundaries contributes to the maximal scrambling of local operators.</p>

            <p>Ultracold gases of dipolar molecules have long been envisioned as a platform for the realization of novel quantum phases. Recent advances in collisional shielding, protecting molecules from inelastic losses, have enabled the creation of degenerate Fermi gases and, more recently, Bose-Einstein condensation of dipolar molecules. However, the observation of quantum phases in ultracold molecular gases that are driven by dipole-dipole interactions has so far remained elusive. In this work, we report the formation of self-bound droplets and droplet arrays in an ultracold gas of strongly dipolar sodium-cesium molecules. Starting from a molecular Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), microwave dressing fields are used to induce dipole-dipole interactions with controllable strength and anisotropy. By varying the speed at which interactions are induced, covering a dynamic range of four orders of magnitude, we prepare droplets under equilibrium and non-equilibrium conditions, observing a transition from robust one-dimensional (1D) arrays to fluctuating two-dimensional (2D) structures. The droplets exhibit densities up to 100 times higher than the initial BEC, reaching the strongly interacting regime, and suggesting the possibility of a quantum-liquid or crystalline state. This work establishes ultracold molecules as a system for the exploration of strongly dipolar quantum matter and opens the door to the realization of self-organized crystal phases and dipolar spin liquids in optical lattices.</p>

            <p>In previous works, we showed that both time and space can emerge from entanglement within a globally constrained quantum Universe, with no background coordinates. By extending the Page and Wootters quantum time formalism to include both quantum clocks and rods, and imposing global constraints on total energy and momentum, we constructed a fully relational model of quantum spacetime. Here we take a further step: working in 1+1 dimensions, we show that the standard wave equations governing quantum particles (the Schr√∂dinger, Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations) emerge naturally from this framework. The solutions of the equations are derived directly from the constraints, without assuming any external spacetime structure. The second quantization formalism is also implemented and discussed. Our results provide further support for the idea that quantum dynamics in spacetime may emerge from entanglement and constraints.</p>

            <p>The Spectral Form Factor (SFF) is defined as the modulus squared of the partition function in complex temperature for hermitian matrices and a suitable generalisation has been given in the non hermitian case. In this work we compute the properties of the quenched SFF for hermitian and non hermitian random matrices. Despite the fact that the (annealed) SFF is not self-averaging the quenched SFF is self-averaging but these two averages coincide up to subleading constants (at least for high enough temperatures). The fluctuations of $\log \mathrm{SFF}$ are deep and one encounters thin spikes when moving close to a zero of the partition function. We study the partition function at late times by considering a suitable change of variable which turns out to be compatible with a Gumbel distribution. We note that the exponential tails of this distribution can be obtained by the deep spikes in the $\log \mathrm{SFF}$, namely the zeros of the partition function. We compare with the results obtained in isolated many-body systems and we show that same results hold at late times also for non-hermitian Hamiltonains and non-hermitian random matrices.</p>

            <p>Variational Quantum Eigensolvers (VQEs) are a leading class of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) algorithms, whose performance is highly sensitive to parameter initialization. Although recent machine learning-based initialization methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance, their progress has been limited by the lack of comprehensive datasets. Existing resources are typically restricted to a single domain, contain only a few hundred instances, and lack complete coverage of Hamiltonians, ansatz circuits, and optimization trajectories. To overcome these limitations, we introduce VQEzy, the first large-scale dataset for VQE parameter initialization. VQEzy spans three major domains and seven representative tasks, comprising 12,110 instances with full VQE specifications and complete optimization trajectories. The dataset is available online, and will be continuously refined and expanded to support future research in VQE optimization.</p>

            <h2>Dimer-driven multiple reentrant localization with composite potential</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pei-Jie Chang, Dong Ruan, Gui-Lu Long</p>
            <p>Recent studies have revealed reentrant localization transitions in quasi-periodic one-dimensional lattices, where the competition between dimerized hopping and staggered disorder plays a central role. Yet the extent to which such reentrant localization persists under more general conditions, such as additional periodic potentials, modified quasi-periodic modulations remains unclear. Here we investigate localization phenomena in a one-dimensional lattice subject to a periodic potential and an additional quasi-periodic modulation. Using both eigenstate-based indicators and experimentally accessible dynamical observables, we identify robust reentrant, or multiple, localization transitions. We show that these transitions are uniquely stabilized by the dimer structure of the unit cell, where the competition between the onsite periodic potential and the quasi-periodic modulation becomes most pronounced. By systematically varying the periodicity parameter $\alpha$ and the quasi-periodic frequency $\beta$, we find that the robust multiple reentrant localization behavior disappears for any deviation from the dimer configuration, confirming its essential role. Our results suggest that the interplay between these competing factors drives the multiple reentrant localization transitions.</p>

            <p>We consider free Dirac fermions on a discretized $AdS_2$ black hole background, and analyze how curved space redshift, horizons, and the spin connection induced chiral gravitational effect shape spectral, transport, and scrambling phenomena. The system is discretized via staggered fermions followed by the Jordan-Wigner transform to encode the model in qubit degrees of freedom, whose Hamiltonian carries site dependent warp factors and bond chirality terms encoding the redshift and spin connection effects. We calculate the ground state and first excited states energies, their local charge profiles, and their half-chain entanglement entropies, showing how redshift and chirality affect the transition from criticality to a gapped regime. Probing operator growth via out-of-time-order correlators, we find that horizons and the chiral coupling accelerate scrambling, yet remain within a non-chaotic regime. Finally, we map out an integrable to ergodic crossover via level-spacing statistics and Brody fits, and introduce on-site disorder to drive a many body localization transition.</p>

            <p>Thermal states are thermal with respect to a fixed Hamiltonian. How much information about this Hamiltonian can we ``bootstrap'' from the subsystems of a thermal state? We attack the problem by positioning it as a subspecies of the quantum marginal problem. In states that obey the quantum Markov property, the Petz recovery map captures the knowledge of the larger system inherent in a subsystem. We use the conditional mutual information to check the goodness of Petz recovery, analytically in a random-matrix-theory-inspired hopping model and numerically in an Ising-like spin chain model. We observe different behavior in chaotic versus integrable phases of the model: in the chaotic phase, the reconstruction works well at both very low and very high temperatures, with some intermediate critical temperature at which reconstruction works worst, whereas in the integrable phase reconstruction breaks down at low temperatures.</p>

            <p>We ask how quantum correlations can be distributed among many subsystems. To address this, we define entanglement sharing schemes (ESS) where certain pairs of subsystems allow entanglement to be recovered via local operations, while other pairs must not. ESS schemes come in two variants, one where the partner system with which entanglement should be prepared is known, and one where it is not. In the case of known partners, we fully characterize the access structures realizable for ESS when using stabilizer states, and construct efficient schemes for threshold access structures, and give a conjecture for the access structures realizable with general states. In the unknown partner case, we again give a complete characterization in the stabilizer setting, additionally give a complete characterization of the case where there are no restrictions on unauthorized pairs, and we prove a set of necessary conditions on general schemes which we conjecture are also sufficient. Finally, we give an application of the theory of entanglement sharing to resolve an open problem related to the distribution of entanglement in response to time-sensitive requests in quantum networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ali Abu-Nada, Lian-Ao Wu</p>
            <p>We analyze two coupled quantum oscillators in a common Lorentzian environment and control them by detuning (temporarily shifting) their frequencies. The reduced dynamics are solved exactly, without Born or Markov approximations, by propagating each detuning segment in closed form. We study two control schedules: regular detuning, with perfectly periodic on and off pulses of fixed period, width, and amplitude; and irregular detuning, with the same on/off structure but cycle-to-cycle jitter in period, width, and amplitude. Our main observable is the average excitation number (AEN) of each mode. Detuning moves the system away from the bath's spectral peak, suppressing decoherence and damping non-Markovian revivals; in effectively Markovian baths the benefit is small. We quantify performance with a simple time-domain suppression factor. Larger detuning amplitudes and higher duty cycles yield stronger protection. Irregular control is slightly weaker at low duty cycle but becomes comparable to regular control as the duty cycle approaches one. These results give practical design rules linking detuning, duty cycle, and bath width, and provide an exact benchmark for controlled non-Markovian dynamics.</p>

            <p>This thesis investigates sampling-based quantum algorithms for electronic ground state energy estimation, focusing on Quantum-Selected Configuration Interaction (QSCI) and Sample-Based Quantum Diagonalization (SQD) as near-term alternatives to the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). Unlike VQE, which suffers from barren plateaus and high measurement costs, these methods avoid variational optimization by sampling Slater determinants from quantum hardware and performing diagonalization classically. The central contribution is the first analytical expression for the sampling bottleneck: the determinant-discovery step is mapped to the classical coupon-collector problem, yielding both an exact formula and a scalable lower-bound estimator for the number of measurements required to recover all determinants contributing to the ground state. Previous work only relied on numerical sampling and estimation. The analysis is validated through simulations, hardware-calibrated noisy studies, and execution on IBM's 127-qubit IBM Brisbane processor, demonstrating the dominant role of sampling efficiency in the near-term feasibility of QSCI and SQD.

In two-level systems, this yields incorrect transmission, while in three-level systems, it predicts unrealistically large amplification. Furthermore, we show that Doppler averaging in warm vapor suppresses oscillatory ringing and the maximum achievable gain.

The dissociation process naturally produces nonlocal quantum correlations in spin, position-momentum, and path degrees of freedom, enabling the deterministic preparation of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pairs of massive particles and multiqubit states through hyperentangled encoding. Having each atom of the pair prepared in a matter waveguide, the scheme can be scaled to hundreds of parallel entanglement sources in an array connected to a matter wave optical network of beam splitters, phase shifters, interferometers, tunnel junctions and local detectors. The protocol builds on established techniques, including programmable optical potentials, high-fidelity single-particle control, single-molecule initialization, controlled molecular dissociation, and quantum gas microscopy with near-perfect detection, making it directly implementable with current technology.

            <p>Radical pairs (also known as spin qubit pairs, electron-hole pairs) are transient reaction intermediates that are found and utilised in all areas of science. Radical pair spin dynamics simulations including all nuclear spins have been a computational barrier due to exponential scaling memory requirements. We address this issue with a tensor network method for accurately simulating the full open quantum dynamics of radical pair systems, explicitly accounting for hyperfine interactions with up to 30 nuclear spins with additional benchmarking including 60 nuclei. By employing the matrix product state (MPS) and matrix product density operator (MPDO) representations, we mitigate the exponential scaling of Hilbert and Liouville spaces typically encountered in full quantum non-Markovian treatments. We demonstrate the power of these methods with biologically relevant flavin-tryptophan radical pair systems, where we investigate electron hopping processes between multiple radical pairs using Lindblad jump operators. These simulations precisely capture anisotropic spin dynamics, clearly identifying orientational dependence of the magnetic field, which enhances or diminishes the spin-selective product yield. These directional sensitivities highlight the critical dependence of the nuclear environment and underscore the necessity of fully quantum treatments in spin biophysics, offering critical insights into avian magnetoreception mechanisms. This work provides a robust computational framework applicable to a broad range of scientific realms, which include spin chemistry, quantum biology, and spintronics.</p>

This way, we are able to control the states of the target qubits by leveraging their intrinsic interaction with the central qubit, eliminating the need for slow error-prone direct control. The DD-gate protocol is developed and experimentally implemented within two distinct frameworks: a hardware-agnostic model with minimal assumptions, benchmarked within a general-purpose digital quantum simulator given by the IBMQ; and an experimentally realistic case with nitrogen-15 vacancy center ($^{15}$NV) in diamond. Likewise, we are able to thoroughly characterize the quantum mechanical dynamics behind the multi-qubit gates within IBMQ, without many of the experimental constraints faced by other quantum systems. While at the same time, we establish the protocol for the $^{15}$NV system, considering its specific properties. The DD-gates with $^{15}$NVs can represent a significant reduction in gate times and improved technological scalability, compared to current methods of target qubit control using dynamical decoupling. In addition, we propose a simple application of the method for high-efficiency polarization generation of the $^{15}$N nuclear spin. All experimental findings are supported by comprehensive open-source simulations in the two distinct frameworks. This work provides a robust hardware-agnostic strategy for quantum control, which can be implemented with arbitrary systems that fit the central-target qubits description. Thus, marking an essential step in technological scalability of future quantum devices.</p>

            <p>The development of emerging technologies in quantum optics demands accurate models that faithfully capture genuine quantum effects. Mature semiclassical approaches reach their limits when confronted with quantized electromagnetic fields, while full Hilbert space treatments are often computationally prohibitive. To address these challenges, we develop a framework based on coupled stochastic processes with a common cross-covariance structure that can be easily coupled to various types of Maxwell solvers. Our approach accounts for the non-commutativity in the quantum-to-classical transition in a natural way, and has the ability to capture quantum optical signatures while retaining compatibility with classical electromagnetics. For benchmarking, we compare our simulation results with experimental emission spectra of a strongly driven InGaAs quantum dot, finding excellent agreement. Our results highlight the potential of tailored stochastic processes for simulating non-classical light in complex photonic environments.</p>

            <h2>Quantum sensing of a quantum field</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ricard Ravell Rodr√≠guez, Mart√≠ Perarnau-Llobet, Pavel Sekatski</p>
            <p>Estimating a classical parameter encoded in the Hamiltonian of a quantum probe is a fundamental and well-understood task in quantum metrology. A textbook example is the estimation of a classical field's amplitude using a two-level probe, as described by the semi-classical Rabi model. In this work, we explore the fully quantum analogue, where the amplitude of a coherent quantized field is estimated by letting it interact with a two-level atom. For both metrological scenarios, we focus on the quantum Fisher information (QFI) of the reduced state of the atomic probe. In the semi-classical Rabi model, the QFI is independent of the field amplitude and grows quadratically with the interaction time $\tau$. In contrast, when the atom interacts with a single coherent mode of the field, the QFI is bounded by 4, a constant dictated by the non-orthogonality of coherent states. We find that this bound can only be approached in the vacuum limit. In the limit of large amplitude $\alpha$, the QFI is found to attain its maximal value $1.47$ at $\tau =O(1)$ and $\tau =O(\alpha^2)$, and also shows periodic revivals at much later times. When the atom interacts with a sequence of coherent states, the QFI can increase with time but is bounded to scale linearly due to the production of entanglement between the atom and the radiation (back-action), except in the limit where the number of modes and their total energy diverge. Finally, in the continuous limit, where the atom interacts with many weak coherent states, this back-action can be simply interpreted as spontaneous emission, giving rise to the optimal interaction time and QFI rate.</p>

            <p>Resonant energy transfer (RET), between equal parity 1s65s$^3\mathrm{S}_1$ and 1s66s$^3\mathrm{S}_1$ Rydberg levels in helium has been observed in low-temperature ($\sim80$ mK) collisions with ammonia molecules which undergo inversion transitions in their X$^1$A$_1$ ground electronic state. This hybrid Rydberg-atom polar-molecule RET represents a monopole-dipole energy exchange reaction that necessarily requires spatial overlap of the Rydberg-electron and molecular wavefunctions. Calculations, explicitly accounting for the charge-dipole interaction between the Rydberg electron and the molecular dipole, provide a quantitative explanation of the observations. Total parity is conserved in the reaction through the mixing of collisional angular momentum in the atom-molecule complex. This work opens opportunities to expand the toolbox of hybrid neutral-atom polar-molecule platforms for quantum science with charge-dipole mediated energy exchange.</p>

            <p>Recent experiments have searched for evidence of the impact of non-inertial motion on the entanglement of particles. The success of these endeavours has been hindered by the fact that such tests were performed within spatial scales that were only "local" when compared to the spatial scales over which the non-inertial motion was taking place. We propose a Sagnac-like interferometer that, by challenging such bottlenecks, is able to achieve entangled states through a mechanism induced by the mechanical rotation of a photonic interferometer. The resulting states violate the Bell-Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (Bell-CHSH) inequality all the way up to the Tsirelson bound, thus signalling strong quantum nonlocality. Furthermore, we show that the Bell-CHSH inequality remains violated even without using any form of post-selection up to the value $1+\sqrt{2}$. Our results demonstrate that mechanical rotation can be thought of as resource for controlling quantum non-locality with implications also for recent proposals for experiments that can probe the quantum nature of curved spacetimes and non-inertial motion.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dongni Chen, Stefano Chesi, Mahn-Soo Choi</p>
            <p>We have analyzed the dynamics of entanglement in dissipative fermionic and bosonic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) models and found that, when the decoherence channel preserves the chiral symmetry, they exhibit a revival of entanglement in a wide range of parameters. This behavior only emerges in the topological phase, with the visibility of the revival dropping to zero at the phase boundary. Furthermore, the revival acquires a universal character once the system size exceeds the localization length of the edge modes. Our findings indicate that the universal entanglement revival has its origin in the topological properties of the SSH model. These dynamical properties may be experimentally accessible, for example, using photonic quantum computers.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Albert Georg Passegger, Rainer Verch</p>
            <p>We calculate the transition rate of an Unruh-DeWitt detector coupled to a non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) of a free massless scalar field on four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. Bringing two semi-infinite heat baths at different temperatures into thermal contact along a surface, the NESS arises at asymptotically late times as a stationary state that has modewise thermal properties and features a heat flow between the reservoirs. The detector couples linearly to the field by a monopole interaction, and it moves inertially along the axis of the NESS heat flow. We contrast the transition rate with the case of a detector that is coupled to an inertial thermal equilibrium state. The results illustrate that the monopole does not couple to the heat flow, causing the detector to only register kinematical effects. Hence dynamical features of the NESS are hidden from this detector model.</p>

Building on the two-potential formalism of Cabibbo and Ferrari, which treats electric and magnetic sources on equal footing and reveals a $U(1) \times U(1)$ gauge symmetry, we extend the theory into the quantum domain. Using the Gupta-Bleuler procedure in the Feynman-'t Hooft gauge, we construct the physical Hilbert space and eliminate negative-norm states. The resulting theory predicts, in addition to conventional photons, the existence of dual photons associated with magnetic charges. We discuss the role of these dual excitations and their possible relevance in the broader context of electromagnetic duality and gauge theories.</p>

QBlue is based on the formalism of second quantization, which provides a natural and expressive way to describe quantum particle systems using creation and annihilation operators. To ensure safety and correctness, QBlue includes a type system that tracks particle types and enforces Hermitian structure. The framework supports compilation to both digital and analog quantum circuits and captures multiple layers of semantics, from static constraints to dynamic evolution. All components of QBlue, including its language design, type system, and compilation correctness, are fully mechanized in the Rocq proof framework, making it the first end-to-end verified compiler for second-quantized Hamiltonian simulation.</p>

            <h2>Computational Relative Entropy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Johannes Jakob Meyer, Asad Raza, Jacopo Rizzo, Lorenzo Leone, Sofiene Jerbi, Jens Eisert</p>
            <p>Our capacity to process information depends on the computational power at our disposal. Information theory captures our ability to distinguish states or communicate messages when it is unconstrained with unrivaled elegance. For computationally bounded observers the situation is quite different. They can, for example, be fooled to believe that distributions are more random than they actually are. In our work, we go beyond the prevailing single-shot approach and take a new direction in computational quantum information theory that captures the essence of complexity-constrained information theory while retaining the look and feel of the unbounded asymptotic theory. As our foundational quantity, we define the computational relative entropy as the optimal error exponent in asymmetric hypothesis testing when restricted to polynomially many copies and quantum gates, defined in a mathematically rigorous way. Building on this foundation, we prove a computational analogue of Stein's lemma, establish computational versions of fundamental inequalities like Pinsker's bound, and demonstrate a computational smoothing property showing that computationally indistinguishable states yield equivalent information measures. We derive a computational entropy that operationally characterizes optimal compression rates for quantum states under computational limitations and show that our quantities apply to computational entanglement theory, proving a computational version of the Rains bound. Our framework reveals striking separations between computational and unbounded information measures, including quantum-classical gaps that arise from cryptographic assumptions, demonstrating that computational constraints fundamentally alter the information-theoretic landscape and open new research directions at the intersection of quantum information, complexity theory, and cryptography.</p>

            <p>Amplification is an essential part of quantum processing and detection that allows for reducing subsequent loss and noise. However, the intensive amplification transfers individual discrete quanta to a detected continuous signal, so Fock probabilities of the unknown input state are not readily available. To solve this issue, we directly derive and analyze a quantum non-Gaussianity witness based on the photon number mean and variance (or alternatively, the second-order correlation $g^{(2)}$) of the unknown state, which can be inferred from post-amplification integrated intensity moments. Since this new witness is based on first and second moments only, measurement results are easy to correct for losses and additive noise.</p>

            <h2>Excited-CAFQA: A classical simulation bootstrap for the variational estimation of molecular excited states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bikrant Bhattacharyya, Gokul Ravi</p>
            <p>Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are iterative algorithms suited to implementation on current-era quantum devices. VQAs employ classical optimization to minimize cost functions evaluated on quantum circuits. However, the extent to which VQAs manage noise is often insufficient for quantum chemistry applications. One method of improving VQAs is through accurate ansatz initialization. The CAFQA (Clifford Ansatz For Quantum Accuracy) protocol runs a discrete search through a classically simulatable subset of the entire state space to find a desirable initialization. Prior work has evaluated CAFQA applied to the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), a VQA that computes grounds states of a Hamiltonian. Motivated by CAFQA's success, we propose Excited-CAFQA initialization for Variational Quantum Deflation (VQD), a quantum algorithm that extends VQE by allowing the computation of excited states. VQD recursively computes excited states, by constraining the kth state to be orthogonal to the previous k-1 computed energy states via a penalty term appended to the standard VQE cost function. Just as with VQE, the VQD cost function can be efficiently computed classically for the states considered in the discrete CAFQA search, allowing for the discrete CAFQA optimizer to find good initial parameters for each energy level computation. Preliminary evaluation shows that Excited-CAFQA achieves 90 to 99+% accuracy across a variety of bond lengths and excited states for H2 and HeH+ molecular systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saurav Suman, Bikash K. Behera, Vivek Vyas, Prasanta k. Panigrahi</p>
            <p>Anharmonic potential quantum system play crucial role in physics as they provide a more realistic description of oscillatory phenomena, which often deviate from the idealized harmonic model. However, simulating such system on classical computers is highly challenging due to nonlinear interactions, large state spaces, and the exponential scaling of memory and computational resources. In this work, quantum simulation is employed to model a quantum anharmonic oscillator (QAHO) using a 3-qubit system implemented on IBM's Quantum Experiences platform. A quantum circuit with a filter-based design and Toffoli gates is constructed to track quantum state evolution, capturing key phenomena like quantum revival. The framework is further extended to n-qubit system to enhance resolution and scalability. For energy estimation, the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) with a TwoLocal ansatz and variational Quantum Deflation (VQD), are used to compute ground and excited state energies. The proposed approach achieves high accuracy with an error of only 1.11% compared to exact methods. Notably, VQE outperforms classical approximations such as perturbation theory (error 6.71%) and the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation(error 5.36%), yielding more precise energy values. These results highlight the potential of quantum simulation and VQD as effective tools for investigating complex quantum system, paving the way for future application in quantum chemistry and materials science as quantum hardware continues to advance.</p>

            <h2>Coherent control of photonic spin Hall effect in a Cavity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muzamil Shah, Shahid Qamar, Muhammad Waseem</p>
            <p>This paper theoretically investigates the manipulation of the Photonic Spin Hall Effect (photonic SHE) using a four-level closed coherent control coupling scheme in a cavity. The atomic system is configured to function as a combined Tripod and Lambda (CTL), Lambda $\Lambda$, and $N$ level model by properly adjusting the control field strengths and their relative phases. The system demonstrates multiple transparency windows in the CTL configuration, allowing the tunable photonic SHE to be used over a wider range of probe field detuning. At probe field resonance under the condition of electromagnetic induced transparency (EIT), the $\Lambda$-type system exhibits photonic SHE similar to the CTL system, showing a maximum upper limit of photonic SHE equal to half of the incident beam waist. This upper limit arises due to zero absorption and dispersion. Control field strengths and atomic density do not influence photonic SHE at resonance for both atomic configurations. Our findings reveal that atomic density and strength of control fields significantly influence photonic SHE in the $N$-type model at resonance, offering additional control parameters for tuning photonic SHE. Finally, the results are equally valid and applicable to conventional $\Lambda$-type and N-type atomic systems, making the findings broadly relevant in cavity atomic systems. The results of angular photonic SHE are also discussed.</p>

We focus on a one-dimensional lattice of nonlinear bosons described by a Lindblad master equation, where the interplay between coherent and incoherent dynamics generates nonreciprocal interactions between sites. Using a mean-field approach, we analyze the phase diagram under both periodic and open boundary conditions. For periodic boundaries, the system always forms a condensate at nonzero momentum and frequency, resulting in a time-dependent traveling wave pattern. In contrast, open boundaries reveal a far richer phase diagram, featuring multiple static and dynamical phases, as well as exotic phase transitions, including the spontaneous breaking of particle-hole symmetry associated with a critical exceptional point and phases with distinct bulk and edge behavior. Our model does not require post-selection and is experimentally realizable in platforms such as superconducting circuits.</p>

More precisely, this difference in output is due to the types of measurements involved and the way in which the data is processed, as both setups are identical, clearly identical states are produced. Here we take a hybrid approach to describe the state, which is generated by parametric down-conversion as input state, and investigate the measurements of the output ports of the interferometer using photon number resolved detection. We show that the output of this interference is separable in the photon number picture and demonstrate the worth of photon-number correlation measures for the characterization of squeezed light sources for hybrid applications like Gaussian boson-sampling.</p>

The strong atom-cavity interaction can also be used to implement the atom-photon controlled-phase gate, which can then be used to construct photon-photon gates, create photonic cluster states, and perform non-demolition detection of single photons.

            <p>Recent developments in quantum light engineering have enabled the use of infrared bright squeezed vacuum (BSV) femtosecond pulses in highly nonlinear optics, particularly strong-field physics and high-harmonic generation. However, theoretical studies were focused on interactions with single-atoms only, neglecting that under realistic conditions light propagates through the media. This raises two key questions: How does BSV propagates in strongly light-driven nonlinear media, and under what conditions it can generate observable nonlinear signals? We address these questions by introducing a fully quantized framework that accounts for the propagation in gas media using high-harmonic generation as a nonlinear observable. We found that the infrared photon losses, atomic ground-state depletion and atomic ionization, induce decoherence effects which significantly limit the propagation length in the medium, and reduce the harmonic yield by more than two orders of magnitude compared to that produced by coherent laser light. Nevertheless, we establish the conditions under which BSV generated harmonics can be detected. Our results lay the foundation for future studies of BSV in strong-field physics, nonlinear optics, and ultrafast science, and establish a basis for exploring its propagation in all states of matter.</p>

            <p>Quantum transduction between microwave and optical photons is essential for building scalable quantum networks, with electro-optics conversion emerging as a promising approach. Recent experiments, however, observe significant quality factor degradation in superconducting microwave cavities when realizing the electro optics transducers. Here, we identify the piezomechanical scattering, where microwave photon loss through phonon radiation into substrate, as a universal dissipation mechanism in these hybrid quantum devices. By establishing a direct analogy to Rayleigh scattering theory, we derive universal scaling laws governing phononic dissipation process. Our analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off that optimizing coherent transduction coupling inevitably increases dissipation, regardless of the configurations of microwave and optical cavities. We propose potential strategies to overcome this challenge. These findings establish piezomechanical scattering as a critical design constraint for quantum transducers and provide insights to optimize their performances toward practical quantum networking.</p>

We use two ensembles of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers separated by 3.6 mm to measure a magnetic field. A different bias field is applied to the two NV ensembles to resolve the resonance peak for each ensemble in the frequency space and enables the multiplexed magnetometry at the two points. The sensitivities achieved at the measurement points are $21~\mathrm{pT/\sqrt{Hz}}$ and $22~\mathrm{pT/\sqrt{Hz}}$. The proposed magnetometry method can be expanded to include more measurement points and shorter spacing. The capability of real-time measurement at numerous points with short spacing and high sensitivity is beneficial for various applications, including biomagnetic sensing, geophysical research, and material science.</p>

            <h2>Vacuum birefringence in the polarized X-ray emission of a radio magnetar</h2>

            <p>The quantum electrodynamics (QED) theory predicts that the quantum vacuum becomes birefringent in the presence of ultra-strong magnetic fields -- a fundamental effect yet to be directly observed. Magnetars, isolated neutron stars with surface fields exceeding $10^{14}$~G, provide unique astrophysical laboratories to probe this elusive prediction. Here, we report phase- and energy-resolved X-ray polarization measurements of the radio-emitting magnetar 1E 1547.0-5408 obtained with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE), in coordination with the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) and Parkes/Murriyang radio observations. We detect a high phase-averaged polarization degree of 65% at 2 keV, where the surface thermal emission is dominant, rising to nearly 80% at certain rotational phases, and remaining at $\gtrsim40\%$ throughout the radio beam crossing. We also observe a strong decrease in polarization from 2~keV to 4~keV. Detailed atmospheric radiative transfer modeling, coupled with geometrical constraints from radio polarization, demonstrate that the observed polarization behavior cannot be consistently explained without invoking magnetospheric vacuum birefringence (VB) influences. These observational findings combined with the theoretical results represent compelling evidence for naturally occurring quantum VB. This work marks a significant advance toward confirming this hallmark prediction of QED and lays the foundation for future tests of strong-field quantum physics using next-generation X-ray polarimeters.</p>

            <p>Many quantum networking applications require efficient photonic interfaces to quantum memories which can be produced at scale and with high yield. Synthetic diamond offers unique potential for the implementation of this technology as it hosts color centers which retain coherent optical interfaces and long spin coherence times in nanophotonic structures. Here, we report a technique enabling wafer-scale processing of thin-film diamond that combines ion implantation and membrane liftoff, high-quality overgrowth, targeted color center implantation, and serial, high-throughput thermocompression bonding with yields approaching unity. The deterministic deposition of thin diamond membranes onto semiconductor substrates facilitates consistent integration of photonic crystal cavities with silicon-vacancy (SiV) quantum memories. We demonstrate reliable, strong coupling of SiVs to photons with cooperativities approaching 100. Furthermore, we show that photonic crystal cavities can be reliably fabricated across several membranes bonded to the same handling chip. Our platform enables modular fabrication where the photonic layer can be integrated with functionalized substrates featuring electronic control lines such as coplanar waveguides for microwave delivery. Finally, we implement passive optical packaging with sub-decibel insertion loss. Together, these advances pave the way to the scalable assembly of optically addressable quantum memory arrays which are a key building block for modular photonic quantum interconnects.</p>

Our package rests on the evaluation of Feynman amplitudes in the momentum-helicity basis within a relativistic framework. Users can specify both pure and mixed initial scattering states in polarization space. From the specified initial state and Feynman amplitudes, QEDtool reconstructs correlations that fully characterize the quantum polarization and entanglement within the final state. These quantities can be expressed in any inertial frame by arbitrary, built-in Lorentz transformations.</p>

            <h2>Generalized Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill States on a Quantum Torus</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sijo K. Joseph, Sudhir Singh</p>
            <p>We introduce a novel formulation of a Generalized Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) state that resolves all of its foundational pathologies, such as infinite energy, non-normalizability, and or- thogonality. We demonstrate that these issues are artifacts of defining the code on an unbounded phase-space. By considering the compact quantum-phase-space intrinsic to systems like coupled quantum harmonic oscillators, we have obtained a Generalized GKP (GGKP) state that is both exact and physically realizable. This is achieved by applying an obtained Quantum Zak Transform (QZT) to Squeezed Coherent States, which reveals that Riemann-Theta functions are the natural representation of these states on the quantum torus phase-space. This framework not only provides a well-behaved quantum state, but also reveals a deep connection between quantum error correc- tion, non-commutative geometry, and the theory of generalized Theta functions. This opens a new avenue for fault-tolerant photonic quantum computing.</p>

            <h2>Structure-Fair Quantum Circuit Complexity: An Information-Theoretic Lower Bound</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> HongZheng Liu, YiNuo Tian, Zhiyue Wu</p>
            <p>Fairly quantifying the complexity of quantum states that possess intrinsic structures (such as symmetries or encodings) is a fundamental challenge for benchmarking quantum technologies. We introduce the "Reference-Contingent Complexity" (RCC). Its core idea is to utilize the quantum relative entropy to measure the extent to which a state deviates from its "structured vacuum" (the maximum entropy state within its constrained subspace), thereby only pricing the generation of non-trivial information. We establish a central theorem, establishing that the RCC is a rigorous information-theoretic lower bound on universal quantum circuit complexity, a bound that features a linear leading term, a universal logarithmic correction, and a precise physical correction for the non-uniformity of the spectral distribution. Furthermore, we establish an operational protocol based on quantum hypothesis testing, which connects this theoretical lower bound to experimentally accessible observables. This work provides a structurally-fair yardstick for quantum technologies and offers a new perspective for exploring the intrinsic connection between computational cost and the generation of non-trivial information.</p>

            <h2>Joint momenta-coordinates states as pointer states in quantum decoherence</h2>

            <p>Quantum decoherence provides a framework to study the emergence of classicality from quantum system by showing how interactions with the environments suppress interferences and select robust states known as pointer states. Earlier studies have linked Gaussian coherent states with pointer states. More recently, it was conjectured that more general quantum states called joint momenta-coordinates states could also be considered as more suitable candidates to be pointer states. These states are associated to the concept of quantum phase space and saturate, by definition, generalized uncertainty relations. In this work, we rigorously prove this conjecture. Building on the Lindblad framework for the damped harmonic oscillator and applying Zurek's predictability-sieve criterion, we analyze both underdamped and overdamped regimes. We show that only in the underdamped case do joint momenta-coordinates states remain pure and robust for all times, establishing them as the true pointer states. This extends Isar's earlier underdamped treatment, generalizes the concept beyond Gaussian approximations, and embeds classical robustness in the quantum phase space formalism, with potential applications in error-resilient quantum information.</p>

            <p>Programmable quantum devices provide a platform to control the coherent dynamics of quantum wavefunctions. Here we experimentally realize adaptive monitored quantum circuits, which incorporate conditional feedback into non-unitary evolution, to control quantum chaotic dynamics using a combination of local mid-circuit measurements and resets. The experiments are performed with an IBM superconducting quantum processor using up to 100 qubits that samples a quantum version of the classically chaotic Bernoulli map. This map scrambles quantum information, while local measurements and feedback attempt to steer the dynamics toward a state that is a fixed point of the map. This competition drives a dynamical phase transition between quantum and classical dynamics that we observe experimentally and describe theoretically using noisy simulations, matrix product states, and mappings to statistical mechanics models. Estimates of the universal critical properties are obtained to high accuracy on the quantum computer thanks to the large number of qubits utilized in the calculation. By successfully applying up to nearly 5000 entangling gates and 5000 non-unitary mid-circuit operations on systems up to 100 qubits, this experiment serves as a signpost on the route towards fault tolerance.</p>

            <p>Accurately predicting protein structures from amino acid sequences remains a fundamental challenge in computational biology, with profound implications for understanding biological functions and enabling structure-based drug discovery. Quantum computing approaches based on coarse-grained lattice models combined with variational algorithms have been proposed as an initial step towards predicting protein structures using quantum computers. In this work, we introduce a more efficient quantum protein structure prediction workflow that bypasses the need for explicit Hamiltonian construction by employing a problem-agnostic ansatz. The ansatz is trained to minimize an energy-based cost function that can be efficiently computed on classical computers, eliminating the need for ancillary qubits and reducing circuit depth compared to previous Hamiltonian-based methods. This enables a more scalable approach for larger proteins and facilitates the inclusion of higher-order interactions, previously hard to achieve in quantum approaches. We validate our method by benchmarking a hardware-efficient ansatz on a large set of proteins with up to 26 amino acids, modeled on the tetrahedral, body-centered cubic, and face-centered cubic lattices, incorporating up to second-nearest-neighbor interactions. We assess the performance on both a noise-free simulator and the ibm_kingston quantum computer using a set of distinct metrics to probe different aspects of the prediction quality. These experiments push the boundaries of quantum methods for protein structure prediction, targeting sequences that are longer than those typically addressed in prior studies. Overall, the results highlight the scalability and versatility of our approach, while also identifying key areas for improvement to inform future algorithm development and hardware advancements.</p>

            <h2>Chiral Color Code : Single-shot error correction for exotic topological order</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dongjin Lee, Beni Yoshida</p>
            <p>We present a family of simple three-dimensional stabilizer codes, called the chiral color codes, that realize fermionic and chiral topological orders. In the qubit case, the code realizes the topological phase of a single copy of the fermionic toric code. For qudit systems with local dimension $d$, the model features a chiral parameter $\alpha$ and realizes 3D topological phases characterized by $\mathbb{Z}_d^{(\alpha)}$ anyon theories with anomalous chiral surface topological order. On closed manifolds, the code has a unique ground state after removing bulk transparent fermions or bosons. Furthermore, we prove that the bulk is short-range entangled (for odd $d$, coprime $\alpha$) by constructing an explicit local quantum channel that prepares the ground state. The chiral color codes are constructed within the gauge color code, and hence inherit its fault-tolerant features: they admit single-shot error correction and allow code switching to other stabilizer color codes. These properties position the chiral color codes as particularly useful platforms for realizing and manipulating fermions and chiral anyons.</p>

            <h2>Optimal scheme for distributed quantum metrology</h2>

            <p>Optimal strategies for local quantum metrology -- including the preparation of optimal probe states, implementation of optimal control and measurement strategies, are well established. However, for distributed quantum metrology, where the goal is to estimate global properties of multiple spatially distributed parameters, the optimal scheme -- particularly the role of optimal control -- remains poorly understood. In this work, we address this challenge by developing optimal schemes for distributed quantum metrology that characterize the ultimate precision limits in distributed systems. We derive the optimal probe state, optimal control protocols, and measurement strategies in estimating a linear combination of $N$ independent unknown parameters coupled to $d$ networked sensors. Crucially, we prove that the optimal control operations can be implemented locally on each sensor, eliminating the need for non-local control operations across distant nodes. This result significantly reduces the complexity of implementing optimal strategies in distributed quantum metrology. To demonstrate the power of our framework, we apply it to several key scenarios.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> F. Q. Guo, Shi-Lei Su, Weibin Li, X. Q. Shao</p>
            <p>We propose a dissipative protocol for preparing nonequilibrium steady-state entanglement in neutral atom arrays within a Floquet-Lindblad framework. Stabilizer pumping is implemented through noninstantaneous kicks, where each period consists of a short resonant laser pulse followed by a detuned strong $\pi$ pulse that couples the atomic ground state to a Rydberg state. This scheme is intrinsically fast and robust against the Doppler shifts and interatomic spatial fluctuations, as adiabatic requirements on the laser field are avoided. As such the engineered dissipation channels induce a fast decay rate, dramatically accelerating convergence toward the desired steady states. We show that this approach is inherently scalable and enables high-fidelity preparation of arbitrary multipartite graph states in the neutral atom array at zero and finite temperatures. Our study not only facilitates the preparation of resource states for measurement-based quantum computation but also provides a passive error-correction mechanism in the undergoing computation.</p>

            <p>Entanglement generation lies at the heart of many quantum networking protocols as it enables distributed and modular quantum computing. For superconducting qubits, entanglement fidelity is typically limited by photon loss in the links that connect these qubits together. We propose and realize a new scheme for heralded entanglement generation that almost entirely circumvents this limit. We produce Bell states with $92\pm1\%$ state fidelity, including state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors, between separated superconducting bosonic qubits in a high-loss regime where direct deterministic state transfer fails. Our scheme exploits simple but fundamental physics found in microwave links, specifically the ability to treat our communication channel as a single standing wave mode. Combining this with local measurements on bosonically encoded qubits allows us to herald entanglement with success probabilities approaching the scheme's upper limit of 50% per attempt. We then use the heralded Bell state as a resource to deterministically teleport a qubit between modules with an average state transfer fidelity of $90\pm1\%$. This is achieved despite the link possessing a direct single photon transfer efficiency of 2%. Our work informs the design of future superconducting quantum networks, by demonstrating fast coupling rates and low loss links are no longer strict requirements for high-fidelity quantum communication in the microwave regime.</p>

Although both technologies have made significant advancements, the integration of microwave-optical conversion and quantum memory functionalities remains a challenge. Here, we theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate a memoryenhanced quantum microwave-optical transduction using a Rydberg ensemble. By utilizing a cascaded electromagnetically induced transparency process, we store microwave photons in a highly excited collective state and subsequently convert them into optical photons during the retrieval process. Taking advantage of the optical depth with order of millions for microwave photons in Rydberg ensemble, combined with a minimal storage dephasing rate at the single-photon level, the transducer achieves an areanormalized storage efficiency greater than 90%, a bandwidth of 2.1 MHz, and a noise equivalent temperature as low as 26 K, even in cavity-free conditions.

We analyze the interaction volume of optical whispering gallery and magnon Kittel modes inside yttrium iron garnet disk and ring microcavities of various sizes and found a significant improvement in modes coupling up to $\sim4.5~kHz$ . Maximal theoretical conversion efficiency for small disks with radius $5~\mu m$ can reach unity for optimal optical power $\sim100~\mu W$, which is experimentally feasible.

Here, we address this question in the context of polaritonic spectra, and report an intriguing new feature: the twin-polariton, an additional splitting beyond the primary resonant polariton splitting, originating from vacuum field fluctuations. We show that the twin-polariton persists in the many-molecule limit under permutationally symmetrical initial-state constraint and that it follows the same linear dependence on coupling strength as the primary polariton splitting. This establishes a novel mechanism by which a quantum feature (the twin-polariton) can be tuned through a classical one (the primary polariton), offering new opportunities to probe and control the fundamental nature of polaritonic systems.</p>

            <p>Quantum entanglement and quantum magic are two distinct fundamental resources that enable quantum systems to exhibit complex phenomena beyond the capabilities of classical computer simulations. While quantum entanglement has been extensively used to characterize both equilibrium and dynamical phases, the study of quantum magic, typically quantified by the stabilizer R√©nyi entropy (SRE), remains largely limited to numerical simulations of moderate system sizes. In this Letter, we establish a general framework for analyzing the SRE in solvable Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models in the large-$N$ limit, which enables the application of the saddle-point approximation. Applying this method to the Maldacena-Qi coupled SYK model, we identify a series of first-order transitions of the SRE as the temperature is tuned. In particular, we uncover an intrinsic transition of the SRE that cannot be detected through thermodynamic quantities. We also discuss the theoretical understanding of the SRE in both the high-temperature and low-temperature limits. Our results pave the way for studying the SRE in strongly correlated fermionic systems in the thermodynamic limit and suggest a new class of transitions for which the SRE serves as an order parameter.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Karan Kendre</p>
            <p>Quantum noise fundamentally limits the utility of near-term quantum devices, making error mitigation essential for practical quantum computation. While traditional quantum error correction codes require substantial qubit overhead and complex syndrome decoding, we propose a machine learning approach that directly reconstructs clean quantum states from noisy density matrices without additional qubits. We formulate quantum noise reduction as a supervised learning problem using a convolutional neural network (CNN) autoencoder architecture with a novel fidelity-aware composite loss function. Our method is trained and evaluated on a comprehensive synthetic dataset of 10,000 density matrices derived from random 5-qubit quantum circuits, encompassing five noise types (depolarizing, amplitude damping, phase damping, bit-flip, and mixed noise) across four intensity levels (0.05-0.20). The CNN successfully reconstructs quantum states across all noise conditions, achieving an average fidelity improvement from 0.298 to 0.774 ({\Delta} = 0.476). Notably, the model demonstrates superior performance on complex mixed noise scenarios and higher noise intensities, with mixed noise showing the highest corrected fidelity (0.807) and improvement (0.567). The approach effectively preserves both diagonal elements (populations) and off-diagonal elements (quantum coherences), making it suitable for entanglement-dependent quantum algorithms. While phase damping presents fundamental information-theoretic limitations, our results suggest that CNN-based density matrix reconstruction offers a promising, resource-efficient alternative to traditional quantum error correction for NISQ-era devices. This data-driven approach could enable practical quantum advantage with fewer physical qubits than conventional error correction schemes require.</p>

            <p>We introduce and conduct a theoretical analysis of a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric double-cavity molecular optomechanical (McOM) system, presenting a framework for generating multipartite quantum entanglement that is both robust and highly adjustable. The system leverages a sophisticated synergy of collective molecular enhancement, nonreciprocal directional coupling, and engineered $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric dissipation. A central finding is the exceptional thermal resilience of this entanglement, which persists robustly at and well above room temperature, with a practical operational ceiling limited by material stability around \SI{700}{\kelvin}. This remarkable resilience, driven by ultra-high-frequency molecular vibrations and collective $\sqrt{N}$ enhancement, positions our system as a leading candidate for developing robust, high-temperature quantum technologies. Notably, our work directly addresses the performance trade-offs inherent in nonlinear enhancement schemes. By employing a two-collective-mode model to explicitly investigate vibration-vibration correlations, our $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric architecture achieves a balanced and powerful enhancement across all investigated bipartite entanglement channels: inter-cavity ($E_{ac}$), cavity-molecule ($E_{aB_1}$, $E_{cB_2}$), and critically, vibration-vibration ($E_{B_1B_2}$).

            <h2>Quantum phase transition in two dimension nonlinear cavity optomagnonic system</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu Sang, Jie Liu, Lei Tan</p>
            <p>The superfluid-Mott insulator and ergodic-many body localization transitions based on a two dimension nonlinear cavity optomagnonic system are investigated, where a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere is embedded at each site of a two-dimensional coupled cavity array. It can be demonstrated that, the introduction of phonon-photon coupling enhances the coherence of the system when considering the Kerr nonlinearity of the YIG sphere. In contrast, the Kerr nonlinearity of photons is more conducive to the Mott insulating phase than that of the YIG sphere. We further elucidate the underlying physical mechanism by calculating the effective repulsive potential of the system in the presence of photonic Kerr nonlinearity. Regarding the ergodic-many body localization transition, the results indicate that as the disorder strength of the Kerr nonlinearity increases, the system transitions from the ergodic phase to the many body localized phase, while increasing the chemical potential expands the region of the ergodic phase. This work provides a novel framework for characterizing quantum phase transitions in cavity optomagnonic systems and offers an experimentally feasible scheme for studying them, thereby yielding valuable insights for quantum simulation.</p>

            <h2>Universal two-excitation scattering in two-dimensional subwavelength atomic arrays</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yidan Wang, Oriol Rubies-Bigorda, Valentin Walther, Susanne F. Yelin</p>
            <p>Subwavelength atomic arrays are a leading platform for engineering strong light-matter interactions, presenting exciting opportunities for quantum science. However, a full understanding of their multi-excitation dynamics remains a significant challenge. In this work, we uncover a remarkable universal phenomenon that emerges in these arrays. Using scattering theory to analyze two-excitation interactions, we reveal a profound simplification near critical points of the collective atomic excitation band structure, determined solely from single-excitation properties. At these critical points, scattering becomes universal and the full two-excitation scattering matrix decomposes into a block-diagonal form. Remarkably, all scattering processes involving the photon field are completely suppressed, resulting in the perfect isolation of a unitary, nonlinear interaction channel between collective dark spin waves. Our findings provide exact analytical insights into few-body nonlinearities and establish a universal framework for analyzing complex scattering phenomena in ordered atomic systems.</p>

            <p>Subwavelength atomic arrays are a leading platform for engineering light-matter interactions, enabling near-perfect single-photon mirrors and robust quantum memories based on long-lived dark spin waves. However, a comprehensive theory of their nonlinear, multi-excitation dynamics has remained a significant challenge. We present a unified quantum scattering theory that treats both photons and collective atomic spin waves as distinct propagating excitations interacting across different spatial dimensions. Our central result is a powerful analytical reduction: we demonstrate that the complete multi-channel S-matrix and the associated scattering cross sections are exactly determined by the effective scattering dynamics solely within the atomic spin wave subspace. This maps the complex physical problem of photon-atom interactions to a conceptually simpler one involving only atomic modes. We apply this formalism to the two-excitation case, deriving the complete analytical S-matrix and scattering cross sections for systems with two-level nonlinearities. Our work provides a versatile analytic tool for analyzing and engineering complex quantum nonlinear phenomena, including multi-excitation subradiance, in large-scale atomic systems.</p>

            <p>We analyze quantum coherence generated by non-interacting magnons in a ferromagnetic spin chain described by the isotropic Heisenberg model. The exact expression derived for the reduced density operator of an arbitrary subsystem reveals that single-site coherence vanishes, while maximal coherence arises in a pure single-mode magnon state. Remarkably, this maximum depends solely on the number of coherently superposed microstates. Based on this property, we introduce coherence-based definitions of entropy, temperature, and heat capacity, establishing a formal analogy with standard thermodynamic quantities.</p>

            <p>Coherent wavepacket expansion is a key component of recent proposals aiming to create non-classical states of a levitated dielectric nanoparticle. Free evolution, i.e., releasing the particle from its harmonic trapping potential and allowing its position variance to grow, is a simple but effective expansion scheme, but requires accurate force compensation to avoid significant mean displacements of the wavepacket during the free evolution. Here, using an optical trap-release-recapture sequence, we demonstrate an electrostatic compensation technique that enables free evolution without significant mean displacement in 3D, successfully compensating both gravity and stray electric fields. To achieve 100 microsecond free evolution times with charged particles, we developed methods to map and correct for force cross-talk, as well as to control the environmental charge state. Combined with a low decoherence environment, our approach enables the preparation of largely delocalized states without the need for long freefall trajectories or a low-gravity environment.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhenyu Du, Jinchang Liu, Elias X. Huber, Zi-Wen Liu, Xiongfeng Ma</p>
            <p>Characterizing increasingly complex quantum systems is a central task in quantum information science, yet experimental costs often scale prohibitively with system size. Certifying key properties -- such as entanglement, circuit complexity, and quantum magic -- using simple local measurements is highly desirable but challenging. In this work, we introduce a highly general certification framework based on a physical phenomenon that we call localizable quantumness: for generic many-body states, essential quantum properties are robustly preserved within the projected ensembles on small subsystems after performing local projective measurements on the rest of the system. Leveraging this insight, we develop certification protocols that certify global properties by witnessing them on a small, accessible subsystem. Our method dramatically reduces experimental cost by relying solely on local Pauli measurements, while achieving constant sample complexity, constant-level noise robustness, and soundness for mixed states -- exponentially improving the sample complexity and overcoming major limitations of previous methods. We further present a random-basis variant to certify state fidelity, with numerical evidence strongly suggesting it maintains constant sample complexity and robustness for generic states, representing a substantial improvement over existing methods. Our results provide a practical, scalable toolkit for certifying large-scale quantum processors and offer a novel lens for understanding complex many-body quantum systems.</p>

            <p>Dynamic stability is vital for the operation and control of molecular nanodevices, particularly molecular cogwheels in an external harmonic field. We used the relative change in rotator entropy as a measure of dynamical stability. This rotator dynamic is described by the Caldeira-Leggett quantum master equation: the main challenge is the absence of a general solution for this equation. As an alternative, we look for the initial states (pure or mixed) of the rotator that result in low entropy change. In order to create candidate initial states, we use an ansatz that align with the maximum entropy principle. We then find conditions for state preparation and system/bath parameters to achieve a small relative change in both linear and differential entropy in underdamped and non-underdamped regimes. We identify cases with relatively small entropy change and discuss their practical feasibility.</p>

            <h2>Transfer of entanglement from nonlocal photon to non-Gaussian CV states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mikhail S. Podoshvedov, Sergey A. Podoshvedov</p>
            <p>Continuous variable (CV) entanglement refers to the type of entanglement of quantum wave-like systems that are described by continuous variables in an inherently infinite-dimensional space. It can become a crucial resource for quantum communication, sensing and computation. We propose the mechanism of transfer of quantum entanglement (TQE) from a nonlocal photon to two initially separate single-mode squeezed vacuum (SMSV) states. The nonlocal photon is the only original quantum resource from which entanglement is transferred to CV states of a certain parity without them directly interacting with each other in a deterministic manner. Measurement induced CV parity entanglement is tuned using initial squeezing and the beam splitter (BS) parameter allowing us to estimate the probability of transfer of maximum entanglement at sufficiently high brightness to be 0.2344 . If, instead of the original SMSV states, we use those from which one photon is initially subtracted, then the heralded technique can turn the probabilistic maximum entanglement transfer protocol into a nearly deterministic one, the probability of which is >0.98. Such a perfect TQE from the nonlocal photon to a maximally parity-entangled CV state can be considered the most suitable for applications, since it preserves the trade-off between the probability and brightness of the output non-Gaussian states.</p>

            <p>Quantum public-key encryption (PKE), where public-keys and/or ciphertexts can be quantum states, is an important primitive in quantum cryptography. Unlike classical PKE (e.g., RSA or ECC), quantum PKE can leverage quantum-secure cryptographic assumptions or the principles of quantum mechanics for security. It has great potential in providing for secure cryptographic systems under potentially weaker assumptions than is possible classically. In addition, it is of both practical and theoretical interest, opening the door to novel cryptographic systems not possible with classical information alone. While multiple quantum PKE schemes have been proposed, they require a large number of qubits acting coherently, and are not practical on current noisy quantum devices. In this paper, we design a practical quantum PKE scheme, taking into account the constraints of current NISQ devices. Specifically, we design a PKE scheme with quantum-classical public keys and classical ciphertexts, that is noise-resilient and only requires a small number of qubits acting coherently. In addition, our design provides tradeoffs in terms of efficiency and the number of qubits that are required.</p>

            <h2>Functional Information in Quantum Darwinism: An Operational Measure of Objectivity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arda Batin Tank</p>
            <p>This paper investigates the emergence of classical objectivity in quantum systems through the measure of Functional Information in Quantum Darwinism ($FI_{QD}$). The goal is to quantify objectivity as the abundance of environment fragments that independently contain sufficient information about a system's pointer states. The method relies on the Holevo quantity -- an upper bound on accessible information -- and introduces a tolerance criterion called $\delta$-adequacy, where fragments are considered adequate if they retain at least $(1-\delta)H_S$ bits of pointer information. Numerical simulations of a dephasing model with fragment sampling reveal three robust features: (i) an early-time regime where $\log R_\delta(t)$ grows approximately linearly, (ii) capacity-limited plateaus determined by fragment size and environment dimension, and (iii) stability of the onset criterion under different sampling strategies and overlap corrections. These results establish $FI_{QD}$ as a practical and conservative yardstick for operational objectivity. Beyond numerical findings, the analysis links redundancy growth to thermodynamic costs of record formation and interprets $FI_{QD}$ as a resource monotone under noisy dynamics. The study suggests that classical objectivity emerges not as an assumption but as a quantifiable, resource-limited abundance of redundant records.</p>

            <h2>Fast and Accurate Decoder for the XZZX code Using Simulated Annealing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tatsuya Sakashita (The University of Osaka)</p>
            <p>The XZZX code is a variant of the surface code designed to address biased noise in realistic quantum devices. For the XZZX code, we propose a decoder based on simulated annealing (SA). Our SA decoder can be readily and efficiently parallelized, by virtue of its simple MCMC-based algorithm. To prepare an initial configuration of SA, we propose to employ recovery chains obtained by a decoder which utilizes a kind of greedy matching graph algorithm. Although $Z$-biased noise is commonly assumed in real quantum devices, we focus on $Y$-biased noise, for which the minimum-weight perfect matching (MWPM) algorithm fails to decode accurately. Our numerical simulation for the code capacity noise model, where only data qubits suffer errors, confirmed that our SA decoder is more accurate than the MWPM decoder. Furthermore, our SA decoder attained the accuracy equivalent to that of the optimal decoder formulated by integer programming, called CPLEX decoder. In our greedy matching decoder, we randomly determine order of matching pairs of incorrect syndromes that have the same distance. This randomness brings about a variety of initial configurations of SA, which leads to faster convergence of our SA decoder. By comparing decoding times of our SA decoder, the CPLEX decoder, and matrix product state (MPS) decoder, all of which can handle $Y$-biased noise appropriately, we confirmed that our SA decoder is fastest if parallelized. This result implies a potential for combining of our greedy matching and SA decoder for practical use in quantum computing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eric Stopfer, Friedrich Wagner</p>
            <p>Recently, several researchers proposed portfolio optimization as a potential use case for quantum optimization. However, the literature is lacking an extensive benchmark quantifying the potential of quantum computers for portfolio optimization. In this work, we fill this gap. We provide a computational study, comparing quantum approaches against state-of-the-art classical methods on a meaningful, real-world instance set. In particular, we compare quantum annealing and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm against classical mixed-integer programming, simulated annealing, steepest descent local search, tabu search and a problem-tailored heuristics. We consider a variant of portfolio optimization which we show to be particular difficult for classical solvers in practice. Our benchmark comprises 250 instances with up to 1,000 assets from actual stock data. The results show that all instances can be solved to proven optimality by mixed-integer programming in the order of seconds. Moreover, the problem-tailored heuristic consistently outperforms quantum approaches in terms of solution quality for fixed runtime. Thus, we conclude that there is only very limited room for a potential quantum advantage in portfolio optimization.</p>

            <p>A rigorous characterization of the information content of any high-spin threefermion wave function is presented. It is based upon a formal decomposition of the wave function into a finite set of fixed invariants, called shapes, whose sole purpose is to satisfy the Pauli principle, and a variable part, constituting the bosonic excitations of these invariants, that provides its physical content. As an example, this decomposition is applied to a benchmark-quality approximate wave function of the lowest-energy quartet electronic state of the lithium atom. This wave function, which comprises hundreds of basis functions, is reduced to eleven shape blocks, only five of which are numerically significant. Such a compact characterization is a generic example of the appearance of superselection rules in configuration space, and provides a qualitative aid in the search for robust few-particle entangled states</p>

In this work, we theoretically investigate a system consisting of a series of superconducting qubits that alternate between XX and YY ultrastrong interactions. By considering the two-lowest energy eigenstates of this system as a {\it logical} qubit, we demonstrate that its coherence is significantly enhanced: both its pure dephasing and relaxation times are extended beyond those of individual {\it physical} qubits. Specifically, we show that by increasing either the interaction strength or the number of physical qubits in the chain, the logical qubit's pure dephasing rate is suppressed to zero, and its relaxation rate is reduced to half the relaxation rate of a single physical qubit. Single qubit and two-qubit gates can be performed with a high fidelity.</p>

Specifically, we consider particle states with both spin and momentum, apply a Lorentz transformation to obtain the states in a new inertial frame, and then trace out the momentum degrees of freedom in both frames. We find that spin states that are contextual in one frame can become non-contextual in the other. Hence, the Spekkens' notion of contextuality, when restricted to spin states only, is a frame-dependent concept. We apply our results to predict a novel relativistic effect concerning the task of discriminating between two quantum states. We show that the probability of success for a moving observer exceeds that of an observer at rest.</p>

In the case of transmon qubits and transmission line resonators, experimental predictions are very close to what is found with canonical quantization, though in this approach constant charge offsets can be interpreted as quantization ambiguities. In the case of LC circuits, polymer quantization predicts nonlinearities which are not present in the canonical approach. Based on this analysis we design and analyze a qubit which uses a meander inductor instead of a Josephson junction. Implications for qubit performance and fabrication are discussed. Given a choice for an effective phase operator, relevant parameters such as anharmonicity, frequency, and dispersive shifts are calculated for this meander inductor based qubit.</p>

            <p>This work investigates the nature of the ground state of the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on minimal kagome cells -- a triangle and a star -- using the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm on real quantum hardware. We demonstrate that the ground state preparation is achievable using a shallow hardware-efficient quantum circuit with a naturally Euclidean parameter space. Our custom ansatz is capable of accurately recovering essential properties such as the spin correlation terms for each edge without explicit error mitigation. These features are found to be less sensitive to noise. We exploited the Fubini-Study metric in constructing the ansatz, ensuring a singularity-free parameter space. With this ansatz design, the quantum natural gradient coincides with the normal gradient, complemented with a backtracking search for dynamic step size adaptation. We refer to this regime as the implicit adaptive quantum natural gradient descent. It achieves faster convergence in fewer iterations compared to simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA), while maintaining competitive runtime with the metric being analytically constant. We further apply error mitigation techniques, including zero noise extrapolation (ZNE) and qubit-wise readout error mitigation (REM). While ZNE does not obey the Rayleigh-Ritz variational principle, the conditions under which REM preserves it are discussed.</p>

            <p>At the heart of building a large-scale quantum internet lies the challenge of establishing long-distance entanglement using quantum repeaters, which mitigate direct transmission losses but introduce additional noise in the nodes via interactions with the environment and imperfect operations. This effect has typically been studied under a simplifying Pauli channel assumption. Our study focuses on distributing end-to-end entanglement in a homogeneous, repeater-based linear quantum network operating under a non-Pauli noise, specifically, amplitude damping noise, which we refer to as amplitude damping-affected quantum network (AQN). Unlike its twirled counterpart (TAQN), where the resulting state is fully Bell-diagonal with a single parameter, we prove that the AQN produces a block-diagonal state in the Bell basis with four parameters. We develop a method for the simulation of AQN, where we keep track of these four parameters of each entangled link, along with the number of times noise acts on it, i.e., its age, until it is consumed for swapping. Our results reveal that across diverse policies, including NESTING and SWAP-ASAP, AQN consistently outperforms TAQN in terms of both fidelity and average entanglement. The benefit is most significant in the low-probability regime of elementary link generation, highly relevant for near-term experiments. Notably, we also identify the coherence-time and link-probability regions where TAQN fails while AQN succeeds in distributing end-to-end entanglement.</p>

Watanabe's Ugly Duckling Theorem highlights diversity, while algorithmic information theory emphasizes depth through Information Distance. We propose a statistical-mechanical framework that treats program length as energy, with a temperature parameter unifying these two aspects: in the low-temperature limit, similarity approaches Information Distance; in the high-temperature limit, it recovers the indiscriminability of the Ugly Duckling theorem; and at the critical point, it coincides with the Solomonoff prior. We refine the statistical-mechanical framework by introducing regular universal machines and effective degeneracy ratios, allowing us to separate redundant from core diversity. This refinement yields new tools for analyzing similarity and opens perspectives for information distance, model selection, and non-equilibrium extensions.</p>

In this paper we define the asymmetry for generalized finite symmetries, including higher-form and noninvertible ones. To this end, we introduce a "symmetrizer" of (reduced) density matrices with respect to the $C^*$-algebra of symmetry operators acting on the subsystem Hilbert space. We study in detail applications to (1+1)-dimensional theories: First, we analyze spontaneous symmetry breaking of noninvertible symmetries, confirming that distinct vacua can exhibit different physical properties. Second, we compute the asymmetry of certain excited states in conformal field theories (including the Ising CFT), when the subsystem is either the full circle or an interval therein. The relevant symmetry algebras to consider are the fusion, tube, and strip algebras. Finally, we comment on the case that the symmetry algebra is a (weak) Hopf algebra.</p>

            <p>We investigate the rate of change of the mean atomic energy for centripetally accelerated atoms interacting with electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations near a reflecting boundary, using the Dalibard-Dupont-Roc-Cohen-Tannoudji formalism. The distinct contributions from vacuum fluctuations and radiation reaction are analyzed separately. Our results reveal that, when the centripetal acceleration significantly exceeds the characteristic acceleration set by the atomic transition frequency, vacuum fluctuations dominates over radiation reaction, irrespective of the atom-boundary distance and the atomic polarization. In the near-zone regime, where the atom-boundary distance is much smaller than both the characteristic length associated with the acceleration and the transition wavelength of the atom, the boundary introduces substantial corrections to the rate of change of the mean atomic energy. These corrections are comparable in magnitude to those in free space and exhibit strong dependence on the atomic polarization. Remarkably, in the intermediate and far regions, contributions stemming from the combined effects of the boundary and acceleration can become the leading and subleading terms, respectively. An acceleration-independent term also arises from their interplay. These findings highlight the significant interplay between acceleration and the presence of a boundary in shaping atomic radiative properties and may have potential implications for experimentally probing the circular Unruh effect.</p>

            <p>Computational materials science has evolved toward materials informatics, where large datasets of complex, multispecies compounds are generated and evaluated using density functional theory (DFT). Materials genome projects mine these datasets for candidates with breakthrough properties, but existing databases remain limited to compounds with relatively small unit cells due to computational cost. Exascale computers now provide the power to simulate larger and more chemically realistic systems, but fully realizing this potential requires DFT codes that can efficiently scale to thousands of processors. Our real-space multigrid (RMG) DFT code's grid-decomposition approach scales nearly linearly with the number of GPUs, even for simulations exceeding thousands of atoms. This scalability makes RMG a compelling tool for high-throughput DFT studies of materials that would otherwise be bottlenecked in other codes (for example, by global Fast Fourier Transforms in plane-wave DFT). In this work, we present pyRMG, a Python package designed to streamline the setup and execution of RMG DFT calculations. Built on the pymatgen and ASE Python packages, pyRMG automates input generation and convergence checking, and integrates with modern job schedulers (e.g., Flux) on leadership-class platforms such as Frontier and Perlmutter. We demonstrate pyRMG for a high-throughput study of interfacial strain and twist-angle effects in lattice-matched, 2D Bi$_2$Se$_3$/NbSe$_2$ heterostructures, which form large, anisotropic supercells.

Our contributions include: * $k$-median and $k$-means clustering: For $n$ points in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space, we give an algorithm that constructs an $\epsilon$-coreset in time $\widetilde O(n^{0.5}dk^{2.5}~\mathrm{poly}(\epsilon^{-1}))$ for $k$-median and $k$-means clustering. Our approach achieves a better dependence on $d$ and constructs smaller coresets that only consist of points in the dataset, compared to recent results of [Xue, Chen, Li and Jiang, ICML'23]. * $\ell_p$ regression: For $\ell_p$ regression problems, we construct an $\epsilon$-coreset of size $\widetilde O_p(d^{\max\{1, p/2\}}\epsilon^{-2})$ in time $\widetilde O_p(n^{0.5}d^{\max\{0.5, p/4\}+1}(\epsilon^{-3}+d^{0.5}))$, improving upon the prior best quantum sampling approach of [Apers and Gribling, QIP'24] for all $p\in (0, 2)\cup (2, 22]$, including the widely studied least absolute deviation regression ($\ell_1$ regression). * Low-rank approximation with Frobenius norm error: We introduce the first quantum sublinear-time algorithm for low-rank approximation that does not rely on data-dependent parameters, and runs in $\widetilde O(nd^{0.5}k^{0.5}\epsilon^{-1})$ time. Additionally, we present quantum sublinear algorithms for kernel low-rank approximation and tensor low-rank approximation, broadening the range of achievable sublinear time algorithms in randomized numerical linear algebra.</p>

            <h2>On the Quantization of the Electromagnetic Field with Magnetic Monopoles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kanan Anwar</p>
            <p>We present a covariant framework for the quantization of the electromagnetic field in the presence of magnetic monopoles. Building on the two-potential formalism of Cabibbo and Ferrari, which treats electric and magnetic sources on equal footing and reveals a $U(1) \times U(1)$ gauge symmetry, we extend the theory into the quantum domain. Using the Gupta-Bleuler procedure in the Feynman-'t Hooft gauge, we construct the physical Hilbert space and eliminate negative-norm states. The resulting theory predicts, in addition to conventional photons, the existence of dual photons associated with magnetic charges. We discuss the role of these dual excitations and their possible relevance in the broader context of electromagnetic duality and gauge theories.</p>

            <h2>DiffQ: Unified Parameter Initialization for Variational Quantum Algorithms via Diffusion Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chi Zhang, Mengxin Zheng, Qian Lou, Fan Chen</p>
            <p>Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are widely used in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, but their trainability and performance depend critically on initialization parameters that shape the optimization landscape. Existing machine learning-based initializers achieve state-of-the-art results yet remain constrained to single-task domains and small datasets of only hundreds of samples. We address these limitations by reformulating VQA parameter initialization as a generative modeling problem and introducing DiffQ, a parameter initializer based on the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM). To support robust training and evaluation, we construct a dataset of 15,085 instances spanning three domains and five representative tasks. Experiments demonstrate that DiffQ surpasses baselines, reducing initial loss by up to 8.95 and convergence steps by up to 23.4%.</p>

            <p>High-accuracy calculations of electric dipole polarizabilities and quadrupole moments ($\Theta$) of the clock states of the singly charged calcium (Ca$^+$), strontium (Sr$^+$) and barium (Ba$^+$) alkaline-earth ions are estimated by employing relativistic coupled-cluster (RCC) theory. It demonstrates importance of the triple excitations in the RCC method for precise determination of the above quantities. We also observe a different trend of correlations in the $\Theta$ values than an earlier study with respect to orbitals from higher angular momenta. Reliability of the results is verified by comparing the calculated energies, magnetic dipole hyperfine structure constants, and lifetimes of the atomic states with the experimental values of the $^{43}$Ca$^+$, $^{87}$Sr$^+$ and $^{137}$Ba$^+$ ions. Nuclear quadrupole moments of these isotopes are also estimated by combining calculations with the measured electric quadrupole hyperfine structure constants, showing large deviations from the literature values.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tiziano Arnone Cardinale, Thomas Bland, Stephanie M. Reimann</p>
            <p>Ultracold polar molecules with microwave shielding provide a powerful platform for exploring quantum many-body physics with strong, anisotropic interactions. We develop an extended Gross-Pitaevskii framework for bosonic molecules under single microwave shielding, incorporating effective interactions and quantum fluctuations, and benchmark it against exact Quantum Monte Carlo simulations. In the regime of positive scattering lengths, our approach captures superfluid, supersolid, and droplet phases with excellent accuracy. We show that elliptic microwave polarization induces direction-dependent superfluidity - absent in cylindrically symmetric systems - enabling tunable anisotropy and potential applications in directional quantum sensing. A quasi-1D theory reveals that roton softening and instabilities can be controlled via ellipticity, consistent with recent experiments. Furthermore, we find that the nature of the superfluid-to-supersolid transition is strongly influenced by the ellipticity: the transition is sharp at low ellipticity and continuous at higher values. This tunability offers a potential route for low entropy preparation of molecular supersolids via adiabatic ramps. While double shielding is often used experimentally, our results demonstrate that single-shielded molecules already offer rich, controllable behavior, laying the groundwork for future studies with more complex shielding schemes.</p>

            <p>Understanding doped Mott insulators is a fundamental goal in condensed matter physics, with relevance to cuprate superconductors and other quantum materials. The doped Hubbard model minimally describes such systems, and has explicated some of their complex behavior. However, many open questions remain concerning the anomalous metallic states which emerge at low temperatures and intermediate doping and which, in cuprates, give rise to high-temperature superconductivity upon cooling. Here we observe a crossover between a normal metal and a pseudogapped metal in the Hubbard model by performing thermodynamic and spectroscopic measurements in a cold atom quantum simulator, leveraging a recent several-fold reduction in experimentally achievable temperatures. Measurements of the compressibility show a maximum versus doping that develops upon cooling, signaling an inflection point in the equation of state. We track this maximum versus interaction strength, revealing a line of thermodynamic anomalies in the phase diagram that separates an underdoped from an overdoped metal at large interactions. Lattice modulation spectroscopy shows a loss of spectral weight at low energies in the underdoped regime which is non-uniform in the Brillouin zone, indicating the formation of a pseudogap. We use this signal to establish a pseudogap phase diagram as a function of interactions and doping. Our results experimentally demonstrate the existence of a pseudogapped metal in the Hubbard model, partially characterize the pseudogap regime, and suggest a link between the pseudogap and charge order which can be probed in future work. Furthermore, this work demonstrates the utility of quantum simulation in addressing frontier problems in correlated electron physics.</p>

            <p>We ask what is the general framework for a quantum error correcting code that is defined by a sequence of measurements. Recently, there has been much interest in Floquet codes and space-time codes. In this work, we define and study the distance of a dynamical code. This is a subtle concept and difficult to determine: At any given time, the system will be in a subspace which forms a quantum error-correcting code with a given distance, but the full error correction capability of that code may not be available due to the schedule of measurements associated with the code. We address this challenge by developing an algorithm that tracks information we have learned about the error syndromes through the protocol and put that together to determine the distance of a dynamical code, in a non-fault-tolerant context. We use the tools developed for the algorithm to analyze the initialization and masking properties of a generic Floquet code. Further, we look at properties of dynamical codes under the constraint of geometric locality with a view to understand whether the fundamental limitations on logical gates and code parameters imposed by geometric locality for traditional codes can be surpassed in the dynamical paradigm. We find that codes with a limited number of long range connectivity will not allow non-Clifford gates to be implemented with finite depth circuits in the 2D setting.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oleksandr V. Marchukov, Andrea Trombettoni, Giuseppe Mussardo, Maxim Olshanii</p>
            <p>The famous Goldbach conjecture states that any even natural number $N$ greater than $2$ can be written as the sum of two prime numbers $p^{\text{(I)}}$ and $p^{\text{(II)}}$. In this article we propose a quantum analogue device that solves the following problem: given a small prime $p^{\text{(I)}}$, identify a member $N$ of a $\mathcal{N}$-strong set even numbers for which $N-p^{\text{(I)}}$ is also a prime. A table of suitable large primes $p^{\text{(II)}}$ is assumed to be known a priori. The device realizes the Grover quantum search protocol and as such ensures a $\sqrt{\mathcal{N}}$ quantum advantage. Our numerical example involves a set of 51 even numbers just above the highest even classical-numerically explored so far [T. O. e Silva, S. Herzog, and S. Pardi, Mathematics of Computation {\bf 83}, 2033 (2013)]. For a given small prime number $p^{\text{(I)}}=223$, it took our quantum algorithm 5 steps to identify the number $N=4\times 10^{18}+14$ as featuring a Goldbach partition involving $223$ and another prime, namely $p^{\text{(II)}}=4\times 10^{18}-239$. Currently, our algorithm limits the number of evens to be tested simultaneously to $\mathcal{N} \sim \ln(N)$: larger samples will typically contain more than one even that can be partitioned with the help of a given $p^{\text{(I)}}$, thus leading to a departure from the Grover paradigm.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jing Yang</p>
            <p>Postselection can compress the metrological information and improve sensitivity in the presence of certain types of technical noise. Postselected quantum metrology with pure states has been significantly advanced recently. However, extending this framework to mixed states leads to formidable challenges, such as the difficulty in searching for lossless postselection measurements or even the loss of metrological information. In this work, we leverage the intuition for the lossless postselection of pure states and generalize the theory to the lossless postselection of a class of mixed states, dubbed quasi-pure states. We illustrate our findings in postselected quantum imaging, unitary estimation problems, and show that the quasi-pure structure can be universally engineered through only classical correlation with an ancilla. Our findings provide a theoretical framework for applying postselection techniques to technical noise suppression, realistic quantum imaging and postselected distributed quantum sensing and offers new perspectives to foundational questions in quantum information geometry.</p>

            <p>We introduce the Sequency Hierarchy Truncation (SeqHT) scheme for reducing the resources required for state preparation and time evolution in quantum simulations, based upon a truncation in sequency. For the $\lambda\phi^4$ interaction in scalar field theory, or any interaction with a polynomial expansion, upper bounds on the contributions of operators of a given sequency are derived. For the systems we have examined, observables computed in sequency-truncated wavefunctions, including quantum correlations as measured by magic, are found to step-wise converge to their exact values with increasing cutoff sequency. The utility of SeqHT is demonstrated in the adiabatic state preparation of the $\lambda\phi^4$ anharmonic oscillator ground state using IBM's quantum computer ${\textit ibm\_sherbrooke}$. Using SeqHT, the depth of the required quantum circuits is reduced by $\sim 30\%$, leading to significantly improved determinations of observables in the quantum simulations. More generally, SeqHT is expected to lead to a reduction in required resources for quantum simulations of systems with a hierarchy of length scales.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nathan Claudet, Simon Perdrix</p>
            <p>Stabilizer states form a ubiquitous family of quantum states that can be graphically represented through the graph state formalism. A fundamental property of graph states is that applying a local complementation - a well-known and extensively studied graph transformation - results in a graph that represents the same entanglement as the original. In other words, the corresponding graph states are LU-equivalent. This property served as the cornerstone for capturing non-trivial quantum properties in a simple graphical manner, in the study of quantum entanglement but also for developing protocols and models based on graph states and stabilizer states, such as measurement-based quantum computing, secret sharing, error correction, entanglement distribution... However, local complementation fails short to fully characterise entanglement: there exist pairs of graph states that are LU-equivalent but cannot be transformed one into the other using local complementations. Only few is known about the equivalence of graph states beyond local complementation. We introduce a generalisation of local complementation which graphically characterises the LU-equivalence of graph states. We use this characterisation to show the existence of a strict infinite hierarchy of equivalences of graph states. Our approach is based on minimal local sets, which are subsets of vertices that are known to cover any graph, and to be invariant under local complementation and even LU-equivalence. We use these structures to provide a type to each vertex of a graph, leading to a natural standard form in which the LU-equivalence can be exhibited and captured by means of generalised local complementation.</p>

            <p>Thermodynamics in quantum circuits aims to find improved functionalities of thermal machines, highlight fundamental phenomena peculiar to quantum nature in thermodynamics, and point out limitations in quantum information processing due to coupling of the system to its environment. An important aspect to achieve some of these goals is the regime of strong coupling that has remained until now a domain of theoretical works only. Our aim is to demonstrate strong coupling features in heat transport using a superconducting flux qubit, which is capable of reaching strong to deep-ultra strong coupling regimes, as shown in previous studies. Here, we show experimental evidence of strong coupling by observing a hybridized state of the qubit with two cavities coupled to it, leading to a triplet-like thermal transport via this combined system around the minimum energy of the qubit, at power levels of tens of femtowatts, exceeding by an order of magnitude those in earlier experiments. We also demonstrate close to 100% on-off switching ratio of heat current mediated by photons by applying magnetic flux to the qubit. Our experiment opens a way towards testing debated questions in strong coupling thermodynamics such as what heat in this regime is. We also present a theoretical model that aligns with our experimental findings and explains the mechanism behind heat transport in our device. Furthermore, our experiment opens new possibilities for quantum thermodynamics, aiming to realize true quantum heat engines and refrigerators with enhanced power and efficiency, by leveraging ultra-strong coupling between the system and its environment in future experiments.</p>

            <p>The logarithm-determinant is an widely-present operation in many areas of physics and computer science. Derivatives of the logarithm-determinant compute physically relevant quantities in statistical physics models, quantum field theories, as well as the inverses of matrices. A multi-variable version of the quantum gradient algorithm is developed here to evaluate the derivative of the logarithm-determinant. From this, the inverse of a sparse-rank input operator may be determined efficiently. Measuring an expectation value of the quantum state--instead of all $N^2$ elements of the input operator--can be accomplished in $O(k/\varepsilon^2)$ time in the idealized case for $k$ relevant eigenvectors of the input matrix with precision $\varepsilon$. A practical implementation of the required operator will likely need $\log_2N$ overhead, giving an overall complexity of $O((k\log_2 N)/\varepsilon^2)$. The method applies widely and converges super-linearly in $k$ when the condition number is high. The best classical method we are aware of scales as $N$. Given the same resource assumptions as other algorithms, such that an equal superposition of eigenvectors is available efficiently, the algorithm is evaluated in the practical case as $O(\log_2 N/\varepsilon^2)$. The output is given in $O(1)$ queries of oracle, which is given explicitly here and only relies on time-evolution operators that can be implemented with arbitrarily small error. The algorithm is envisioned for fully error-corrected quantum computers but may be implementable on near-term machines. We discuss how this algorithm can be used for kernel-based quantum machine-learning.</p>

            <p>We describe an algorithm with quasi-polynomial runtime $n^{\log_2(n)+O(1)}$ for deciding local unitary (LU) equivalence of graph states. The algorithm builds on a recent graphical characterisation of LU-equivalence via generalised local complementation. By first transforming the corresponding graphs into a standard form using usual local complementations, LU-equivalence reduces to the existence of a single generalised local complementation that maps one graph to the other. We crucially demonstrate that this reduces to solving a system of quasi-polynomially many linear equations, avoiding an exponential blow-up. As a byproduct, we generalise Bouchet's algorithm for deciding local Clifford (LC) equivalence of graph states by allowing the addition of arbitrary linear constraints. We also improve existing bounds on the size of graph states that are LU- but not LC-equivalent. While the smallest known examples involve 27 qubits, and it is established that no such examples exist for up to 8 qubits, we refine this bound by proving that LU- and LC-equivalence coincide for graph states involving up to 19 qubits.</p>

            <h2>Bypassing eigenstate thermalization with experimentally accessible quantum dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amit Vikram</p>
            <p>Eigenstate thermalization has played a prominent role as a determiner of the validity of quantum statistical mechanics since von Neumann's early works on quantum ergodicity. However, its connection to the dynamical process of quantum thermalization relies sensitively on nondegeneracy properties of the energy spectrum, as well as detailed features of individual eigenstates that are effective only over correspondingly large timescales, rendering it generically inaccessible given practical timescales and finite experimental resources. Here, we introduce the notion of energy-band thermalization to address these limitations, by coarse-graining over energy level spacings with a finite energy resolution. We show that energy-band thermalization implies the thermalization of an observable in almost all states (in any orthonormal basis) over accessible timescales without relying on microscopic properties of the energy eigenvalues or eigenstates, and conversely, can be efficiently accessed in experiments via the dynamics of a single mixed state (for a given observable) with only polynomially many resources in the system size. This allows us to directly determine thermalization, including in the presence of conserved charges, from this state: Most strikingly, if an observable thermalizes in this initial state over a finite range of times, then it must thermalize in almost all physical initial states over all longer timescales. As applications, we derive a finite-time Mazur-Suzuki inequality for quantum transport with approximately conserved charges, and establish the thermalization of local observables over finite timescales in almost all accessible states in (generally inhomogeneous) dual-unitary quantum circuits. We also propose measurement protocols for general many-qubit systems. This work initiates a rigorous treatment of quantum thermalization in terms of experimentally accessible quantities.</p>

            <h2>Efficient Two Photon Generation from an Atom in a Cavity</h2>

            <p>Two-photon states are essential for quantum technologies such as metrology, lithography, and communication. One of the main methods of two-photon generation is based on parametric down-conversion, but this suffers from low efficiency and a large footprint. This work is a detailed investigation of an alternative approach: two-photon generation from an atom in a doubly resonant cavity. The system, consisting of an atom interacting with two modes of the cavity, is modelled by the Lindblad Master Equation. An approximate analytical solution is derived, using a novel approximation method, to determine the practically achievable limits on efficiency and brightness. The model also predicts the optimal cavity parameters for achieving these limits. For experimentally feasible parameters, the maximum efficiency turns out to be approximately $0.1\%$, which is about three orders of magnitude greater than that of parametric down-conversion-based methods. The optimal rate and efficiency for two-photon generation are achieved when the outcoupling rate of the cavity mode at the two-photon emission frequency matches the single-photon atom-field coupling strength. Moreover, the outcoupling rate of the cavity mode at the one-photon emission frequency for single photons should be minimized. The cavity field properties are also examined by studying the second-order correlation function at zero time delay and the Fano Factor. The quantum-jump framework, combined with Monte Carlo simulations, is used to characterize the mechanism of two-photon emission and the emission spectra of the cavity. Two-photon emission is demonstrated to be a rapid cascade process of quantum jumps, and the spectrum exhibits distinct peaks that correspond to transitions between the manifolds of the system.</p>

            <p>Detecting genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) is a state-characterization task that benchmarks coherence and experimental control in quantum systems. Existing GME tests often require joint measurements on many qubits, posing experimental challenges for systems like time-bin encoded qubits and microwave photons from superconducting circuits, where qubit connectivity is limited or measurement noise grows with the number of jointly measured qubits. Here we introduce versatile GME and $k$-inseparability criteria applicable to any state, which only require measuring $O(n^2)$ out of $2^n$ (at most) $m$-body stabilizers of $n$-qubit target graph states, with $m$ upper-bounded by twice the underlying graph's maximum degree. For cluster or ring-graph states, only constant-weight stabilizers are needed. Using semidefinite programming, we further reduce both the number and weight of required stabilizers. Analytical and numerical results show that our criteria are noise-robust and can infer state infidelity from certified $k$-inseparability in microwave photonic graph states generated under realistic conditions.</p>

Diamagnetic levitation offers a passive method at room temperature to isolate macroscopic objects in vacuum environments, yet eddy current damping remains a critical limitation for electrically conductive materials. We show that there are situations where the motion of conductors in magnetic fields does not, in principle, produce eddy damping, and demonstrate an electrically conducting rotor diamagnetically levitated in an axially symmetric magnetic field in a high vacuum. Experimental measurements and finite-element simulations reveal gas collision damping as the dominant loss mechanism at high pressures, while residual eddy damping, which arises from symmetry-breaking factors such as platform tilt or material imperfections, dominates at low pressures. The conclusion is supported by an analytic proof and an analytic example of zero steady current density for a rotating conductor in a magnetic field. This demonstrates a macroscopic levitated rotor with extremely low rotational damping and paves the way to fully suppress rotor damping, enabling ultra-low-loss rotors for gyroscopes, pressure sensing, and fundamental physics tests.</p>

            <h2>Hardware-efficient quantum phase estimation via local control</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benjamin F. Schiffer, Dominik S. Wild, Nishad Maskara, Mikhail D. Lukin, J. Ignacio Cirac</p>
            <p>Quantum phase estimation plays a central role in quantum simulation as it enables the study of spectral properties of many-body quantum systems. Most variants of the phase estimation algorithm require the application of the global unitary evolution conditioned on the state of one or more auxiliary qubits, posing a significant challenge for current quantum devices. In this work, we present an approach to quantum phase estimation that uses only locally controlled operations, resulting in a significantly reduced circuit depth. At the heart of our approach are efficient routines to measure the complex phase of the expectation value of the time-evolution operator, the so-called Loschmidt echo, for both circuit dynamics and Hamiltonian dynamics. By tracking changes in the phase during the dynamics, the routines trade circuit depth for an increased sampling cost and classical postprocessing. Our approach does not rely on reference states and is applicable to any efficiently preparable state, regardless of its correlations. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the sample complexity and illustrate the results with numerical simulations. Our methods offer a practical pathway for measuring spectral properties in large many-body quantum systems using current quantum devices.</p>

            <h2>Methods for Reducing Ancilla-Overhead in Block Encodings</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francisca Vasconcelos, Andr√°s Gily√©n</p>
            <p>Block encodings are a fundamental primitive in quantum algorithms, but can often have large ancilla overhead. In this work, we introduce novel techniques for reducing this overhead in two distinct ways. In Part I, we prove the existence of a "space-time tradeoff" by deriving an algorithm that, for any block encoding, approximately uncomputes all but one of its ancilla (freeing up those ancillae for reuse in later parts of a quantum algorithm). In Part II, we evaluate the minimum number of ancillae required to perform coherent multiplication of block encodings and introduce a "space-accuracy tradeoff". Specfically, we prove that logarithmic ancillae is optimal for exact multiplication of block encodings, but show that (in certain block encoding regimes) approximate multiplication of block encodings can be achieved to high-precision with just one ancilla.</p>

            <p>Generating large, non-trivial quantum chemistry test problems with known ground-state solutions remains a core challenge for benchmarking electronic structure methods. Inspired by planted-solution techniques from combinatorial optimization, we introduce four classes of Hamiltonians with embedded, retrievable ground states. These Hamiltonians mimic realistic electronic structure problems, support adjustable complexity, and are derived from reference systems. Crucially, their ground-state energies can be computed exactly, provided the construction parameters are known. To obscure this structure and control perceived complexity, we introduce techniques such as killer operators, balance operators, and random orbital rotations. We showcase this framework using examples based on homogeneous catalysts of industrial relevance and validate tunable difficulty through density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) convergence behavior. Beyond enabling scalable, ground-truth benchmark generation, our approach offers a controlled setting to explore the limitations of electronic structure methods and investigate how Hamiltonian structure influences ground state solution difficulty.</p>

            <h2>Security loophole in error verification in quantum key distribution</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Toyohiro Tsurumaru, Akihiro Mizutani, Toshihiko Sasaki</p>
            <p>The security of quantum key distribution (QKD) is evaluated based on the secrecy of Alice's key and the correctness of the keys held by Alice and Bob. A practical method for ensuring correctness is known as error verification, in which Alice and Bob reveal a portion of their reconciled keys and check whether the revealed information matches. In this paper, we point out that when error verification is performed in a QKD protocol, the definition of secrecy must be revised accordingly. We illustrate the necessity of this revision with a counterexample, showing that neglecting it can lead to an incorrect security claim. In particular, we observe that in the case of security proof method based on phase error correction, which is one of the mainstream approaches and also known as Koashi's approach, no explicit method has been established to properly incorporate the revised secrecy definition. To resolve this issue, we present a way to translate the phase error correction-based approach into another mainstream approach, called the leftover hashing lemma-based approach, also known as Renner's approach, where a solution has already been formulated. As a consequence, security proofs under the phase error correction-based approach automatically remain valid without any change in the secret key length, even if they implicitly consider error verification without revising the secrecy definition.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tzu-Liang Hsu, Kuan-Jou Wang, Chun-Hao Chang, Sheng-Yan Sun, Shih-Husan Chen, Ching-Jui Huang, Che-Ming Li</p>
            <p>Characterizing quantum dynamics is essential for quantifying arbitrary properties of a quantum process -- such as its ability to exhibit quantum-mechanical dynamics or generate entanglement. However, current methods require a number of experimental settings that increases with system size, leading to artifacts from experimental errors. Here, we propose an approximate optimization method that estimates property measures using only two mutually unbiased bases to compute their lower and upper bounds, and to reconstruct the corresponding processes. This system-size independence prevents error accumulation and allows characterization of the intrinsic quantum dynamics. Compared with quantum process tomography, we experimentally validate our method on photonic fusion and controlled-NOT operations, demonstrating accurate resource estimation while substantially reducing the number of required Pauli experimental settings: from 81 to 10 for the photonic fusion and to 2 for the controlled-NOT. These results show that our method is well-suited for estimation of dynamical properties in architectures ranging from chip-scale quantum processors to long-distance quantum networks.</p>

            <h2>Ancilla-Free Quantum Protocol for Thermal Green's Functions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Changhao Yi, Cunlu Zhou</p>
            <p>We introduce a simple and noise-resilient quantum algorithm for computing both zero- and finite-temperature Green's functions, requiring no ancillas and relying only on native time evolution and measurements readily available on current platforms. Assuming parity symmetry of the system, as in the Fermi-Hubbard and Heisenberg models, we construct symmetric and antisymmetric thermal states and employ a tailored quench spectroscopy scheme to recover the exact real and imaginary parts of two-point time correlators. Green's functions are then reconstructed through efficient signal analysis. The protocol is theoretically efficient, experimentally accessible, and directly applicable to both digital quantum computers and analog quantum simulators. Beyond Green's functions, the same framework extends naturally to out-of-time-order correlators (OTOC). This work highlights a practical path toward probing finite-temperature dynamics of strongly correlated quantum systems on near-term and early fault-tolerant quantum hardware.</p>

            <h2>Measuring Multiparticle Indistinguishability with the Generalized Bunching Probability</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shawn Geller, Emanuel Knill</p>
            <p>The indistinguishability of many bosons undergoing passive linear transformations followed by number basis measurements is fully characterized by the visible state of the bosons. However, measuring all the parameters in the visible state is experimentally demanding. We argue that the generalized bunching probability--which is the probability that all the input bosons arrive in a given subset of the output modes--provides useful partial information about the indistinguishability of the input bosons, by establishing that it is monotonic with respect to certain partial orders of distinguishability of the bosons. As an intermediate result, we prove that Lieb's permanental-dominance conjecture for immanants is equivalent to the following statement: for states that are invariant under permutations of the occupied visible modes, the generalized bunching probability is maximized when the bosons are perfectly indistinguishable. As a corollary, we show that if Lieb's conjecture holds, then the generalized bunching probability is monotonic with respect to the refinement partial order on what we refer to as partially labelled states. We also prove, unconditionally, that for states such that the single-particle density matrix is the same for each particle, the Haar average of the generalized bunching probability is Schur convex with respect to the eigenvalues of said single-particle density matrix. As an application of the Schur convexity, we show that when the single-particle density matrix is a Gibbs state, the mean generalized bunching probability serves as a thermometer.</p>

            <h2>How to simulate magic state cultivation with around $8$ Clifford terms on average</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kwok Ho Wan, Zhenghao Zhong</p>
            <p>Building upon [arXiv:2509.01224], we present a sketch on how to simulate the non-Clifford $d=5$ magic state cultivation circuits [arXiv:2409.17595] with a sum of $\approx 8$ Clifford ZX-diagrams on average, at $0.1\%$ noise. Compared to a magic cat state stabiliser decomposition of all $53$ non-Clifford spiders ($6{,}377{,}292$ terms required), this is more than $7 \times 10^{5}$ times reduction in the number of terms. Our stabiliser decomposition has the advantage of representing the final non-Clifford state (in light of circuit errors) as a sum of Clifford ZX-diagrams. This will be useful in simulating the escape stage of magic state cultivation, where one need to port the resultant state of cultivation into a larger Clifford circuit with many more qubits. Still, it's necessary to only track $\approx 8$ Clifford terms. Our result sheds light on the simulability of operationally relevant, high $T$-count quantum circuits with some internal structure.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aysel Shiralieva, Grigory A. Starkov, Bj√∂rn Trauzettel</p>
            <p>Open quantum systems can be approximately described by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians (NHHs) and Lindbladians. The two approaches differ by quantum jump terms corresponding to a measurement of the system by its environment. We analyze the emergence of exceptional points (EPs) in NHHs and Lindbladians. In particular, we show how EPs in NHHs relate to a novel type of EPs -- multi-block EPs -- in the non-Hermitian Liouvillian, i.e. the Lindbladian in absence of quantum jump terms. We further analyze how quantum jump terms modify the multi-block structure. To illustrate our general findings, we present two prime examples: qubits and qutrits coupled to additional ground state levels that serve as sinks of the population. In those examples, we can navigate through the EP block structure by a variation of physical parameters. We analyze how the dynamics of the population of the states is affected by the order of the EPs. Additionally, we demonstrate that the quantum geometric tensor serves as a sensitive indicator of EPs of different kinds.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Carolyn Mayer, Anand Ganti, Uzoma Onunkwo, Tzvetan Metodi, Benjamin Anker, Jacek Skryzalin</p>
            <p>We describe a practical approach for accessing the logical failure rates of quantum error-correcting (QEC) circuits under low physical (component) failure rate regimes. Standard Monte Carlo is often the de facto approach for studying the failure rates of quantum circuits. However, in the study of fault-tolerant error-correcting circuits, the ability to extend this approach to low physical failure rates is limited. In particular, the use of Monte Carlo to access circuits that are relatively large or have high correcting power becomes more difficult as we lower the input failure rates of the individual components (gates) in the circuit. For these reasons, many simulations studying the circuit model go no lower than end-to-end logical failure rates in the 10^{-6} regime. In this report, we outline an approach that borrows from earlier work by Bravyi and Vargo to the more complex circuit noise model. Earlier works studied both the capacity and phenomenological noise models, but the work is insufficient for generating similar simulations in the circuit-noise model. To the best of our knowledge, our team is the first to develop a full prescription of the rare event simulation by splitting technique for the circuit-based noise model. We have also generated promising results that are confirmed by standard Monte Carlo simulation under an accessible regime. This work shows that we can access noise in the circuit-model prescription of quantum error-correcting code to failure rates below 10^{-20} regime.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuebing Zhou, Jiawei Hu, Hongwei Yu</p>
            <p>The Unruh effect predicts that a uniformly accelerated observer perceives the vacuum seen by an inertial observer as a thermal bath at a temperature proportional to its proper acceleration. This phenomenon is often regarded as a flat spacetime ``cousin" of Hawking radiation. In this Letter, we first study the entanglement dynamics of a quantum system composed of two polarizable two-level subsystems undergoing centripetal acceleration in a vacuum. We demonstrate that the system's steady state can be entangled irrespective of the initial state, a distinct characteristic attributable to the circular manifestation of the Unruh effect. Through meticulous analysis, we then propose that this phenomenon can feasibly be detected using state-of-the-art optomechanical technologies, particularly with a quantum system of two molecules.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Takato Mori, Beni Yoshida</p>
            <p>The Ryu-Takayanagi formula predicts that two boundary subsystems $A$ and $C$ can exhibit large mutual information $I(A:C)$ even when they are spatially disconnected on the boundary and separated by a buffer subsystem $B$, as long as $A$ and $C$ have connected entanglement wedge in the bulk. However, whether the reduced state $\rho_{AC}$ contains distillable EPR pairs has remained a longstanding open problem. In this work, we resolve this problem by showing that: i) there is no LO-distillable entanglement at leading order in $G_N$, suggesting the absence of bipartite entanglement in a holographic mixed state $\rho_{AC}$, and ii) one-shot, one-way LOCC-distillable entanglement is given at leading order by locally accessible information $J^W(A|C)$, which is related to the entanglement wedge cross section $E^W$ involving the (third) purifying system $B$ via $J^W(A|C) = S_A - E^W(A:B)$. Namely, we demonstrate that a connected entanglement wedge does not necessarily imply nonzero distillable entanglement in one-shot, one-way LOCC. We also show that entanglement of formation $E_{F}(A:C)$ is given by $E^W(A:C)$ at leading order in holography.</p>

            <p>Understanding the coherent properties of electron spins driven by electric fields is crucial for their potential application in quantum-coherent nanoscience. In this work, we address two distinct driving mechanisms in electric-field driven electron-spin resonance as implemented in scanning tunneling spectroscopy. We study the origin of the driving field using a single orbital Anderson impurity, connected to polarized leads and biased by a voltage modulated on resonance with a spin transition. By mapping the quantum master equation into a system of equations for the impurity spin, we identify two distinct driving mechanisms. Below the charging thresholds of the impurity, electron spin resonance is dominated by a magnetically exchange-driven mechanism or field-like torque. Conversely, above the charging threshold spin-transfer torque caused by the spin-polarized current through the impurity drives the spin transition. Only the first mechanism enables coherent quantum spin control, while the second one leads to fast decoherence and spin accumulation towards a non-equilibrium steady-state. The electron spin resonance signals and spin dynamics vary significantly depending on which driving mechanism dominates, highlighting the potential for optimizing quantum-coherent control in electrically driven quantum systems.</p>

The calculation uses 10 qubits for staggered fermions at five spatial sites and one ancillary qubit. The most critical and challenging step is to reduce the number of two-qubit gate depths to around 500 so that sensible results start to emerge. The resulting lightcone correlators have excellent agreement with the classical simulator result in central values, although the error is still large. Compared with classical approaches, quantum computation has the advantage of not being limited in the accessible range of parton momentum fraction $x$ due to renormalon ambiguity, and the difficulty of accessing non-valence partons. A PDF calculation with 3+1 dimensional QCD near $x=0$ or $x=1$ will be a clear demonstration of the quantum advantage on a problem with great scientific impact.</p>

The emergence of a new computational paradigm based on quantum computing, therefore, can introduce further advances in this program. In particular, it is believed that quantum computing will make possible first-principles studies of matter at extreme densities, and in and out of equilibrium, hence improving our theoretical description of early universe, astrophysical environments, and high-energy particle collisions. Developing and advancing a quantum-computing based lattice-gauge-theory program, therefore, is a vibrant and fast-moving area of research in theoretical nuclear and particle physics. These lecture notes introduce the topic of quantum computing lattice gauge theories in a pedagogical manner, with an emphasis on theoretical and algorithmic aspects of the program, and on the most common approaches and practices, to keep the presentation focused and useful. Hamiltonian formulation of lattice gauge theories is introduced within the Kogut-Susskind framework, the notion of Hilbert space and physical states is discussed, and some elementary numerical methods for performing Hamiltonian simulations are discussed. Quantum-simulation preliminaries and digital quantum-computing basics are presented, which set the stage for concrete examples of gauge-theory quantum-circuit design and resource analysis.

            <p>In this article, we apply the recently proposed Asymmetric Bethe Ansatz method to the problem of two one-dimensional, short-range-interacting bosons on a ring in the presence of a $\delta$-function barrier. Only half of the Hilbert space--namely, the two-body states that are odd under point inversion about the position of the barrier--is accessible to this method. The other half is presumably non-integrable. We consider benchmarking the recently proposed $1/g$ expansion about the hard-core boson point [A. G. Volosniev, D. V. Fedorov, A. S. Jensen, M. Valiente, N. T. Zinner, Nature Communications 5, 5300 (2014)] as one application of our results. Additionally, we find that when the $\delta$-barrier is converted to a $\delta$-well with strength equal to that of the particle-particle interaction, the system exhibits the spectrum of its non-interacting counterpart while its eigenstates display features of a strongly interacting system. We discuss this phenomenon in the "Summary and Future Research" section of our paper.</p>

We experimentally detect the multipartite entanglement of a two-dimensional cluster state involving 123 orbit qubits through direct stabilizer measurements, verifying the full bipartite non-separability. Furthermore, we demonstrate measurement-based quantum computation by implementing single-qubit and two-qubit logical gates, highlighting the flexibility of orbit-qubit operations.

            <h2>Measuring dark state number in the Tavis-Cummings model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> L. Theerthagiri, Rajesh Narayanan, R. Ganesh</p>
            <p>Quantum mechanics allows for light-matter setups that hold excitations without releasing them as light. Arising from destructive interference processes, they are best seen in a Tavis-Cummings-like setup where two-level atoms (or qubits) are placed within a lossy cavity. If the system is initialized with some qubits excited and some in the ground state, there is a non-zero probability that no photons will be emitted. This can be framed as a Stern-Gerlach measurement, with a detector to measure if one or more photons leave the cavity. If no photons are detected, the qubits collapse onto a dark state. This can be viewed as heralding of a dark state based on zero photon detection. Building upon this idea, we propose a protocol to measure the number of independent dark states. Moreover, we show that this quantity is robust to arbitrary levels of disorder in the qubit-photon coupling constants. We then discuss a phase transition where the number of dark states plays the role of an order parameter. This provides an exciting example of a phase transition that is completely insensitive to disorder.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muqaddar Abbas, Muhammad Awais Altaf, Pei Zhang, Muhammad Waseem</p>
            <p>We propose a theoretical model to obtain the photonic spin Hall effect (SHE) in an optomechanical nanocavity using a graphene bilayer as the intracavity medium. In our model, the pump and probe fields coherently drive the first mirror, whereas the second mirror has mechanical oscillation due to the radiation pressure. We show that the right- and left-circular polarization components of the Gaussian probe field striking at an arbitrary incident angle become spatially separate along a direction orthogonal to the plane of incidence. Photonic SHE can be coherently controlled by adjusting the optomechanical interaction, cavity field and G-mode phonon coupling, as well as G-mode phonon and electronic state interaction. The findings of photonic SHE are equally valid for standard optomechanical systems in the absence of cavity field and G-mode phonon coupling and electronic state interaction. The cavity field and G-mode phonon coupling broadened the detuning range of the probe field to observe the dominant photonic SHE. Adding G-mode phonon and electronic state interaction generates enhanced photonic SHE at three different probe field detunings due to optomechanical-induced transparency being split into three windows. We show that asymmetric photonic SHE can be controlled through cavity field and G-mode phonon coupling and G-mode phonon and electronic state interaction when probe field detuning is non-zero. The photonic SHE in bilayer graphene integrated with an optomechanical cavity may enable further studies of spin-dependent photonic effects and quantum sensing applications.</p>

We find a coupling strength between the electron motion and a resonator photon of $g/2\pi=118$ MHz, exceeding both the electron motional state decoherence and the resonator loss. These experiments open new avenues for investigating light-matter interaction at the single electron level, and are a key step towards measurement and control of electrons on helium-based spin qubits.</p>

            <p>A scalable hybrid cavity quantum acoustodynamics (QAD) platform is proposed. The architecture integrates superconducting transmon qubits with phononic integrated circuits on a single chip made by lithium niobate-on-sapphire substrate. The platform supports tightly confined and guided phononic modes in unsuspended waveguides and microring structures, while the superconducting qubits reside on the sapphire substrate. Efficient piezoelectric coupling between the phononic modes and transmon qubits can be achieved using interdigital transducers as part of the qubit's shunt capacitance. Numerical calculations demonstrate the feasibility of achieving strong coupling between the phononic microring resonator and the transmon qubit. This hybrid cavity QAD platform opens up new opportunities for quantum information processing and the study of novel quantum acoustic phenomena.</p>

            <h2>Mixed Quantum-Classical Approaches to Spin Current and Polarization Dynamics in Chiral Molecular Junctions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu Wang, Ruihao Bi, Wei Liu, Jiayue Han, Wenjie Dou</p>
            <p>Chiral molecular junctions offer a promising platform for realizing chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS), where spin filtering occurs without external magnetic fields. Here, we investigate spin transport in such junctions by combining quantum master equation (QME) methods for purely electronic dynamics with surface hopping (SH) and mean-field Ehrenfest (MF) approaches to incorporate electron-phonon coupling. Our results show that transient spin polarization arises but ultimately decays to zero at long times. We find that bias voltage, molecular length, and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) strongly influence the spin current dynamics: higher bias enhances spin current but reduces polarization, while longer molecules and stronger SOC amplify transient polarization. Including electron-phonon coupling modifies current-voltage characteristics, enhancing spin currents at intermediate bias but suppressing them at high bias, while leaving the polarization dynamics largely unchanged. These findings highlight the interplay between electronic and vibrational effects in CISS and provide guidance for designing molecular spintronic devices.</p>

            <h2>Spin-photon coupling using circular double quantum dots</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ferdinand Omlor, Florinda Vi√±as Bostr√∂m, Martin Leijnse</p>
            <p>We propose and analyze a microwave spin-photon interface based on a circular double quantum dot, inspired by recent experimental observations of anisotropic g-factors and ring states in InAs nanowires. We develop an effective theoretical model capturing the interplay of spin-orbit coupling and the magnetic flux through the ring and show how ring states form at crossings of odd and even geometrical parity orbital states. Similar to bonding and antibonding states of conventional double quantum dots, the ring eigenstates can be changed into single dot states by detuning the dots, which enables a high degree of control over the system's properties. Applying a tilted magnetic field induces spin-charge hybridization which enables spin-photon coupling. For low disorder, the photons couple states of simultaneously (almost) opposite spin and angular momentum. With increasing disorder, the spin-photon coupling becomes analogous to the flopping mode mechanism of conventional double quantum dots where the spin is hybridized with the bonding and antibonding orbital states without angular momentum. We show that the system exhibits a second-order charge-noise sweet spot at a specific magnetic field angle, which lowers the system's sensitivity to dephasing while retaining a substantial spin-photon coupling strength. Moreover, the photon coupling mechanism can be switched off either electrically, by detuning to the single-dot regime, or magnetically, by rotating the field to disable the spin-charge hybridization.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Leon C. Sander, Nathan A. McMahon, Petr Zapletal, Michael J. Hartmann</p>
            <p>Quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs) are quantum circuits for characterizing complex quantum states. They have been proposed for recognizing quantum phases of matter at low sampling cost and have been designed for condensed matter systems in one dimension. Here we construct a QCNN that can perform phase recognition in two dimensions and correctly identify the phase transition from a Toric Code phase with $\mathbb{Z}_2$-topological order to the paramagnetic phase. The network also exhibits a noise threshold up to which the topological order is recognized. Furthermore, it captures correlations between all stabilizer elements of the Toric Code, which cannot be accessed by direct measurements. This increases the threshold for errors leading to such correlations and allows for correctly identifying the topological phase in the presence of strong correlated errors. Our work generalizes phase recognition with QCNNs to higher spatial dimensions and intrinsic topological order, where exploration and characterization via classical numerics become challenging.</p>

            <p>Simulating non-equilibrium phenomena in strongly-interacting quantum many-body systems, including thermalization, is a promising application of near-term and future quantum computation. By performing experiments on a digital quantum computer consisting of fully-connected optically-controlled trapped ions, we study the role of entanglement in the thermalization dynamics of a $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory in 2+1 spacetime dimensions. Using randomized-measurement protocols, we efficiently learn a classical approximation of non-equilibrium states that yields the gap-ratio distribution and the spectral form factor of the entanglement Hamiltonian. These observables exhibit universal early-time signals for quantum chaos, a prerequisite for thermalization. Our work, therefore, establishes quantum computers as robust tools for studying universal features of thermalization in complex many-body systems, including in gauge theories.</p>

            <p>Controlling the motion of nanoscale objects at the quantum limit promises new tests of quantum mechanics and advanced sensors. Rotational motion is of particular interest, as it follows nonlinear dynamics in a compact, closed configuration space, which opens up a plethora of phenomena and applications beyond the possibilities of free or trapped linear motion. A prerequisite for such experiments is the capability to trap nanorotors and initialize them in a quantum ground state of libration. Here, we demonstrate the reliable, repetitive laser-induced loading of silica nanodimers and trimers into an optical tweezer. Coherent scattering in a high-finesse cavity allows us to cool two different librational modes to the quantum ground state with occupation numbers as low as $n_{\beta}=0.54\pm0.32$ and $n_{\alpha}=0.21\pm0.03$. By simultaneously cooling both degrees of freedom ($n_\beta=0.73\pm0.22$, $n_\alpha=1.02\pm0.08$) we align nanorotors to a space-fixed axis with precision better than 20$\,\mu$rad, close to the zero-point amplitude of librations.</p>

            <p>The security of quantum key distribution (QKD) is quantified by a parameter $\varepsilon>0$, which -- under well-defined physical assumptions -- can be bounded explicitly. This contrasts with computationally secure schemes, where security claims are only asymptotic (i.e., under standard complexity assumptions, one only knows that $\varepsilon \to 0$ as the key size grows, but has no explicit bound). Here we explain the definition and interpretation of $\varepsilon$-security. Adopting an axiomatic approach, we show that $\varepsilon$ can be understood as the maximum probability of a security failure. Finally, we review and address several criticisms of this definition that have appeared in the literature.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Devjyoti Tripathy, Juzar Thingna, Sebastian Deffner</p>
            <p>Scrambling, the delocalization of initially localized quantum information, is commonly characterized by the out-of-time ordered correlator (OTOC). Employing the OTOC-Renyi-2 entropy theorem we derive a quantum speed limit for the OTOC, which sets an lower bound for the rate with which information can be scrambled. This bound becomes particularly tractable by describing the scrambling of information in a closed quantum system as an effective decoherence process of an open system interacting with an environment. We prove that decay of the OTOC can be bounded by the strength of the system-environment coupling and two-point environmental correlation functions. We validate our analytic bound numerically using the non-integrable transverse field Ising model. Our results provide a universal and model-agnostic quantitative framework for understanding the dynamical limits of information spreading across quantum many-body physics, condensed matter, and engineered quantum platforms.</p>

            <p>The extended Jaynes-Cummings model (eJCM) is a foundational framework for describing multi-mode light-matter interactions, with direct applications in quantum technologies such as photon addition and quasi-noiseless amplification. However, the model's complexity makes classical simulation intractable for large systems that could be of practical interest. In this work, we present a comprehensive, end-to-end framework for the quantum simulation of the eJCM. We develop explicit quantum algorithms and circuits for simulating the system's time evolution using first and second-order product formulas, analyzing the dynamics in both the Schrodinger and interaction pictures. Our analysis includes rigorous, closed-form error bounds that guide the choice of simulation parameters, and we extend the methodology to efficiently handle both pure and mixed quantum states. Furthermore, we validate our theoretical cost models with numerical simulations and provide a detailed fault-tolerant resource analysis, compiling the simulation circuits for a surface-code architecture to yield concrete estimates for physical qubit counts and execution times. This work establishes a complete roadmap for simulating the eJCM on future quantum computers.</p>

Among these, the exceptional point (EP) ring stands out as a quintessential topological feature unique to non-Hermitian systems. In this study, we employ single-photon interferometry to overcome the experimental challenge of precise phase control in quantum systems, thereby enabling a complete simulation of the non-Hermitian EP ring in three-dimensional parameter space without invoking any additional symmetry assumptions. By measuring the non-Hermitian dynamics in three-dimensional parameter space, we determine the system's eigenstates, which allows us to characterize the topological band structure of the system under different conditions. We describe the topological properties of the EP ring by extracting the Chern number and Berry phase for different parameter manifolds and observe the topological critical phenomena of the system.

This technique increases the effective detection efficiency from 74% to 95% and increases the observed squeezing from 4 dB to 8 dB, the highest level of squeezing observed at this wavelength. Additionally, the shot-to-dark-noise clearance increases, extending the effective measurement bandwidth toward lower frequencies.

Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a method to generate high-dimensional topological photonic entanglement. Our platform relies on carefully designed silicon photonic waveguide topological superlattices, which support nonlinear generation of energy-time entangled photon pairs on a superposition of multiple topological modes. Our measurements and theoretical analysis reveal entanglement of up to five topological modes with resilience to nanofabrication imperfections. This study, at the intersection of nonlinear integrated photonics, quantum information, and topology, opens a research avenue toward scalable, fault-tolerant quantum photonic states.</p>

            <p>The Fermi-Hubbard model is a fundamental model in condensed matter physics that describes strongly correlated electrons. On the other hand, quantum computers are emerging as powerful tools for exploring the complex dynamics of these quantum many-body systems. In this work, we demonstrate the quantum simulation of the one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model using IBM's superconducting quantum computers, employing over 100 qubits. We introduce a first-order Trotterization scheme and extend it to an optimized second-order Trotterization for the time evolution in the Fermi-Hubbard model, specifically tailored for the limited qubit connectivity of quantum architectures, such as IBM's platforms. Notably, both Trotterization approaches are scalable and maintain a constant circuit depth at each Trotter step, regardless of the qubit count, enabling us to precisely investigate the relaxation dynamics in the Fermi-Hubbard model by measuring the expectation value of the N√©el observable (staggered magnetization) for time-evolved quantum states. Finally, our successful measurement of expectation values in such large-scale quantum many-body systems, especially at longer time scales with larger entanglement, highlights the quantum utility of superconducting quantum platforms over conventional classical approximation methods.</p>

            <p>High-harmonic generation (HHG) is a highly nonlinear optical process that typically requires an intense laser to trigger emissions at integer multiples of the driving field frequency. Since HHG is commonly used as a spectroscopic tool to probe material properties, it becomes impossible to extract information about a material without introducing distortions caused by the strong driving field. Recent advances in bright squeezed vacuum sources have allowed HHG to be driven by purely quantum fields alone. Our work focuses on controlling and tuning HHG emission using a weak classical driving field with energy 1000 times less than that used in conventional HHG experiments, perturbed by an even weaker quantum field, such as bright squeezed vacuum (BSV). Our technique opens new avenues for nonlinear spectroscopy of materials by minimizing issues such as laser-induced damage, distortions, and heating. Our results show that a BSV pulse, containing less than 0.5% of the driving laser energy, can serve as an optical dial for tuning nonlinear emission, electron dynamics, and ionization.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ian T. Abrahams</p>
            <p>Strong excitonic coupling and photon antibunching (AB) have been observed together in Venus yellow fluorescent protein dimers and currently lack a cohesive theoretical explanation. In 2019, Kim et al. demonstrated Davydov splitting in circular dichroism spectra, revealing strong J-like coupling, while antibunched fluorescence emission was confirmed by combined antibunching--fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (AB/FCS fingerprinting). To investigate the implications of this coexistence, Venus dimer population dynamics are modeled within a Lindblad master equation framework, justified by the separation of characteristic coupling, dephasing, and thermal relaxation rates. Simulations predict rapid decoherence, yielding bright/dark state mixtures consistent with antibunched fluorescence emission at room temperature. Thus, excitonic coupling and photon AB are reconciled without invoking long-lived quantum coherence. More broadly, fluorescent proteins emerge as tractable model systems for probing evolutionary pressures on chromoprotein photophysics and quantum dynamics. Cryogenic cooling may extend coherence time into the regime required for ultrafast gate operations, suggesting fluorescent protein dimers as a viable platform for bio-inspired qubits.</p>

Using piecewise adiabatic evolution, we confirm the validity of these configurations through observations of complex geometric phases.

We further propose a scheme leveraging soliton dynamics in dissipative two-component Bose-Einstein condensates, enabling direct measurement of these topological signatures. These results establish a milestone for understanding Dirac monopole charge distributions and measuring complex geometric phases in non-Hermitian systems, with far-reaching implications for topological quantum computing and non-Hermitian photonics.</p>

            <p>Photons, unlike electrons, do not couple directly to magnetic fields, yet synthetic gauge fields can impart magnetic-like responses and enable topological transport. Discretized Floquet evolution provides a controlled route, where the time-ordered sequencing of non-commuting Hamiltonians imprints complex hopping phases and breaks time-reversal symmetry. However, stabilizing such driven dynamics and observing unambiguous topological signatures on a reconfigurable platform has remained challenging. Here we demonstrate synthetic gauge fields for light on a programmable photonic processor by implementing discretized Floquet drives that combine static and dynamic phases. This approach reveals hallmark features of topological transport: chiral circulation that reverses under drive inversion, flux-controlled interference with high visibility, and robust directional flow stabilized by maximizing the minimal Floquet quasi-energy gap. The dynamics are further characterized by a first-harmonic phase order parameter, whose per-period winding number quantifies angular drift and reverses sign with the drive order. These results establish discretized, gap-optimized Floquet evolution as a versatile and fully programmable framework for topological photonics, providing a compact route to engineer gauge fields, stabilize driven phases, and probe winding-number signatures of chiral transport.</p>

We show that the average phase can be estimated with high precision, exhibiting Heisenberg scaling in the total photon number, while individual phases are inaccessible. Although complete privacy - where all other combinations of phases remain entirely hidden - is unattainable for finite squeezing in multi-party settings, it emerges in the large-squeezing limit. We further investigate the impact of displacements and optical losses, revealing trade-offs between estimation accuracy and privacy. Finally, we benchmark the protocol against other continuous-variable resource states.</p>

            <p>Cluster states are multipartite entangled states that are maximally connected and resilient to decoherence, making them valuable resources for quantum information processing. Continuous-variable (CV) cluster states have been extensively investigated for such applications. Here we present a pulsed protocol for generating CV cluster states in a phononic quantum network composed of phonon waveguides, mechanical resonators, and optical cavities. A key feature of this architecture is the modular design, where pairs of mechanical modes act as building blocks with only local, tunable interactions between mechanical and cavity modes. The scheme is scalable, requiring just $4N$ driving tones for $N$ mechanical resonators. We characterize the resulting cluster states by evaluating the nullifiers of the CV modes. We also study the effects of dissipation, showing that strong squeezing with large phonon occupations can degrade the generated cluster states under finite mechanical and optical losses. As a direct application, we demonstrate that distant mechanical modes can be entangled via local measurements.</p>

            <p>The Nonequilibrium Fermi's Golden Rule (NE-FGR) provides a convenient theoretical framework for calculating the charge transfer rate between a photoexcited bright donor electronic state and a dark acceptor electronic state, when the nuclear degrees of freedom start out in a nonequilibrium initial state. In this paper, we show that NE-FGR rates can be significantly modified by placing the molecular system inside an electromagnetic microcavity, even when the coupling with the cavity modes is weak. In this case, cavity-modified NE-FGR rates can also be estimated from the same inputs needed for calculating the cavity-free NE-FGR rates, thereby bypassing the need for an explicit simulation of the molecular system inside the cavity. We also introduce an approximate limit of the cavity-modified NE-FGR, which we denote cavity-modified Instantaneous Marcus Theory, since it is based on the same assumptions underlying Marcus theory. The utility of the proposed framework for calculating cavity-modified NE-FGR rates is demonstrated by applications to photo-induced charge transfer in the carotenoid-porphyrin-C$_{60}$ molecular triad dissolved in liquid tetrahydrofuran and the Garg-Onuchic-Ambegaokar model for charge transfer in the condensed phase.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arley Fl√≥rez L√≥pez, Johan F. Triana, Jos√© Luis Sanz-Vicario</p>
            <p>Molecular polaritons within the mid-infrared regime have emerged as a source for modifying and manipulating molecular and photonic properties. However, the development of new methodologies for photon generation is still a challenge in nanophotonics. We propose a molecular model based on the Holstein-quantum-Rabi Hamiltonian, which also incorporates realistic dipole moments and non-adiabatic couplings among electronic excited states, to study the ultrafast photodynamics of diatomic molecules in confined electromagnetic fields within quantized cavities. In addition to vibronic transitions due to intrinsic non-adiabatic couplings, two types of light-induced crossings emerge: one type is located at molecular nuclear geometries where the rotating wave approximation is fulfilled, and another type appears at different geometries where counter-rotating transitions may occur. We make a comprehensive study of polariton photodynamics within a time window of a few tens of femtoseconds, where dissipative mechanisms do not influence the polariton photodynamics. We stress the dramatic change of the polariton energy spectrum as a function of the Huang-Rhys factor when non-adiabatic couplings are included in the model. We conclude that both the molecular non-adiabatic couplings and, more specifically, the counter-rotating couplings in the cavity-molecule interaction play a crucial role in converting vibronic energy into photons through excited dressed states. We also show that the sign of the Huang-Rhys factor has a significant impact on this photon conversion. Our work paves the way for the development of many-photon generation powered by strong light-matter interaction, along with potential applications using alkaline earth monohydride molecules.</p>

            <h2>Driven-Dissipative Landau Polaritons: Two Highly Nonlinearly-Coupled Quantum Harmonic Oscillators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Farokh Mivehvar</p>
            <p>Landau levels (LLs) are the massively-degenerate discrete energy spectrum of a charged particle in a transverse magnetic field and lie at the heart of many intriguing phenomena such as the integer and fractional quantum Hall effects as well as quantized vortices. In this Letter, we consider coupling of LLs of a transversely driven charge neutral particle in a synthetic gauge potential to a quantized field of an optical cavity -- a setting reminiscent of superradiant self-ordering setups in quantum gases. We uncover that this complex system can be surprisingly described in terms of two highly nonlinearly-coupled quantum harmonic oscillators, thus enabling a full quantum mechanical treatment. Light-matter coupling mixes the LLs and the superradiant photonic mode, leading to the formation of hybrid states referred to as ``Landau polaritons''. They inherit partially the degeneracy of the LLs and possess intriguing features such as non-zero light-matter entanglement and quadrature squeezing. Depending on the system parameters and the choice of initial state, the system exhibits diverse nonequilibrium quantum dynamics and multiple steady states, with distinct physical properties. This work lays the foundation for further investigating the novel, driven-dissipative Landau-polariton physics in quantum-gas--cavity-QED settings.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lu Zhou, Zheng-Chun Li, Keye Zhang, Zhihao Lan, Alessio Celi, Weiping Zhang</p>
            <p>As a novel platform for exploring exotic quantum phenomena, the moir√© lattice has garnered significant interest in solid-state physics, photonics, and cold atom physics. While moir√© lattices in two- and three-dimensional systems have been proposed for neutral cold atoms, the simpler one-dimensional moir√© effect remains largely unexplored. We present a scheme demonstrating moir√© effects in a one-dimensional cold atom-cavity coupling system, which resembles a generalized open Dicke model exhibiting superradiant phase transitions. We reveal a strong link between the phase transition critical point and the one-dimensional moir√© parameter. Evidences of the one-dimensional moir√© effect are explicitly explored, including cavity field spectrum, phase transition dynamics, and anomalous atomic diffusion. This work provides a new route for testing one-dimensional moir√© effects with cold atoms and open new possibility of moir√© metrology.</p>

            <h2>Nonclassical Driven-Dissipative Dynamics in Collective Quantum Optics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alejandro Vivas-Via√±a</p>
            <p>Reduced abstract. This Thesis explores emergent cooperative phenomena in collective light-matter systems. We study ensembles of interacting quantum emitters coherently driven by a laser field and coupled to photonic structures, focusing on the hybrid description of emitters dressed by light. The interplay among quantum emitters, coherent driving, and photonic environments reveals a rich landscape of cooperative effects. While single-emitter dressing has been widely studied, we address collective phenomena in two non-identical emitters modelled as two-level systems. Strong interaction forms a dimer exhibiting superradiant and subradiant states, with two-photon resonances directly connecting ground and doubly excited states. This nonlinear process, central to the Thesis, enables new regimes of cooperative light-matter physics. Analytical studies show how interactions reshape observables such as emission intensity, photon statistics, and spectra, offering implications for quantum metrology. The sensitivity of two-photon processes to emitter distance and driving strength enables high-precision sensing and sub-wavelength imaging. Unexpectedly, we find that off-resonant virtual states may gain population through dissipation, redefining their role in open systems. To capture this, we develop a hierarchical adiabatic elimination method for metastable dynamics. We also analyze entanglement in emitters coupled to a lossy cavity, identifying five mechanisms, including the frequency-resolved Purcell effect introduced here. This selective enhancement stabilizes cooperative states and enables scalable entanglement. Our models, tailored to solid-state platforms such as quantum dots and molecular aggregates, address challenges like inhomogeneous broadening and decoherence, demonstrating the feasibility of harnessing cooperative light-matter effects for quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>With rapid progress being made in the development of platforms for quantum computation, there has been considerable interest in whether present-day and near-term devices can be used to solve problems of relevance. A commonly cited application area is the domain of quantum chemistry. While most experimental demonstrations of quantum chemical calculations on quantum devices have focused on the ground-state electronic energy of the system, other properties of the ground-state, such as the electric dipole moment, are also of interest. Here we employ the quantum computed moments (QCM) method, based on the Lanczos cluster expansion, to estimate the dipole moment of the water molecule on an IBM Quantum superconducting quantum device. The noise-mitigated results agree with full configuration interaction (FCI) calculations to within 0.03 $\pm$ 0.007 debye (2% $\pm$ 0.5%), compared to direct expectation value determination (i.e. VQE) with errors on the order of 0.07 debye (5%), even when the VQE calculation is performed without noise. This demonstrates that moments-based energy estimation techniques can be adapted to noise-robust evaluation of non-energetic ground-state properties of chemical systems.</p>

            <p>The controlled assembly of solid-state spins with nanoscale spatial precision is an outstanding challenge for quantum technology. Here, we combine DNA-based patterning with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) ensemble quantum sensors in diamond to form and sense programmable 2D arrays of spins. We use DNA origami to control the spacing of chelated Gd$^{3+}$ spins, as verified by the observed linear relationship between proximal NVs' relaxation rate, $1/T_1$, and the engineered number of Gd$^{3+}$ spins per origami unit. We further show that DNA origami provides a robust way of functionalizing the diamond surface with spins as it preserves the charge state and spin coherence of proximal, shallow NV centers. Our work enables the formation and interrogation of ordered, strongly interacting spin networks with applications in quantum sensing and quantum simulation. We quantitatively discuss the prospects of entanglement-enhanced metrology and high-throughput proteomics.</p>

            <h2>Practical Routing and Criticality in Large-Scale Quantum Communication Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cillian Harney, Stefano Pirandola</p>
            <p>The efficacy of a communication network hinges upon both its physical architecture and the protocols that are employed within it. In the context of quantum communications, there exists a fundamental rate-loss tradeoff for point-to-point quantum channels such that the rate for distributing entanglement, secret keys, or quantum states decays exponentially with respect to transmission distance. Quantum networks are the solution to overcome point-to-point limitations, but they simultaneously invite a challenging open question: How should quantum networks be designed to effectively and efficiently guarantee high rates? Now that performance and physical topology are inexorably linked, this question is not easy, but the answer is essential for a future quantum internet to be successful. In this work, we offer crucial insight into this open question for complex optical-fiber quantum networks. Using realistic descriptions of quantum networks via random network models and practical end-to-end routing protocols, we reveal critical phenomena associated with large-scale quantum networks. Our work reveals the weaknesses of applying single-path routing protocols within quantum networks, observing an inability to achieve reliable rates over long distances. Adapting novel algorithms for multi-path routing, we employ an efficient and practical multi-path routing algorithm capable of boosting performance while minimizing costly quantum resources.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Meng Qian Wu, Ge Sun, Jing Lu, Lan Zhou</p>
            <p>We consider two two-level quantum emitters (QEs) with separations on the order of the wavelength which are chirally coupled to a one-dimensional (1D) waveguide, and the electromagnetic field of the 1D waveguide has a direction-dependent velocity, which produces two field propagation phases on the dynamics of QEs. Their spontaneous process is examined for QEs having unequal emission rates to the waveguide. It is found that radiation could be enhanced for both QEs, inhibited for both QEs, enhanced for one while inhibited for the other, completely suppressed for both QEs. In particular, the mechanism for radiation completely suppressed is the presence of a QE-photon bound state.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhouyang Yu, Jinping Xu, Chengjie Zhu, Zhengyang Bai, Yaping Yang</p>
            <p>Weinvestigate the generation of antibunching photons and photon pairs in a two-atom cavity QED system leveraging interatomic van der Waals (vdW) interaction. We show that the vdW interaction shifts the two-atom excited state, enabling the suppression of two-photon excitation via destructive interference in a diamond configuration. This leads to antibunching photon emission with extremely high purity. Furthermore, by tuning the vdW interaction strength, the conditions for conventional and unconventional photon blockades can overlap, significantly enhancing single-photon emission. Conversely, at the antiblockade excitation frequency, quantum Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the feasibility of generating antibunching photon pairs with a high purity and reasonable leaking rate by selecting appropriate driving field Rabi frequency and vdW interaction strength. These f indings on enhanced single/two-photon emission could lead to more efficient and brighter quantum light sources.</p>

            <p>Quantum dot single-photon sources are promising for quantum communication. Yet, the most advanced devices operate near 900 nm, where standard single-mode fibers experience significant losses. We address this by employing a hollow-core fiber engineered for low-loss transmission at quantum dot wavelengths, with measured loss of 0.65 dB/km and potentially as low as 0.12 dB/km near 934 nm. The fiber also supports strong classical signals at 1550 nm without adding Raman noise. Using this platform, we transmit all four BB84 polarization states from an InAs quantum dot over 340 m with 0.1% QBER, preserving single-photon purity and indistinguishability even in the presence of a strong classical signal. These results highlight how tailored transmission media enable quantum networks beyond the limits of standard telecom fibers.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Noise Tomography with Physics-Informed Neural Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Antonin Sulc</p>
            <p>Characterizing the environmental interactions of quantum systems is a critical bottleneck in the development of robust quantum technologies. Traditional tomographic methods are often data-intensive and struggle with scalability. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for performing Lindblad tomography using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). By embedding the Lindblad master equation directly into the neural network's loss function, our approach simultaneously learns the quantum state's evolution and infers the underlying dissipation parameters from sparse, time-series measurement data. Our results show that PINNs can reconstruct both the system dynamics and the functional form of unknown noise parameters, presenting a sample-efficient and scalable solution for quantum device characterization. Ultimately, our method produces a fully-differentiable digital twin of a noisy quantum system by learning its governing master equation.</p>

            <p>Quantum reservoir computing has emerged as a promising paradigm for harnessing quantum systems to process temporal data efficiently by bypassing the costly training of gradient-based learning methods. Here, we demonstrate the capability of this approach to predict and characterize chaotic dynamics in discrete nonlinear maps, exemplified through the logistic and H√©non maps. While achieving excellent predictive accuracy, we also demonstrate the optimization of training hyperparameters of the quantum reservoir based on the properties of the underlying map, thus paving the way for efficient forecasting with other discrete and continuous time-series data. Furthermore, the framework exhibits robustness against decoherence when trained in situ and shows insensitivity to reservoir Hamiltonian variations. These results highlight quantum reservoir computing as a scalable and noise-resilient tool for modeling complex dynamical systems, with immediate applicability in near-term quantum hardware.</p>

            <h2>A new characterization of the holographic entropy cone</h2>

            <p>Entanglement entropies computed using the holographic Ryu-Takayanagi formula are known to obey an infinite set of linear inequalities, which define the so-called RT entropy cone. The general structure of this cone, or equivalently the set of all valid inequalities, is unknown. It is also unknown whether those same inequalities are also obeyed by entropies computed using the covariant Hubeny-Rangamani-Takayanagi formula, although significant evidence has accumulated that they are. Using Markov states, we develop a test of this conjecture in a heretofore unexplored regime. The test reduces to checking that a given inequality obeys a certain majorization property, which is easy to evaluate. We find that the RT inequalities pass this test and, surprisingly, only RT inequalities do so. Our results not only provide strong new evidence that the HRT and RT cones coincide, but also offer a completely new characterization of that cone.</p>

We use superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) and large-area NIR avalanche photodiodes (APDs) to maximize the time resolution ($\sim$70 ps) and emission count rates ($\sim$2000 cps). To our knowledge, these results represent the first demonstration of HED in the solid state and establish NIR QDs as a bright, tunable model system with longer-lived coherences and integrability with optical cavities as an additional experimental control knob.</p>

This experiment would probe unexplored ranges of the possible couplings of bosonic ultralight dark matter (ULDM) to atomic constituents and undertake a pioneering search for gravitational waves (GWs) at frequencies intermediate between those to which existing and planned experiments are sensitive, among other fundamental physics studies. A conceptual feasibility study showed that this AI experiment could be isolated from the LHC by installing a shielding wall in the TX46 gallery, and surveyed issues related to the proximity of the LHC machine, finding no technical obstacles. A detailed technical implementation study has shown that the preparatory civil-engineering work, installation of bespoke radiation shielding, deployment of access-control systems and safety alarms, and installation of an elevator platform could be carried out during LS3, allowing installation and operation of the detector to proceed during Run 4 without impacting HL-LHC operation. These studies have established that PX46 is a uniquely promising location for an AI experiment.

            <p>Neutral atom quantum computing's great scaling potential has resulted in it emerging as a popular modality in recent years. For state preparation, atoms are loaded stochastically and have to be detected and rearranged at runtime to create a predetermined initial configuration for circuit execution. Such rearrangement schemes either suffer from low parallelizability for acousto-optic deflector (AOD)-based approaches or are comparatively slow in case of spatial light modulators (SLMs). In our work, we introduce an algorithm that can improve the parallelizability of the former. Since the transfer of atoms from static SLM traps to AOD-generated movable traps is detrimental both in terms of atom loss rates and execution time, our approach is based on highly-parallel composite moves where many atoms are picked up simultaneously and maneuvered into target positions that may be comparatively distant. We see that our algorithm outperforms its alternatives for near-term devices with up to around 1000 qubits and has the potential to scale up to several thousand with further optimizations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chenyi Zhang, Tao Shang, Xueyi Guo, Yuanjing Zhang</p>
            <p>With the rapid advancement of quantum computing, quantum compilation has become a crucial layer connecting high-level algorithms with physical hardware. In quantum cloud computing, compilation is performed on the cloud platforms, which expose user circuits to potential risks such as structural leakage and output predictability. To address these issues, we propose the encrypted-state quantum compilation scheme based on quantum circuit obfuscation (ECQCO), the first secure compilation scheme tailored for the co-location of compilers and quantum hardware for quantum cloud platforms. It applies quantum homomorphic encryption to conceal output states and instantiates a structure obfuscation mechanism based on quantum indistinguishability obfuscation, effectively protecting both functionality and topology of the circuit. Additionally, an adaptive decoupling obfuscation algorithm is designed to suppress potential idle errors while inserting pulse operations. The proposed scheme achieves information-theoretic security and guarantees computational indistinguishability under the quantum random oracle model. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that ECQCO achieves a total variation distance (TVD) of up to 0.7 and a normalized graph edit distance (GED) of 0.88, enhancing compilation-stage security. Moreover, it introduces only a slight increase in circuit depth, while keeping the average fidelity change within 1\%, thus achieving a practical balance between security and efficiency.</p>

In particular, we study a photon interference-based scheme with feedback which can achieve success probabilities above 50%, and use the photon-count decomposition method to perform the first analytical calculations of its entanglement fidelity and efficiency while accounting for imperfections. We also calculate the fidelity and efficiency of the other schemes. Finally, we compare the performance of all the schemes, considering current and near-future experimental capabilities.

Our construction is a variation of the Feynman-Kitaev clock -- a well-known mapping between quantum circuits and local Hamiltonians -- where the clock register is given periodic boundary conditions. Assuming the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) holds for the input circuit, our construction yields Hamiltonians whose eigenstates have properties characteristic of infinite temperature, like volume-law entanglement entropy, across the whole spectrum -- including the ground state. We then construct a family of exactly solvable Floquet quantum circuits whose eigenstates are shown to obey the ETH at infinite temperature. Combining the two constructions yields a new family of local Hamiltonians with provably volume-law-entangled ground states, and the first such construction where the volume law holds for all contiguous subsystems.</p>

An efficient population transfer through the b-state at room temperature is demonstrated despite relatively long relaxation times. It is also demonstrated that, in case of large one-photon detuning, the so-called b-state has the same lifetime as that of the dark state. The evolution of adiabatic states for arbitrary values of single-photon detunings has been studied numerically.</p>

            <p>Stationary scattering of TE and TM waves propagating in an isotropic medium with planar symmetry is described by Bergmann's equation in one dimension. This is a generalization of Helmholtz equation which allows for developing transfer matrix methods to deal with the corresponding scattering problems. We use a dynamical formulation of stationary scattering to study the low-frequency scattering of these waves when the inhomogeneities of the medium causing the scattering are confined to a planar slab. This formulation relies on the construction of an effective two-level non-Hermitian quantum system whose time-evolution operator determines the transfer matrix. We use it to construct the low-frequency expansions of the transfer matrix and the reflection and transmission coefficients of the medium, introduce a generalization of Brewster's angle for inhomogeneous slabs at low frequencies, and derive analytic conditions for transparency and reflectionlessness of PT-symmetric and non-PT-symmetric slabs at these frequencies. We also discuss the application of this method to deal with the low-frequency scattering of TE and TM waves when the carrier medium occupies a half-space and the waves satisfy boundary conditions with planar symmetry at the boundary of the half-space. Because acoustic waves propagating in a compressible fluid with planar symmetry are also described by Bergmann's equation, our results apply to the low-frequency scattering of these waves.</p>

            <h2>Optimal Waveforms for Dipole Moment Estimation with Coherent States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Karthik Chinni, Nicol√°s Quesada</p>
            <p>We investigate quantum sensing for spectroscopy in a system consisting of a two-level atom coupled to a continuum of modes. We focus on optimizing the pulse shape of a coherent state to maximize the quantum Fisher information (QFI) of the emitted light with the aim of estimating the atom's dipole moment, which is proportional to its spontaneous emission rate. To achieve this, we derive a set of coupled differential equations, which include the standard optical Bloch equations as a subset and whose solution directly yields the QFI of the emitted light without resorting to finite-difference methods. Furthermore, we analyze the factors that govern its optimization, provide analytic solutions in both the long and the short pulse width limits, and examine the role of the average photon number of the pulses. We then show that under the closed (periodic) boundary conditions, the harmonic (plane-wave) with frequency equal to half the spontaneous emission rate and a phase determined by detuning are optimal in the long pulse width limit.</p>

            <h2>No oscillating subradiant correlations in a strongly driven quantum emitter array</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiaming Shi, Nikita Leppenen, Ran Tessler, Alexander N. Poddubny</p>
            <p>We theoretically study time-dependent correlations in a strongly driven array of $N$ two-level atoms, coupled to photons in a waveguide. We focus on the spectrum $\{\lambda\}$ of the Liouvillian superoperator, which determines the correlation decay rates $-\Re \lambda$ and the frequencies $\Im\lambda$. Our main finding is the suppression of subradiant oscillating correlations between atomic states by a strong coherent of amplitude $\Omega$: $|\Re \lambda|\ge m\gamma/2$, where $\gamma$ is the single-atom spontaneous decay rate and $m=|\Im \lambda/(2\Omega)|$ is a nonzero integer for correlations oscillating in time $\propto \exp(\pm 2i m|\Omega| t)$. This limit is independent of the number of atoms $N$; it holds both for small arrays and in the macroscopic limit. We demonstrate the suppression of subradiance numerically and provide a rigorous proof based on the analytical decomposition of the Liouvillian using spectral theory of simplicial complexes and posets.</p>

            <h2>Bistability of optical properties of cesium vapor due to collective interaction of alignment and orientation under strong spin exchange conditions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M.V. Petrenko, A.K. Vershovskii</p>
            <p>Hydrogen-like alkali atoms with a single valence electron are the most common objects in quantum optics and, at the same time, serve as essential tools of the field. Under conditions of optical pumping, strong spin-exchange and ultra-weak magnetic field (spin-exchange relaxation free mode, SERF), ensembles of such atoms in the gas phase can demonstrate not only the absence of spin-exchange relaxation, but also nonlinear collective effects. We present experimental evidence that the alignment, i.e. the quadrupole momentum, can not only be preserved under SERF conditions, but also coexist and interact with the orientation, i.e. the dipole momentum. We also show that this interaction leads to bistability: a small change in conditions can cause the medium to transition to a different steady state, an effect characterized by hysteresis. The combination of properties of this effect opens up a wide range of applications as optical keys or memory elements with a storage time of hundreds of seconds in tasks of quantum information and cryptography.</p>

            <h2>Density-Functional Tight Binding Meets Maxwell: Unraveling the Mysteries of (Strong) Light-Matter Coupling Efficiently</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dominik Sidler, Carlos M. Bustamante, Franco P. Bonafe, Michael Ruggenthaler, Maxim Sukharev, Angel Rubio</p>
            <p>Controlling chemical and material properties through strong light-matter coupling in optical cavities has gained considerable attention over the past decade. However, the underlying mechanisms remain insufficiently understood, and a significant gap persists between experimental observations and theoretical descriptions. This challenge arises from the intrinsically multi-scale nature of the problem, where non-perturbative feedback occurs across different spatial and temporal scales. Collective coupling between a macroscopic ensemble of molecules and a photonic environment, such as Fabry-Perot cavity, can strongly influence the microscopic properties of individual molecules, while microscopic details of the ensemble in turn affect the macroscopic coupling. To address this complexity, we present an efficient computational framework that combines density-functional tight binding (DFTB) with finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations for Maxwell's equations (DFTB+Maxwell). This approach allows for a self-consistent treatment of both the cavity and microscopic details of the molecular ensemble. We demonstrate the potential for this method by tackling several open questions. First, we calculate non-perturbatively two-dimensional spectroscopic observable that directly connect to well-established experimental protocols. Second, we provide local, molecule-resolved information within collectively coupled ensembles, which is difficult to obtain experimentally. Third, we show how cavity designs can be optimized to target specific microscopic applications. Finally, we outline future directions to enhance the predictive power of this framework, including extension to finite temperature, condensed phases, and correlated quantum effects.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Dissipative Continuous Time Crystals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Felix Russo, Thomas Pohl</p>
            <p>Continuous time crystals, i.e., nonequilibrium phases with a spontaneously broken continuous time-translational symmetry, have been studied and recently observed in the long-time dynamics of open quantum systems. Here, we investigate a lattice of interacting three-level particles and find two distinct time-crystal phases that cannot be described within mean-field theory. Remarkably, one of them emerges only in the presence of correlations, upon accounting for beyond-mean-field effects. Our findings extend explorations of continuous time-translational symmetry breaking in dissipative systems beyond the classical phenomenology of periodic orbits in a low-dimensional nonlinear system. The proposed model applies directly to the laser-driven dynamics of interacting Rydberg states in neutral atom arrays and suggests that the predicted time-crystal phases are observable in such experiments.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Entanglement Generation in the Heterometallic Ni$^\text{2+}_4$Gd$_4^\text{3+}$ Complexes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hamid Arian Zad, Michal Ja≈°ƒçur, Azam Zoshki, Ralph Kenna, Nerses Ananikian</p>
            <p>We investigate various types of quantum entanglement in the octanuclear heterometallic $3d/4f$ complexes denoted as Ni$^{2+}_4$Gd$^{3+}_4$ under an external magnetic field, using the exact diagonalization approach. These molecular magnets, which can be effectively described by Heisenberg spin models, consist of two identical $\{\text{Ni}^{2+}_2\text{Gd}^{3+}_2\}$ cubane subunits bridged by acetate and hydroxide ligands. Our analysis reveals that their magnetization exhibits intermediate plateaus at low temperatures, indicating distinct ground states characteristic of Ni-containing compounds. Using negativity as a measure of quantum entanglement, we examine the influence of single-ion anisotropy and magnetic field on tetrapartite, bipartite, 1$-$3 tangle, and 2$-$2 tangle entanglements in two families of Ni$^{2+}_4$Gd$^{3+}_4$ complexes: $\boldsymbol{(1)}$ without anisotropy and $\boldsymbol{(2)}$ with anisotropy. Complex $\boldsymbol{(1)}$ exhibits strong bipartite entanglement between Ni ions, which persists up to $T \approx 3.0\,\text{K}$ and $B \approx 4.0\,\text{T}$, but shows significantly weaker tetrapartite entanglement and vanishing bipartite entanglement between Gd$\cdots$Gd and Ni$\cdots$Gd pairs. In contrast, complex $\boldsymbol{(2)}$ displays nonzero and sizable values for all types of entanglement considered. These findings emphasis the crucial role of single-ion anisotropy in generating and shaping the entanglement landscape of heterometallic Ni$^{2+}_4$Gd$^{3+}_4$ complexes. Notably, we find that the 1$-$3 tangle entanglement between a Ni ion and the remaining sites in a cubane unit serves as a reliable indicator of ground-state phase transitions, exhibiting distinct changes across phase boundaries irrespective of the presence of single-ion anisotropy.</p>

            <p>Measurements are essential for the processing and protection of information in quantum computers. They can also induce long-range entanglement between unmeasured qubits. However, when post-measurement states depend on many non-deterministic measurement outcomes, there is a barrier to observing and using the entanglement induced by prior measurements. Here we demonstrate a new approach for detecting such measurement-induced entanglement. We create short-range entangled states of one- and two-dimensional arrays of qubits in a superconducting quantum processor, and aim to characterize the long-range entanglement induced between distant pairs of qubits when we measure all of the others. To do this we use unsupervised training of neural networks on observations to create computational models for post-measurement states and, by correlating these models with experimental data, we reveal measurement-induced entanglement. Our results additionally demonstrate a transition in the ability of a classical agent to accurately model the experimental data; this is closely related to a measurement-induced phase transition. We anticipate that our work can act as a basis for future experiments on quantum error correction and more general problems in quantum control.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rahul Arvind, Nikhil Bansal, Dax Enshan Koh, Tobias Haug, Kishor Bharti</p>
            <p>In adversarial settings, where attackers can deliberately and strategically corrupt quantum data, standard quantum error correction reaches its limits. It can only correct up to half the code distance and must output a unique answer. Quantum list decoding offers a promising alternative. By allowing the decoder to output a short list of possible errors, it becomes possible to tolerate far more errors, even under worst-case noise. But two fundamental questions remain: which quantum codes support list decoding, and can we design decoding schemes that are secure against efficient, computationally bounded adversaries? In this work, we answer both. To identify which codes are list-decodable, we provide a generalized version of the Knill-Laflamme conditions. Then, using tools from quantum cryptography, we build an unambiguous list decoding protocol based on pseudorandom unitaries. Our scheme is secure against any quantum polynomial-time adversary, even across multiple decoding attempts, in contrast to previous schemes. Our approach connects coding theory with complexity-based quantum cryptography, paving the way for secure quantum information processing in adversarial settings.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kaiyuan Ji, Seth Lloyd, Mark M. Wilde</p>
            <p>We study the capacity of a quantum channel for retrocausal communication, where messages are transmitted backward in time, from a sender in the future to a receiver in the past, through a noisy postselected closed timelike curve (P-CTC) represented by the channel. We completely characterize the one-shot retrocausal quantum and classical capacities of a quantum channel, and we show that the corresponding asymptotic capacities are equal to the average and sum, respectively, of the channel's max-information and its regularized Doeblin information. This endows these information measures with a novel operational interpretation. Furthermore, our characterization can be generalized beyond quantum channels to all completely positive maps. This imposes information-theoretic limits on transmitting messages via postselected-teleportation-like mechanisms with arbitrary initial- and final-state boundary conditions, including those considered in various black-hole final-state models.</p>

            <p>Quantum sensing with solid-state spin defects has transformed nanoscale metrology, offering sub-wavelength spatial resolution with exceptional sensitivity to multiple signal types. Maximizing these advantages requires minimizing both the sensor-target separation and detectable signalthreshold. However, leading platforms such as nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond suffer performance degradation near surfaces or in nanoscale volumes, motivating the search for optically addressable spin sensors in atomically thin, two-dimensional (2D) materials. Here, we present an experimental framework to probe a novel 2D spin ensemble, including its Hamiltonian, coherent sensing dynamics, and noise environment. Using a central spin system in a 2D hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) crystal, we fully map the hyperfine interactions with proximal nuclear spins, demonstrate programmable switching between magnetic and electric sensing, and introduce a robust method for reconstructing the environmental noise spectrum explicitly accounting for quantum control imperfections. We achieve a record coherence time of 80 $\mu$s and nanotesla-level AC magnetic sensitivity at a 10 nm target distance, reaching the threshold for detecting a single nuclear spin in nanoscale spectroscopy. Leveraging the broad opportunities for defect engineering in atomically thin hosts, these results lay the foundation for next-generation quantum sensors with ultrahigh sensitivity, tunable noise selectivity, and versatile quantum functionalities.</p>

            <h2>Exploring Photon Blockade in Multimode Jaynes-Cummings Models with Two-Photon Dissipation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Caden McCollum, Imran M. Mirza</p>
            <p>The photon blockade phenomenon, a promising tool for realizing efficient single-photon sources, is the central focus of our work. We study this phenomenon within the context of the multimode extension of the Jaynes-Cummings model, incorporating two-photon dissipation and external coherent driving. Operating in the weak-driving regime, we confine our analysis to the two-excitation sector of the Hilbert space, initially exploring the single-mode case and then focusing on the corresponding multimode problem. Our study calculates the second-order correlation function (both numerically and analytically) for zero- and nonzero time delays in single- and multimode cases, to pinpoint and validate the conditions that lead to conventional and unconventional photon blockade. Our zero delay findings reveal that photon antibunching is comparable in both cases; however, the multimode case offers a greater degree of control and applicability. Furthermore, for non-zero delay operation, we find that when one of the multiple modes is set at the optimal conventional photon blockade conditions, the behavior of the curve mimics the single-mode problem with an overall slower rate of reaching the $g^{(2)}(\tau)=1$ value. These results highlight the practical implications of our findings for building useful single-photon sources.</p>

            <p>We investigate quantum emitters (QEs) interacting with a photonic structured bath made of bilayer square lattices, where the resonance anti-crossing between the energy bands opens a symmetric middle energy gap. Due to the intrinsic chiral symmetry of the bath and interactions with the square-like band-edges, the QE-photon dressed states generated in this inner bandgap are odd-neighbor, robust, and anisotropic, when the emitters' transition frequencies lie in the middle of the bandgap. We also use giant artificial atoms to engineer and modify the dressed states' patterns. Exotic bound states can lead to spin models with symmetry protection, resulting in fascinating many-body phases. As an example, we show that this proposal can be used to generate both edge states and corner states in the generalized 2D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. This work opens up new avenues for research into innovative quantum many-body physics and quantum simulations with photonic or phononic multilayer structures.</p>

            <p>Chaos is a fundamental phenomenon in nonlinear dynamics, manifesting as irregular and unpredictable behavior across various physical systems. Among the diverse routes to chaos, intermittent chaos is a distinct transition pathway, characterized by the temporal or spatial alternation between periodic and chaotic motions. Here, we experimentally demonstrate, for the first time, optomechanically induced intermittent chaos in an optical whispering-gallery-mode microresonator. Specifically, the system evolves from stable periodic oscillation through an intermittent-chaos regime before fully developing into chaotic motion. As system parameters vary, the proportion of chaotic motion in the time-domain increases asymptotically until chaotic dynamics dominates entirely. Moreover, it is counterintuitive that, intermittent chaos can act as noise of a favorable intensity compared with purely periodic or fully chaotic states, and enhance rather than reduce system's responses in nonlinear ultrasonic detection. These findings not only deepen the comprehensive understanding of chaos formation but also broaden its potential applications in high-precision sensing and information processing.</p>

Specifically, we combine the generation of event-ready remote quantum entanglement, photon mode erasure that hides the "which-path" information of temporally and spatially separated incoming optical modes, and non-local, non-destructive photon heralding enabled by remote entanglement to perform a proof-of-concept entanglement-assisted differential phase measurement of weak incident light between two spatially separate stations. Demonstrating successful operation of the remote phase sensing protocol with a fiber link baseline up to 1.55 km, our results open the door for a new class of quantum enhanced imaging applications.</p>

Conventional imaging techniques, constrained to integrating over detected signals and classical post-processing, are limited in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) from shot noise accumulation in the post-processing algorithms.

As a specific example, we develop a quantum algorithm for imaging unresolved point sources and apply it to exoplanet detection.

            <p>Quantum emitters operating at telecom wavelengths are essential for the advancement of quantum technologies, particularly in the development of integrated on-chip devices for quantum computing, communication, and sensing. Coupling resonant structures to a near-zero-index (NZI) environment has been shown to enhance their optical performance by both increasing spontaneous emission rates and improving emission directionality. In this work, we comparatively study emission characteristics of colloidal PbS/CdS (core/shell) quantum dots at telecom wavelengths on different substrates, where two different sets of quantum dots emitting within and outside the epsilon-near-zero region are deposited on both glass and indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates. Our results demonstrate that coupling quantum dots to the epsilon-near-zero spectral region results in a reduction of photoluminescence lifetime of 54~times, a 7.5-fold increase in saturation intensity, and a relative emission cone narrowing from 17.6¬∞ to 10.3¬∞. These results underline the strong dependence of quantum dot emission properties on the spectral overlap with the epsilon-near-zero condition, highlighting the potential of transparent conducting oxides (TCOs), such as ITO, for integration into next-generation quantum photonic devices. Due to their CMOS compatibility, fabrication tunability, and high thermal and optical damage thresholds, TCO NZI materials offer a robust platform for scalable and high-performance quantum optical systems operating within the telecom bandwidth.</p>

            <p>We experimentally and theoretically study collective emission of a dense atomic ensemble coupled to a single mode in a nanophotonic microring resonator. Because many cold atoms are localized in a small volume, these trapped atoms collectively couple not only to the guided resonator mode but also to the nonguided modes in free space. Through tuning the atom-photon coupling and by adjusting the number of trapped atoms, we demonstrate superradiant emission to the microring resonator. For photon emission via the nonguided modes, our study reveals signatures of subradiance and superradiance when the system is driven to the steady state and to the timed-Dicke state, respectively. Our experimental platform thus presents the first atom-light interface with selective collective emission behavior into a guided mode and the environment. Our observation and methodology could shed light on future explorations of collective emission with densely packed quantum emitters coupled to nanophotonic light-matter interfaces.</p>

            <p>One of the hallmarks of topological quantum systems is the robust quantization of particle transport, which is the origin of the integer-valued Quantum Hall conductivity. In the presence of interactions the topological transport can also become fractional. Recent experiments on topological pumps constructed by arrays of photonic waveguides have demonstrated both integer and fractional transport of lattice solitons. Here a background medium mediates interactions between photons via a Kerr nonlinearity and leads to the formation of self-bound composites, called lattice solitons. Upon increasing the interaction strength of these solitons a sequence of transitions was observed from a phase with integer transport in a pump cycle through different phases of fractional transport to a phase with no transport. We here present a full quantum description of topological pumps of solitons. This approach allows us to identify a topological invariant, a many-body Chern number, determined by the band structure of the center-of-mass (COM) momentum of the solitons, which fully governs their transport. Increasing the interaction leads to a successive merging of COM bands which explains the observed sequence of topological phase transitions and also the potential for a breakdown of topological quantization for intermediate interaction strength.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement Asymmetry and Quantum Mpemba Effect for Non-Abelian Global Symmetry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Harunobu Fujimura, Soichiro Shimamori</p>
            <p>Entanglement asymmetry is a measure that quantifies the degree of symmetry breaking at the level of a subsystem. In this work, we investigate the entanglement asymmetry in $\widehat{su}(N)_k$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model and discuss the quantum Mpemba effect for SU$(N)$ symmetry, the phenomenon that the more symmetry is initially broken, the faster it is restored. Due to the Coleman-Mermin-Wagner theorem, spontaneous breaking of continuous global symmetries is forbidden in $1+1$ dimensions. To circumvent this no-go theorem, we consider excited initial states which explicitly break non-Abelian global symmetry. We particularly focus on the initial states built from primary operators in the fundamental and adjoint representations. In both cases, we study the real-time dynamics of the R√©nyi entanglement asymmetry and provide clear evidence of quantum Mpemba effect for SU$(N)$ symmetry. Furthermore, we find a new type of quantum Mpemba effect for the primary operator in the fundamental representation: increasing the rank $N$ leads to stronger initial symmetry breaking but faster symmetry restoration. Also, increasing the level $k$ leads to weaker initial symmetry breaking but slower symmetry restoration. On the other hand, no such behavior is observed for adjoint case, which may suggest that this new type of quantum Mpemba effect is not universal.</p>

            <p>We introduce random-LCHS, a circuit-efficient randomized-compilation framework for simulating linear non-unitary dynamics of the form $\partial_t u(t) = -A(t) u(t) + b(t)$ built on the linear combination of Hamiltonian simulation (LCHS). We propose three related settings: the general random-LCHS for time-dependent inhomogeneous linear dynamics; the observable-driven random-LCHS, which targets estimation of an observable's expectation at the final time; and the symmetric random-LCHS, a time-independent, homogeneous reduction that can exploit physical symmetries. Our contributions are threefold: first, by randomizing the outer linear-combination-of-unitaries (LCU) layer as well as the deterministic inner Hamiltonian simulation layer, random-LCHS attains favorable resource overheads in the circuit design for early fault-tolerant devices; second, the observable-driven variant employs an unbiased Monte-Carlo estimator to target expectation values directly, reducing sample complexity; and third, integrating the physical symmetry in the model with the sampling scheme yields further empirical improvements, demonstrating tighter error bounds in realistic numerics. We illustrate these techniques with theoretical guarantees as well as numerical verifications and discuss implementation trade-offs for near-term quantum hardware.</p>

Surprisingly, a finite (parameters dependent) asymmetry appears only when boundary conditions break the duality, and emerges as well in the transverse-field Ising chain, which lacks topological order. These results show that magic is unable to detect topological phases, indicating that either an additional resource is required to capture their unique quantum contribution, or that not all forms of long-range entanglement constitute a genuine computational resource.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pavel Sekatski, Yelena Guryanova, Naga Bhavya Teja Kothakonda, Michalis Skotiniotis</p>
            <p>We consider the problem of deterministically cloning quantum channels with respect to the best attainable rate and the highest quality, so-called optimal cloning. We demonstrate that cloning quantum states is, in-fact, equivalent to cloning the trash-and-replace channel and therefore the former is a special case of the more general problem. By appealing to higher-order quantum operations (quantum processes) we construct a unified framework to deal with the most general cloning tasks and establish necessary conditions for a family of channels to exhibit super-replication -- a quadratic cloning rate with vanishing error. We find that noisy phase-gate channels satisfy these conditions, and we construct the explicit super-replicating process for the task. Conversely, we find that the criteria are not met by the full set of noisy unitary gates; classical noise channels; or amplitude damping channels, whose respective cloning rates are at most linear. In this paradigm, we not only derive new results, but also refigure known ones. We derive a strong converse for state cloning, and for unitary channels we construct an alternative super-replication process to that of D√ºr et al. [PRL 114, 120503 (2015)] and Chiribella et al. [PRL 114, 120504 (2015)] based on a measure-and-prepare process, which allows us to establish a direct connection between optimal channel cloning and Bayesian channel estimation. Finally we give an SDP algorithm to search for optimal cloning processes and study the advantage of coherent vs measure-and-prepare protocols on concrete examples.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Felix Fritzsch, Gabriel O. Alves, Michael A. Rampp, Pieter W. Claeys</p>
            <p>Out-of-time-order correlation functions (OTOCs) and their higher-order generalizations present important probes of quantum information dynamics and scrambling. We introduce a solvable many-body quantum model, which we term boundary scrambling, for which the full dynamics of higher-order OTOCs is analytically tractable. These dynamics support a decomposition into free cumulants and unify recent extensions of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis with predictions from random quantum circuit models. We obtain exact expressions for (higher-order) correlations between matrix elements and show these to be stable away from the solvable point. The solvability is enabled by the identification of a higher-order Markovian influence matrix, capturing the effect of the full system on a local subsystem. These results provide insight into the emergence of random-matrix behavior from structured Floquet dynamics and show how techniques from free probability can be applied in the construction of exactly-solvable many-body models.</p>

            <p>We report an innovative model for predicting entanglement distribution between end parties of a quantum network using our in-house simulation algorithm. Our implementation is based on stochastic methods that are built upon a unique global and local clock system for monitoring expectations with finite quantum memory (QM) parameters. This allows us to tabulate rates with independently operating quantum repeater nodes in a distribution chain. The numerical simulations presented utilize a stochastic modeling of QM efficiency and storage lifetime. The findings presented reveal the translation of the effects of QM lifetime on the spread of time needed for successful entanglement distribution between end parties. Our model based on this transformative clock scheme will make an impactful addition to quantum network simulators platforms.</p>

            <p>Distributed quantum sensing exploits entanglement to enhance the estimation of multiple parameters across a network of spatially-separated sensors, achieving sensitivities beyond the classical limit. Potential applications cover a plethora of technologies, from precision navigation to biomedical imaging and environmental monitoring. However, practical implementations are challenged by the complex optimal distribution of entanglement throughout the sensing nodes, which affects scalability and robustness. Here we demonstrate a reconfigurable network of Mach-Zehnder interferometers entangled via a single shared squeezed-vacuum resource. We achieve joint noise suppression of $4.36 \pm 0.35$ dB below the standard quantum limit at the phase-uncertainty level of $10^{-9}$ . Furthermore, after full optimization in the low-intensity regime, we demonstrate a crossover from the standard quantum limit to the Heisenberg limit. The network estimates arbitrary linear combinations of phases, saturates the quantum Cramer-Rao bound in the ideal case, remains robust under realistic photon losses, and scales favorably with the number of sensors.</p>

            <p>A distributed network architecture in which flying photons connect individual modules containing stationary atomic qubits is a promising approach for scaling up neutral-atom based quantum-computing platforms. We consider an all-fiber based platform consisting of nanofiber cavity QED systems interconnected via conventional optical fibers. Each nanofiber cavity is strongly coupled to multiple atoms through its evanescent field, and atom pairs within one cavity (local) or two distant cavities (remote) are addressed for performing photon-mediated quantum logic gates on them by controlling the effective light-matter coupling via local AC Stark shifts and atom-fiber distance. We numerically evaluate the required parameters for achieving nearly crosstalk-free gate operation using these targeting methods by calculating average gate fidelities, success probabilities, and Pauli error rates for both local and remote controlled-Z gates. For the case of perfect addressing, we also analytically determine the theoretical optimum gate performance as limited by cavity reflectivity, cooperativity, and qubit level-splitting.</p>

            <p>Topological materials hold great promise for developing next-generation devices with transport properties that remain resilient in the presence of local imperfections. However, their susceptibility to thermal noise has posed a major challenge. In particular, the Haldane model, a cornerstone in topological physics, generally requires cryogenic temperatures for experimental realization, limiting both the investigation of topologically robust quantum phenomena and their practical applications. In this work, we demonstrate a room-temperature realization of the Haldane model using atomic ensembles in momentum-space superradiance lattices, a platform intrinsically resistant to thermal noise. The topological phase transition is revealed through the superradiant emission contrast between two timed Dicke states in the lattice. Crucially, the thermal resilience of this platform allows us to access a deep modulation regime, where topological transitions to high Chern number phases emerge -- going beyond the traditional Haldane model. Our results not only deepen the understanding of exotic topological phases, but also offer a robust, reconfigurable, and room-temperature-compatible platform that connects quantum simulation to real-world quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>Having multiple Bell pairs shared by distant quantum registers provides a key resource for both quantum networks and distributed quantum computing. In this paper, we present a protocol for parallelized Bell-pair generation that uses the phase of a coherent light pulse to encode a qudit, enabling the simultaneous generation of multiple Bell pairs. By encoding a qudit in a basis of light-matter Schr√∂dinger's cat states, the loss of a photon in transit can be detected through an $XX$ parity syndrome, allowing the backaction due to the lost photon to be deterministically corrected through single-qubit rotations.

We find a canonical transformation that allows one to obtain the spectrum of the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ Rabi model using perturbation theory in a magnetic field. We show that in a certain parameter regime (deep-strong-coupling and a small magnetic field) the three lowest eigenstates become $\mathbb{Z}_3$ qutrit-boson cat states. In order to characterize these states we introduce a joint qutrit-boson Wigner function and derive its closed-form expression for the qutrit-boson cat states. Numerical calculations across a wide range of coupling strengths show that the proposed Wigner function is a useful tool that allows one to unambiguously identify the $\mathbb{Z}_{3}$ qutrit-boson cat states.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ravishankar Ramanathan, Yuan Liu, Yutian Wu, Stefano Pironio</p>
            <p>Recently it has been found that there exist maximally nonlocal quantum correlations that fail to certify randomness for any fixed input pair, rendering them useless for device-independent spot-checking randomness expansion schemes. Here we show that conversely, in DI randomness amplification protocols where all input pairs are used for randomness generation, any amount of quantum nonlocality is sufficient to certify randomness. This shows that no bound randomness exists in quantum nonlocality - any quantum nonlocal behavior is useful in a DI randomness generation task with appropriate modification of protocol structure. Secondly, we show that in contrast to the hitherto considered fixed-input guessing probability, the average guessing probability over all inputs is a faithful and monotonic measure of nonlocality. We use the average guessing probability to show that in contrast to findings in PRL 134, 090201, the detection efficiency threshold for randomness generation is never lower than that for nonlocality detection. Finally, we analytically compute the average guessing probability by a quantum adversary of a single player's measurement outputs in a standard CHSH Bell test, and use it to demonstrate an improvement in the generation rate in state-of-art amplification protocols.</p>

            <p>Quantum state purification, which mitigates noise by exploiting multiple noisy copies of unknown states, has applications in quantum communication and computation with imperfect devices. Despite its importance, the fundamental capabilities and limitations of purification in distributed quantum systems remain largely unexplored. Here, we systematically study distributed quantum state purification under local operations and classical communication (LOCC). We prove that no nontrivial two-to-one LOCC purification protocol exists for three fundamental sets: all pure states, all maximally entangled states, and the four Bell states. This no-go theorem demonstrates that no LOCC protocol can reduce noise for every state within these sets, even probabilistically. In stark contrast, we show that single-state purification is achievable, and we provide an explicit analytical LOCC protocol for individual target states. For arbitrary state sets, we develop an optimization-based algorithm that systematically designs LOCC purification protocols, demonstrating its efficacy through concrete examples. These results delineate the fundamental boundaries of LOCC-based purification and provide practical strategies for noise reduction in distributed quantum information processing.</p>

            <p>Geometric quantum computation relies on the geometric phase that arises in adiabatic cyclic evolutions of non-degenerate quantum systems, enabling the design of robust quantum gates. However, the adiabatic condition requires long evolution times, making the system vulnerable to decoherence. In this work, we propose a scheme to realize fast and high-fidelity geometric quantum gates by applying the Superadiabatic Transitionless Driving (SATD) protocol within the dressed-state framework. We analyze the implementation of single-qubit gates in a two-level system driven by a microwave field, focusing in particular on the NV center in diamond. We show how the dynamical phase can be canceled to obtain purely geometric operations. The robustness of the gates is assessed under systematic errors and environmental decoherence, demonstrating high fidelities even in regimes with strong fluctuations. Finally, we extend the protocol to construct nontrivial two-qubit gates, highlighting its feasibility for scalable quantum information processing.</p>

To obtain higher efficiency in finite time evolution, we use the shortcuts-to-adiabaticity method in work generation processes. The modified thermal efficiencies are obtained by numerical simulation.

            <p>Scattering experiments with energetic particles, such as free electrons, have been historically used to reveal the quantum structure of matter. However, realizing coherent interactions between free-electron beams and solid-state quantum systems has remained out of reach, owing to their intrinsically weak coupling. Realizing such coherent control would open up opportunities for hybrid quantum platforms combining free electrons and solid-state qubits for coincident quantum information processing and nanoscale sensing. Here, we present a framework that employs negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy centers (NV-) in diamond as quantum sensors of a bunched electron beam. We develop a Lindblad master equation description of the magnetic free-electron--qubit interactions and identify spin relaxometry as a sensitive probe of the interaction. Experimentally, we integrate a confocal fluorescence microscopy setup into a microwave-bunched electron beam line. We monitor charge-state dynamics and assess their impact on key sensing performance metrics (such as spin readout contrast), defining safe operating parameters for quantum sensing experiments. By performing $T_1$ relaxometry under controlled electron beam exposure, we establish an upper bound on the free-electron--spin coupling strength. Our results establish NV- centers as quantitative probes of free electrons, providing a metrological benchmark for free-electron--qubit coupling under realistic conditions, and chart a route toward solid-state quantum control with electron beams.</p>

            <p>Topological phases have been extensively studied over the past two decades, primarily in quantum pure states, where they are protected by exact symmetries. Recently, numerous studies have theoretically demonstrated the existence of average symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in mixed quantum states, which naturally arise in real systems due to decoherence or disorder. Despite extensive experimental observations of exact SPT phases in various systems, ranging from solid-state materials to synthetic matters, average SPT phases are yet to be observed until this work. Here we report direct observations of disorder-induced many-body interacting average SPT phase in an atom array at half-filling, whereby random offsets to tweezer locations forming a lattice implement structural disorder, resulting in fluctuating long-range dipolar interactions between tweezer confined single atoms. The induced topological phase is vindicated by the spatially resolved atom-atom correlation functions for different forms of dimer compositions. The ground state degeneracy in disordered configurations is detected and compared to the regular lattice without disorder. By probing the quench dynamics of a highly excited state, we observe markedly slower decay of edge spin magnetization in comparison to the bulk spin, consistent with the presence of topologically protected edge modes in disordered lattices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qimao Yang, Jing Guo</p>
            <p>This work develops simulation methods that enable the application of the variational quantum linear solver (VQLS) to simulate quantum transport in nanoscale semiconductor devices. Most previous work on VQLS applications in semiconductor device simulations focuses on solving the Poisson equation, where the coefficient matrix of the sparse linear system is real and symmetric. Solving the quantum transport equation, however, leads to coefficient matrices that are complex and non-symmetric. This work addresses the challenges of applying VQLS to quantum transport simulations. We propose new forms of cost functions to solve complex and non-symmetric linear systems with faster computing speed. We further develop efficient decomposition methods for cost function evaluation, which target reducing the quantum circuit complexity and improving noise robustness when solving the quantum transport equation using the non-equilibrium Green's function method. While classical computation faces the challenge of the "curse of dimensionality" as the spatial-energy numerical grid dimensions grow, the proposed quantum-computing-based method scales logarithmically with the grid size, which offers a promising opportunity for addressing the computational challenges of solving quantum transport in semiconductor devices.</p>

            <p>Time-periodic quantum systems exhibit a rich variety of far-from-equilibrium phenomena and serve as ideal platforms for quantum engineering and control. However, simulating their dynamics with conventional numerical methods remains challenging due to the exponential growth of Hilbert space dimension and rapid spreading of entanglement. In this work, we introduce Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) as an efficient, accurate, and scalable surrogate for non-equilibrium quantum dynamics. Parameterized in Fourier space, FNO naturally captures temporal correlations and remains minimally dependent on discretization of time. We demonstrate the versatility of FNO through three complementary learning paradigms: reconstructing effective Floquet Hamiltonians, predicting expectation values of local observables, and learning quantum information spreading. For each learning task, FNO achieves remarkable accuracy, while attaining a significant speedup, compared to exact numerical methods. Moreover, FNO possesses a remarkable capacity to transfer learning across different temporal discretizations and system driving frequencies. We also show that FNO can extrapolate beyond the time window provided by training data, enabling access to observables and operator-spreading dynamics that might otherwise be difficult to obtain. By employing an appropriate local basis, we argue that the computational cost of FNOs scales only polynomially with the system size. Our results establish FNO as a versatile and scalable surrogate for predicting non-equilibrium quantum dynamics, with potential applications to processing data from near-term quantum computers.</p>

            <p>Modeling open quantum dynamics without full knowledge of the system Hamiltonian or noise model is a key challenge in quantum control and quantum state estimation. We introduce an Augmented Quantum Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (AQNODE) framework that learns quantum trajectories and dissipation parameters directly from partial continuous measurement data. By embedding the system into a latent space evolved via neural ODEs, AQNODE captures both observable and hidden non-Markovian dynamics with temporal smoothness and physical consistency. Our approach integrates weak measurement data to reconstruct qubit states and time-dependent decoherence rates, enabling accurate state prediction and parameter inference without explicit physical equations. Furthermore, we incorporate AQNODE-based feedback control techniques, including proportional-derivative and time-varying linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) strategies, to steer the quantum system toward target states in real time. Extensive numerical simulations demonstrate AQNODE's ability to generalize across system configurations, achieve low prediction errors, and perform robust quantum filtering and control. These results establish AQNODE as a scalable, differentiable, and experimentally compatible framework for real-time modeling and control of dissipative quantum systems.</p>

            <p>Accurately and efficiently predicting the equilibrium geometries of large molecules remains a central challenge in quantum computational chemistry, even with hybrid quantum-classical algorithms. Two major obstacles hinder progress: the large number of qubits required and the prohibitive cost of conventional nested optimization. In this work, we introduce a co-optimization framework that combines Density Matrix Embedding Theory (DMET) with Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) to address these limitations. This approach substantially reduces the required quantum resources, enabling the treatment of molecular systems significantly larger than previously feasible. We first validate our framework on benchmark systems, such as H4 and H2O2, before demonstrating its efficacy in determining the equilibrium geometry of glycolic acid C2H4O3, a molecule of a size previously considered intractable for quantum geometry optimization. Our results show the method achieves high accuracy while drastically lowering computational cost. This work thus represents a significant step toward practical, scalable quantum simulations, moving beyond the small, proof-of-concept molecules that have historically dominated the field. More broadly, our framework establishes a tangible path toward leveraging quantum advantage for the in silico design of complex catalysts and pharmaceuticals.</p>
