            <h2>Optimal Waveforms for Dipole Moment Estimation with Coherent States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Karthik Chinni, Nicolás Quesada</p>
            <p>We investigate quantum sensing for spectroscopy in a system consisting of a two-level atom coupled to a continuum of modes. We focus on optimizing the pulse shape of a coherent state to maximize the quantum Fisher information (QFI) of the emitted light with the aim of estimating the atom's dipole moment, which is proportional to its spontaneous emission rate. To achieve this, we derive a set of coupled differential equations, which include the standard optical Bloch equations as a subset and whose solution directly yields the QFI of the emitted light without resorting to finite-difference methods. Furthermore, we analyze the factors that govern its optimization, provide analytic solutions in both the long and the short pulse width limits, and examine the role of the average photon number of the pulses. We then show that under the closed (periodic) boundary conditions, the harmonic (plane-wave) with frequency equal to half the spontaneous emission rate and a phase determined by detuning are optimal in the long pulse width limit.</p>

            <h2>No oscillating subradiant correlations in a strongly driven quantum emitter array</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiaming Shi, Nikita Leppenen, Ran Tessler, Alexander N. Poddubny</p>
            <p>We theoretically study time-dependent correlations in a strongly driven array of $N$ two-level atoms, coupled to photons in a waveguide. We focus on the spectrum $\{\lambda\}$ of the Liouvillian superoperator, which determines the correlation decay rates $-\Re \lambda$ and the frequencies $\Im\lambda$. Our main finding is the suppression of subradiant oscillating correlations between atomic states by a strong coherent of amplitude $\Omega$: $|\Re \lambda|\ge m\gamma/2$, where $\gamma$ is the single-atom spontaneous decay rate and $m=|\Im \lambda/(2\Omega)|$ is a nonzero integer for correlations oscillating in time $\propto \exp(\pm 2i m|\Omega| t)$. This limit is independent of the number of atoms $N$; it holds both for small arrays and in the macroscopic limit. We demonstrate the suppression of subradiance numerically and provide a rigorous proof based on the analytical decomposition of the Liouvillian using spectral theory of simplicial complexes and posets.</p>

            <h2>Bistability of optical properties of cesium vapor due to collective interaction of alignment and orientation under strong spin exchange conditions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M.V. Petrenko, A.K. Vershovskii</p>
            <p>Hydrogen-like alkali atoms with a single valence electron are the most common objects in quantum optics and, at the same time, serve as essential tools of the field. Under conditions of optical pumping, strong spin-exchange and ultra-weak magnetic field (spin-exchange relaxation free mode, SERF), ensembles of such atoms in the gas phase can demonstrate not only the absence of spin-exchange relaxation, but also nonlinear collective effects. We present experimental evidence that the alignment, i.e. the quadrupole momentum, can not only be preserved under SERF conditions, but also coexist and interact with the orientation, i.e. the dipole momentum. We also show that this interaction leads to bistability: a small change in conditions can cause the medium to transition to a different steady state, an effect characterized by hysteresis. The combination of properties of this effect opens up a wide range of applications as optical keys or memory elements with a storage time of hundreds of seconds in tasks of quantum information and cryptography.</p>

            <h2>Density-Functional Tight Binding Meets Maxwell: Unraveling the Mysteries of (Strong) Light-Matter Coupling Efficiently</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dominik Sidler, Carlos M. Bustamante, Franco P. Bonafe, Michael Ruggenthaler, Maxim Sukharev, Angel Rubio</p>
            <p>Controlling chemical and material properties through strong light-matter coupling in optical cavities has gained considerable attention over the past decade. However, the underlying mechanisms remain insufficiently understood, and a significant gap persists between experimental observations and theoretical descriptions. This challenge arises from the intrinsically multi-scale nature of the problem, where non-perturbative feedback occurs across different spatial and temporal scales. Collective coupling between a macroscopic ensemble of molecules and a photonic environment, such as Fabry-Perot cavity, can strongly influence the microscopic properties of individual molecules, while microscopic details of the ensemble in turn affect the macroscopic coupling. To address this complexity, we present an efficient computational framework that combines density-functional tight binding (DFTB) with finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations for Maxwell's equations (DFTB+Maxwell). This approach allows for a self-consistent treatment of both the cavity and microscopic details of the molecular ensemble. We demonstrate the potential for this method by tackling several open questions. First, we calculate non-perturbatively two-dimensional spectroscopic observable that directly connect to well-established experimental protocols. Second, we provide local, molecule-resolved information within collectively coupled ensembles, which is difficult to obtain experimentally. Third, we show how cavity designs can be optimized to target specific microscopic applications. Finally, we outline future directions to enhance the predictive power of this framework, including extension to finite temperature, condensed phases, and correlated quantum effects.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Dissipative Continuous Time Crystals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Felix Russo, Thomas Pohl</p>
            <p>Continuous time crystals, i.e., nonequilibrium phases with a spontaneously broken continuous time-translational symmetry, have been studied and recently observed in the long-time dynamics of open quantum systems. Here, we investigate a lattice of interacting three-level particles and find two distinct time-crystal phases that cannot be described within mean-field theory. Remarkably, one of them emerges only in the presence of correlations, upon accounting for beyond-mean-field effects. Our findings extend explorations of continuous time-translational symmetry breaking in dissipative systems beyond the classical phenomenology of periodic orbits in a low-dimensional nonlinear system. The proposed model applies directly to the laser-driven dynamics of interacting Rydberg states in neutral atom arrays and suggests that the predicted time-crystal phases are observable in such experiments.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Entanglement Generation in the Heterometallic Ni$^\text{2+}_4$Gd$_4^\text{3+}$ Complexes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hamid Arian Zad, Michal Jaščur, Azam Zoshki, Ralph Kenna, Nerses Ananikian</p>
            <p>We investigate various types of quantum entanglement in the octanuclear heterometallic $3d/4f$ complexes denoted as Ni$^{2+}_4$Gd$^{3+}_4$ under an external magnetic field, using the exact diagonalization approach. These molecular magnets, which can be effectively described by Heisenberg spin models, consist of two identical $\{\text{Ni}^{2+}_2\text{Gd}^{3+}_2\}$ cubane subunits bridged by acetate and hydroxide ligands. Our analysis reveals that their magnetization exhibits intermediate plateaus at low temperatures, indicating distinct ground states characteristic of Ni-containing compounds. Using negativity as a measure of quantum entanglement, we examine the influence of single-ion anisotropy and magnetic field on tetrapartite, bipartite, 1$-$3 tangle, and 2$-$2 tangle entanglements in two families of Ni$^{2+}_4$Gd$^{3+}_4$ complexes: $\boldsymbol{(1)}$ without anisotropy and $\boldsymbol{(2)}$ with anisotropy. Complex $\boldsymbol{(1)}$ exhibits strong bipartite entanglement between Ni ions, which persists up to $T \approx 3.0\,\text{K}$ and $B \approx 4.0\,\text{T}$, but shows significantly weaker tetrapartite entanglement and vanishing bipartite entanglement between Gd$\cdots$Gd and Ni$\cdots$Gd pairs. In contrast, complex $\boldsymbol{(2)}$ displays nonzero and sizable values for all types of entanglement considered. These findings emphasis the crucial role of single-ion anisotropy in generating and shaping the entanglement landscape of heterometallic Ni$^{2+}_4$Gd$^{3+}_4$ complexes. Notably, we find that the 1$-$3 tangle entanglement between a Ni ion and the remaining sites in a cubane unit serves as a reliable indicator of ground-state phase transitions, exhibiting distinct changes across phase boundaries irrespective of the presence of single-ion anisotropy.</p>

            <h2>Machine learning the effects of many quantum measurements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wanda Hou, Samuel J. Garratt, Norhan M. Eassa, Eliott Rosenberg, Pedram Roushan, Yi-Zhuang You, Ehud Altman</p>
            <p>Measurements are essential for the processing and protection of information in quantum computers. They can also induce long-range entanglement between unmeasured qubits. However, when post-measurement states depend on many non-deterministic measurement outcomes, there is a barrier to observing and using the entanglement induced by prior measurements. Here we demonstrate a new approach for detecting such measurement-induced entanglement. We create short-range entangled states of one- and two-dimensional arrays of qubits in a superconducting quantum processor, and aim to characterize the long-range entanglement induced between distant pairs of qubits when we measure all of the others. To do this we use unsupervised training of neural networks on observations to create computational models for post-measurement states and, by correlating these models with experimental data, we reveal measurement-induced entanglement. Our results additionally demonstrate a transition in the ability of a classical agent to accurately model the experimental data; this is closely related to a measurement-induced phase transition. We anticipate that our work can act as a basis for future experiments on quantum error correction and more general problems in quantum control.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Error Correction in Adversarial Regimes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rahul Arvind, Nikhil Bansal, Dax Enshan Koh, Tobias Haug, Kishor Bharti</p>
            <p>In adversarial settings, where attackers can deliberately and strategically corrupt quantum data, standard quantum error correction reaches its limits. It can only correct up to half the code distance and must output a unique answer. Quantum list decoding offers a promising alternative. By allowing the decoder to output a short list of possible errors, it becomes possible to tolerate far more errors, even under worst-case noise. But two fundamental questions remain: which quantum codes support list decoding, and can we design decoding schemes that are secure against efficient, computationally bounded adversaries? In this work, we answer both. To identify which codes are list-decodable, we provide a generalized version of the Knill-Laflamme conditions. Then, using tools from quantum cryptography, we build an unambiguous list decoding protocol based on pseudorandom unitaries. Our scheme is secure against any quantum polynomial-time adversary, even across multiple decoding attempts, in contrast to previous schemes. Our approach connects coding theory with complexity-based quantum cryptography, paving the way for secure quantum information processing in adversarial settings.</p>

            <h2>Retrocausal capacity of a quantum channel</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kaiyuan Ji, Seth Lloyd, Mark M. Wilde</p>
            <p>We study the capacity of a quantum channel for retrocausal communication, where messages are transmitted backward in time, from a sender in the future to a receiver in the past, through a noisy postselected closed timelike curve (P-CTC) represented by the channel. We completely characterize the one-shot retrocausal quantum and classical capacities of a quantum channel, and we show that the corresponding asymptotic capacities are equal to the average and sum, respectively, of the channel's max-information and its regularized Doeblin information. This endows these information measures with a novel operational interpretation. Furthermore, our characterization can be generalized beyond quantum channels to all completely positive maps. This imposes information-theoretic limits on transmitting messages via postselected-teleportation-like mechanisms with arbitrary initial- and final-state boundary conditions, including those considered in various black-hole final-state models.</p>

            <p>Quantum sensing with solid-state spin defects has transformed nanoscale metrology, offering sub-wavelength spatial resolution with exceptional sensitivity to multiple signal types. Maximizing these advantages requires minimizing both the sensor-target separation and detectable signalthreshold. However, leading platforms such as nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond suffer performance degradation near surfaces or in nanoscale volumes, motivating the search for optically addressable spin sensors in atomically thin, two-dimensional (2D) materials. Here, we present an experimental framework to probe a novel 2D spin ensemble, including its Hamiltonian, coherent sensing dynamics, and noise environment. Using a central spin system in a 2D hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) crystal, we fully map the hyperfine interactions with proximal nuclear spins, demonstrate programmable switching between magnetic and electric sensing, and introduce a robust method for reconstructing the environmental noise spectrum explicitly accounting for quantum control imperfections. We achieve a record coherence time of 80 $\mu$s and nanotesla-level AC magnetic sensitivity at a 10 nm target distance, reaching the threshold for detecting a single nuclear spin in nanoscale spectroscopy. Leveraging the broad opportunities for defect engineering in atomically thin hosts, these results lay the foundation for next-generation quantum sensors with ultrahigh sensitivity, tunable noise selectivity, and versatile quantum functionalities.</p>

            <h2>Exploring Photon Blockade in Multimode Jaynes-Cummings Models with Two-Photon Dissipation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Caden McCollum, Imran M. Mirza</p>
            <p>The photon blockade phenomenon, a promising tool for realizing efficient single-photon sources, is the central focus of our work. We study this phenomenon within the context of the multimode extension of the Jaynes-Cummings model, incorporating two-photon dissipation and external coherent driving. Operating in the weak-driving regime, we confine our analysis to the two-excitation sector of the Hilbert space, initially exploring the single-mode case and then focusing on the corresponding multimode problem. Our study calculates the second-order correlation function (both numerically and analytically) for zero- and nonzero time delays in single- and multimode cases, to pinpoint and validate the conditions that lead to conventional and unconventional photon blockade. Our zero delay findings reveal that photon antibunching is comparable in both cases; however, the multimode case offers a greater degree of control and applicability. Furthermore, for non-zero delay operation, we find that when one of the multiple modes is set at the optimal conventional photon blockade conditions, the behavior of the curve mimics the single-mode problem with an overall slower rate of reaching the $g^{(2)}(\tau)=1$ value. These results highlight the practical implications of our findings for building useful single-photon sources.</p>

            <h2>Exotic quantum light-matter interactions in bilayer square lattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xing-Liang Dong, Peng-Bo Li, Jia-Qiang Chen, Fu-Li Li, Franco Nori</p>
            <p>We investigate quantum emitters (QEs) interacting with a photonic structured bath made of bilayer square lattices, where the resonance anti-crossing between the energy bands opens a symmetric middle energy gap. Due to the intrinsic chiral symmetry of the bath and interactions with the square-like band-edges, the QE-photon dressed states generated in this inner bandgap are odd-neighbor, robust, and anisotropic, when the emitters' transition frequencies lie in the middle of the bandgap. We also use giant artificial atoms to engineer and modify the dressed states' patterns. Exotic bound states can lead to spin models with symmetry protection, resulting in fascinating many-body phases. As an example, we show that this proposal can be used to generate both edge states and corner states in the generalized 2D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. This work opens up new avenues for research into innovative quantum many-body physics and quantum simulations with photonic or phononic multilayer structures.</p>

            <h2>Intermittent chaos in an optomechanical resonator</h2>

            <p>Chaos is a fundamental phenomenon in nonlinear dynamics, manifesting as irregular and unpredictable behavior across various physical systems. Among the diverse routes to chaos, intermittent chaos is a distinct transition pathway, characterized by the temporal or spatial alternation between periodic and chaotic motions. Here, we experimentally demonstrate, for the first time, optomechanically induced intermittent chaos in an optical whispering-gallery-mode microresonator. Specifically, the system evolves from stable periodic oscillation through an intermittent-chaos regime before fully developing into chaotic motion. As system parameters vary, the proportion of chaotic motion in the time-domain increases asymptotically until chaotic dynamics dominates entirely. Moreover, it is counterintuitive that, intermittent chaos can act as noise of a favorable intensity compared with purely periodic or fully chaotic states, and enhance rather than reduce system's responses in nonlinear ultrasonic detection. These findings not only deepen the comprehensive understanding of chaos formation but also broaden its potential applications in high-precision sensing and information processing.</p>

            <p>The sensitivity of non-local optical measurements at low light intensities, such as those involved in long baseline telescope arrays, can be improved by using remote entanglement. Here, we demonstrate the use of entangled quantum memories in a quantum network of Silicon-vacancy centers in diamond nano-cavities to experimentally perform such non-local phase measurements. Specifically, we combine the generation of event-ready remote quantum entanglement, photon mode erasure that hides the "which-path" information of temporally and spatially separated incoming optical modes, and non-local, non-destructive photon heralding enabled by remote entanglement to perform a proof-of-concept entanglement-assisted differential phase measurement of weak incident light between two spatially separate stations. Demonstrating successful operation of the remote phase sensing protocol with a fiber link baseline up to 1.55 km, our results open the door for a new class of quantum enhanced imaging applications.</p>

            <h2>Enhancing Optical Imaging via Quantum Computation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aleksandr Mokeev, Babak Saif, Mikhail D. Lukin, Johannes Borregaard</p>
            <p>Extracting information from weak optical signals is a critical challenge across a broad range of technologies. Conventional imaging techniques, constrained to integrating over detected signals and classical post-processing, are limited in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) from shot noise accumulation in the post-processing algorithms. We show that these limitations can be circumvented by coherently encoding photonic amplitude information into qubit registers and applying quantum algorithms to process the stored information from asynchronously arriving optical signals. As a specific example, we develop a quantum algorithm for imaging unresolved point sources and apply it to exoplanet detection. We demonstrate that orders-of-magnitude improvements in performance can be achieved under realistic imaging conditions using relatively small scale quantum processors.</p>

            <p>Quantum emitters operating at telecom wavelengths are essential for the advancement of quantum technologies, particularly in the development of integrated on-chip devices for quantum computing, communication, and sensing. Coupling resonant structures to a near-zero-index (NZI) environment has been shown to enhance their optical performance by both increasing spontaneous emission rates and improving emission directionality. In this work, we comparatively study emission characteristics of colloidal PbS/CdS (core/shell) quantum dots at telecom wavelengths on different substrates, where two different sets of quantum dots emitting within and outside the epsilon-near-zero region are deposited on both glass and indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates. Our results demonstrate that coupling quantum dots to the epsilon-near-zero spectral region results in a reduction of photoluminescence lifetime of 54~times, a 7.5-fold increase in saturation intensity, and a relative emission cone narrowing from 17.6° to 10.3°. These results underline the strong dependence of quantum dot emission properties on the spectral overlap with the epsilon-near-zero condition, highlighting the potential of transparent conducting oxides (TCOs), such as ITO, for integration into next-generation quantum photonic devices. Due to their CMOS compatibility, fabrication tunability, and high thermal and optical damage thresholds, TCO NZI materials offer a robust platform for scalable and high-performance quantum optical systems operating within the telecom bandwidth.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinchao Zhou, Deepak A. Suresh, F. Robicheaux, Chen-Lung Hung</p>
            <p>We experimentally and theoretically study collective emission of a dense atomic ensemble coupled to a single mode in a nanophotonic microring resonator. Because many cold atoms are localized in a small volume, these trapped atoms collectively couple not only to the guided resonator mode but also to the nonguided modes in free space. Through tuning the atom-photon coupling and by adjusting the number of trapped atoms, we demonstrate superradiant emission to the microring resonator. For photon emission via the nonguided modes, our study reveals signatures of subradiance and superradiance when the system is driven to the steady state and to the timed-Dicke state, respectively. Our experimental platform thus presents the first atom-light interface with selective collective emission behavior into a guided mode and the environment. Our observation and methodology could shed light on future explorations of collective emission with densely packed quantum emitters coupled to nanophotonic light-matter interfaces.</p>

            <h2>Quantum theory of fractional topological pumping of lattice solitons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julius Bohm, Hugo Gerlitz, Christina Jörg, Michael Fleischhauer</p>
            <p>One of the hallmarks of topological quantum systems is the robust quantization of particle transport, which is the origin of the integer-valued Quantum Hall conductivity. In the presence of interactions the topological transport can also become fractional. Recent experiments on topological pumps constructed by arrays of photonic waveguides have demonstrated both integer and fractional transport of lattice solitons. Here a background medium mediates interactions between photons via a Kerr nonlinearity and leads to the formation of self-bound composites, called lattice solitons. Upon increasing the interaction strength of these solitons a sequence of transitions was observed from a phase with integer transport in a pump cycle through different phases of fractional transport to a phase with no transport. We here present a full quantum description of topological pumps of solitons. This approach allows us to identify a topological invariant, a many-body Chern number, determined by the band structure of the center-of-mass (COM) momentum of the solitons, which fully governs their transport. Increasing the interaction leads to a successive merging of COM bands which explains the observed sequence of topological phase transitions and also the potential for a breakdown of topological quantization for intermediate interaction strength.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement Asymmetry and Quantum Mpemba Effect for Non-Abelian Global Symmetry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Harunobu Fujimura, Soichiro Shimamori</p>
            <p>Entanglement asymmetry is a measure that quantifies the degree of symmetry breaking at the level of a subsystem. In this work, we investigate the entanglement asymmetry in $\widehat{su}(N)_k$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model and discuss the quantum Mpemba effect for SU$(N)$ symmetry, the phenomenon that the more symmetry is initially broken, the faster it is restored. Due to the Coleman-Mermin-Wagner theorem, spontaneous breaking of continuous global symmetries is forbidden in $1+1$ dimensions. To circumvent this no-go theorem, we consider excited initial states which explicitly break non-Abelian global symmetry. We particularly focus on the initial states built from primary operators in the fundamental and adjoint representations. In both cases, we study the real-time dynamics of the Rényi entanglement asymmetry and provide clear evidence of quantum Mpemba effect for SU$(N)$ symmetry. Furthermore, we find a new type of quantum Mpemba effect for the primary operator in the fundamental representation: increasing the rank $N$ leads to stronger initial symmetry breaking but faster symmetry restoration. Also, increasing the level $k$ leads to weaker initial symmetry breaking but slower symmetry restoration. On the other hand, no such behavior is observed for adjoint case, which may suggest that this new type of quantum Mpemba effect is not universal.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Songqinghao Yang, Jin-Peng Liu</p>
            <p>We introduce random-LCHS, a circuit-efficient randomized-compilation framework for simulating linear non-unitary dynamics of the form $\partial_t u(t) = -A(t) u(t) + b(t)$ built on the linear combination of Hamiltonian simulation (LCHS). We propose three related settings: the general random-LCHS for time-dependent inhomogeneous linear dynamics; the observable-driven random-LCHS, which targets estimation of an observable's expectation at the final time; and the symmetric random-LCHS, a time-independent, homogeneous reduction that can exploit physical symmetries. Our contributions are threefold: first, by randomizing the outer linear-combination-of-unitaries (LCU) layer as well as the deterministic inner Hamiltonian simulation layer, random-LCHS attains favorable resource overheads in the circuit design for early fault-tolerant devices; second, the observable-driven variant employs an unbiased Monte-Carlo estimator to target expectation values directly, reducing sample complexity; and third, integrating the physical symmetry in the model with the sampling scheme yields further empirical improvements, demonstrating tighter error bounds in realistic numerics. We illustrate these techniques with theoretical guarantees as well as numerical verifications and discuss implementation trade-offs for near-term quantum hardware.</p>

            <p>Topological phases are expected to carry enhanced computational power, stemming from the long-range entanglement that characterizes them. Here we investigate whether this advantage is reflected in quantum magic, quantified through stabilizer Rényi entropies (SREs). We analyze one-dimensional models with an exact duality between a symmetry-protected topological phase and a trivial one. Surprisingly, a finite (parameters dependent) asymmetry appears only when boundary conditions break the duality, and emerges as well in the transverse-field Ising chain, which lacks topological order. These results show that magic is unable to detect topological phases, indicating that either an additional resource is required to capture their unique quantum contribution, or that not all forms of long-range entanglement constitute a genuine computational resource.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pavel Sekatski, Yelena Guryanova, Naga Bhavya Teja Kothakonda, Michalis Skotiniotis</p>
            <p>We consider the problem of deterministically cloning quantum channels with respect to the best attainable rate and the highest quality, so-called optimal cloning. We demonstrate that cloning quantum states is, in-fact, equivalent to cloning the trash-and-replace channel and therefore the former is a special case of the more general problem. By appealing to higher-order quantum operations (quantum processes) we construct a unified framework to deal with the most general cloning tasks and establish necessary conditions for a family of channels to exhibit super-replication -- a quadratic cloning rate with vanishing error. We find that noisy phase-gate channels satisfy these conditions, and we construct the explicit super-replicating process for the task. Conversely, we find that the criteria are not met by the full set of noisy unitary gates; classical noise channels; or amplitude damping channels, whose respective cloning rates are at most linear. In this paradigm, we not only derive new results, but also refigure known ones. We derive a strong converse for state cloning, and for unitary channels we construct an alternative super-replication process to that of Dür et al. [PRL 114, 120503 (2015)] and Chiribella et al. [PRL 114, 120504 (2015)] based on a measure-and-prepare process, which allows us to establish a direct connection between optimal channel cloning and Bayesian channel estimation. Finally we give an SDP algorithm to search for optimal cloning processes and study the advantage of coherent vs measure-and-prepare protocols on concrete examples.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Felix Fritzsch, Gabriel O. Alves, Michael A. Rampp, Pieter W. Claeys</p>
            <p>Out-of-time-order correlation functions (OTOCs) and their higher-order generalizations present important probes of quantum information dynamics and scrambling. We introduce a solvable many-body quantum model, which we term boundary scrambling, for which the full dynamics of higher-order OTOCs is analytically tractable. These dynamics support a decomposition into free cumulants and unify recent extensions of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis with predictions from random quantum circuit models. We obtain exact expressions for (higher-order) correlations between matrix elements and show these to be stable away from the solvable point. The solvability is enabled by the identification of a higher-order Markovian influence matrix, capturing the effect of the full system on a local subsystem. These results provide insight into the emergence of random-matrix behavior from structured Floquet dynamics and show how techniques from free probability can be applied in the construction of exactly-solvable many-body models.</p>

            <p>We report an innovative model for predicting entanglement distribution between end parties of a quantum network using our in-house simulation algorithm. Our implementation is based on stochastic methods that are built upon a unique global and local clock system for monitoring expectations with finite quantum memory (QM) parameters. This allows us to tabulate rates with independently operating quantum repeater nodes in a distribution chain. The numerical simulations presented utilize a stochastic modeling of QM efficiency and storage lifetime. The findings presented reveal the translation of the effects of QM lifetime on the spread of time needed for successful entanglement distribution between end parties. Our model based on this transformative clock scheme will make an impactful addition to quantum network simulators platforms.</p>

            <p>Distributed quantum sensing exploits entanglement to enhance the estimation of multiple parameters across a network of spatially-separated sensors, achieving sensitivities beyond the classical limit. Potential applications cover a plethora of technologies, from precision navigation to biomedical imaging and environmental monitoring. However, practical implementations are challenged by the complex optimal distribution of entanglement throughout the sensing nodes, which affects scalability and robustness. Here we demonstrate a reconfigurable network of Mach-Zehnder interferometers entangled via a single shared squeezed-vacuum resource. We achieve joint noise suppression of $4.36 \pm 0.35$ dB below the standard quantum limit at the phase-uncertainty level of $10^{-9}$ . Furthermore, after full optimization in the low-intensity regime, we demonstrate a crossover from the standard quantum limit to the Heisenberg limit. The network estimates arbitrary linear combinations of phases, saturates the quantum Cramer-Rao bound in the ideal case, remains robust under realistic photon losses, and scales favorably with the number of sensors.</p>

            <p>A distributed network architecture in which flying photons connect individual modules containing stationary atomic qubits is a promising approach for scaling up neutral-atom based quantum-computing platforms. We consider an all-fiber based platform consisting of nanofiber cavity QED systems interconnected via conventional optical fibers. Each nanofiber cavity is strongly coupled to multiple atoms through its evanescent field, and atom pairs within one cavity (local) or two distant cavities (remote) are addressed for performing photon-mediated quantum logic gates on them by controlling the effective light-matter coupling via local AC Stark shifts and atom-fiber distance. We numerically evaluate the required parameters for achieving nearly crosstalk-free gate operation using these targeting methods by calculating average gate fidelities, success probabilities, and Pauli error rates for both local and remote controlled-Z gates. For the case of perfect addressing, we also analytically determine the theoretical optimum gate performance as limited by cavity reflectivity, cooperativity, and qubit level-splitting.</p>

            <p>Topological materials hold great promise for developing next-generation devices with transport properties that remain resilient in the presence of local imperfections. However, their susceptibility to thermal noise has posed a major challenge. In particular, the Haldane model, a cornerstone in topological physics, generally requires cryogenic temperatures for experimental realization, limiting both the investigation of topologically robust quantum phenomena and their practical applications. In this work, we demonstrate a room-temperature realization of the Haldane model using atomic ensembles in momentum-space superradiance lattices, a platform intrinsically resistant to thermal noise. The topological phase transition is revealed through the superradiant emission contrast between two timed Dicke states in the lattice. Crucially, the thermal resilience of this platform allows us to access a deep modulation regime, where topological transitions to high Chern number phases emerge -- going beyond the traditional Haldane model. Our results not only deepen the understanding of exotic topological phases, but also offer a robust, reconfigurable, and room-temperature-compatible platform that connects quantum simulation to real-world quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>Having multiple Bell pairs shared by distant quantum registers provides a key resource for both quantum networks and distributed quantum computing. In this paper, we present a protocol for parallelized Bell-pair generation that uses the phase of a coherent light pulse to encode a qudit, enabling the simultaneous generation of multiple Bell pairs. By encoding a qudit in a basis of light-matter Schrödinger's cat states, the loss of a photon in transit can be detected through an $XX$ parity syndrome, allowing the backaction due to the lost photon to be deterministically corrected through single-qubit rotations. The protocol presented here is compatible with existing technologies in both optical and microwave (circuit QED) architectures, supporting near-term implementation across diverse quantum platforms.</p>

            <p>We investigate one- and two-mode variants of the $\mathbb{Z}_3$-symmetric quantum Rabi model, which describe the interaction of a qutrit with one or two bosonic modes and are directly relevant for circuit-QED and spin-qudit platforms. We find a canonical transformation that allows one to obtain the spectrum of the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ Rabi model using perturbation theory in a magnetic field. We show that in a certain parameter regime (deep-strong-coupling and a small magnetic field) the three lowest eigenstates become $\mathbb{Z}_3$ qutrit-boson cat states. In order to characterize these states we introduce a joint qutrit-boson Wigner function and derive its closed-form expression for the qutrit-boson cat states. Numerical calculations across a wide range of coupling strengths show that the proposed Wigner function is a useful tool that allows one to unambiguously identify the $\mathbb{Z}_{3}$ qutrit-boson cat states.</p>

            <h2>No Bound Randomness in Quantum Nonlocality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ravishankar Ramanathan, Yuan Liu, Yutian Wu, Stefano Pironio</p>
            <p>Recently it has been found that there exist maximally nonlocal quantum correlations that fail to certify randomness for any fixed input pair, rendering them useless for device-independent spot-checking randomness expansion schemes. Here we show that conversely, in DI randomness amplification protocols where all input pairs are used for randomness generation, any amount of quantum nonlocality is sufficient to certify randomness. This shows that no bound randomness exists in quantum nonlocality - any quantum nonlocal behavior is useful in a DI randomness generation task with appropriate modification of protocol structure. Secondly, we show that in contrast to the hitherto considered fixed-input guessing probability, the average guessing probability over all inputs is a faithful and monotonic measure of nonlocality. We use the average guessing probability to show that in contrast to findings in PRL 134, 090201, the detection efficiency threshold for randomness generation is never lower than that for nonlocality detection. Finally, we analytically compute the average guessing probability by a quantum adversary of a single player's measurement outputs in a standard CHSH Bell test, and use it to demonstrate an improvement in the generation rate in state-of-art amplification protocols.</p>

            <p>Quantum state purification, which mitigates noise by exploiting multiple noisy copies of unknown states, has applications in quantum communication and computation with imperfect devices. Despite its importance, the fundamental capabilities and limitations of purification in distributed quantum systems remain largely unexplored. Here, we systematically study distributed quantum state purification under local operations and classical communication (LOCC). We prove that no nontrivial two-to-one LOCC purification protocol exists for three fundamental sets: all pure states, all maximally entangled states, and the four Bell states. This no-go theorem demonstrates that no LOCC protocol can reduce noise for every state within these sets, even probabilistically. In stark contrast, we show that single-state purification is achievable, and we provide an explicit analytical LOCC protocol for individual target states. For arbitrary state sets, we develop an optimization-based algorithm that systematically designs LOCC purification protocols, demonstrating its efficacy through concrete examples. These results delineate the fundamental boundaries of LOCC-based purification and provide practical strategies for noise reduction in distributed quantum information processing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Estefanía Rus, Alejandro Ferrón, Omar Osenda, Sergio S. Gomez</p>
            <p>Geometric quantum computation relies on the geometric phase that arises in adiabatic cyclic evolutions of non-degenerate quantum systems, enabling the design of robust quantum gates. However, the adiabatic condition requires long evolution times, making the system vulnerable to decoherence. In this work, we propose a scheme to realize fast and high-fidelity geometric quantum gates by applying the Superadiabatic Transitionless Driving (SATD) protocol within the dressed-state framework. We analyze the implementation of single-qubit gates in a two-level system driven by a microwave field, focusing in particular on the NV center in diamond. We show how the dynamical phase can be canceled to obtain purely geometric operations. The robustness of the gates is assessed under systematic errors and environmental decoherence, demonstrating high fidelities even in regimes with strong fluctuations. Finally, we extend the protocol to construct nontrivial two-qubit gates, highlighting its feasibility for scalable quantum information processing.</p>

            <p>Scattering experiments with energetic particles, such as free electrons, have been historically used to reveal the quantum structure of matter. However, realizing coherent interactions between free-electron beams and solid-state quantum systems has remained out of reach, owing to their intrinsically weak coupling. Realizing such coherent control would open up opportunities for hybrid quantum platforms combining free electrons and solid-state qubits for coincident quantum information processing and nanoscale sensing. Here, we present a framework that employs negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy centers (NV-) in diamond as quantum sensors of a bunched electron beam. We develop a Lindblad master equation description of the magnetic free-electron--qubit interactions and identify spin relaxometry as a sensitive probe of the interaction. Experimentally, we integrate a confocal fluorescence microscopy setup into a microwave-bunched electron beam line. We monitor charge-state dynamics and assess their impact on key sensing performance metrics (such as spin readout contrast), defining safe operating parameters for quantum sensing experiments. By performing $T_1$ relaxometry under controlled electron beam exposure, we establish an upper bound on the free-electron--spin coupling strength. Our results establish NV- centers as quantitative probes of free electrons, providing a metrological benchmark for free-electron--qubit coupling under realistic conditions, and chart a route toward solid-state quantum control with electron beams.</p>

            <p>Topological phases have been extensively studied over the past two decades, primarily in quantum pure states, where they are protected by exact symmetries. Recently, numerous studies have theoretically demonstrated the existence of average symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in mixed quantum states, which naturally arise in real systems due to decoherence or disorder. Despite extensive experimental observations of exact SPT phases in various systems, ranging from solid-state materials to synthetic matters, average SPT phases are yet to be observed until this work. Here we report direct observations of disorder-induced many-body interacting average SPT phase in an atom array at half-filling, whereby random offsets to tweezer locations forming a lattice implement structural disorder, resulting in fluctuating long-range dipolar interactions between tweezer confined single atoms. The induced topological phase is vindicated by the spatially resolved atom-atom correlation functions for different forms of dimer compositions. The ground state degeneracy in disordered configurations is detected and compared to the regular lattice without disorder. By probing the quench dynamics of a highly excited state, we observe markedly slower decay of edge spin magnetization in comparison to the bulk spin, consistent with the presence of topologically protected edge modes in disordered lattices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qimao Yang, Jing Guo</p>
            <p>This work develops simulation methods that enable the application of the variational quantum linear solver (VQLS) to simulate quantum transport in nanoscale semiconductor devices. Most previous work on VQLS applications in semiconductor device simulations focuses on solving the Poisson equation, where the coefficient matrix of the sparse linear system is real and symmetric. Solving the quantum transport equation, however, leads to coefficient matrices that are complex and non-symmetric. This work addresses the challenges of applying VQLS to quantum transport simulations. We propose new forms of cost functions to solve complex and non-symmetric linear systems with faster computing speed. We further develop efficient decomposition methods for cost function evaluation, which target reducing the quantum circuit complexity and improving noise robustness when solving the quantum transport equation using the non-equilibrium Green's function method. While classical computation faces the challenge of the "curse of dimensionality" as the spatial-energy numerical grid dimensions grow, the proposed quantum-computing-based method scales logarithmically with the grid size, which offers a promising opportunity for addressing the computational challenges of solving quantum transport in semiconductor devices.</p>

            <p>Time-periodic quantum systems exhibit a rich variety of far-from-equilibrium phenomena and serve as ideal platforms for quantum engineering and control. However, simulating their dynamics with conventional numerical methods remains challenging due to the exponential growth of Hilbert space dimension and rapid spreading of entanglement. In this work, we introduce Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) as an efficient, accurate, and scalable surrogate for non-equilibrium quantum dynamics. Parameterized in Fourier space, FNO naturally captures temporal correlations and remains minimally dependent on discretization of time. We demonstrate the versatility of FNO through three complementary learning paradigms: reconstructing effective Floquet Hamiltonians, predicting expectation values of local observables, and learning quantum information spreading. For each learning task, FNO achieves remarkable accuracy, while attaining a significant speedup, compared to exact numerical methods. Moreover, FNO possesses a remarkable capacity to transfer learning across different temporal discretizations and system driving frequencies. We also show that FNO can extrapolate beyond the time window provided by training data, enabling access to observables and operator-spreading dynamics that might otherwise be difficult to obtain. By employing an appropriate local basis, we argue that the computational cost of FNOs scales only polynomially with the system size. Our results establish FNO as a versatile and scalable surrogate for predicting non-equilibrium quantum dynamics, with potential applications to processing data from near-term quantum computers.</p>

            <p>Modeling open quantum dynamics without full knowledge of the system Hamiltonian or noise model is a key challenge in quantum control and quantum state estimation. We introduce an Augmented Quantum Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (AQNODE) framework that learns quantum trajectories and dissipation parameters directly from partial continuous measurement data.

Our approach integrates weak measurement data to reconstruct qubit states and time-dependent decoherence rates, enabling accurate state prediction and parameter inference without explicit physical equations. Furthermore, we incorporate AQNODE-based feedback control techniques, including proportional-derivative and time-varying linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) strategies, to steer the quantum system toward target states in real time. Extensive numerical simulations demonstrate AQNODE's ability to generalize across system configurations, achieve low prediction errors, and perform robust quantum filtering and control. These results establish AQNODE as a scalable, differentiable, and experimentally compatible framework for real-time modeling and control of dissipative quantum systems.</p>

            <p>Accurately and efficiently predicting the equilibrium geometries of large molecules remains a central challenge in quantum computational chemistry, even with hybrid quantum-classical algorithms. Two major obstacles hinder progress: the large number of qubits required and the prohibitive cost of conventional nested optimization. In this work, we introduce a co-optimization framework that combines Density Matrix Embedding Theory (DMET) with Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) to address these limitations. This approach substantially reduces the required quantum resources, enabling the treatment of molecular systems significantly larger than previously feasible. We first validate our framework on benchmark systems, such as H4 and H2O2, before demonstrating its efficacy in determining the equilibrium geometry of glycolic acid C2H4O3, a molecule of a size previously considered intractable for quantum geometry optimization. Our results show the method achieves high accuracy while drastically lowering computational cost. This work thus represents a significant step toward practical, scalable quantum simulations, moving beyond the small, proof-of-concept molecules that have historically dominated the field. More broadly, our framework establishes a tangible path toward leveraging quantum advantage for the in silico design of complex catalysts and pharmaceuticals.</p>

            <p>Entanglement distillation, a fundamental building block of quantum networks, enables the purification of noisy entangled states shared among distant nodes by local operations and classical communication. Its practical realization presents several technical challenges, including the storage of quantum states in quantum memory and the execution of coherent quantum operations on multiple copies of states within the quantum memory. In this work, we present an entanglement purification protocol via quantum communication, namely a carrier-assisted entanglement purification protocol, which utilizes two elements only: i) quantum memory for a single-copy entangled state shared by parties and ii) single qubits travelling between parties. We show that the protocol, when single-qubit transmission is noiseless, can purify a noisy entangled state shared by parties. When single-qubit transmission is noisy, the purification relies on types of noisy qubit channels; we characterize qubit channels such that the protocol works for the purification. We resolve the limitation by applying multiple qubits over noisy channels, and show that the purification protocol with multi-carrier qubits works through a noisy qubit channel in general, provided that the channels are not entanglement-breaking, i.e., channels that cannot be constructed as measure-and-prepare operations. Our results significantly reduce the experimental overhead needed for distilling entanglement, such as quantum memory and coherent operations, making long-distance pure entanglement closer to a practical realization.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Atmadev Rai, Danilo Triggiani, Paolo Facchi, Vincenzo Tamma</p>
            <p>We present a framework for simultaneously estimating all four real parameters of a general two-channel unitary U(2) with Heisenberg-scaling precision. We derive analytical expressions for the quantum Fisher information matrix and show that all parameters attain the 1/N scaling in the precision by using experimentally feasible Gaussian probes such as two-mode squeezed states or two single-mode squeezed states. Our results extend multiparameter metrology to its most general two-mode setting and establish concrete design principles for experimental implementations of Heisenberg-scaling, multi-parameter optical interferometry with experimentally feasible resources. It not only sheds light on the fundamental interface between quantum interference of squeezed light and quantum metrological advantage in multiparameter estimation, but it also provides an important stepstone towards the development of a wide range of quantum technologies based on distributed quantum metrology in arbitrary optical networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luisa Tolle, Ameneh Sheikhan, Thierry Giamarchi, Corinna Kollath, Catalin-Mihai Halati</p>
            <p>We investigate fermionic atoms subjected to an optical lattice and coupled to a high finesse optical cavity with photon losses. A transverse pump beam introduces a coupling between the atoms and the cavity field. We explore the steady state phase diagram taking fluctuations around the mean-field of the atoms-cavity coupling into account. Our approach allows us to investigate both one- and higher-dimensional atomic systems. The fluctuations beyond mean-field lead to an effective temperature which changes the nature of the self-organization transition. We find a strong dependence of the results on the atomic filling, in particular when contrasting the behavior at low filling and at half filling. At low filling the transition to a self-organized phase takes place at a critical value of the pump strength. In the self-organized phase the cavity field takes a finite expectation value and the atoms show a modulation in the density. Surprisingly, at even larger pump strengths a strongly non-monotonous behavior of the temperature is found and hints towards effects of cavity cooling at many-body resonances. Additionally multiple self-organized stable solutions of the cavity field and the atoms occur, signaling the presence of a fluctuation-induced bistability, with the two solutions having different effective temperatures previously discussed in [Tolle et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 133602 (2025)]. In contrast, at half filling a bistable region arises at the self-organization transition already neglecting the fluctuations. The presence of the fluctuations induce an effective temperature as at lower filling and change the behavior of the transition and the steady states drastically. We analyze the properties of the occurring steady states of the coupled atoms-cavity system.</p>

            <p>Quantum computational chemistry holds great promise for simulating molecular systems more efficiently than classical methods by leveraging quantum bits to represent molecular wavefunctions. However, current implementations face significant limitations in accuracy due to hardware noise and algorithmic constraints. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a hybrid framework that learns molecular wavefunction using a combination of an efficient quantum circuit and a deep neural network. This approach enhances computational efficiency and accuracy, surpassing traditional quantum computational chemistry methods. Numerical benchmarking on molecular systems shows that our hybrid quantum-neural wavefunction approach achieves near-chemical accuracy, comparable to advanced quantum and classical techniques. Experimental validation on a superconducting quantum computer, using the isomerization reaction of cyclobutadiene, further demonstrates its practical applicability, with high accuracy in energy estimation and significant resilience to noise.</p>

            <p>We study quantum imaging by applying the resolvable expressive capacity (REC) formalism developed for physical neural networks (PNNs). In this paradigm of quantum learning, the imaging system functions as a physical learning device that maps input parameters to measurable features, while complex practical tasks are handled by training only the output weights, enabled by the systematic identification of well-estimated features (eigentasks) and their corresponding sample thresholds. Using this framework, we analyze both direct imaging and superresolution strategies for compact sources, defined as sources with sizes bounded below the Rayleigh limit. In particular, we introduce the orthogonalized SPADE method-a nontrivial generalization of existing superresolution techniques-that achieves superior performance when multiple compact sources are closely spaced. This method relaxes the earlier superresolution studies' strong assumption that the entire source must lie within the Rayleigh limit, marking an important step toward developing more general and practically applicable approaches. Using concrete examples involving complex structured sources and classification tasks, we demonstrate the superior performance of our orthogonalized SPADE method and highlight key advantages of the quantum learning approach-its ability to tackle complex imaging tasks and enhance performance by selectively extracting well-estimated features.</p>

            <h2>On the quantum computational complexity of classical linear dynamics with geometrically local interactions: Dequantization and universality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kazuki Sakamoto, Keisuke Fujii</p>
            <p>The simulation of large-scale classical systems in exponentially small space on quantum computers has gained attention. The prior work demonstrated that a quantum algorithm offers an exponential speedup over any classical algorithm in simulating classical dynamics with long-range interactions. However, many real-world classical systems, such as those arising from partial differential equations, exhibit only local interactions. The question remains whether quantum algorithms can still provide exponential speedup under this condition. In this work, we thoroughly characterize the computational complexity of quantum algorithms for simulating such geometrically local systems. First, we dequantize the quantum algorithm for simulating short-time (polynomial-time) dynamics of such systems. This implies that the problem of simulating this dynamics does not yield any exponential quantum advantage. Second, we show that quantum algorithms for short-time dynamics have the same computational complexity as polynomial-time probabilistic classical computation. Third, we show that the computational complexity of quantum algorithms for long-time (exponential-time) dynamics is captured by exponential-time and polynomial-space quantum computation. This suggests a super-polynomial time advantage when restricting the computation to polynomial-space, or an exponential space advantage otherwise. This work offers new insights into the complexity of classical dynamics governed by partial differential equations, providing a pathway for achieving quantum advantage in practical problems.</p>

            <h2>Towards an Experimental Device-Independent Verification of Indefinite Causal Order</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Carla M. D. Richter, Michael Antesberger, Huan Cao, Philip Walther, Lee A. Rozema</p>
            <p>In classical physics, events follow a definite causal order: the past influences the future, but not the reverse. Quantum theory, however, permits superpositions of causal orders -- so-called indefinite causal orders -- which can provide operational advantages over classical scenarios. Verifying such phenomena has sparked significant interest, much like earlier efforts devoted to refuting local realism and confirming quantum entanglement. To date, demonstrations of indefinite causal order have all been based a process called the quantum switch and have relied on device-dependent or semi-device-independent protocols. A recent theoretical development introduced a Bell-like inequality that allows for fully device-independent verification of indefinite causal order in a quantum switch. Here we implement this verification by experimentally violating this inequality. In particular, we measure a value of $1.8328 \pm 0.0045$, which is 18 standard deviations above the classical bound of $1.75$. Our work presents the first implementation of a device-independent protocol to verify indefinite causal order, albeit in the presence of experimental loopholes. This represents an important step towards the device-independent verification of an indefinite causal order, and provides a context in which to identify loopholes specifically related to the verification of indefinite causal order.</p>

            <p>We offer the first operational interpretation of the {\alpha}-z relative entropies, a measure of distinguishability between two quantum states introduced by Jakšić et al. and Audenaert and Datta. We show that these relative entropies appear when formulating conditions for large-sample or catalytic relative majorization of pairs of flat states and certain generalizations of them. Indeed, we show that such transformations exist if and only if all the {\alpha}-z relative entropies of the two pairs are ordered. In this setting, the {\alpha} and z parameters are truly independent from each other. These results also yield an expression for the optimal rate of converting one flat state pair into another. Our methods use real-algebraic techniques involving preordered semirings and certain monotone homomorphisms and derivations on them.</p>

            <p>We define the Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability representation of quantum mechanics associated with the Fourier transform over second countable locally compact abelian groups. We discuss its link with the Kohn-Nirenberg quantization of the phase space $G\times \widehat{G}$. We use it to argue that in this abstract setting the Wigner-Weyl quantization, when it exists, can still be interpreted as a symmetric ordering. Then, we identify all generalized (non-normalizable) pure states having a positive Kirkwood-Dirac distribution. They are, up to the natural action of the Weyl-Heisenberg group, Haar measures on closed subgroups. This generalizes a result known for finite abelian groups. We then show that the classical fragment of quantum mechanics associated with the Kirkwood-Dirac distribution is non-trivial if and only if the group has a compact connected component. Finally, we provide for connected compact abelian groups a complete geometric description of this classical fragment.</p>

            <p>Practical implementations of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) often deviate from the theoretical protocols, exposing the implementations to various attacks even when the underlying (ideal) protocol is proven secure. We present new analysis tools and methodologies for quantum cybersecurity, adapting the concepts of vulnerabilities, attack surfaces, and exploits from classical cybersecurity to QKD implementation attacks. We also present three additional concepts, derived from the connection between classical and quantum cybersecurity: "Quantum Fuzzing", which is the first tool for black-box vulnerability research on QKD implementations; "Reversed-Space Attacks", which are a generic exploit method using the attack surface of imperfect receivers; and concrete quantum-mechanical definitions of "Quantum Side-Channel Attacks" and "Quantum State-Channel Attacks", meaningfully distinguishing them from each other and from other attacks. Using our tools, we analyze multiple existing QKD attacks and show that the "Bright Illumination" attack could have been found even with minimal knowledge of the device implementation. This work begins to bridge the gap between current analysis methods for experimental attacks on QKD implementations and the decades-long research in the field of classical cybersecurity, improving the practical security of QKD products and enhancing their usefulness in real-world systems.</p>

Many types of quantum machine learning methods have been released, such as Quantum Annealer, Quantum Neural Network, Variational Quantum Algorithms, and Quantum Reservoir Computers. They can work, consuming far less energy for networks of equivalent size. Quantum Reservoir Computers, in particular, have no limit on the size of input data. However, their accuracy is not enough for practical use, and the effort to improve accuracy is mainly focused on hardware improvements. Therefore, we propose the approach from software called Quantum Reservoir Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), which uses Quantum Reservoir Computers as a generator of GAN. We performed the generation of handwritten single digits and monochrome pictures on the CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST datasets. As a result, Quantum Reservoir GAN is confirmed to be more accurate than Quantum GAN, Classical Neural Network, and ordinary Quantum Reservoir Computers.</p>

            <p>In quantum optics, the postselection amplitude of a nondegenerate parametric down-conversion (PDC) process is linked to a beamsplitter (BS) via partial time reversal, up to a normalization coefficient which is related to the parametric gain [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 117, 33107 (2020)]. A special example where the gain is low is reminiscent of Klyshko's advanced-wave picture in quantum imaging. Here, we propose and prove a generalized duality for multiple spatial paths connecting a quantum nonlinear interference setup consisting of nondegenerate PDCs and linear optical systems to a linear one, where the PDCs are directly replaced by hypothetical wavelength-shifting BSs. This replacement preserves the geometry of the original setup, and cascaded PDCs become optical cavities whose calculation involves the Redheffer star product. Additional terms in the normalization coefficient are related to the contribution of looping photons inside the cavities. Then, we discuss the case of coherent state input and postselection for $Q$-function calculation. This theorem will be helpful in the development of quantum photonic devices beyond the low-gain limit.</p>

            <p>Quantum batteries, which are energy-storage or state-storage devices that exploit unique quantum effects, are sensitive to environmental noise. Here, we demonstrate that suitably engineered noise can induce a "Zeno-like" stabilization effect of the charging process in a spin-chain quantum battery within the Heisenberg XYZ model. Focusing on a system size N=6, which balances computational cost and storage capacity, we find that the ergotropy-to-energy ratio W(t)/E_B(t) attains a maximum value of about 0.99 at a certain time parameter value. Then, by varying the noise strength in each channel, we find that not only does decoherence merely degrade performance but it may also stabilize stored energy and ergotropy in the high noise strength regime. For instance, the phase-flip channel slows charging and reduces charging power, but its discharging behavior releases energy and ergotropy more slowly, allowing the battery to be used for longer times compared to bit-flip and bit-phase-flip channels. In contrast, the bit-flip channel enables fast charging, but yields low storage and rapid energy release. Remarkably, the bit-phase-flip channel can combine the advantages of both bit-flip and phase-flip channels in the high-noise-strength regime. The bit-phase-flip channel supports accelerated charging together with enhanced storage capacity, while its discharging behavior resembles that of the bit-flip channel with rapid energy release. These results reveal that, under sufficiently strong noise, environmental decoherence induces a Zeno-like stabilization, allowing it to achieve enhanced charging performance and to stabilize stored energy and ergotropy in the spin-chain quantum battery.</p>

            <h2>Geometric Discord of any arbitrary dimensional bipartite system and its application in quantum key distribution</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rashi Jain, Satyabrata Adhikari</p>
            <p>Entangled quantum states are regarded as a key resource in quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols. However, quantum correlations, other than entanglement can also play a significant role the QKD protocols. In this work, we will focus on one such measure of quantum correlation, known as geometric quantum discord (GQD). Firstly, we derive an analytical expression of GQD for two-qutrit quantum systems and further generalize it for $d_1\otimes d_2$ dimensional systems. Next, we apply the concept of GQD in studying QKD. In particular, we derive the lower bound for a distillable secret key rate $K_D$ in terms of GQD when two communicating parties uses private states for generating a secret key in the presence of an eavesdropper. The lower bound of $K_D$ depends upon the GQD of $\frac{\sigma_0+\sigma_1}{2}$ and $\frac{\sigma_2+\sigma_3}{2}$, where $\sigma_i$'s, $i=0,1,2,3$ are the density matrices. We find that for a certain range of GQD, the successful generation of the secret key is not guaranteed. We further study the behavior of distillable key rate when the geometric discord of $\frac{\sigma_0+\sigma_1}{2}$ and $\frac{\sigma_2+\sigma_3}{2}$ increases, decreases or remains constant, with the help of a few examples. Moreover, we find that even when $\sigma_i$'s are separable or positive partial transpose entangled states, the distillable key can still be generated.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daiki Suruga</p>
            <p>Estimating properties of unknown unitary operations is a fundamental task in quantum information science. While full unitary tomography requires a number of samples to the unknown unitary scaling linearly with the dimension (implying exponentially with the number of qubits), estimating specific functions of a unitary can be significantly more efficient. In this paper, we present a unified framework for the sample-efficient estimation of arbitrary square integrable functions $f: \mathbf{U}(d) \to \mathbb{C}$, using only access to the controlled-unitary operation. We first provide a tight characterization of the optimal sample complexity when the accuracy is measured by the averaged bias over the unitary $\mathbf{U}(d)$. We then construct a sample-efficient estimation algorithm that becomes optimal under the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning criterion for various classes of functions. Applications include optimal estimation of matrix elements of irreducible representations, the trace, determinant, and general polynomial functions on $\mathbf{U}(d)$. Our technique generalize the Hadamard test and leverage tools from representation theory, yielding both lower and upper bound on sample complexity.</p>

By carefully optimizing the parameters of qubits and couplers, we achieve a simulated fidelity over 99% within 194ns, surpassing the decomposed methods with single-qubit and two-qubit gates in both latency and overall fidelity. Crucially, the scheme is robust against parameter drifts and can be extended to CCPhase({\theta}) gates with arbitrary angles and multi-qubit operations. All these results highlight the advantages of our scheme which paves the way for substantial depth compression of complex quantum circuits for practical application in transformative quantum algorithms and simulations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi Tian, Y. Zheng, Xiaoting Wang, Ching-Yi Lai</p>
            <p>Efficient and realistic error decoding is crucial for fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC) on near-term devices. While decoding is a classical post-processing task, its effectiveness depends on accurately modeling quantum noise, which is hardware-dependent. In particular, correlated bit-flip ($X$) and phase-flip ($Z$) errors often arise under circuit-level noise. We introduce the Iterative Reweighting Minimum-Weight Perfect Matching (IRMWPM) decoder, which systematically incorporates such correlations to enhance quantum error correction. Our method leverages fault-detection patterns to guide reweighting: correlated $X$ and $Z$ detection events are identified, and their conditional probabilities update weights on the primal and dual lattices. This iterative procedure improves handling of realistic error propagation in a hardware-agnostic yet noise-aware manner. We prove that IRMWPM converges in finite time while preserving the distance guarantee of MWPM. Numerical results under circuit-level noise show substantial improvements. For distances $\geq 17$ and physical error rates $\leq 0.001$, IRMWPM reduces logical error rates by over 20x with only a few iterations. It also raises the accuracy threshold from 1% to 1.16%, making it practical for near-term real-time decoding. Extrapolated estimates suggest that to reach logical error rate $10^{-16}$, IRMWPM requires distance $d=31$, while standard MWPM needs $d=50$, implying a major reduction in qubit overhead.</p>

            <p>Tensor parameters that are amortized or regularized over large tensor powers, often called "asymptotic" tensor parameters, play a central role in several areas including algebraic complexity theory (constructing fast matrix multiplication algorithms), quantum information (entanglement cost and distillable entanglement), and additive combinatorics (bounds on cap sets, sunflower-free sets, etc.). Examples are the asymptotic tensor rank, asymptotic slice rank and asymptotic subrank. Recent works (Costa-Dalai, Blatter-Draisma-Rupniewski, Christandl-Gesmundo-Zuiddam) have investigated notions of discreteness (no accumulation points) or "gaps" in the values of such tensor parameters. We prove a general discreteness theorem for asymptotic tensor parameters of order-three tensors and use this to prove that (1) over any finite field (and in fact any finite set of coefficients in any field), the asymptotic subrank and the asymptotic slice rank have no accumulation points, and (2) over the complex numbers, the asymptotic slice rank has no accumulation points. Central to our approach are two new general lower bounds on the asymptotic subrank of tensors, which measures how much a tensor can be diagonalized. The first lower bound says that the asymptotic subrank of any concise three-tensor is at least the cube-root of the smallest dimension. The second lower bound says that any concise three-tensor that is "narrow enough" (has one dimension much smaller than the other two) has maximal asymptotic subrank. Our proofs rely on new lower bounds on the maximum rank in matrix subspaces that are obtained by slicing a three-tensor in the three different directions. We prove that for any concise tensor, the product of any two such maximum ranks must be large, and as a consequence there are always two distinct directions with large max-rank.</p>

For the former, we pick the representative example of computing avoided crossings in the H4 molecule in a rectangular geometry, and demonstrate that we obtain results to within about 1.2% of the full configuration interaction value on the D-Wave Advantage system 4.1 hardware. We carry out analyses on the effect of the number of shots, anneal time, and the choice of Lagrange multiplier on our obtained results.

            <p>High-fidelity multi-qubit gates are a critical resource for near-term quantum computing, as they underpin the execution of both quantum algorithms and fault-tolerant protocols. The Toffoli gate (CCNOT), in particular, plays a central role in quantum error correction and quantum arithmetic, yet its efficient implementation on current quantum hardware remains limited by noise and connectivity constraints. In this work, we present a hardware-aware characterization of the Toffoli gate using optimized, connectivity-compliant decompositions executed on IBM's 127-qubit superconducting quantum processors. Our study integrates state preparation, gate synthesis, and quantum state/process tomography (QST/QPT) to evaluate fidelity across three distinct classes of input states: Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ), W, and the uniform superposition of all three-qubit computational basis states -- under noise-free simulation, noise-aware emulation, and real hardware execution. For GHZ states, we report state fidelities of 98.442% (noise-free simulation), 81.470% (noise-aware quantum emulation), and 56.368% (real quantum hardware). For W states, state fidelities are 98.739%, 79.900%, and 63.689%, respectively, and for the uniform superposition state, we observe state fidelities of 99.490%, 85.469%, and 61.161%.

            <h2>Efficient Preparation of Resource States for Hamiltonian Simulation and Universal Quantum Computation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thierry N. Kaldenbach, Isaac D. Smith, Hendrik Poulsen Nautrup, Matthias Heller, Hans J. Briegel</p>
            <p>The direct compilation of algorithm-specific graph states in measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) can lead to resource reductions in terms of circuit depth, entangling gates, and even the number of physical qubits. In this work, we extend previous studies on algorithm-tailored graph states to periodic sequences of generalized Pauli rotations, which commonly appear in, e.g., Trotterized Hamiltonian simulation. We first implement an enhanced simulated-annealing-based algorithm to find optimal periodic graph states within local-Clifford (LC-)MBQC. In addition, we derive a novel scheme for the preparation of resource states based on a graph state and a ladder of CNOT gates, which we term anticommutation-based (AC-)MBQC, since it uncovers a direct relationship between the graph state and the anticommutation matrix for the set of Hamilonians generating the computation. We also deploy our two approaches to derive universal resource states from minimal universal sets of generating Hamiltonians, thus providing a straightforward algorithm for finding the former. Finally, we demonstrate and compare both of our methods based on various examples from condensed matter physics and universal quantum computation.</p>

            <p>Quantum error correction protocols require rapid and repeated qubit measurements. While multiplexed readout in superconducting quantum systems improves efficiency, fast probe pulses introduce spectral broadening, leading to signal leakage into neighboring readout resonators. This crosstalk results in qubit dephasing and degraded readout fidelity. Here, we introduce a pulse shaping technique inspired by the derivative removal by adiabatic gate (DRAG) protocol to suppress measurement crosstalk during fast readout. By engineering a spectral notch at neighboring resonator frequencies, the method effectively mitigates spurious signal interference. Our approach integrates seamlessly with existing readout architectures, enabling fast, low-crosstalk multiplexed measurements without additional hardware overhead -- a critical advancement for scalable quantum computing.</p>

            <h2>Room Temperature Single Photon Detection at 1550 nm using van der Waals Heterojunction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nithin Abraham, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Kausik Majumdar</p>
            <p>Single-photon detectors (SPDs) are crucial in applications ranging from space, biological imaging to quantum communication and information processing. The SPDs that operate at room temperature are of particular interest to broader application space as the energy overhead introduced by the cryogenic cooling can be avoided. Although silicon-based single photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) are well matured and operate at room temperature, the bandgap limitation restricts their operation at telecommunication wavelength (1550 nm) and beyond. InGaAs-based SPADs, on the other hand, are sensitive to 1550 nm photons, but suffer from relatively lower efficiency, high dark count rate, afterpulsing probability, and pose hazards to the environment from the fabrication process. In this work, we demonstrate how we can leverage the properties of nanomaterials to address these challenges and realise a room temperature single-photon detector capable of operating at 1550 nm. We achieve this by coupling a low bandgap ($\sim 350~meV$) absorber (black phosphorus) to a sensitive van der Waals probe that is capable of detecting discrete electron fluctuation. We optimize the device for operation at $1550~nm$ and demonstrate an overall quantum efficiency of $21.4\%$ (estimated as $42.8\%$ for polarized light), and a minimum dark count of $\sim 720~Hz$ at room temperature.</p>

            <p>Quantum random number generators play a vital role in securing communication and encryption. In the present work, we have produced bright twin beams using four-wave mixing in a double-{\Lambda} configuration in rubidium-85 vapor and generated two strings of highly correlated random numbers. The randomness originates from the probabilistic nature of the intensity fluctuations of the twin beams and the quantum correlations are certified by measuring the intensity-difference squeezing in the generated twin beams. At an analysis frequency of 2 MHz, we have measured 95% correlation between the random intensity fluctuations of the twin beams. We observe over 5 bits/sample of entropy from the quantum fluctuations of the twin beams. Furthermore, to extract identical strings of random numbers, post-selection of the binned data and hashing algorithms are used, leading to a binary string of random numbers at a rate of 6 Mbps that passes standard statistical tests from NIST and TestU01. Here, the simplicity of generating bright twin beams shows the potential of this method in quantum cryptography and quantum communication.</p>

            <p>The necessary and sufficient conditions for the stability of adiabatic states in three-level quantum systems are investigated analytically and numerically. Various possible configurations of three-level systems under exact two-photon resonance are considered. It is shown that in all these schemes, the lifetime of the studied states is determined by the dephasing time between levels that are not connected by a dipole transition. An efficient population transfer through the b-state at room temperature is demonstrated despite relatively long relaxation times. It is also demonstrated that, in case of large one-photon detuning, the so-called b-state has the same lifetime as that of the dark state. The evolution of adiabatic states for arbitrary values of single-photon detunings has been studied numerically.</p>

            <p>Dense and shallow ensembles of negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy centers (NV$^-$) with good optical and spin properties play a key role in the performance enhancement of diamond-based quantum sensors. Ion implantation enables precise control of NV$^-$ depth and density. However, at high ion fluence, this method is limited by low NV$^-$ creation yields and sample amorphization. Additionally, shallow NV$^-$ spin properties deteriorate due to surface proximity. In this paper, we study N$_2^+$ ion implantation at energies between 10 and 15 keV with fluences as high as 1e15 ions/cm2 at temperatures of 20, 400 and 800°C to investigate the influence of implantation temperature on lattice damage, NV$^-$ creation yield and NV$^-$ spin properties. Our results show that diamond maintains structural integrity at 800°C with fluences up to 1e15 ions/cm2 without amorphization. Furthermore, high-temperature implantation improves NV$^-$ creation yields up to five times without compromising T2$^*$, T2 and T1, making it a promising approach to enhance the magnetic field sensitivity of NV$^-$ ensembles.</p>

Here, we report the first demonstration of massively parallel, wavelength-resolved photon bunching, revealing Hanbury Brown-Twiss correlations across 100 independent spectral channels. These observations are enabled by a fast, data-driven single-photon spectrometer that achieves 40 pm spectral and 40 ps temporal resolution over a 10 nm bandwidth, allowing simultaneous access to spectro-temporal photon correlations without the need for narrowband filtering. This approach preserves photon flux while enabling high-dimensional quantum interference measurements across a broad spectrum.

            <p>The multimode ultrastrong coupling (USC) regime has emerged as a novel platform for accessing previously inaccessible phenomena in cavity quantum electrodynamics. Of particular interest are cavity-mediated correlations between local and nonlocal excitations, or equivalently, between modes at zero and finite in-plane momentum modes, which offer new opportunities for controlling light--matter interactions across space. However, direct experimental evidence of such interactions has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate nonlocal multimode coupling in a Landau polariton system, where cavity photons simultaneously interact with the zero-momentum cyclotron resonance and finite-momentum magnetoplasmons of a two-dimensional electron gas in a GaAs quantum well. Our slot cavities, with their subwavelength mode volumes, supply in-plane momentum components that enable the excitation of finite-momentum matter modes. Terahertz time-domain magnetospectroscopy measurements reveal a clear splitting of the upper-polariton branch, arising from hybridization between magnetoplasmon modes and the cavity--cyclotron-resonance hybrids. Extracted coupling strengths confirm USC of the cyclotron resonance and strong coupling of the magnetoplasmon modes to the cavity field, respectively. The experimental results are well captured by the multimode Hopfield model and finite-element simulations. These findings establish a pathway for engineering multimode light--matter interactions involving zero- and finite-momentum matter modes in the USC regime.</p>

            <p>Optical parametric amplifiers and oscillators are among the best-developed quantum light sources, having already been adopted in precision measurement and underpinning various quantum computing and communication paradigms. Meanwhile, progress in photonic structures such as Bragg gratings has enabled distributed feedback oscillators to become widely established as classical laser sources with desirable properties. Recent work in fabricating and processing photonic structures in nonlinear media opens the path to combining these two programs to realize distributed feedback parametric oscillators. Such devices have great potential as sources of quantum light, especially for squeezed vacuum, a crucial resource state in emerging quantum technologies. In this study, an analytic and fully quantum-mechanical model of the dynamics of such devices is presented. This approach gives explicit results for the key properties of these sources, including the parametric oscillation pump threshold, intracavity mode, tunability, and quantum statistics of the output modes. These results underpin future work on a versatile class of next-generation quantum light source.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. A. Semenov, M. Klen, I. Pechonkin</p>
            <p>Quantum light propagation through turbulent atmosphere has become a subject of intensive research, spanning both theoretical and experimental studies. This interest is driven by its important applications in free-space quantum communication, remote quantum sensing, and environmental monitoring. At the same time, this phenomenon itself poses an intriguing fundamental problem. A consistent theoretical description typically makes explicit assumptions about the measurement scheme at the receiver station and/or the method of quantum-information encoding. A common and straightforward approach encodes the information in quantum states of a quasi-monochromatic mode, representing a pulsed Gaussian beam. Atmospheric turbulence induces random distortions of the pulse shape and, consequently, random fluctuations of the transmittance through the receiver aperture. These fluctuations, characterized by the probability distribution of transmittance (PDT), directly affect the quantum state of the received light. In this paper we examine various analytical models of the PDT, validate them through numerical simulations, and assess their range of applicability. Furthermore, we extend the analysis beyond the standard ensemble-averaging approach, recognizing that realistic experiments typically involve time averaging. This requires a detailed examination of the underlying random process, including the study of temporal correlations and their impact on nonclassical properties of electromagnetic radiation.</p>

            <h2>High-order Magnus Expansion for Hamiltonian Simulation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Di Fang, Diyi Liu, Shuchen Zhu</p>
            <p>Efficient simulation of quantum dynamics with time-dependent Hamiltonians is important not only for time-varying systems but also for time-independent Hamiltonians in the interaction picture. Such simulations are more challenging than their time-independent counterparts due to the complexity introduced by time ordering. Existing algorithms that aim to capture commutator-based scaling either exhibit polynomial cost dependence on the Hamiltonian's time derivatives or are limited to low-order accuracy. In this work, we establish the general commutator-scaling error bounds for the truncated Magnus expansion at arbitrary order, where only Hamiltonian terms appear in the nested commutators, with no time derivatives involved. Building on this analysis, we design a high-order quantum algorithm with explicit circuit constructions. The algorithm achieves cost scaling with the commutator structure in the high-precision regime and depends only logarithmically on the Hamiltonian's time variation, making it efficient for general time-dependent settings, including the interaction picture.</p>

            <p>Quantum Machine Learning (QML) integrates quantum computation with classical Machine Learning (ML) and holds the potential to achieve the quantum advantage for specific tasks. In classical ML, Machine Unlearning (MU) is a crucial strategy for removing the influence of specified training data from a model, to meet regulatory requirements and mitigate privacy risks. However, both the risk of training-data membership leakage remains underexplored in QML. This motivates us to propose Quantum Machine Unlearning (QMU) to explore two core questions: do QML models require MU due to training-data membership leakage, and can MU mechanisms be efficiently implemented in the QML? To answer the two questions, we conducted experiments on the MNIST classification task, utilizing a class-wise unlearning paradigm in both noiseless simulations and quantum hardware. First, we quantify training-data privacy leakage using a Membership Inference Attack (MIA), observing average success rates of 90.2\% in noiseless simulations and 75.3\% on quantum hardware. These results indicate that QML models present training-data membership leakage with very high probability under adversarial access, motivating the need for MU. Second, we implement MU algorithms on the QML model, which reduces the average MIA success rate to 0\% in simulations and 3.7\% on quantum hardware while preserving accuracy on retained data. We conclude that implementing MU mechanisms in QML models renders them resistant to MIA. Overall, this paper reveals significant privacy vulnerabilities in QML models and provides effective corresponding defense strategies, providing a potential path toward privacy-preserving QML systems.</p>

            <h2>The Efficiency Frontier: Classical Shadows versus Quantum Footage</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shuowei Ma, Junyu Liu</p>
            <p>Interfacing quantum and classical processors is an important subroutine in full-stack quantum algorithms. The so-called "classical shadow" method efficiently extracts essential classical information from quantum states, enabling the prediction of many properties of a quantum system from only a few measurements. However, for a small number of highly non-local observables, or when classical post-processing power is limited, the classical shadow method is not always the most efficient choice. Here, we address this issue quantitatively by performing a full-stack resource analysis that compares classical shadows with ``quantum footage," which refers to direct quantum measurement. Under certain assumptions, our analysis illustrates a boundary of download efficiency between classical shadows and quantum footage. For observables expressed as linear combinations of Pauli matrices, the classical shadow method outperforms direct measurement when the number of observables is large and the Pauli weight is small. For observables in the form of large Hermitian sparse matrices, the classical shadow method shows an advantage when the number of observables, the sparsity of the matrix, and the number of qubits fall within a certain range. The key parameters influencing this behavior include the number of qubits $n$, observables $M$, sparsity $k$, Pauli weight $w$, accuracy requirement $\epsilon$, and failure tolerance $\delta$. We also compare the resource consumption of the two methods on different types of quantum computers and identify break-even points where the classical shadow method becomes more efficient, which vary depending on the hardware. This paper opens a new avenue for quantitatively designing optimal strategies for hybrid quantum-classical tomography and provides practical insights for selecting the most suitable quantum measurement approach in real-world applications.</p>

            <p>Advanced quantum technologies rely on non-Gaussian states of light, essential for universal quantum computation, fault-tolerant error correction, and quantum sensing. Their practical realization, however, faces hurdles: simulating large multi-mode generators is computationally demanding, and benchmarks such as the \emph{stellar rank} do not capture how effectively photon detections yield useful non-Gaussianity. We address these challenges by introducing the \emph{non-Gaussian control parameters} $(s_0,\delta_0)$, a continuous and operational measure that goes beyond stellar rank. Leveraging these parameters, we develop a universal optimization method that reduces photon-number requirements and greatly enhances success probabilities while preserving state quality. Applied to the Gottesman--Kitaev--Preskill (GKP) state generation, for example, our method cuts the required photon detections by a factor of three and raises the preparation probability by nearly $10^8$. Demonstrations across cat states, cubic phase states, GKP states, and even random states confirm broad gains in experimental feasibility. Our results provide a unifying principle for resource-efficient non-Gaussian state generation, charting a practical route toward scalable optical quantum technologies and fault-tolerant quantum computation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Devon Campbell</p>
            <p>Quantum processors are often affected by biased noise and noisy readout, which reduce reliability and reproducibility. This work combines two complementary strategies to address these challenges. The first is bias tailoring, which aligns stabilizers with the dominant error type. The second is single-shot (SS) decoding, which uses metachecks to identify measurement faults from just one noisy round. We implement these ideas in a four-dimensional lifted hypergraph product (4D-LHP) code constructed from quasi-cyclic protograph seeds. Simulation results show that bias tailoring lowers the word-error rate (WER) by 20-60 percent across realistic Z:X bias ratios (from 1:1 up to 1000:1), with the largest improvements at moderate bias. When measurement noise is present, a single SS round recovers more than one third of the performance lost to readout errors. Moreover, metachecks identify over 99.8 percent of faulty syndromes, providing near-complete fault visibility even with limited correction power. Together, these findings demonstrate that 4D-LHP codes maintain strong resilience under realistic noise, making them promising candidates for integration into orchestrated QPU-CPU workflows.</p>

Experiments show that targeted hammering induces localized errors confined to the attack cycle and primarily manifests as phase noise, as confirmed by near 50% flip rates under Hadamard-basis probing. A full lattice sweep maps QR's spatial and temporal behavior, revealing reproducible corruption limited to qubits within two coupling hops and rapid recovery in subsequent benign cycles. Finally, we leverage these properties to outline a prime-and-probe covert channel, demonstrating that the clear separability between hammered and benign rounds enables highly reliable signaling without error correction. These findings underscore the need for hardware-level isolation and scheduler-aware defenses as multi-tenant quantum computing becomes standard.</p>

We realize a tunable, state-resolved laser-induced loss channel for individual Rydberg atoms, in both non-interacting and strongly correlated settings. This capability allows us to reveal interaction-driven shifts of the exceptional point separating quantum Zeno and anti-Zeno regimes, and to demonstrate interaction-enhanced decay. By exploiting interaction-dependent energy level shifts, we observe a configuration-selective two-body Zeno effect that freezes target spin states. We theoretically show that when this mechanism is extended to many-body chains it allows for the dissipative distillation of unwanted spin configurations. These experimental studies establish a versatile approach for exploring strongly interacting, open quantum spin systems, and opens possible new routines for dissipative preparation of correlated quantum states in Rydberg atom arrays.</p>

We present an entanglement distillation protocol based on the [[4,2,2]] quantum error-detecting code, deriving analytical expressions for its output fidelity and yield, and benchmarking it against the BBPSSW protocol. In addition to initial distillation, we investigate a re-distillation strategy in which stored logical entangled states are refreshed using only local operations and classical communication, avoiding the need to regenerate and redistribute entanglement from scratch. Our analysis shows that this method can extend the effective storage lifetime beyond BBPSSW,with its performance advantage primarily determined by classical communication delay. We derive upper bounds on classical communication latency required for the approach to maintain superiority. This work introduces a framework for treating quantum memories as reusable resources and links distillation strategy to practical implementation constraints, offering quantitative guidance for designing resilient quantum networks.</p>

This work provides the first step in this direction. We introduce a worst-case noise model and use it to derive success probabilities for preparing a GHZ state and preparing a $W$-state using either an adaptive quantum algorithm, or using a standard non-adaptive quantum algorithm. Next, we implemented these protocols on quantum hardware and we compare the outcomes to our derived theoretical results. We find that despite their potential, adaptive quantum algorithms currently do not outperform full quantum algorithms.</p>

Crucially, the scheme is robust against parameter drifts and can be extended to CCPhase({\theta}) gates with arbitrary angles and multi-qubit operations.

We here develop a general theory to control an $N$-node bosonic network governed by the time-dependent Hamiltonian, as the universal quantum control theory for continuous-variable systems. In particular, we can activate nonadiabatic passages superposed of initial and target modes by the commutation condition for the Hamiltonian's coefficient matrix in the representation of time-independent ancillary modes, which serves as the necessary and sufficient condition to solve the time-dependent Schrödinger equation of the entire network. To exemplify the versatility of our theory on the Heisenberg-picture passages, we perform arbitrary state exchange between two nodes, chiral NOON-state transfer among three bosonic nodes, and chiral Fock-state transfer among three of four bosonic nodes. Our work provides a promising avenue toward universal control of any pair of nodes or modes in bosonic networks as well as the whole network.</p>

            <h2>Construction of PPT entangled state and its detection by using second-order moment of the partial transposition</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rohit Kumar, Satyabrata Adhikari</p>
            <p>In this work, we adopt a formalism by which we construct a new family of positive partial transpose (PPT) states, which includes separable and PPT entangled states (PPTES) in a $d_{1}\otimes d_{2}$ dimensional system and then derive a condition that can distinguish between them. The PPT condition is expressed in terms of the inequality between the second-order moment of the system's partial transposition $(p_2)$ and the reciprocal of the product of $d_{1}$ and $d_{2}$. The second order moment $(p_{2})$ plays a vital role in detecting the PPT states as it is very easy to calculate and may be a realizable quantity in an experiment. Once we know that the given state is a PPT state, we will use a suitable witness operator to detect whether the given PPT state is a PPTES. Further, we have established a relation between the second and third order moments of partial transposition of a PPT state and have shown that the violation of the inequality implies that the detected state is a negative partial transpose (NPT) entangled state. We will then construct a quantum state by considering the mixture of a separable and an entangled state and obtain a condition on the mixing parameter for which the mixture represents a PPT entangled state. We observe that the resulting PPT entangled state may also be detected by the same witness operator $W$, which had detected the entangled state present in the mixture. Finally, applying our results, we have shown that the distillable key rate of the private state, prepared through our prescription, is positive. It suggests that our result also has potential applications in quantum cryptography.</p>

            <h2>Reaffirming a Challenge to Bohmian Mechanics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jan Klaers, Violetta Sharoglazova, Marius Puplauskis</p>
            <p>In our recent work (Sharoglazova et al., Nature 643, 67 (2025)), we reported the first measurement of the speed of tunnelling particles using a coupled waveguide system. The measured speed was found to be in disagreement with the standard guiding equation of Bohmian mechanics, which we regard as a challenge to that framework. In the present article, we provide a more detailed account of this issue. In particular, we argue that reformulating the Bohmian guiding equation so as to extend our results on the particle speed to the trajectory level yields a convergence between the predictions of Bohmian mechanics and standard quantum mechanics for tunnelling and related phenomena. Our findings therefore challenge Bohmian mechanics to justify or revise its reliance on the standard guiding equation-an issue that has so far not been addressed.</p>

            <h2>Dissipation-Enhanced Localization in a Disorder-Free $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Lattice Gauge System</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xuanpu Yang, Xiang-Ping Jiang, Lei Pan</p>
            <p>The $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge model, as the simplest realization of a lattice gauge theory, exhibits rich and unconventional physics. One of its most remarkable features is disorder-free localization, where localization emerges not from explicit quenched disorder but from static background $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge charges, leading to persistent memory of the initial state. In this work, we investigate the dissipative dynamics of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge model by coupling it to a Markovian environment. We find that quantum dissipation can enhance localization: memory of the initial state is retained more robustly under dissipative evolution than under unitary dynamics. This dissipation-induced enhancement of localization persists across a variety of initial states, indicating that the effect is not limited to fine-tuned configurations. Our results demonstrate that dissipation, often associated with decoherence and thermalization, can in fact serve as a powerful tool for stabilizing non-ergodic behavior in gauge-constrained quantum systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Borja Aizpurua, Sukhbinder Singh, Román Orús</p>
            <p>We address the problem of implementing bottleneck layers from classical pre-trained neural networks on a quantum computer, with the goal of achieving quantum advantage on near-term devices. Our approach begins with a compression step in which the target linear layer is represented as an effective matrix product operator (MPO) without degrading model performance. The MPO is then further disentangled into a more compact form. This enables a hybrid classical-quantum execution scheme, where the disentangling circuits are deployed on a quantum computer while the remainder of the network -- including the disentangled MPO -- runs on classical hardware. We introduce two complementary algorithms for MPO disentangling: (i) an explicitly disentangling variational method leveraging standard tensor-network optimization techniques, and (ii) an implicitly disentangling gradient-descent-based approach. We validate these methods through a proof-of-concept translation of simple classical neural networks for MNIST and CIFAR-10 image classification into a hybrid classical-quantum form.</p>

            <h2>Enhancing Fault-Tolerant Surface Code Decoding with Iterative Lattice Reweighting</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi Tian, Yi-Cong Zheng, Xiaoting Wang, Ching-Yi Lai</p>
            <p>Efficient and realistic error decoding is crucial for fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC) on near-term devices. While decoding is a classical post-processing task, its effectiveness depends on accurately modeling quantum noise, which is hardware-dependent. In particular, correlated bit-flip ($X$) and phase-flip ($Z$) errors often arise under circuit-level noise. We introduce the Iterative Reweighting Minimum-Weight Perfect Matching (IRMWPM) decoder, which systematically incorporates such correlations to enhance quantum error correction. Our method leverages fault-detection patterns to guide reweighting: correlated $X$ and $Z$ detection events are identified, and their conditional probabilities update weights on the primal and dual lattices. This iterative procedure improves handling of realistic error propagation in a hardware-agnostic yet noise-aware manner. We prove that IRMWPM converges in finite time while preserving the distance guarantee of MWPM. Numerical results under circuit-level noise show substantial improvements. For distances $\geq 17$ and physical error rates $\leq 0.001$, IRMWPM reduces logical error rates by over 20x with only a few iterations. It also raises the accuracy threshold from 1% to 1.16%, making it practical for near-term real-time decoding. Extrapolated estimates suggest that to reach logical error rate $10^{-16}$, IRMWPM requires distance $d=31$, while standard MWPM needs $d=50$, implying a major reduction in qubit overhead.</p>

            <h2>Uncertainty Principle from Operator Asymmetry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xingze Qiu</p>
            <p>The uncertainty principle is fundamentally rooted in the algebraic asymmetry between observables. We introduce a new class of uncertainty relations grounded in the resource theory of asymmetry, where incompatibility is quantified by an observable's intrinsic, state-independent capacity to break the symmetry associated with another. This ``operator asymmetry,'' formalized as the asymmetry norm, leads to a variance-based uncertainty relation for pure states that can be tighter than the standard Robertson bound, especially in the near-compatible regime. Most significantly, this framework resolves a long-standing open problem in quantum information theory: the formulation of a universally valid, product-form uncertainty relation for the Wigner-Yanase skew information. We demonstrate the practical power of our framework by deriving tighter quantum speed limits for the dynamics of nearly conserved quantities, which are crucial for understanding non-equilibrium phenomena such as prethermalization and many-body localization. This work provides both a new conceptual lens for understanding quantum uncertainty and a powerful toolkit for its application.</p>

To explain this phenomenon, we present theoretical framework that quantitatively captures the observed mode hybridization and provides estimates of the coupling strength, which are further validated experimentally. This work not only elucidates the fundamental dynamics of PPC in planar systems but also offers practical guidance for designing hybrid platforms with tunable photon interactions, paving the way for future advancements in planar magnonic and hybrid photonic technologies.</p>

            <h2>Toward Axion Signal Extraction in Semiconductor Spin Qubits Via Spectral Engineering</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiangjun Tan, Zhanning Wang</p>
            <p>Recent advances in quantum sensing and computational technologies indicate the possibility of improving the precision of measurements aimed at detecting cosmological particles and weakly interacting massive particles using various qubit platforms. While recent progress has been made, mitigating environmental noise remains a challenge in extracting particle parameters with high fidelity. Addressing these challenges requires efforts on two levels. At the device level, the qubit and its array acting as a probe, must be isolated from electrical and magnetic noise through optimized device geometry. At the signal-processing level, it is necessary to develop filtering methods targeting specific noise spectra based on different qubit architectures. In this work, we explore the possibility of using semiconductor quantum dot spin qubits as a platform to search for quantum chromodynamics axions and, more broadly, axion like particles (ALPs). Starting by deriving an effective Hamiltonian for electron-axion interactions, we identify an axion-induced effective magnetic field and determine the characteristic axion oscillation frequency. To suppress charge noise in the devices and environmental noise, we first analyze the charge noise spectrum and then develop a dedicated filtering and noise-reduction protocol, paving the way for exploring feasible axion mass ranges. Our preliminary study holds promise for enhancing the screening of various axion signals using quantum technologies. We expect that our analysis and filtering protocol can help advance the use of semiconductor quantum dot spin qubit arrays in axion detection.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dounan Du, Eden Figueroa</p>
            <p>Simulating the dynamics of open quantum systems with spatial structure and external control is an important challenge in quantum information science. Classical numerical solvers for such systems require integrating coupled master and field equations, which is computationally demanding for simulation and optimization tasks and often precluding real-time use in network-scale simulations or feedback control. We introduce a regional attention-based neural architecture that learns the spatiotemporal dynamics of structured open quantum systems. The model incorporates translational invariance of physical laws as an inductive bias to achieve scalable complexity, and supports conditioning on time-dependent global control parameters. We demonstrate learning on two representative systems: a driven dissipative single qubit and an electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) quantum memory. The model achieves high predictive fidelity under both in-distribution and out-of-distribution control protocols, and provides substantial acceleration up to three orders of magnitude over numerical solvers. These results demonstrate that the architecture establishes a general surrogate modeling framework for spatially structured open quantum dynamics, with immediate relevance to large-scale quantum network simulation, quantum repeater and protocol design, real-time experimental optimization, and scalable device modeling across diverse light-matter platforms.</p>

            <p>In recent years, Quantum Machine Learning (QML) has grown rapidly, emerging as a promising approach to make quantum computing implementation competitive. In this work, we investigate Quantum Extreme Learning Machines (QELM), a quantum variant of Extreme Learning Machines where training is restricted to the output layer. The proposed architecture combines dimensionality reduction (via PCA or Autoencoders), quantum state encoding, evolution under an XX Hamiltonian, and measurement, providing features for a single-layer classifier. By analyzing the performance of QELMs as a function of the evolution time, we identify a relatively sharp transition from a low-accuracy to a high-accuracy regime, after which the accuracy saturates. Remarkably, the saturation value matches that achieved with random unitaries, which induce maximally complex dynamics and optimally scramble information across the system. Across all cases studied, the critical transition time is sufficient for information to reach nearest neighbors, enabling feature extraction for learning, and is independent of the system size (i.e., the number of qubits). This independence implies that QELMs can be efficiently simulated classically for a broad class of tasks.</p>

            <p>We present benchmarking results for single-qubit gates implemented on a neutral atom quantum processor using Direct Randomized Benchmarking (DRB) and Gate Set Tomography (GST). The DRB protocol involves preparing stabilizer states, applying $m$ layers of native single-qubit gates, and measuring in the computational basis, providing an efficient error characterization under a stochastic Pauli noise model. GST enables the full, self-consistent reconstruction of quantum processes, including gates, input states, and measurements. Both protocols provide robust to state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors estimations of gate performance, offering complementary perspectives on quantum gate fidelity. For single-qubit gates, DRB yields an average fidelity of $99.963 \pm 0.016\%$. The protocol was further applied to a 25-qubit array under global single-qubit control. GST results are consistent with those obtained via DRB. We also introduce a gauge optimization procedure for GST that brings the reconstructed gates, input states, and measurements into a canonical frame, enabling meaningful fidelity comparisons while preserving physical constraints. These constraints of the operators -- such as complete positivity and trace preservation -- are enforced by performing the optimization over the Stiefel manifold. The combined analysis supports the use of complementary benchmarking techniques for characterizing scalable quantum architectures.</p>

            <p>Ensembles of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are versatile quantum sensors with broad applications in the physical and life sciences. The concentration of neutral substitutional nitrogen ([N$_\text{s}^0$]) strongly influences coherence times, sensitivity, and optimal sensing strategies. Diamonds with [N$_\text{s}^0$] $\sim\,1-10\,\text{ppm}$ are a focus of recent material engineering efforts, with higher concentrations being favorable for continuous-wave optically detected magnetic resonance (CW-ODMR) and lower concentrations expected to benefit pulsed magnetometry techniques through extended NV electronic spin coherence times and improved sensing duty cycles. In this work, we synthesize and characterize low-[N$_\text{s}^0$] ($\sim\,0.8\,\text{ppm}$), NV-enriched diamond material, engineered through low-strain chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth on high-quality substrates, $^{12}$C isotopic purification, and controlled electron irradiation and annealing. Our results demonstrate good strain homogeneity in diamonds grown on CVD substrates and spin-bath-limited NV dephasing times. By measuring NV spin and charge properties across a wide range of optical NV excitation intensity, we provide direct comparisons of photon-shot-noise-limited magnetic sensitivity between the current low-[$\text{N}_\text{s}^0$] and previously studied higher-[$\text{N}_\text{s}^0$] ($\sim\,14\,\text{ppm}$) NV-diamond sensors. We show that low-[N$_\text{s}^0$] diamond can outperform higher-[N$_\text{s}^0$] diamond at moderate and low optical NV excitation intensity. Our results provide practical benchmarks and guidance for selecting NV-diamond sensors tailored to specific experimental constraints and sensing requirements.</p>

            <p>Rich phenomenology emerges at the intersection of non-Hermiticity and many-body dynamics, yet physically realizable implementations remain challenging. In this work, we propose a general formalism that maps non-Hermitian many-body Hamiltonians to the Laplacians of Markov chains, such that wavefunction amplitudes are re-interpreted as stochastic many-body configuration probabilities. Despite explicitly preserving all state transition processes and inheriting analogous non-Hermitian localization and state-space fragmentation, our Markov chain processes exhibit distinct steady-state behavior independently of energetic considerations that govern quantum evolution. We demonstrate our framework with two contrasting representative scenarios, one involving asymmetric (biased) propagation with exclusion interactions, and the other involving flipping pairs of adjacent spins (agents). These results reveal robust and distinctive signatures of non-Hermitian phenomena in classical stochastic settings such as ecological and social networks, and provide a versatile framework for studying non-reciprocal many-body dynamics across and beyond physics.</p>

Below its Curie temperature, Mn3Si2Te6 hosts chiral orbital currents (COC) that circulate within the crystal lattice and give rise to collective electronic behavior [1]. By applying a magnetic field along the hard c axis and driving the system with low-frequency currents, we uncover a giant inductive response up to millihenry scale, originating from first-order reconfigurations of COC domains. These domains act as coherent mesoscopic inductive elements that resist reversal upon current reduction, producing a large electromotive force and sharply increasing voltage. This emergent inductance defies classical models, occurs without superconductivity or engineered nanostructures, and opens a new frontier in orbital-based quantum functionality and device concepts.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Harunobu Fujimura, Soichiro Shimamori</p>
            <p>Entanglement asymmetry is a measure that quantifies the degree of symmetry breaking at the level of a subsystem. In this work, we investigate the entanglement asymmetry in $\widehat{su}(N)_k$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model and discuss the quantum Mpemba effect for SU$(N)$ symmetry, the phenomenon that the more symmetry is initially broken, the faster it is restored. Due to the Coleman-Mermin-Wagner theorem, spontaneous breaking of continuous global symmetries is forbidden in $1+1$ dimensions. To circumvent this no-go theorem, we consider excited initial states which explicitly break non-Abelian global symmetry. We particularly focus on the initial states built from primary operators in the fundamental and adjoint representations. In both cases, we study the real-time dynamics of the Rényi entanglement asymmetry and provide clear evidence of quantum Mpemba effect for SU$(N)$ symmetry. Furthermore, we find a new type of quantum Mpemba effect for the primary operator in the fundamental representation: increasing the rank $N$ leads to stronger initial symmetry breaking but faster symmetry restoration. Also, increasing the level $k$ leads to weaker initial symmetry breaking but slower symmetry restoration. On the other hand, no such behavior is observed for adjoint case, which may suggest that this new type of quantum Mpemba effect is not universal.</p>

            <p>The degradation of classical and quantum structured light induced by complex media constitutes a critical barrier to its practical implementation in a range of applications, from communication and energy transport to imaging and sensing. Atmospheric turbulence is an exemplary case due to its complex phase structure and dynamic variations, driving the need to find invariances in light. Here we construct classical and quantum optical skyrmions and pass them through experimentally simulated atmospheric turbulence, revealing the embedded topological resilience of their structure. In the quantum realm, we show that while skyrmions undergo diminished entanglement, their topological characteristics maintain stable. This is paralleled classically, where the vectorial structure is scrambled by the medium yet the skyrmion remains stable by virtue of its intrinsic topological protection mechanism. Our experimental results are supported by rigorous analytical and numerical modelling, validating that the quantum-classical equivalence of the topological behaviour is due to the non-separability of the states and one-sided nature of the channel. Our work blurs the classical-quantum divide in the context of topology and opens a new path to information resilience in noisy channels, such as terrestrial and satellite-to-ground communication networks.</p>

            <p>We revisit the thermal nature of the Unruh effect within a quantum thermodynamic framework. For a Unruh-deWitt (UDW) detector in $n$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime, we demonstrate that its irreversible thermalization to a Gibbs equilibrium state follows distinct trajectories on the Bloch sphere, which depend on the types of fields the detector interacts with, as well as the spacetime dimensionality. Using thermodynamic process functions, particularly quantum coherence and heat that form the quantum First Law, we characterize the Unruh thermalization through a complementary time evolution between the trajectory-dependent rates of process functions. Grounded in information geometry, we further explore the kinematics of the detector state as it "flows" along the trajectory. In particular, we propose two heating/cooling protocols for the UDW detector undergoing Unruh thermalization. We observe a quantum Mpemba-like effect, characterized by faster heating than cooling in terms of Uhlmann fidelity "distance" change. Most significantly, we establish the maximum fidelity difference as a novel diagnostic that essentially distinguishes between Unruh thermalization and its classical counterpart, i.e., classical thermal bath-driven thermalization of an inertial UDW detector. This compelling criterion may serve as a hallmark of the quantum origin of the Unruh effect in future experimental detection and quantum simulation. Finally, we conclude with a general analysis of Unruh thermalization, starting from equal-fidelity non-thermal states, and demonstrate that the detectors' fidelity and "speed" of quantum evolution still exhibit a Mpemba-like behavior.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander Altland, Kun Woo Kim, Tobias Micklitz</p>
            <p>We introduce a quasiclassical Green function approach describing the unitary yet irreversible dynamics of quantum systems effectively acting as their own environment. Combining a variety of concepts of quantum many-body theory, notably the nonlinear $\sigma$-model of disordered systems, the $G \Sigma$-formalism for strong correlations, and real time path integration, the theory is capable of describing a wide range of system classes and disorder models. It extends previous work beyond perturbation theory (in inverse Hilbert space dimensions), enabling a description of thermalization dynamics from short scattering times, through the onset of ergodicity at an effective `Thouless time', up to the many-body Heisenberg time. We illustrate the approach with two case studies, (i) a brickwork model of unitarily coupled quantum circuits with and without conserved symmetries, and (ii) an array of capacitively coupled quantum dots. Using the spectral form factor as a test observable, we find good agreement with numerical simulations. We present our formalism in a self-contained and pedagogical manner, aiming to provide a transferable toolbox for the first-principles description of many-body chaotic quantum systems in regimes of strong entanglement.</p>

            <h2>Topological energy pumping in a quasi-periodically driven four-level system</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vansh Kaushik, Sayan Choudhury, Tanay Nag</p>
            <p>We investigate a quasi-periodically driven four-level system that serves as a temporal analog of topological phenomena found in four-band models with intertwined spin and orbital degrees of freedom. Under a two-tone drive in the strong-driving regime, the system realizes a two-dimensional synthetic Floquet lattice, thus facilitating the realization of topological energy pumping. For a temporal quantum spin Hall insulator, we find that the rates of emission and absorption of energy between the two drives are not exactly opposite for a given band. However, when contributions from two chiral symmetric partner bands are added, they become exactly opposite. This quantized rate of energy exchange is a direct consequence of propagating edge modes in the real-space model, which we further characterize by computing the spin-Chern number. Interestingly, our analysis yields zero rate of exchange of energy between the drives for a temporal higher-order topological insulator, suggesting the presence of localized corner modes that we characterize by the mid-gap Wannier spectra. Finally, we demonstrate that the perfect (imperfect) nature of the fidelity during the time-evolution of the system serves as a characteristic signature of a topological (trivial) phase.</p>

            <h2>Persistent Charge and Spin Currents in a Ferromagnetic Hatano-Nelson Ring</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sourav Karmakar, Sudin Ganguly, Santanu K. Maiti</p>
            <p>We investigate persistent charge and spin currents in a ferromagnetic Hatano-Nelson ring with anti-Hermitian intradimer hopping, where non-reciprocal hopping generates a synthetic magnetic flux and drives a non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm effect. The system supports both real and imaginary persistent currents, with ferromagnetic spin splitting enabling all three spin-current components, dictated by the orientation of magnetic moments. The currents are computed using the current operator method within a biorthogonal basis. In parallel, the complex band structure is analyzed to uncover the spectral characteristics. We emphasize how the currents evolve across different topological regimes, and how they are influenced by chemical potential, ferromagnetic ordering, finite size, and disorder. Strikingly, disorder can even amplify spin currents, opening powerful new routes for manipulating spin transport in non-Hermitian systems.</p>

            <h2>Site Basis Excitation Ansatz for Matrix Product States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Steven R. White</p>
            <p>We introduce a simple and efficient variation of the tangent-space excitation ansatz used to compute elementary excitation spectra of one-dimensional quantum lattice systems using matrix product states (MPS). A small basis for the excitation tensors is formed based on a single diagonalization analogous to a single site DMRG step but for multiple states. Once overlap and Hamiltonian matrix elements are found, obtaining the excitation for any momentum only requires diagonalization of a tiny matrix, akin to a non-orthogonal band-theory diagonalization. The approach is based on an infinite MPS description of the ground state, and we introduce an extremely simple alternative to variational uniform matrix product states (VUMPS) based on finite system DMRG. For the $S=1$ Heisenberg chain, our method -- site basis excitation ansatz (SBEA) -- efficiently produces the one-magnon dispersion with high accuracy. We also examine the role of MPS gauge choices, finding that not imposing a gauge condition -- leaving the basis nonorthogonal -- is crucial for the approach, whereas imposing a left-orthonormal gauge (as in prior work) severely hampers convergence. We also show how one can construct Wannier excitations, analogous to the Wannier functions of band theory, where one Wannier excitation, translated to all sites, can reconstruct the single magnon modes exactly for all momenta.</p>

            <p>Recent development of cloud-based experiment platforms has allowed physicists to examine theoretical concepts with unprecedented convenience. Oqtant is a cloud-accessible platform for trapped Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs) of neutral atomic gases, providing an invaluable experimental tool for studying the dynamics of BECs. Anomalous tunneling, which means low-energy phonon excitations of BECs easily transmit through a barrier potential, has been theoretically predicted as a characteristic phenomenon of BECs. We utilize Oqtant to observe the effects of anomalous tunneling on collective excitations of BECs. For this purpose, we theoretically show that anomalous tunneling affects the frequencies of the collective excitations in the low-energy region and experimentally measure their frequencies, finding that low-energy collective modes are less affected by a potential barrier, which indicates the presence of anomalous tunneling. Our work would contribute to fundamental understandings of BECs and stimulate further development and use of cloud-based experiments in this field.</p>

            <p>Electron irradiation and annealing treatments are a method of colour centre/defect creation in diamond. The depth profile of defects created by low energy 200 keV electrons in single crystal high purity (type II) electronic grade diamond grown via chemical vapour deposition has been investigated. The depth profile of monovacancies created was found, using photoluminescence (PL), to decay exponentially, with decay length $12\pm1$ $\mu$m and production rate of $(1.1\pm0.2)\times 10 ^{-1}$ V/e$^{-}$/cm at the surface. The depth distribution of the neutral and negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV$^{0/-}$) centre, and the 733 nm zero phonon line defect formed during an isochronal annealing study have also been investigated by PL. The observed NV profiles, which do not match the vacancy profiles, can be qualitatively explained in terms of a simple model that includes the formation of vacancy clusters and the nitrogen-divacancy (NV$_{2}$) defect. The production of (NV$^{0/-}$) has been assumed to be nitrogen limited, but this paper has shown that this is not the case, with NVs lost to the production of NV$_{2}$ when the concentration of vacancies greatly exceeds that of substitutional nitrogen.</p>

            <h2>Super-Quadratic Quantum Speed-ups and Guessing Many Likely Keys</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Timo Glaser, Alexander May, Julian Nowakowski</p>
            <p>We study the fundamental problem of guessing cryptographic keys, drawn from some non-uniform probability distribution $D$, as e.g. in LPN, LWE or for passwords. The optimal classical algorithm enumerates keys in decreasing order of likelihood. The optimal quantum algorithm, due to Montanaro (2011), is a sophisticated Grover search. We give the first tight analysis for Montanaro's algorithm, showing that its runtime is $2^{H_{2/3}(D)/2}$, where $H_{\alpha}(\cdot)$ denotes Renyi entropy with parameter $\alpha$. Interestingly, this is a direct consequence of an information theoretic result called Arikan's Inequality (1996) -- which has so far been missed in the cryptographic community -- that tightly bounds the runtime of classical key guessing by $2^{H_{1/2}(D)}$. Since $H_{2/3}(D) < H_{1/2}(D)$ for every non-uniform distribution $D$, we thus obtain a super-quadratic quantum speed-up $s>2$ over classical key guessing. As another main result, we provide the first thorough analysis of guessing in a multi-key setting. Specifically, we consider the task of attacking many keys sampled independently from some distribution $D$, and aim to guess a fraction of them. For product distributions $D = \chi^n$, we show that any constant fraction of keys can be guessed within $2^{H(D)}$ classically and $2 ^{H(D)/2}$ quantumly per key, where $H(\chi)$ denotes Shannon entropy. In contrast, Arikan's Inequality implies that guessing a single key costs $2^{H_{1/2}(D)}$ classically and $2^{H_{2/3}(D)/2}$ quantumly. Since $H(D) < H_{2/3}(D) < H_{1/2}(D)$, this shows that in a multi-key setting the guessing cost per key is substantially smaller than in a single-key setting, both classically and quantumly.</p>

            <p>We present a novel approach to deriving positivity bounds on effective field theories by analyzing the thermodynamic behavior of thermal quantum field systems. Focusing on scalar theories with higher-dimensional operators, we compute the finite-temperature entropy using thermal field theory techniques. We argue that consistency with fundamental thermodynamic principles-specifically, the expectation that entropy increases with the introduction of new degrees of freedom-imposes nontrivial constraints on Wilson coefficients. In particular, we show that the coefficient of the leading dimension-8 operator must be strictly positive. This thermodynamic perspective offers an alternative to traditional S-matrix-based derivations of positivity bounds and provides fresh insight into the interplay between entropy, unitarity, and causality in quantum field theory.</p>

            <p>We have investigated vacuum polarization of a quantized charged massive scalar field in the presence of a magnetic topological defect, modeled as an impenetrable tube of finite thickness carrying magnetic flux. At the tube's surface, we imposed a generalized Robin boundary condition. Our analysis demonstrates that, in flat space-time, the total induced vacuum energy is independent of the coupling $\xi$ of the scalar field's interaction with the space-time curvature only in the special cases of Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. For general Robin boundary conditions, however, the total induced vacuum energy depends on the coupling $\xi$ in a flat space-time and exhibits a nontrivial dependence on the parameter of the Robin boundary condition. We investigated the dependence of this effect not only on Robin's boundary condition parameter, but also on the tube thickness and the space-time dimensionality. We conclude that careful measurements of vacuum polarization effects in flat space-time may, in principle, provide an independent way to probe the $\xi$ coupling.</p>

            <p>Deciphering complex gene-gene interactions remains challenging in transcriptomics as traditional methods often miss higher-order and nonlinear dependencies. This study introduces a quantum-inspired framework leveraging tensor networks (TNs) to optimally map expression data into a lower dimensional representation preserving biological locality. Using Quantum Mutual Information (QMI), a nonparametric measure natural for tensor networks, we quantify gene dependencies and establish statistical significance via permutation testing. This constructs robust interaction networks where the edges reflect biologically meaningful relationships that are resilient to random chance. The approach effectively distinguishes true regulatory patterns from experimental noise and biological stochasticity. To test the proposed method, we recover a gene regulatory network consisted of six pathway genes from single-cell RNA sequencing data comprising over $28.000$ lymphoblastoid cells. Furthermore, we unveil several triadic regulatory mechanisms. By merging quantum physics inspired techniques with computational biology, our method provides novel insights into gene regulation, with applications in disease mechanisms and precision medicine.</p>

By switching the dimensionless flux per plaquette between a set of values $\{p_j/q_j\}$ the Floquet quasienergy spectrum is folded into Q = lcm$\{q_j\}$ bands. We determine closed form analytical solutions for the quasienergy spectrum and Chern numbers for the -1/2 $\to$ 1/2 flux switching case, as well as the Rudner-Lindner-Berg-Levin (RLBL) winding invariants W numerically, and construct the corresponding topological phase diagram for arbitrary driving period. We find that generic flux-switching drives feature interlaced Hofstadter butterfly quasienergy spectra, and the gaps in the spectrum may be labeled according to a Diophantine equation which relates the quasienergy gap index to the fluxes attained in the drive and their associated per-step windings.</p>

            <p>We investigated the quantum Mpemba effect (QME) in a one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model across clean and disordered regimes using exact numerical technique of a four-site lattice under Lindblad dynamics with local dephasing noise. By systematically varying hopping strength, onsite interactions, Stark potentials, and random disorder, we probe relaxation dynamics toward a common steady state using trace distance, relative entropy, entanglement asymmetry, and $\ell_1$-norm of coherence metrics. Our results reveal that QME emerges prominently in the clean-interacting regime, where many-body correlations drive nonlinear relaxation pathways, enabling initially distant states to overtake closer ones. In contrast, non-interacting systems exhibit conventional thermalization, whereas Stark potentials and random disorder suppress QME by inducing localization barriers, with disorder causing milder delays compared to the pronounced effects of Stark fields. Entanglement asymmetry proves to be particularly sensitive to the symmetry restoration dynamics underlying QME. These findings elucidate the critical role of interactions in anomalous relaxation and provide insights for controlling quantum thermalization in experimental platforms such as ultra-cold atomic systems.</p>

We apply the theory to an on-threshold optical parametric oscillator, exploring optimal conditions for purity recovery by smoothing. The role of quantum efficiency is elucidated, in both low and high efficiency limits.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joshua Cudby, Sergii Strelchuk</p>
            <p>Magic states, pivotal for universal quantum computation via classically simulable Clifford gates, often undergo decomposition into resourceless stabilizer states, facilitating simulation through classical means. This approach yields three operationally significant metrics: stabilizer rank, fidelity, and extent. We extend these simulation methods to encompass matchgate circuits (MGCs), and define equivalent metrics for this setting. We begin with an investigation into the algebraic constraints defining Gaussian states, marking the first explicit characterisation of these states. The explicit description of Gaussian states is pivotal to our methods for tackling all the simulation tasks. Central to our inquiry is the concept of Gaussian rank -- a pivotal metric defining the minimum terms required for decomposing a quantum state into Gaussian constituents. This metric holds paramount significance in determining the runtime of rank-based simulations for MGCs featuring magic state inputs. The absence of low-rank decompositions presents a computational hurdle, thereby prompting a deeper examination of fermionic magic states. We find that the Gaussian rank of 2 instances of our canonical magic state is 4 under symmetry-restricted decompositions. Additionally, our numerical analysis suggests the absence of low-rank decompositions for 2 or 3 copies of this magic state. Further, we explore the Gaussian extent, a convex metric offering an upper bound on the rank. We prove the Gaussian extent's multiplicative behaviour on 4-qubit systems, along with initial strides towards proving its sub-multiplicative nature in general settings. One important result in that direction we present is an upper bound on the Gaussian fidelity of generic states.</p>

            <h2>One Gate Scheme to Rule Them All: Introducing a Complex Yet Reduced Instruction Set for Quantum Computing</h2>

            <p>The design and architecture of a quantum instruction set are paramount to the performance of a quantum computer. This work introduces a gate scheme for qubits with $XX+YY$ coupling that directly and efficiently realizes any two-qubit gate up to single-qubit gates. First, this scheme enables high-fidelity execution of quantum operations and achieves minimum possible gate times. Second, since the scheme spans the entire $\textbf{SU}(4)$ group of two-qubit gates, we can use it to attain the optimal two-qubit gate count for algorithm implementation. These two advantages in synergy give rise to a quantum Complex yet Reduced Instruction Set Computer (CRISC). Though the gate scheme is compact, it supports a comprehensive array of quantum operations. This may seem paradoxical but is realizable due to the fundamental differences between quantum and classical computer architectures. Using our gate scheme, we observe marked improvements across various applications, including generic $n$-qubit gate synthesis, quantum volume, and qubit routing. Furthermore, the proposed scheme also realizes a gate locally equivalent to the commonly used CNOT gate with a gate time of $\frac{\pi}{2g}$, where $g$ is the two-qubit coupling. The AshN scheme is also completely impervious to $ZZ$ error, the main coherent error in transversely coupled systems, as the control parameters implementing the gates can be easily adjusted to take the $ZZ$ term into account.</p>

            <p>We explore entanglement as a resource to distinguish locally indistinguishable orthogonal quantum states. Specifically, we consider sets which contain states from an unextendible product basis along with a pure entangled state. We establish a connection between the aforesaid problem and the entanglement-assisted discrimination of a certain class of many-copy indistinguishable sets. The entanglement-assisted protocols that we construct here are quite efficient, as they render the teleportation-based protocols sub-optimal. In fact, a central aspect of our study is to explore the role of Schmidt rank as a resource to distinguish the states of locally indistinguishable sets. Interestingly, we identify an instance where a set of locally indistinguishable orthogonal states remains locally indistinguishable even with access to any finite number of copies, yet becomes perfectly distinguishable using entangled resources of relatively low cost. This fact makes it possible to compare the degrees of local indistinguishability associated with several locally indistinguishable sets within the same Hilbert space. Consequently, we report a hierarchy of local indistinguishability among the many-copy indistinguishable sets. Thereafter, based on our analysis, we present a theoretical proposal for an information processing protocol exhibiting secure locking of information and its resource-efficient extraction. Furthermore, we also find that the hierarchical difference in local indistinguishability can increase with increasing dimension of the Hilbert space.</p>

            <p>Local sets, a graph structure invariant under local complementation, have been originally introduced in the context of quantum computing for the study of quantum entanglement within the so-called graph state formalism. A local set in a graph is made of a non-empty set of vertices together with its odd neighborhood. We show that any graph can be covered by minimal local sets, i.e. that every vertex is contained in at least one local set that is minimal by inclusion. More precisely, we introduce an algorithm for finding a minimal local set cover in polynomial time. This result is proved by exploring the link between local sets and cut-rank. We prove some additional results on minimal local sets: we give tight bounds on their size, and we show that there can be exponentially many of them in a graph. Finally, we provide an extension of our definitions and our main result to $q$-multigraphs, the graphical counterpart of quantum qudit graph states.</p>

This mechanism is common to other solid-state defect nuclear spins with similar optical excited states.

            <p>We study a qDRIFT-type randomized method to simulate Lindblad dynamics by decomposing its generator into an ensemble of Lindbladians, $L = \sum_{a \in A} L_a$, where each $L_a$ comprises a simple Hamiltonian and a single jump operator. Assuming an efficient quantum simulation is available for the Lindblad evolution $e^{t L_a}$, we implement $e^{t L_a}$ for a randomly sampled $L_a$ at each time step according to a probability distribution $\mu$ over the ensemble $\{L_a\}_{a \in A}$. This randomized strategy reduces the quantum cost of simulating Lindblad dynamics, particularly in quantum many-body systems with a large or even infinite number of jump operators. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we provide a detailed convergence analysis of the proposed randomized method, covering both average and typical algorithmic realizations. This analysis extends the known results for the random product formula from closed systems to open systems, ensuring rigorous performance guarantees. Second, based on the random product approximation, we derive a new quantum Gibbs sampler algorithm that utilizes jump operators sampled from a Clifford-random circuit. This generator (i) can be efficiently implemented using our randomized algorithm, and (ii) exhibits a spectral gap lower bound that depends on the spectrum of the Hamiltonian. Our results present a new instance of a class of Hamiltonians for which the thermal states can be efficiently prepared using a quantum Gibbs sampling algorithm.</p>

            <p>Recently, interest in quantum computing has significantly increased, driven by its potential advantages over classical techniques. Quantum machine learning (QML) exemplifies one of the important quantum computing applications that are expected to surpass classical machine learning in a wide range of instances. This paper addresses the performance of QML in the context of high-energy physics (HEP). As an example, we focus on the top-quark tagging, for which classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been effective but fall short in accuracy when dealing with highly energetic jet images. In this paper, we use a quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) for this task and compare its performance with CNN using a classical noiseless simulator. We compare various setups for the QCNN, varying the convolutional circuit, type of encoding, loss function, and batch sizes. For every quantum setup, we design a similar setup to the corresponding classical model for a fair comparison. Our results indicate that QCNN with proper setups tend to perform better than their CNN counterparts, particularly when the convolution block has a lower number of parameters. For the higher parameter regime, the QCNN circuit was adjusted according to the dimensional expressivity analysis (DEA) to lower the parameter count while preserving its optimal structure. The DEA circuit demonstrated improved results over the comparable classical CNN model.</p>

We provide a pedagogical outline for how two coupled harmonic oscillators, under a beam-splitter interaction, can exhibit hallmark signatures analogous to the photo-electric effect, including resonance conditions and quantised energy absorption. We discuss the implications of this model for recently proposed graviton detection protocols.

Additionally, they accommodate experimental limitations and preferred cost trade-offs. We propose a robust benchmark for amplitude estimation algorithms and use it to test BAE against other approaches, demonstrating its competitive performance in both noisy and noiseless scenarios. In both cases, it achieves lower error than any other algorithm as a function of the cost. In the presence of decoherence, it is capable of learning when other algorithms fail.</p>

Here, we present quantum LDPC codes that not only approach the hashing bound but also allow decoding with computational cost linear in the number of physical qubits. This breakthrough paves the way for large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computation.

Identifying the incoherent noise of a quantum device in addition to its coherent interactions is, however, as essential. Precise knowledge of such imperfections of a quantum device allows to devise strategies to mitigate detrimental effects, for example via quantum error correction. We introduce the open Quantum Model Learning Agent (oQMLA) framework to account for Markovian noise through the Liouvillian formalism. By simultaneously learning the Hamiltonian and jump operators, oQMLA independently captures both the coherent and incoherent dynamics of a system. The added complexity of open systems necessitates advanced algorithmic strategies. Among these, we implement regularization to steer the algorithm towards plausible models and an unbiased metric to evaluate the quality of the results. We validate our implementation in simulated scenarios of increasing complexity, demonstrating its robustness to hardware-induced measurement errors and its ability to characterize systems using only local operations. Additionally, we develop a scheme to interface oQMLA with a publicly available superconducting quantum computer, showcasing its practical utility. These advancements represent a significant step toward improving the performance of quantum hardware and contribute to the broader goal of advancing quantum technologies and their applications.</p>

            <h2>Impossibility of Quantum Private Queries</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Esther Hänggi, Severin Winkler</p>
            <p>Symmetric private information retrieval is a cryptographic task allowing a user to query a database and obtain exactly one entry without revealing to the owner of the database which element was accessed. The task is a variant of general two-party protocols called one-sided secure function evaluation and is closely related to oblivious transfer. Under the name quantum private queries, quantum protocols have been proposed to solve this problem in a cheat-sensitive way: In such protocols, it is not impossible for dishonest participants to cheat, but they risk detection [V. Giovannetti, S. Lloyd, and L. Maccone, Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 230502 (2008)]. We give an explicit attack against any cheat-sensitive symmetric private information retrieval protocol, showing that any protocol that is secure for the user cannot have non-trivial security guarantees for the owner of the database.</p>

            <h2>Incoherent behavior of partially distinguishable photons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emilio Annoni, Stephen C. Wein</p>
            <p>Photon distinguishability is a key factor limiting quantum interference in photonic devices, directly impacting the performance of protocols such as Boson Sampling and photonic quantum computing. We present a basis-independent framework for analyzing multi-photon interference, identifying a necessary and sufficient condition under which distinguishability behaves as a stochastic error process. This condition enables any multi-photon state to be uniquely expressed as a classical mixture of partition states -- discrete configurations representing different patterns of photon distinguishability. We introduce an experimentally implementable operation, analogous to Pauli twirling, that enforces this condition without compromising computational hardness. The resulting probability distribution over partition states defines the system's incoherent distinguishability spectrum, which we show can be fully characterized through a specific set of experiments. Building on this structure, we also demonstrate the existence of an error mitigation strategy. This framework clarifies key challenges in defining genuine multi-photon indistinguishability, links previous perspectives on partial distinguishability, and provides a rigorous foundation for robust photonic protocols.</p>

            <h2>Interferometric detection of continuous-variable entanglement using two states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elena Callus, Martin Gärttner, Tobias Haas</p>
            <p>The efficient witnessing and certification of entanglement is necessitated by its ubiquitous use in various aspects of quantum technologies. In the case of continuous-variable bipartite systems, the Shchukin--Vogel hierarchy gives necessary conditions for separability in terms of moments of the mode operators. In this work, we derive mode-operator-based witnesses for continuous-variable bipartite entanglement relying on the interference of two states. Specifically, we show how one can access higher moments of the mode operators, crucial for detecting entanglement of non-Gaussian states, using a single beamsplitter with variable phase and photon-number-resolving detectors. We demonstrate that the use of an entangled state paired with a suitable reference state is sufficient to detect entanglement in, e.g., two-mode squeezed vacuum, NOON states, and mixed entangled cat states. We also take into account experimental noise, including photon loss and detection inefficiency, as well as finite measurement statistics.</p>

            <p>Integrating quantum key distribution (QKD) with classical data transmission over the same fiber is crucial for scalable quantum-secured communication. However, noise from classical channels limits QKD distance. We demonstrate the longest-distance continuous-variable QKD (CV-QKD) over 120 km (20 dB loss) in the asymptotic regime, and over 100 km (17 dB loss) in the finite-size regime, both coexisting with a fully populated coarse wavelength division multiplexing system. Natural mode filtering of the local oscillator and phase noise mitigation enabled this without additional filtering or wavelength reallocation. Benchmarking against a commercial discrete-variable QKD system and considering finite-size effects confirms the feasibility of CV-QKD as a plug-and-play solution for typical 80-100 km long-haul optical networks. Our results set a record fiber distance for CV-QKD, showing its potential for cost-effective, large-scale deployment in existing network infrastructure.</p>

Some sufficient and some necessary criteria are presented. For certain states, these criteria together are both sufficient and necessary. Detailed examples show that our criteria are better than some existing ones in identifying separability. Based on these criteria, the largest separable ball around the maximally mixed state for arbitrary multi-qubit systems is found, and it is proved that its radius defined via the $l_1$-norm of the Bloch vector is the constant 1. Furthermore, the criteria in this paper can be implemented experimentally.</p>

            <p>In this work, we propose a stable charging scheme mediated by a three-level system (qutrit), which renders a unidirectional energy flow from an external power source to an $(N+1)$-dimensional quantum battery. By virtue of the qutrit dissipation, the battery avoids the spontaneous discharging induced by the time-reversal symmetry of any unitary-charging scheme. Irrespective of the initial state, the battery can be eventually stabilized at the maximal-ergotropy state as long as the charger-battery interaction is present. We use a Dyson series of Lindbladian superoperator to obtain an effective master equation for the battery, which is found to be equivalent to the high-order Fermi's golden rule adapted to the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and spontaneous decay. We extract the optimization condition for charging efficiency and justify it in the finite-size battery with uniform energy splitting, the large spin battery, and the truncated harmonic-oscillator battery.</p>

Central to this work is a detailed analysis of the microstructure of real measurement devices. Particular attention is paid to the Mott problem, which addresses a simpler version of canonical quantum measurement behavior: It asks why an alpha particle emitted in a nuclear decay produces one and only one track in a cloud chamber. My analysis - entirely consistent with unitarity - leads to an emergent, approximate Born rule supported by experiment, with possible breakdown at very small probability density.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhixin Song, Hang Ren, Melody Lee, Bryan Gard, Nicolas Renaud, Spencer H. Bryngelson</p>
            <p>Quantum tomography is a crucial tool for characterizing quantum states and devices and estimating nonlinear properties of the systems. Performing full quantum state tomography on an $N_\mathrm{q}$ qubit system requires an exponentially increasing overhead with $O(3^{N_\mathrm{q}})$ distinct Pauli measurement settings to resolve all complex phases and reconstruct the density matrix. However, many potential quantum computing applications, such as linear system solves, require only real-valued amplitudes. We introduce a readout method for real-valued quantum states that reduces measurement settings required for state vector reconstruction to $O(N_\mathrm{q})$; the post-processing cost remains exponential $\Omega(2^{N_\mathrm{q}})$. This approach offers a substantial speedup over conventional tomography. We experimentally validate our method up to 10 qubits on the latest available IBM quantum processor and demonstrate that it accurately extracts key properties such as entanglement and magic. Our method also outperforms the standard SWAP test for state overlap estimation. This calculation resembles a numerical integration in certain cases and can be applied to extract nonlinear properties, which are important in application fields. We further implement the method to readout the solution from a quantum linear solver.</p>

            <h2>Waveguides in a quantum perspective</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eddy Collin, Alexandre Delattre</p>
            <p>Solid state quantum devices, operated at dilution cryostat temperatures, are relying on microwave signals to both drive and read-out their quantum states. These signals are transmitted into the cryogenic environment, out of it towards detection devices, or even between quantum systems by well-designed waveguides, almost lossless when made of superconducting materials. Here we report on the quantum theory that describes the simplest Cartesian-type geometries: parallel plates, and rectangular tubes. The aim of the article is twofold: first on a technical and pragmatic level, we provide a full and compact quantum description of the different traveling wave families supported by these guides. Second, on an ontological level, we interpret the results and discuss the nature of the light fields corresponding to each mode family. The concept of potential difference is extended from transverse electric-magnetic (TEM) waves to all configurations, by means of a specific gauge fixing. The generalized flux $\phi$ introduced in the context of quantum electronics becomes here essential: it is the scalar field, conjugate of a charge $Q$, that confines light within the electrodes, let them be real or virtual. The gap in the dispersion relations of non-TEM waves turns out to be linked either to a potential energy necessary for the photon confinement, or to a kinetic energy arising from a photon mass. We finally compute the field zero-point fluctuations in every configuration. The theory is predictive: the lowest transverse magnetic (TM) modes should have smaller quantum noise than the higher ones, which at large wavevectors recover a conventional value similar to TEM and transverse electric (TE) ones. Such low-noise modes might be particularly useful for the routing of quantum information.</p>

Instead of mapping the second quantization of the system Hamiltonian to qubit Pauli gates representation via the Jordan-Wigner transform, we propose to use the few-body Hamiltonian matrix under the statevector basis representation which is more economical on the required number of quantum registers. For a single-particle excitation state on a one-dimensional chain, $\Gamma$ qubits can simulate $N=2^\Gamma$ number of sites, in comparison to $N$ qubits for $N$ sites via the Jordan-Wigner approach. A two-band diatomic tight-binding model is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the statevector basis representation.

            <p>Quantum key distribution (QKD) can provide secure key material between two parties without relying on assumptions about the computational power of an eavesdropper. QKD is performed over quantum links and quantum networks, systems which are resource-intensive to deploy and maintain. To evaluate and optimize performance prior to, during, and after deployment, realistic simulations with attention to physical realism are necessary. Quantum network simulators can simulate a variety of quantum and classical protocols and can assist in quantum network design and optimization by offering realism and flexibility beyond mathematical models which rely on simplifying assumptions and can be intractable to solve as network complexity increases. We use a versatile discrete event quantum network simulator to simulate the entanglement-based QKD protocol BBM92 and compare it to our experimental implementation and to existing theory. Furthermore, we simulate secure key rates in a repeater key distribution scenario for which no experimental implementations exist.</p>

            <p>Experimental realizations of spin models are irremediably prone to errors, which can propagate through the system corrupting experimental signals. We study how such errors affect the measurement of local observables in systems with long-range interactions, where perturbations can spread more rapidly. Specifically, we focus on the stability of thermal equilibrium and investigate its relation to the correlation structure of the system, both analytically and numerically. As a main result, we prove that the stability of local expectation values follows from the decay of correlations on the Gibbs state and the Lieb-Robinson bound, and hence that stability always holds at high temperature. We also provide numerical evidence that this stability extends to an even larger regime of interacting long-range systems. Our results support the robustness of analogue simulation platforms for long-range models, and provide further evidence that computing physical quantities of interest can be significantly easier than performing arbitrary quantum computations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amit Vikram</p>
            <p>The quantum chaos conjecture associates the spectral statistics of a quantum system with abstract notions of quantum ergodicity. Such associations are taken to be of fundamental and sometimes defining importance for quantum chaos, but their practical relevance has been challenged by theoretical and experimental developments. Here, in counterpoint, we show that ergodic dynamics can be directly utilized for the preparation of quantum states with parametrically higher entanglement than generated by maximally scrambling dynamics such as in random unitary circuits. Our setting involves quantum systems coupled via a "non-demolition" interaction of conserved charges. We derive an exact relation between the evolving entanglement of an initial product state and a measure of spectral statistics of the interacting charges in this state. This connection is explained via a notion of Krylov vector ergodicity, tied to the ability of quantum dynamics to generate orthonormal states over time. We consider exploiting this phenomenon for the preparation of approximate Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) states between complex systems, a crucial resource for tasks such as quantum teleportation. We quantitatively show that the transfer of operators between entangled systems, which underlies the utility of the EPR state, can be performed with parametrically larger capacity for entanglement generated via ergodic dynamics than with maximal scrambling. Our analysis suggests a direct application of "ergodic" spectral statistics as a potential resource for quantum information tasks.</p>

This method significantly relaxes the device requirements, enabling a more practical way of generating randomness from untrusted devices. By distributing the device requirements across a network of servers and clients, our proposal allows the server to operate high-performance devices while the clients can be equipped with more cost-effective devices. Moreover, the outputs of the client's device are also private, even against the server, which is essential in cryptographic applications. Therefore, DIPQRB provides a cost-effective method to generate secure and private random numbers from untrusted devices.</p>

            <p>We investigate the dynamics of nonstabilizerness - also known as `magic' - in monitored quantum circuits composed of random Clifford unitaries and local projective measurements. For measurements in the computational basis, we derive an analytical model for dynamics of the stabilizer nullity, showing that it decays in quantized steps and requires exponentially many measurements to vanish, which reveals the strong protection through Clifford scrambling. On the other hand, for measurements performed in rotated non-Clifford bases, measurements can both create and destroy nonstabilizerness. Here, the dynamics leads to a steady-state with non-trivial nonstabilizerness, independent of the initial state. We find that Haar-random states equilibrate in constant time, whereas stabilizer states exhibit linear-in-size relaxation time. While the stabilizer nullity is insensitive to the rotation angle, Stabilizer Rényi Entropies expose a richer structure in their dynamics. Our results uncover sharp distinctions between coarse and fine-grained nonstabilizerness diagnostics and demonstrate how measurements can both suppress and sustain quantum computational resources.</p>

            <p>The framework of internal quantum reference frames (QRFs) constitutes a universal toolset for dealing with symmetries in quantum theory and has led to new revelations in quantum gravity, gauge theories and foundational physics. Multiple approaches have emerged, sometimes differing in scope and the way symmetries are implemented, raising the question as to their relation. Here, we investigate the relation between three approaches to QRFs for gauge symmetries, namely the effective semiclassical, algebraic, and perspective-neutral (PN) approaches. Rather than constructing Hilbert spaces, as the PN approach, the effective approach is based on a quantum phase space parametrized by expectation values and fluctuations, while the emphasis of the algebraic approach is on the state space of complex linear functionals on a kinematical algebra. Nevertheless, external frame information is treated as gauge in all three formalisms, manifested in constraints on states and algebra. We show that these three approaches are, in fact, equivalent for ideal QRFs, distinguished by sharp orientations, which is the previous setting of the first two approaches. Our demonstration pertains to single constraints, including relativistic ones, and encompasses QRF changes. In particular, the QRF transformations of the PN framework agree semiclassically with those of the older effective approach, by which it was inspired. As a physical application, we explore the QRF covariance of uncertainties and fluctuations, which turn out to be frame-dependent. This is particularly well-suited for the effective and algebraic approaches, for which these quantities form a natural basis. Finally, we pave the way towards extending these two approaches to non-ideal QRFs by studying the projection and gauge-fixing operations of the Page-Wootters formalism, built into the PN framework, on algebraic states.</p>

This paper presents a practical verification approach based on violations of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality. We derive tight mathematical bounds that relate the CHSH value to entanglement fidelity and introduce a statistical framework that optimizes resource usage while ensuring reliable certification. Our main contributions are: (i) fidelity bounds derived directly from the CHSH measure, which also enable nonlocality certification at sufficiently high fidelities; (ii) a sample-complexity analysis that quantifies the number of measurements required to achieve desired confidence levels for the CHSH measure and the entanglement fidelity; and (iii) verification protocols, some with rigorous mathematical guarantees and others with numerical evaluation. Using NetSquid, we develop a simulation framework that models diverse network conditions and enables systematic exploration of trade-offs in CHSH-based verification. This framework highlights the interplay between accuracy, efficiency, and operational parameters, providing concrete guidelines for deploying entanglement verification in resource-constrained quantum networks.</p>

This extends classical AG codes by adding weighted degrees and singularities, enabling self-orthogonal codes via the CSS method with improved distances using algebraic structures and invariants like weighted this http URL second class arises from chain complexes of graded vector spaces, generalizing homological quantum codes to include torsion and multiple gradings. This produces low-density parity-check codes with parameters based on homology ranks, including examples from knot invariants and quantum rotors. A shared grading leads to a refined Singleton bound: $d \leq \frac{n - k + 2}{2} - \frac{\epsilon}{2}$, where $\epsilon > 0$ reflects entropy adjustments from geometric singularities and defects. The bound holds partially for simple orbifolds and is supported by examples over small fields. Applications include post-quantum cryptography, fault-tolerant quantum computing, and optimization via graded neural networks, linking algebraic geometry, homological algebra, and quantum information.</p>

Binary tree network, being a subclass of Cayley tree network, is a significant topological structure used for information transfer in a hierarchical sense. In this article, we consider four types of binary tree repeater networks (directed and undirected, asymmetric and symmetric) and obtain the analytical expressions of the average of the maximum teleportation fidelities for each of these binary tree networks. Our work investigates the role of directionality and symmetry in this measure. Like [1], here also we have used simple Werner state-based models and are able to identify the parameter ranges for which these networks can show quantum advantage. We explore the role of maximally entangled states in the network to enhance the quantum advantage. We explore the large $N$ (nodes) scenario for each of these networks and find out the limiting value of the average of the maximum teleportation fidelity for each of these networks. We also include the scenarios when the Werner state parameters for each link are different and chosen from a uniform distribution.

            <h2>Simulating Quantum Turbulence with Matrix Product States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Felipe Gómez-Lozada, Nicolas Perico-García, Nikita Gourianov, Hayder Salman, Juan José Mendoza-Arenas</p>
            <p>Quantum turbulence spans length scales from the system size $L$ to the healing length $\xi$, making direct numerical simulations (DNS) of the Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation computationally expensive when $L \gg \xi$. We present a matrix product state (MPS) solver for the GP equation that efficiently compresses the wavefunction by truncating weak interlength-scale correlations. This approach reduces memory usage by factors ranging from 10x to over 10,000x compared to DNS. We benchmark our approach on nonlinear excitations, namely dark solitons (1D) and quantized vortices (2D, 3D), capturing key dynamics such as Kelvin wave propagation and vortex ring emission in the case of vortex line reconnection. For turbulent states composed of multiple nonlinear excitations, we find that the memory compression of the MPS representation is directly proportional to the soliton or vortex densities. We also accurately reproduce established results from two-point correlation functions and energy spectra, where we recover the incompressible kinetic energy spectrum with little memory overhead. These results demonstrate the representative capabilities of the MPS ansatz for quantum turbulence and pave the way for studying this nonequilibrium state using previously-prohibited system sizes to uncover novel physics.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Higher Order Fourier Analysis and the Clifford Hierarchy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kaifeng Bu, Weichen Gu, Arthur Jaffe</p>
            <p>We propose a mathematical framework that we call quantum, higher-order Fourier analysis. This generalizes the classical theory of higher-order Fourier analysis, which led to many advances in number theory and combinatorics. We define a family of quantum measures on a Hilbert space, that reduce in the case of diagonal matrices to the classical uniformity norms. We show that our quantum measures and our related theory of quantum higher-order Fourier analysis characterize the Clifford hierarchy, an important notion of complexity in quantum information. In particular, we give a necessary and sufficient analytic condition that a unitary is an element of the k-th level of the Clifford hierarchy.</p>

            <h2>A Superselection Rule for Quantum Causality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Issam Ibnouhsein</p>
            <p>In quantum causality, local laboratories are typically assumed to be operationally independent, each free to choose its own reference frames. We ask whether such independence is compatible with nonclassical correlations, and address this question using the resource-theoretic framework. We formalize local gauge freedom on laboratory connections as a symmetry, and prove that any bipartite process covariant under this symmetry is causally separable. This result holds in arbitrary dimensions and applies both to marginals of multipartite quantum circuits and to general reductions across cuts. Because such covariance enforces a strict superselection rule, it explains why circuit-embeddable dynamics, such as the quantum switch, cannot violate bipartite causal inequalities, even asymptotically. Our analysis thus establishes that generating nonclassical causal correlations requires physical resources that break operational independence.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xie-Hang Yu, Hongchao Li, J. Ignacio Cirac, Rahul Trivedi</p>
            <p>Many-body systems arising in condensed matter physics and quantum optics inevitably couple to the environment and need to be modelled as open quantum systems. While near-optimal algorithms have been developed for simulating many-body quantum dynamics, algorithms for their open system counterparts remain less well investigated. We address the problem of simulating geometrically local many-body open quantum systems interacting with a stationary Gaussian environment. Under a smoothness assumption on the system-environment interaction, we develop near-optimal algorithms that, for a model with $N$ spins and evolution time $t$, attain a simulation error $\delta$ in the system-state with $\mathcal{O}(Nt(Nt/\delta)^{o(1)})$ gates, $\mathcal{O}(t(Nt/\delta)^{o(1)})$ parallelized circuit depth and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(N(Nt/\delta)^{o(1)})$ ancillas. We additionally show that, if only simulating local observables is of interest, then the circuit depth of the digital algorithm can be chosen to be independent of the system size $N$. This provides theoretical evidence for the utility of these algorithms for simulating physically relevant models, where typically local observables are of interest, on pre-fault tolerant devices. Finally, for the limiting case of Markovian dynamics with commuting jump operators, we propose two algorithms based on sampling a Wiener process and on a locally dilated Hamiltonian construction, respectively. These algorithms reduce the asymptotic gate complexity on $N$ compared to currently available algorithms in terms of the required number of geometrically local gates.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alec L. Riso, Karthik Thyagarajan, Connor Whiting, Katherine Jimenez</p>
            <p>Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) stands as a revolutionary approach to secure communication, using the principles of quantum mechanics to establish unbreakable channels. Unlike traditional cryptography, which relies on the computational difficulty of mathematical problems, QKD utilizes the inherent properties of quantum states to achieve information-theoretic security. This means that the security of the key exchange is guaranteed by the laws of physics, making it theoretically unbreakable even by an adversary with unlimited computational power. Currently, one of the most viable ways to implement QKD for communication is via photonics, namely, using phase-preserving long-distance optical fibers. The objective of this project is to implement photonic QKD in a laboratory setting. This will help demonstrate the protocol's robustness and provide a feasible implementation for educational demonstrations.</p>

            <p>Quantum computing enables parallelism through superposition and entanglement and offers advantages over classical computing architectures.

By incorporating batch-buffered overlap processing, dependency-aware gate contraction and staggered multi-gate parallelism, our optimizations significantly enhance the simulation speed compared to unoptimized baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of hybrid-level parallelism in HPC systems. Benchmark results show that Q$^2$Chemistry consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art open-source simulators across various circuit types.

            <h2>Connes spectral distance and nonlocality of generalized noncommutative phase spaces</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bing-Sheng Lin, Tai-Hua Heng</p>
            <p>We study the Connes spectral distance of quantum states and analyse the nonlocality of a 4D generalized noncommutative phase space. By virtue of the Hilbert-Schmidt operatorial formulation, we obtain the Dirac operator and construct a spectral triple corresponding to the noncommutative phase space. Based on the ball condition, we obtain some constraint relations about the optimal elements, and then calculate the Connes spectral distance between two Fock states. Due to the noncommutativity, the spectral distances between Fock states in generalized noncommutative phase spaces are shorter than those in normal phase spaces. This shortening of distances implies some type of nonlocality caused by the noncommutativity. These spectral distances in the 4D generalized noncommutative phase space are additive and satisfy the normal Pythagoras theorem. When the noncommutative parameters go to zero, the results return to those in normal quantum phase spaces.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stefano Carignano, Luca Tagliacozzo</p>
            <p>We show how the Loschmidt echo of a product state after a quench to a conformal invariant critical point and its leading finite time corrections can be predicted by using conformal field theories (CFT). We check such predictions with tensor networks, finding excellent agreement. As a result, we can use the Loschmidt echo to extract the universal information of the underlying CFT including the central charge, the operator content, and its generalized temporal entropies. We are also able to predict and confirm an emerging dual-unitarity of the evolution at late times, since the spatial transfer matrix operator that evolves the system in space becomes unitary in such limit. Our results on the growth of temporal entropies also imply that, using state-of-the art tensor networks algorithms, such calculations only require resources that increase polynomially with the duration of the quench, thus providing an example of numerically efficiently solvable out-of-equilibrium scenario.</p>

This extension introduces the concept of Quantum Thermodynamic Integrability (QTI), offering an alternative foundation for statistical mechanics. QTI is characterized by the path-independence of work and heat within the thermodynamic manifold, which is locally described by energy levels and specific thermodynamic parameters. Within this framework, temperature naturally emerges as an integrating factor, allowing for the derivation of both canonical and non-canonical states from the Entropy Integrable Equations (EIE) based on QTI. Notably, non-canonical states, which become particularly significant outside the thermodynamic limit, reveal the existence of informational correlations in finite-size thermodynamic systems.</p>

We quantify the impact of numerical analysis on the distinction of such signals. Furthermore, we explore dimensionality reduction techniques to create interpretable and precise photon-number embeddings. We demonstrate that the preservation of local data structures of some nonlinear methods is an accurate way to achieve unsupervised classification of TES traces. We do so by considering a confidence metric that quantifies the overlap of the photon-number clusters inside a latent space. Furthermore, we demonstrate that for our dataset previous methods such as the signal's area and principal component analysis can resolve up to 16 photons with confidence above $90\%$ while nonlinear techniques can resolve up to 21 with the same confidence threshold. Also, we showcase implementations of neural networks to leverage information within local structures, aiming to increase confidence in assigning photon numbers. Finally, we demonstrate the advantage of some nonlinear methods to detect and remove outlier signals.</p>

            <p>When two or more energy bands become degenerate at a singular point in the momentum space, such singularity, or ``Dirac points", gives rise to intriguing quantum phenomena as well as unusual material properties. Systems at the Dirac points can possess topological charges and their unique properties can be probed by various methods, such as transport measurement, interferometry and momentum spectroscopy. While the topology of Dirac point in the momentum space is well studied theoretically, observation of topological defects in a many-body quantum systems at Dirac point remain an elusive goal. Based on atomic Bose-Einstein condensate in a graphene-like optical honeycomb lattice, we directly observe emergence of quantized vortices at the Dirac point. The phase diagram of lattice bosons at the Dirac point is revealed. Our work provides a new way of generating vortices in a quantum gas, and the method is generic and can be applied to different types of optical lattices with topological singularity, especially twisted bilayer optical lattices.</p>

            <p>Coulomb crystals -- ordered structures of cold ions confined in ion traps -- find applications in a variety of research fields. The number and temperature of the ions forming the Coulomb crystals are two key attributes of interest in many trapped-ion experiments. Here, we present a fast and accurate approach to determining these attributes from fluorescence images of the ions based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this approach, we first generate a large number of images of Coulomb crystals with different ion numbers and temperatures using molecular-dynamics simulations and then train CNN models on these images to classify the desired attributes. The classification performance of several common pretrained CNN models was compared in example tasks. We find that for crystals with ion numbers in the range 100--299 and secular temperatures of 5--15 mK, the best-performing model can discern number variations on the level of one ion with an accuracy of 93% and temperature variations by 1 mK with an accuracy of 92%. Since the trained model can be directly integrated into experiments, in-situ determination of these attributes can be realized in a non-invasive fashion, which has the potential to greatly facilitate the analysis and control of trapped ions in real time.</p>

We compute the quantum-information observables for the corresponding two-qutrit system $(ZZ)$ at next-to-leading order electroweak (NLO EW) accuracy in the SM. We find that NLO EW corrections lead to giant (order 1) effects in some specific cases, significantly altering the extraction of observables quantifying the quantum correlations. We identify observables that are robust and can be used to extract reliable information. Finally, we discuss possible new physics (NP) effects, parametrised via an effective-field-theory approach.

            <p>Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are a promising platform for high-precision magnetometry. In contrast to the use of spontaneous emission in a number of NV-magnetometers, laser threshold magnetometry (LTM) exploits stimulated emission of NV centers by placing an NV-doped diamond inside an optical cavity. The NV laser system is predicted to reach a high magnetic-field-dependent contrast and coherent signal strength, leading to an improved magnetic field sensitivity combined with a high linearity. Here, we consider a two-media setup where the cavity additionally includes a vertical external cavity surface emitting laser. This optically active material compensates cavity losses at \SI{750}{nm} while still allowing for magnetic-field-dependent effects from the NV-diamond. We demonstrate a magnetic-field-dependent laser threshold and investigate the effects of pump laser induced absorption of the diamond. The experimental data is supported by an analytical simulation based on a rate model. Furthermore, we derive a generalized formula to compute the shot-noise-limited magnetic field sensitivity in the regime of high contrast yielding 49.07(33) pT/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ for the present setup. Simulations with an optimized NV-diamond suggest that values down to 4.9 ft/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ are possible.</p>

            <p>Fibre Fabry-Perot cavities (FFPCs) are used in various studies in cavity quantum electrodynamics (CQED) and quantum technologies due to the cavity's small mode volume and compact integration with optical fibres. We develop a novel $\text{CO}_2$ laser machining method that produces well-controlled surface profiles on the end facets of cleaved optical fibres. Using multiple shots in distinct spatial distribution patterns, our method employs a shooting algorithm that adaptively changes laser ablation parameters during the shooting to suppress deviations from the desired profile. This is made possible by $\textit{in situ}$ imaging of the machined profile, its inspection and the usage of the information in the subsequent steps. Underlying this algorithm is a newly found laser ablation parameter, the pause between shots, which controls the accumulation of heat in between successive laser shots and as a result determines the area of impact made by an individual ablation sequence. We fabricate fibre-based micro-mirrors with radii of curvature ranging from 250 $\mu$m to 700 $\mu$m with an effective mirror diameter of 60 $\mu$m in either Gaussian or spherical profiles. Due to the self-correcting nature of our adaptive algorithm, we achieve a near 100\% success rate in the production of desired profiles with low ellipticity. After furnishing the laser machined fibre end facets with high reflectivity coating, FFPCs are formed to demonstrate a high finesse up to 150,000 at an optical wavelength of 854 nm.</p>

            <p>By generalizing the construction of genuine multi-entropy ${\rm GM}[\mathtt{q}]$ for genuine multi-partite entanglement proposed in the previous paper arXiv:2502.07995, we give a prescription on how to construct ${\rm GM}[\mathtt{q}]$ systematically for any $\mathtt{q}$. The crucial point is that our construction naturally fits to the partition number $p(\mathtt{a})$ of integer $\mathtt{a}$. For general $\mathtt{q}$, ${\rm GM}[\mathtt{q}]$ contains $N (\mathtt{q}) = p(\mathtt{q})-p(\mathtt{q}-1)-1$ number of free parameters. Furthermore, these give $N (\mathtt{q})+1$ number of new diagnostics for genuine $\mathtt{q}$-partite entanglement. Especially for $\mathtt{q}=4$ case, this reproduces not only the known diagnostics pointed out by arXiv:1406.2663, but also a new diagnostics for quadripartite entanglement. We also study these ${\rm GM}[\mathtt{q}]$ for $\mathtt{q} = 4, 5$ in holography and show that these are of the order of ${\cal{O}}\left(1/G_N \right)$ both analytically and numerically. Our results give evidence that genuine multipartite entanglement is ubiquitous in holography.

            <p>An interesting question in physics is how the correlation energy of atoms evolves upon forming a solid. Here, we address this problem for a specific case of double-layer FeSe. We used many-body wavefunction-based quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) techniques to compute the correlation energies of double-layer FeSe with different geometrical configurations and compared them with those of isolated Fe and Se atoms. Variational and diffusion QMC calculations were carried out with Slater Jastrow trial wavefunctions employing two alternative forms for the homogeneous two-body pair correlation term. The ground-state energy was obtained in the thermodynamic limit using two types of trial wave functions of JDFT, in which only the Jastrow factor is optimized while the Slater determinant is derived from the local density approximation, and JSD, where both the Jastrow factor and the Slater determinant are optimized simultaneously. Our results indicate that the correlation energy of double layer FeSe at the thermodynamic limit is mainly determined by the atomic contributions, with the bonding between atoms playing a comparatively minor role in it. After optimizing the interlayer separation of double-layer FeSe under tensile strain, we analyze the correlation energy as a function of strain and separation. We found that with increasing tensile stretch and interlayer spacing, the correlation energy of double-layer FeSe stochastically approaches that of its constituent atomic fragments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Logan S. McCarty</p>
            <p>Comparing probability distributions is a core challenge across the natural, social, and computational sciences. Existing methods, such as Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), struggle in high-dimensional and non-compact domains. Here we introduce quantum probability metrics (QPMs), derived by embedding probability measures in the space of quantum states: positive, unit-trace operators on a Hilbert space. This construction extends kernel-based methods and overcomes the incompleteness of MMD on non-compact spaces. Viewed as an integral probability metric (IPM), QPMs have dual functions that uniformly approximate all bounded, uniformly continuous functions on $\mathbb{R}^n$, offering enhanced sensitivity to subtle distributional differences in high dimensions. For empirical distributions, QPMs are readily calculated using eigenvalue methods, with analytic gradients suited for learning and optimization. Although computationally more intensive for large sample sizes ($O(n^3)$ vs. $O(n^2)$), QPMs can significantly improve performance as a drop-in replacement for MMD, as demonstrated in a classic generative modeling task. By combining the rich mathematical framework of quantum mechanics with classical probability theory, this approach lays the foundation for powerful tools to analyze and manipulate probability measures.</p>

Quantum particles are introduced as sections $\Psi_+$ of the bundle $L_C^+$ holomorphic along the space $C^2_L\times C^2_R$, and antiparticles are sections $\Psi_-^{}$ of the bundle $L_C^-$ antiholomorphic along the internal spin space $C^2_L\times C^2_R$. The wave functions $\Psi_\pm$ are characterized by conserved charges $q_{\sf{v}}=\pm 1$ associated with the structure group U(1)$_{\sf{v}}$ of the bundles $L_C^\pm$. Wave functions $\Psi_\pm$ are governed by relativistic analogue of the Schrödinger equation. We show how fields with spin $s=0$ (Klein-Gordon), spin $s=\frac12$ (Dirac) and spin $s=1$ (Proca fields) arise from these equations in the zeroth, first, and second order expansions of the functions $\Psi_\pm^{}$ in the coordinates of the spin space $C^2_L\times C^2_R$. The Klein-Gordon, Dirac and Proca equations for these fields follow from the Schrödinger equation on the extended phase space $T^* R^{1,3}\times C^2_L\times C^2_R$. Using these results, we also introduce equations describing first quantized photons. We show that taking into account the charges $q_{\sf{v}}=\pm 1$ of the fields $\Psi_\pm$ changes the definitions of the inner products and currents, which eliminates negative energies and negative probabilities from relativistic quantum mechanics.</p>

            <h2>Note on searching for critical lattice models as entropy critical points from strange correlator</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anran Jin, Ling-Yan Hung</p>
            <p>An entropy function is proposed in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 251602] as a way to detect criticality even when the system size is small. In this note we apply this strategy in the search for criticality of lattice transfer matrices constructed based on the topological holographic principle. We find that the combination of strategy is indeed a cost-effective and efficient way of identifying critical boundary conditions, estimating central charges and moreover, plotting entire phase diagrams in a multi-dimensional phase space.</p>

            <h2>The Kerr-Induced Superradiant Tricritical Point</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arash Azizi, Reed Nessler</p>
            <p>The interplay of interaction and dissipation in open quantum systems can forge phase transitions beyond conventional paradigms. In the canonical quantum Rabi model, we demonstrate that a photon-photon (Kerr) interaction transforms the celebrated superradiant phase transition, inducing a line that separates continuous, second-order behavior from discontinuous, first-order regimes. Strikingly, this is not a line of tricritical points. Instead, we prove that genuine tricriticality is an isolated phenomenon, emerging only at a single, mathematically exact dissipation rate: the ``sweet spot'' of $\kappa_t^2 = (\sqrt{13}-2)/3$. Our discovery pinpoints the precise and restrictive conditions for realizing a rare multicritical point in a foundational quantum optical system, identifying this critical dissipation as a unique gateway to a higher order of criticality.</p>

We show how to write and edit these bi-photon correlations between the two output channels of a beam-splitter, hiding this encoded information from conventional intensity measurements. Our scheme offers an easy extension to multiparticle scenarios and facilitates the transmission of high-dimensional quantum information, with potential applications to quantum communication and imaging protocols.</p>

            <p>We introduce the Qumode Subspace Variational Quantum Eigensolver (QSS-VQE), a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for computing molecular excited states using the Fock basis of bosonic qumodes in circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) devices. This approach harnesses the native universal gate sets of qubit-qumode architectures to construct highly expressive variational ansatze, offering potential advantages over conventional qubit-based methods. In QSS-VQE, the electronic structure Hamiltonian is first mapped to a qubit representation and subsequently embedded into the Fock space of bosonic qumodes, enabling efficient state preparation and reduced quantum resource requirements. We demonstrate the performance of QSS-VQE through simulations of molecular excited states, including dihydrogen and a conical intersection in cytosine. Additionally, we explore a bosonic model Hamiltonian to assess the expressivity of qumode gates, identifying regimes where qumode-based implementations outperform purely qubit-based approaches. These results highlight the promise of leveraging bosonic degrees of freedom for enhanced quantum simulation of complex molecular systems.</p>

            <h2>Cavity QED based on strongly localized modes: exponentially enhancing single-atom cooperativity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qian Bin, Ying Wu, Jin-Hua Gao, Aixi Chen, Franco Nori, Xin-You Lü</p>
            <p>Large single-atom cooperativity in quantum systems is important for quantum information processing. Here, we propose to exponentially enhance the single-atom cooperativity parameter by exploiting the strongly localized effect of modes in cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) systems. By increasing the wing width of a cavity with special geometry symmetry, the interference property allows us to exponentially improves the quality factor Q without altering the mode volume V for cavities supporting subwavelength light modes. This effectively overcomes the trade-off between Q and V in conventional subwavelength Fabry-Perot cavities. Consequently, we demonstrate the occurrence of ultra-long vacuum Rabi oscillations and the generation of strong photon blockade by enhancing the single-atom cooperativity parameter. This work offers a promising approach for advancing coherent manipulation and holds significant potential for applications in establishing longer-distance quantum communication networks, enhancing the precision and stability of quantum sensors, and improving the efficiency of quantum algorithms.</p>

            <h2>Tracking Quantum Dynamics in an Optical Cavity for Recovering Purity and Squeezing via Quantum State Smoothing</h2>

            <p>Tracking the dynamics of a quantum system is conventionally achieved by monitoring the system continuously in time and filtering the information contained in measurement records via the causal quantum trajectory approach. However, in practical scenarios there is often loss of information to the environment, leading to filtered states that are impure because of decoherence. If real-time tracking is not required, the lost information can be maximally extracted via acausal quantum state smoothing, which has been theoretically proven to better restore the system's coherence (purity) than causal filtering. Interestingly, quantum state smoothing requires assumptions of how any lost quantum information (unobserved by the experimenter) was turned into classical information by the environment. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate smoothing scenarios, using an optical parametric oscillator and introducing `observed' and `unobserved' channels by splitting the output beam into two independent homodyne detectors. We achieve improvement in state purification of 10.3% +/- 1.6%, squeezing restoration of 7.6% +/- 2.6%, and show that smoothed states are better estimates of hidden true states than those from conventional filtering. The estimation techniques used in this paper are promising for many applications in quantum information that incorporate post-processing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. F. Urquijo Rodríguez, Edgar A. Gómez, H. Vinck-Posada</p>
            <p>We propose a theoretical control protocol designed for the dynamic synthesis of single qubit and four-level qudit quantum gates using external parameters, such as photonic Gaussian pulses and magnetic fields, in a microcavity quantum well system.

We demonstrate that it is possible to achieve precise manipulation of populations of encoded quantum states through the unitary evolution of the system. In particular, we illustrate our optimization method for generating a single qubit gate with a mean fidelity of 99.99 as well as the realization of an iSWAP gate in the four level qudit case with a fidelity of 99.6.</p>

            <p>The generation of high Fock states of light pulses and their superpositions with provable quantum non-Gaussian features is still very challenging, although the power of conditional methods to herald the approximate state from the available Gaussian states is growing. The atom-light interaction in the high-Q cavity has been considered a viable alternative to the heralded Fock states of the light pulses from nonlinear optics limited to three-photon Fock states for the last decade. Here, by optimizing the realistic protocol combining it with available optical delay elements we conclusively predict filtering of Fock states up to ten photons with a high success rate of $20\%$ using a hierarchy of quantum non-Gaussian criteria. Moreover, the filtering protocol enables the preparation of superposition of Fock states and we analyse this emerging case up to two photons with with provable quantum non-Gaussian coherence and high success rate $50\%$. To demonstrate their quality for applications, we evaluate the robustness of such features, the bunching capability in a linear network, and the sensing capability to estimate the magnitude of unknown force, noise and phase, These assessments outline the essential conditions and application criteria for realistic optical cavity QED interaction on light pulses to outperform photon detection methods.</p>

            <p>A theory for ground-state modifications of matter embedded in a Fabry-Perot cavity and whose excitations are described as harmonic oscillators is presented. Based on Lifshitz's theory for vacuum energy and employing a Lorentz model for the material permittivity, a non-perturbative macroscopic QED model was built that accounts for the infinite number of cavity modes with a continuum of their wavevectors. Differences from the commonly used single-mode Hopfield Hamiltonian are revealed. The non-resonant role of polaritons in the ground-state energy shift is also demonstrated, showing that the cavity effect is mainly caused by static screening occurring at very low frequencies. The theory allows for a straightforward incorporation of losses and temperature effects.</p>

            <p>Magnetometers based on nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have emerged as the most important solid-state quantum sensors. However, ensembles are limited in optical contrast to typically a few percent and high-sensitivity variants usually possess only a few $\mathrm{\mu}$T dynamic range. Here, we demonstrate a laser threshold magnetometry-based NV system that avoids these limitations. By integrating the NV centers into a laser cavity and showing magnetic-field-dependent shifts of the laser threshold, we observe 100\,\% contrast with strong output signals up to 50\,mW. The resulting system exhibits a dynamic range of $\pm$280\,$\mathrm{\mu}$T with a photon-shot-noise-limited sensitivity of 670\,fT/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$, which we demonstrate to improve super-linearly with contrast. The ratio of these sensing-relevant parameters, that can be traded at the cost of each other, marks an improvement factor of 780 over typical fluorescence-based readout and vapor cell sensors. Such performance improvements open the door to new generations of sensors for applications including magnetoencephalography, magnetic navigation, and magnetic anomaly detection.</p>

            <p>Quantum many-body systems present substantial technical challenges from both analytical and numerical perspectives. Despite these difficulties, some progress has been made, including studies of interacting atomic gases and interacting quantum spins. Furthermore, the potential for criticality to enhance engine performance has been demonstrated, suggesting a promising direction for future investigation. Here, we explore the performance of a quantum Otto cycle using a long-range Ising chain as the working substance. We consider an idealized cycle consisting of two adiabatic transformations and two perfect thermalizations, eliminating dissipation. Analyzing both engine and refrigerator modes, we investigate the influence of particle number, varied from 10 to 100, on efficiencies and behavior near the critical point of the phase transition, which we characterize using a scaling factor. We also examine how internal factors; specifically, the power-law exponent, the number of particles, and the hot and cold reservoir temperatures, affect the system's operation in different modes. Our results reveal that these factors have a different impact compared to their classical counterparts.</p>

            <h2>Efficient Magic State Cultivation on the Surface Code</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yotam Vaknin, Shoham Jacoby, Arne Grimsmo, Alex Retzker</p>
            <p>Magic state cultivation is a newly proposed protocol that represents the state of the art in magic state generation. It uses the transversality of the $H_{XY}$ gate on the 2D triangular color-code, together with a novel grafting mechanism to transform the color-code into a matchable code with minimal overhead. Still, the resulting code has a longer cycle time and some high weight stabilizers. Here, we introduce three new cultivation protocols, each yielding a different magic state. These protocols avoid grafting by exploiting transversal operations on the surface code using non-local connectivity, allowing for a much lower post-selection rates in the expansion process. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that our protocol achieves state-of-the-art infidelities and acceptance rates for magic state generation, on par with another recent proposal on the $\mathbb{RP}^2$ code, while still preserving the local geometry of the surface code. Moreover, in platforms such as cold atoms and trapped ions, where idle error rates are lower than two-qubit gate errors, we demonstrate that cultivation exhibits an even greater advantage, yielding an additional order-of-magnitude reduction in resource requirements. Lastly, we analyze the effect of erasure qubits on cultivation and show that \emph{algorithmically-relevant} infidelities can be achieved using only 9 erasure qubits on a distance-2 surface code with a single cultivation round.</p>

            <p>The quantum vacuum of the electromagnetic field is inherently entangled across distinct spatial sub-regions, resulting in non-trivial particle content across these sub-regions. However, accessing this particle content in a controlled laboratory experiment has remained out of experimental reach. Here we propose to overcome this challenge with a quantum mirror made from a two-dimensional sub-wavelength array of atoms that divides a photonic cavity. The arrays response to light is tunable between transmissive and reflective states by a control atom that is excited to a Rydberg state. We find that photon content from entangled sub-regions of the vacuum causes subtle frequency shifts that are accessible to sub-wavelength atom array platforms. This novel approach for probing vacuum particle content stems from the systems unique ability to create coherent dynamics of superpositions of transmissive and reflective states, providing a quantum-enhanced platform for observing particle content from entangled spatial sub-regions of the electromagnetic field vacuum.</p>

            <p>Feedback cooling plays a critical role in stabilizing quantum systems and achieving low temperatures, where a key question is to determine the fundamental thermodynamic limits on cooling performance. We establish a fundamental bound on quantum feedback cooling in Gaussian systems, by deriving a generalized second law of thermodynamics involving the kinetic temperatures of the system and a measure of quantum information flow obtained by continuous measurement. In contrast to previously known bounds, the obtained bound can be saturated by experimentally feasible situations using the quantum Kalman filter with a large feedback gain, where the cooling efficiency approaches its maximum. Our theoretical result is numerically demonstrated using parameters from an experiment of levitated nanoparticles. Our theory provides a general framework for understanding the thermodynamic constraints on quantum feedback cooling.</p>

            <p>Certifying a quantum state in a device independent (DI) manner, in which no trust is placed on the internal workings of any physical components, is a fundamental task bearing various applications in quantum information theory. The composability of a state certification protocol is key to its integration as a subroutine within information theoretic protocols. In this work, we present a composable certification of quantum states in a DI manner under the assumption that a source prepares a finite sequence of independent quantum states that are not necessarily identical. We show that the security relies on the DI analog of the fidelity, called the extractability. We develop methods to compute this quantity under local operations and classical communication in certain Bell scenarios that self test the singlet state, which may also be of independent interest. Finally, we demonstrate our framework by certifying the singlet state in a composable and DI manner using the Clauser Horne Shimony Holt inequality.</p>

            <p>We present an explicit construction of a universal embezzlement protocol in the C*-algebraic model of quantum information, that is equivalent to the commuting operator model. Our protocol enables exact embezzlement of arbitrary bipartite pure states using a single, fixed catalyst state. Unlike prior constructions that achieve only approximate embezzlement or require state-dependent catalysts, our approach is both exact and state-independent. The construction is explicit, based on simple *-automorphisms acting locally on infinite tensor products of CAR algebras with the underlying idea of the Hilbert hotel. In the dense-state case, the protocol naturally recovers the Type III_1 factor via the GNS construction, consistent with recent classification results. We further extend the construction to allow exact embezzlement of all states, at the cost of working with a non-separable C*-algebra. Despite the increase in algebraic size, the operational structure remains simple and localized. This offers a conceptually intuitive model for universal entanglement embezzlement in infinite-dimensional settings.</p>

            <p>The quantum Fisher information, the quantum analogue of the classical Fisher information, is a central quantity in quantum metrology and quantum sensing due to its connection to parameter estimation and fidelity susceptibility. Using numerically exact methods applied to a paradigmatic open quantum system, the spin-boson model, we calculate both static and dynamical quantum Fisher information matrix elements with respect to spin-bath couplings and magnetic field strengths. As the spin-bath interaction increases, we first show that the coupling-coupling matrix elements relative to the ground state of the Hamiltonian are linked to the entanglement growth and signal the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless quantum phase transition through their non-monotonic behavior. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the time-dependent matrix elements can reveal non-Markovian effects as well as the transition from the coherent to incoherent regime at the Toulouse point, remaining robust under pure dephasing noise. Non-monotonic signatures of the quantum Fisher information matrix reflect changes in quantum resources such as entanglement and coherence, quantify non-Markovian behavior, and enable criticality-enhanced quantum sensing, thereby shedding light on key features of open quantum systems.</p>

            <p>In recent years, the quantum computing method has been used to address the sign problem in traditional Monte Carlo lattice gauge theory (LGT) simulations. We propose that the Coulomb gauge (CG) should be used in quantum simulations of LGT. This is because the redundant degrees of freedom can be eliminated in CG. Therefore, the Hamiltonian in CG does not need to be gauge invariance, allowing the gauge field to be discretized naively. We point out that discretized gauge fields and fermion fields should be placed on momentum and position lattices, respectively. Under this scheme, the CG condition and Gauss's law can be conveniently preserved by solving algebraic equations of polarization vectors. We also discuss the procedure for mapping gauge fields to qubits, and then demonstrate the polynomial scaling of qubits and the complexity of time evolution. Finally, we calculate the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the U(1) plaquette operator and the Wilson loop on a classical device to test the performance of our discretization scheme.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> F. Nur Ünal, A. Nardin, N. Goldman</p>
            <p>Quantum Hall states are characterized by a topological invariant, the many-body Chern number, which determines their quantized Hall conductivity. This invariant also emerges in circular dichroic responses, namely, by applying a circular drive and comparing excitation rates for opposite orientations. This work explores the dichroic response of confined, isolated quantum Hall systems, where bulk and edge contributions cancel exactly: When the edge response is properly isolated, the circular dichroic signal becomes quantized, serving as a direct and elegant probe of the many-body Chern number encoded in the edge physics. We demonstrate that this quantized edge response is entirely captured by low-energy chiral edge modes, allowing for a universal description of this effect based on Wen's edge theory. Its low-energy nature implies that the quantized edge response can be distinguished from the bulk response in the frequency domain. The edge response is also shown to be a sensitive diagnostic of geometric features. This opens the possibility of characterizing the shape of quantum Hall droplets through edge spectroscopic measurements, without requiring knowledge of the system's boundary profile. We illustrate our findings using realistic models of integer and fractional Chern insulators, with different edge geometries, and propose detection schemes suitable for ultracold atoms.</p>

            <p>We investigate the gravitational impulse by using the generalized formulation of the quantum Boltzmann equation (QBE), wherein the initial states are taken as wave packets rather than plane waves. The QBE operates within an open quantum system framework. Using this approach, we can analyze the two-body gravitational scattering by considering one body as part of the environment and the other as the system. Through this procedure, we obtain the system's impulse up to the second order for two massive objects. Similarly, we apply the forward scattering of the QBE to the gravitational impulse of a photon due to a massive object, during which we consider the photon as the system and the massive object as the environment. In this methodology, we use the QBE to compute the time evolution of the momentum operator associated with the system. While the forward scattering term vanishes when considering point particles, we demonstrate its persistence when using wave packets to describe both massive particles and the photon field. The results reported here are entirely consistent with the previous approaches.</p>

            <p>Entangled vortex filaments are essential to turbulence, serving as coherent structures that govern nonlinear fluid dynamics and support the reconstruction of fluid fields to reveal statistical properties. This study introduces an quantum implicit representation of vortex filaments in turbulence, employing a level-set method that models the filaments as the intersection of the real and imaginary zero iso-surfaces of a complex scalar field. Describing the fluid field via the scalar field offers distinct advantages in capturing complex structures, topological properties, and fluid dynamics, while opening new avenues for innovative solutions through quantum computing platforms. The representation is reformulated into an eigenvalue problem for Hermitian matrices, enabling the conversion of velocity fields into complex scalar fields that embed the vortex filaments. The resulting optimization is addressed using a variational quantum eigensolver, with Pauli operator truncation and deep learning techniques applied to improve efficiency and reduce noise. The proposed quantum framework achieves a near-linear time complexity and a exponential storage reduction while maintaining a balance of accuracy, robustness, and versatility, presenting a promising tool for turbulence analysis, vortex dynamics research, and machine learning dataset generation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> G. Gimeno, M. Xipell, Enric Pérez</p>
            <p>This work analyses the extent to which the "blurred orbits" of the current model for the atom, drafted by Heisenberg in 1926, fits the image of a bunch of wandering electrons around a nucleus. We will deal with early appearances of the concept of indistinguishable particles within the frame of quantum mechanics. There are few studies on the use of this concept in Heisenberg's 1926 papers on helium, in contrast with the large number of them on its use in Bose--Einstein's 1924 papers. We will discuss to what extent Heisenberg's approach leads to a purely statistical interpretation of this concept. We will also study the viewpoint of Dirac, who dealt with the same topic few months later. Although the indistinguishability of the electrons and indeterminacy are common explanations for the blurring of electron orbits, we argue that such an image is an oversimplification which masks interesting aspects of: a) the dynamics of bound electrons and b) the deeper implications of indistinguishability in quantum mechanics.</p>

            <h2>Search for thermodynamically stable ambient-pressure superconducting hydrides in GNoME database</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Antonio Sanna, Tiago F. T. Cerqueira, Ekin Dogus Cubuk, Ion Errea, Yue-Wen Fang</p>
            <p>Hydrides are considered to be one of the most promising families of compounds for achieving high temperature superconductivity. However, there are very few experimental reports of ambient-pressure hydride superconductivity, and the superconducting critical temperatures ($T_{\rm c}$) are typically less than 10 K. At the same time several hydrides have been predicted to exhibit superconductivity around 100 K at ambient pressure but in thermodynamically unfavorable phases. In this work we aim at assessing the superconducting properties of thermodynamically stable hydride superconductors at room pressure by investigating the GNoME material database, which has been recently released and includes thousands of hydrides thermodynamically stable at 0K. To scan this large material space we have adopted a multi stage approach which combines machine learning for a fast initial evaluation and cutting edge ab initio methods to obtain a reliable estimation of ($T_{\rm c}$). Ultimately we have identified 22 cubic hydrides with ($T_{\rm c}$) above 4.2~K and reach a maximum ($T_{\rm c}$) of 17 K. While these critical temperatures are modest in comparison to some recent predictions, the systems where they are found, being stable, are likely to be experimentally accessible and of potential technological relevance.</p>

            <h2>The Chaotic Art: Quantum Representation and Manipulation of Color</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guosheng Hu</p>
            <p>Due to its unique computing principles, quantum computing technology will profoundly change the spectacle of color art. Focusing on experimental exploration of color qubit representation, color channel processing, and color image generation via quantum computing, this article proposes a new technical path for color computing in quantum computing environment, by which digital color is represented, operated, and measured in quantum bits, and then restored for classical computers as computing results. This method has been proved practicable as an artistic technique of color qubit representation and quantum computing via programming experiments in Qiskit and IBM Q. By building a bridge between classical chromatics and quantum graphics, quantum computers can be used for information visualization, image processing, and more color computing tasks. Furthermore, quantum computing can be expected to facilitate new color theories and artistic concepts.</p>

            <h2>Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions and Many-Body Backflow in Open Quantum Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kai Zhang, Chang Shu, Kai Sun</p>
            <p>Dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) are non-equilibrium transitions characterized by the orthogonality between an initial quantum state and its time-evolved counterpart following a sudden quench. Recently, studies of this phenomenon have been extended beyond closed quantum systems to include environmental interactions, often modeled through non-Hermitian effects. However, because non-Hermitian descriptions neglect both quantum jump processes and interaction effects, the ultimate fate of interacting quantum systems under full open-system quantum dynamics remains an open question. In this paper, by incorporating both interactions and full Liouvillian dynamics, we prove that DQPTs in open quantum systems remain robust when subject to either particle loss or particle gain alone, but are generically smeared out when both processes coexist, as a result of many-body particle backflow. Furthermore, we uncover a non-perturbative dynamical effect: even a weak admixture of gain (loss) into a system with loss (gain) can dramatically reshape the long-time behavior of DQPT dynamics, leading to substantial deviations over time. These phenomena--including the universal smearing of DQPTs and the emergence of large dynamical deviations in the long-time limit--arise intrinsically from non-equilibrium many-body effects in open quantum systems. Our findings are general and substantiated by both analytical arguments and numerical simulations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jad C. Halimeh, Niklas Mueller, Johannes Knolle, Zlatko Papić, Zohreh Davoudi</p>
            <p>Recent advances in quantum technologies have enabled quantum simulation of gauge theories -- some of the most fundamental frameworks of nature -- in regimes far from equilibrium, where classical computation is severely limited. These simulators, primarily based on neutral atoms, trapped ions, and superconducting circuits, hold the potential to address long-standing questions in nuclear, high-energy, and condensed-matter physics, and may ultimately allow first-principles studies of matter evolution in settings ranging from the early universe to high-energy collisions. Research in this rapidly growing field is also driving the convergence of concepts across disciplines and uncovering new phenomena. In this Review, we highlight recent experimental and theoretical developments, focusing on phenomena accessible in current and near-term quantum simulators, including particle production and string breaking, collision dynamics, thermalization, ergodicity breaking, and dynamical quantum phase transitions. We conclude by outlining promising directions for future research and opportunities enabled by available quantum hardware.</p>

            <h2>QuLTRA: Quantum hybrid Lumped and TRansmission lines circuits Analyzer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Simona Zaccaria, Antonio Gnudi</p>
            <p>We present QuLTRA (Quantum hybrid Lumped and TRansmission lines circuits Analyzer), an open-source Python package for the accurate simulation of superconducting quantum circuits containing both lumped and distributed elements. QuLTRA directly models coplanar waveguide (CPW) transmission lines and multi-line couplers without discretization into lumped-element equivalents, and extracts the circuit Hamiltonian parameters using the energy participation ratio (EPR) method. This approach enables fast and accurate extraction of mode frequencies, anharmonicities, cross-Kerr interactions, and Purcell decay rates without relying on full electromagnetic simulations, while naturally accounting for higher-order modes of distributed components. The performance of QuLTRA is validated against Ansys HFSS, pyEPR, QuCAT, and results from the literature, showing excellent agreement with orders-of-magnitude reductions in computational time with respect to full electromagnetic simulations. Some application examples are discussed, including the design of Purcell filters, multi-mode ultra-strong coupling systems, and multiplexed qubit readout schemes, demonstrating that QuLTRA can efficiently simulate complex architectures relevant to circuit quantum electrodynamics applications.</p>

            <h2>Polarization-Controlled Dual-State Distribution of Bell and N00N Entanglement Over a Metro-Scale Commercial Quantum Network</h2>

            <p>We report the first demonstration of multiphoton, dual state entanglement distribution over a metropolitan scale commercial fiber network, implemented on the EPB Bohr IV quantum network in Chattanooga, TN, using an all fiber optic experimental platform. Employing a spatially degenerate, continuous wave type II SPDC biphoton source and fully fiber coupled linear optics, we generated a 4 photon entangled state. Through polarization projective measurements on two locally retained photons, we then probabilistically heralded the remaining two photons into either a Bell state (particle particle entanglement) or a N00N state (mode-mode entanglement), which were then distributed to two spatially separated network nodes. Experimental verification confirmed successful entanglement distribution across the deployed network despite significant channel losses and limited source fidelity. These results highlight the versatility of our polarization controlled multi photon entanglement distribution over real world telecom infrastructure and lay the groundwork for future upgrades, including higher quality non degenerate photon sources, White Rabbit timing synchronization for true multi node entanglement, and active polarization control for enhanced fidelity and long term stability.</p>

            <h2>Cavity-Controlled High Harmonic Generation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zohar Amitay, Nimrod Moiseyev</p>
            <p>Employing non-Hermitian Floquet theory, the strong-field process of high harmonic (HH) generation by a classical continuous-wave field irradiating ground-state atom is discovered to be controllable by placing the irradiated atom inside a single-mode quantum cavity initiated even with a single photon. Judicious cavity coupling of cavity-free photo-induced atomic Floquet states forms polaritonic Floquet states that generate side harmonics around the (standard no-cavity) odd harmonics. The different possible cavity-controlled HH spectra, including also the ones resulting from several cavities in a row, enable attosecond-pulse sequences different from the one produced without a cavity. Moreover, the present study sets the framework and opens the way for further cavity control over the HH generation process as well as over other strong-field processes</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fazal Badshah, Imed Boukhris, Mohamed Sultan Al-Buriah, Yuan Zhou, Muhammad Idrees, Ziauddin</p>
            <p>We propose a theoretical investigation of the photonic spin Hall effect (PSHE) in a mid-infrared probe field by employing an asymmetric double AlGaAsGaAs quantum well as the intracavity medium. The system is designed such that an external control beam together with tunable tunneling barriers regulates the quantum interference of the probe tunneling process. This configuration enables precise manipulation of the PSHE for both horizontally and vertically polarized components of light. Our analysis reveals the emergence of a giant horizontal PSHE in the quantum well based cavity system. Moreover, by incorporating absorptive and gain-assisted cavity slabs, the horizontal PSHE is further amplified, leading to an even more pronounced photonic spin separation. The results provide novel insights into light matter interactions in semiconductor quantum wells and suggest an effective route for enhancing and controlling the PSHE in mid-infrared photonic devices.</p>

            <p>Quantum frequency conversion (QFC) plays a crucial role in constructing seamless interconnection between quantum systems operating at different wavelengths. To advance future quantum technology, chip-scale integrated QFC components, featuring high efficiency, small footprint, low power consumption and high scalability, are indispensable. In this work, we demonstrate the first hybrid integrated QFC chip on thin film lithium niobate platform that connects the telecom and visible bands. Benefiting from the periodically poled microring resonator with ulta-high normalized conversion efficiency of 386,000 %/W, an ultra-low pump power of 360 {\mu}W is achieved which is more than two orders of magnitude lower than traditional straight waveguide scheme. By injecting current into the chip, an on-chip quantum efficiency of 57% and a noise count of ~ 7k counts per second are achieved. Such an electrically pumped, integrated and scalable QFC chip would significantly advancing the integration of quantum network and the development of chip-scale quantum optical systems.</p>

            <h2>Unilateral Criticality and Phase Transition in the Cavity-Ising Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zeyu Rao, Xiaoshui Lin, Xiwang Luo, Guangcan Guo, Han Pu, Ming Gong</p>
            <p>Superradiant phase transitions from cavity light-matter coupling have been widely explored across platforms. Here, we report a unilateral critical endpoint (UCEP) and a tricritical point (TCP) in the phase diagram of the cavity-coupled transverse Ising model with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. At zero temperature, we demonstrate that this model hosts three phases separated by two second-order and one first-order transitions. These lines intersect at a TCP and a UCEP, the latter not captured by existing phase-transition paradigms. The UCEP displays one-sided criticality: approaching the point from one side, the system behaves as a second-order transition, while from the other side it is first-order. Correspondingly, two order parameters, respectively, undergo the first- and the second-order phase transitions at the same point. We construct a minimal description of UCEP with the density of the free energy $f = c_{1}(\tilde{\alpha}^{2}+c_{2})+(\tilde{\alpha}^{2}+c_{2})^{2}\ln{\vert\tilde{\alpha}^{2}+c_{2}\vert}$, with the UCEP at $(c_{1},c_{2})=(1/e,0)$ and $\tilde{\alpha}$ being the order parameter. We further map the finite-temperature phase diagram and perform a symmetry analysis. By unifying first- and second-order signatures in a single, direction-dependent endpoint, the UCEP introduces a qualitatively new class of phase transition and may have applications in fields such as quantum measurement and quantum sensing. This work also provides an intriguing platform for exploring novel critical phenomena in cavity-coupled many-body systems with or without dissipation.</p>

            <p>In the era of 6G and beyond, space-aerial-terrestrial quantum networks (SATQNs) are shaping the future of the global-scale quantum Internet. This paper investigates the collaboration among satellite, aerial, and terrestrial quantum networks to efficiently transmit high-fidelity quantum entanglements over long distances. We begin with a comprehensive overview of existing satellite-, aerial-, and terrestrial-based quantum networks. Subsequently, we address the entanglement routing problem with the objective of maximizing quantum network throughput by jointly optimizing path selection and entanglement generation rates (PS-EGR). Given that the original problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem, which is inherently intractable, we propose a Benders' decomposition (BD)-based algorithm to solve the problem efficiently. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed PS-EGR scheme, offering valuable insights into various optimizable factors within the system. Finally, we discuss the current challenges and propose promising avenues for future research in SATQNs.</p>

            <h2>Energy transfer between localized emitters in photonic cavities from first principles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Swarnabha Chattaraj, Giulia Galli</p>
            <p>Radiative and nonradiative resonant couplings between defects are ubiquitous phenomena in photonic devices used in classical and quantum information technology applications. In this work we present a first principles approach to enable quantitative predictions of the energy transfer between defects in photonic cavities, beyond the dipole-dipole approximation and including the many-body nature of the electronic states. As an example, we discuss the energy transfer from a dipole like emitter to an F center in MgO in a spherical cavity. We show that the cavity can be used to controllably enhance or suppress specific spin flip and spin conserving transitions. Specifically, we predict that a ~10 to 100 enhancement in the resonant energy transfer rate can be gained in the case of the F center in MgO at ~10nm distances from a dipolar source, using rather moderate cavity with quality factor Q~400. We also show that a similar suppression in the transfer rate can be achieved by off-tuning the cavity resonance relative to the emitter transition energy. The framework presented here is general and readily applicable to a wide range of devices where localized emitters are embedded in micro-spheres, core-shell nanoparticles, and dielectric Mie resonators. Hence, our approach paves the way to predict how to control energy transfer in quantum memories and in ultra-high density optical memories, and in a variety of quantum information platforms.</p>

And, in order to make this very clear, we will show that the quantum-mechanical description of a photon can already be identified, simply, by manipulating Maxwell's equations in free space with mathematical resources that, for instance, were already well known before the advent of Quantum Mechanics.</p>

            <p>Quantum communication resources offer significant advantages for fault-tolerant distributed protocols, particularly in Byzantine Agreement (BA), where reliability against adversarial interference is essential. Quantum Detectable Byzantine Agreement (QDBA) enables consensus protocols that surpass classical limitations by leveraging entangled quantum states. In this work, we focus on the practical realization of QDBA using Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pairs, the simplest maximally entangled quantum resources, making the protocol experimentally accessible across current quantum hardware platforms. We present a comprehensive computational study of the EPRQDBA protocol under realistic quantum network conditions, utilizing the Aliro Quantum Network Simulator to evaluate the performance and robustness of the protocol. Our simulations systematically explore the protocol's parameter space --including variations in network size, traitorous node count, the amount of entanglement consumed in the protocol, and physically motivated noise models tailored specifically for superconducting and photonic qubit technologies. Through extensive numerical experiments, we provide insights into how these physically realistic parameters impact protocol performance, establishing critical thresholds and optimal operational regimes for experimental implementations. This work bridges theoretical advances in quantum consensus protocols with practical network implementations, offering a concrete reference for experimentalists. Our findings serve as a guideline for evaluating and optimizing QDBA implementations in realistic, noisy environments.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Circuit Optimization for the Fault-Tolerance Era: Do We Have to Start from Scratch?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tobias Forster, Nils Quetschlich, Robert Wille</p>
            <p>Quantum computing has made significant advancements in the last years in both hardware and software. Unfortunately, the currently available Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware is still heavily affected by noise. Many optimization techniques have been developed to reduce the negative effects thereof, which, however, only works up to a certain point. Therefore, scaling quantum applications from currently considered small research examples to industrial applications requires error-correction techniques to execute quantum circuits in a fault-tolerant fashion and enter the Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computing (FTQC) era. These error-correction techniques introduce dramatic qubit overheads, leading to the requirement of tens of thousands of qubits already for toy-sized examples. Hence, quantum circuit optimization that reduces qubit overheads when shifting from the NISQ to the FTQC era is essential. This raises the question, whether we need to start from scratch, or whether current state-of-the-art optimization techniques can be used as a basis for this. To approach this question, this work investigates the effects of different optimization passes on a representative selection of quantum circuits. Since hardly any tools to automatically design and evaluate FTQC quantum circuits exist yet, we utilize resource estimation to compare the (potential) benefits gained by applying NISQ quantum circuit optimization to estimated FTQC resource requirements. The results indicate that, indeed, the estimated resource requirements for FTQC can be improved by applying NISQ quantum circuit optimization techniques. At the same time, more detailed investigations show what techniques lead to more benefits for FTQC compared to others, providing guidelines for the transfer of NISQ optimization techniques to the FTQC era.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sneha Narasimha Moorthy, Anupam Mazumdar</p>
            <p>We investigate a Stern-Gerlach type matter-wave interferometer where an inhomogeneous magnetic field couples to an embedded spin in a nanoparticle to create spatial superpositions. Employing a sequence of harmonic and inverted harmonic oscillator potentials created by external magnetic fields, we aim to enhance the one-dimensional superposition of a nanodiamond with mass $\sim 10^{-15}$ kg to $\sim 1 \mu$m. Such matter-wave interferometers have diverse applications, including entanglement of adjacent interferometers mediated by Standard Model and beyond-Standard Model fields, precision tests of the equivalence principle, quantum sensing, and laboratory probes of the quantum nature of spacetime. However, random fluctuations of the magnetic field stochastically perturbs the interferometer paths and induce dephasing. We quantitatively estimate the susceptibility of the interferometer to white noise arising from magnetic-field fluctuations. Constraining the dephasing rate $\Gamma$ to be low enough that the final coherence $e^{-\Gamma \tau}\leq 0.1$ (where $\tau$ is the experimental time duration), we obtain the following bounds on the noise to signal ratios: $\delta \eta_\text{IHP}/\eta_\text{IHP}\lesssim 10^{-13}$, where $\eta_\text{IHP}$ is the magnetic field curvature that gives rise to the inverted harmonic potential, and $\delta \eta_\text{HP}/\eta_\text{HP}\lesssim 10^{-6}$, where $\eta_\text{HP}$ is the linear magnetic field gradient that gives rise to the harmonic potential. For such tiny fluctuations, we demonstrate that the Humpty-Dumpty problem arising from a mismatch in position and momentum does not cause a loss in contrast of the interferometer. Further, we show that constraining the dephasing rate leads to stricter bounds on the noise parameters than enforcing a contrast threshold, indicating that good dephasing control ensures high interferometric contrast.</p>

            <p>As quantum computing progresses, the need for scalable solutions to address large-scale computational problems has become critical. Quantum supercomputers are the next upcoming frontier by enabling multiple quantum processors to collaborate effectively to solve large-scale computational problems. The emergence of quantum supercomputers necessitates an efficient interface to manage the quantum communication protocols between quantum processors. In this paper, we propose the Quantum Network Processing Unit (QNPU), which enables quantum applications to efficiently scale beyond the capacity of individual quantum processors, serving as a critical building block for future quantum supercomputers. The QNPU works alongside the Quantum Processing Unit (QPU) in our decoupled processing units architecture, where the QPU handles local quantum operations while the QNPU manages quantum communication between nodes. We design a comprehensive instruction set architecture (ISA) for the QNPU with high-level communication protocol abstractions, implemented via micro-operations that manage EPR resources, quantum operations, and classical communication. To facilitate programming, we introduce DistQASM, which extends OpenQASM with distributed quantum operations. We then propose a microarchitecture featuring both scalar and superscalar QNPU designs to enhance performance for communication-intensive quantum workloads. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our proposed QNPU design with distributed quantum workloads and demonstrate that the QNPU significantly improves the efficiency of communication between quantum nodes, paving the way for quantum supercomputing.</p>

The ability to control and monitor the rotational dynamics of molecular rotors inside the superfluid environment may shed new light on superfluidity and the interaction of superfluids with defects at the atomic level.</p>

These states emerge when the emitter is driven by an external field while coupled to the cavity. We show that by rapidly changing the driving strength, new wave packets can be generated, allowing multiple packets to coexist and evolve independently. We classify the resulting wave packet behavior into distinct dynamical subclasses between which we choose through the choice of relevant parameters. Based on this understanding, we develop simple and robust protocols to generate a specified number of photon number wave packets on demand. We propose that the rich dynamics can be experimentally investigated by merely measuring the mean photon number.</p>

            <p>Magnons can serve as a bridge between spin, phonon, and photon systems, which renders them suitable for constructing hybrid systems. An important application of such hybrid systems is generating entanglement between different platforms. As magnons can support a broad variety of states, e.g., Fock states, squeezed states, or coherent states, and hybrid states can be produced with cavities or spins, there are many different kinds of entangled states in magnon systems. In this paper, we consider the entanglement of cat-state-like throughout states, which can be generated in magnon systems with parametric pumps beyond the parametric stable intensities. However, estimating the entanglement in such states is challenging due to their multiphoton and non-Gaussian properties. Here, we apply a modular variable-based projection, which maps the catlike states to spin states, preserving the encoded information. After the projection, Bell's inequality is employed to detect the entanglement in the effective spin states. Our numerical analysis provides the conditions for generating catlike entanglement in magnon systems and can be conveniently extended to other entangled states that may be formed by magnon and spin systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martin Jirlow, Kunal Helambe, Axel M. Eriksson, Simone Gasparinetti, Tahereh Abad</p>
            <p>Accurate modeling of driven light-matter interactions is essential for quantum technologies, where natural and synthetic atoms are used to store and process quantum information, mediate interactions between bosonic modes, and enable nonlinear operations. In systems subject to multi-tone drives, however, the theoretical description becomes challenging and existing models cannot quantitatively reproduce the experimental data. Here, we derive an effective Hamiltonian that retains slowly rotating terms, providing a general framework for accurately describing driven dynamics across platforms. As a concrete application, we validate the theory in circuit QED, where it quantitatively reproduces experimentally measured ac Stark shifts and captures key interactions such as two-mode squeezing and beam-splitting. Our results establish a broadly applicable tool to engineer driven interactions in quantum information processing platforms.</p>

            <p>We introduce and validate a machine-learning assisted quantum sensing protocol to classify spatial and temporal correlations of classical noise affecting two ultrastrongly coupled qubits. We consider six distinct classes of Markovian and non-Markovian noise. Leveraging the sensitivity of a coherent population transfer protocol under three distinct driving conditions, the various forms of noise are discriminated by only measuring the final transfer efficiencies. Our approach achieves $\gtrsim 86\%$ accuracy in classification providing a near-perfect discrimination between Markovian and non-Markovian noise. The method requires minimal experimental resources, relying on a simple driving scheme providing three inputs to a shallow neural network with no need of measuring time-series data or real-time monitoring. The machine-learning data analysis acquires information from non-idealities of the coherent protocol highlighting how combining these techniques may significantly improve the characterization of quantum-hardware.</p>

            <p>Highly coherent quantum emitters operating in the telecommunication C-band (1530 - 1565nm), where ultra-low-loss fibers and photonic circuits are available, are crucial to the development of scalable quantum technologies. In this work, we report on a modified Stranski-Krastanov growth scheme using chemical beam epitaxy to enable the generation of high-quality InAs/InP quantum dots, characterized by near-transform-limited linewidths ($\Gamma_{\mathrm{TL}}$). We demonstrate the growth of highly-symmetric quantum dots with aspect ratios >0.8 and densities ranging from 2 to 22$\,\mu$m$^{-2}$. Optical characterization of these sources reveal fine-structure splittings down to $25\pm4\,\mu$eV and a single-photon purity of $g^{(2)}(0) = 0.012\pm\mathrm{0.007}$, confirming the quality of these dots. Further, using an etalon to measure the linewidth, in combination with rigorous modelling, we find an upper-bound to the mean, low-power linewidths of only $12.1\pm 6.7\,\Gamma_\mathrm{TL}$ and, in the best case, $2.8\pm 1.8\,\Gamma_\mathrm{TL}$.

            <h2>Measuring topological invariants of even-dimensional line-gapped non-Hermitian systems through quench dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiao-Dong Lin, Long Zhang</p>
            <p>The accurate determination of non-Hermitian (NH) topological invariants plays a central role in the study of NH topological phases. In this work, we propose a general framework for directly measuring NH topological invariants in even-dimensional systems with real line gaps through quench dynamics. Our approach hinges on constructing an auxiliary Hermitian matrix topologically equivalent to the original NH Hamiltonian, enabling topological characterization via reduced-dimensional momentum subspaces called band-inversion surfaces (BISs). A key insight lies in the emergence of chiral symmetry in the NH Hamiltonian specifically on BISs -- a critical property that allows extension of the dynamical characterization scheme previously developed for odd-dimensional NH systems with chiral or sublattice symmetry [Lin et al., Phys. Rev. Res. 7, L012060 (2025)]. We show that NH topological invariants can be extracted from the winding patterns of a dynamical field constructed from post-quench spin textures on BISs. We demonstrate our approach through a detailed analysis of NH Chern insulators and then extend the framework to higher even-dimensional systems by introducing second-order BISs for characterization. The framework is also generalized to imaginary line-gapped topological phases. This work establishes an experimentally accessible protocol for detecting NH topological invariants in quantum platforms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruby Wei, Aqua Chung, Luke Coffman, Su-Kuan Chu, Xun Gao</p>
            <p>Quantum simulation of fermionic systems is a leading application of quantum computers. One promising approach is to represent fermions with qubits via fermion-to-qubit mappings. In this work, we present high-distance fermion-to-qubit stabilizer codes for simulating 2D and 3D fermionic systems. These codes achieve arbitrarily large code distances while keeping stabilizer weights constant. They also preserve locality by mapping local fermionic operators to local qubit operators at any fixed distance. Notably, our 3D construction is the first to simultaneously achieve high distance, constant stabilizer weights, and locality preservation. Our construction is based on concatenating a small-distance 2D or 3D fermion-to-qubit code with a high-distance fermionic color code. Together, these features provide a robust and scalable pathway to quantum simulation of fermionic systems.</p>

            <h2>Strategies to search for two-dimensional materials with long spin qubit coherence time</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michael Y. Toriyama, Jiawei Zhan, Shun Kanai, Giulia Galli</p>
            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) materials that can host qubits with long spin coherence time (T2) have the distinct advantage of integrating easily with existing microelectronic and photonic platforms, making them attractive for designing novel quantum devices with enhanced performance. However, the relative lack of 2D materials as spin qubit hosts, as well as appropriate substrates that can help maintain long T2, necessitates a strategy to search for candidates with robust spin coherence. Here, we develop a high-throughput computational workflow to predict the nuclear spin bath-driven qubit decoherence and T2 in 2D materials and heterostructures. We initially screen 1173 2D materials and find 190 monolayers with T2 > 1 ms, higher than that of naturally-abundant diamond. We then construct 1554 lattice-commensurate heterostructures between high-T2 2D materials and select 3D substrates, and we find that T2 is generally lower in a heterostructure than in the bare 2D host material; however, low-noise substrates (such as CeO2 and CaO) can help maintain high T2. To further accelerate the material screening effort, we derive analytical models that enable rapid predictions of T2 for 2D materials and heterotructures. The models offer a simple, yet quantitative, way to determine the relative contributions to decoherence from the nuclear spin baths of the 2D host and substrate in a heterostructural system. By developing a high-throughput workflow and analytical models, we expand the genome of 2D materials and their spin coherence times for the development of spin qubit platforms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Edric Matwiejew, Jonathan Wurtz, Jing Chen, Pascal Jahan Elahi, Tommaso Macri, Ugo Varetto</p>
            <p>A key use of near-term quantum computers is as analogue simulators, matching the action of some virtual or abstracted system onto a program executed on physical quantum hardware. This work explores continuous-time quantum walks (CTQW) on constrained graphs of independent set configurations and implements these abstract walks on analog-mode neutral-atom hardware. First, we explore variational state preparation protocols with limited controls through the lens of CTQW and optimal control to prepare nontrivial target states in non-separable Hilbert spaces. Next, we match these virtual walk dynamics to physical execution on analog-mode neutral atom hardware by leveraging the Rydberg blockade phenomenon. We analyze the convergence and scaling in the preparation of these known states as an indicator of the upper bounds on the quantum speedup mechanisms predicted by ideal CTQWs, showing that these signatures persist even when executed on noisy hardware. Finally, we introduce noise mitigation methods using Bayesian postprocessing. This paper demonstrates the ability to prepare nontrivial entangled states using quantum walks in constrained subspaces, and that nonequilibrium dynamics on constrained independent set supspaces is feasible on cloud-accessible analog-mode neutral-atom quantum computers.</p>

The resulting states are also useful for quantum secret sharing. The success of the scheme is heralded by the rate of photoemissions.

            <p>Quantum sensing near exceptional points (EPs) in non-Hermitian systems has shown promising sensitivity enhancements. However, practical applications are often hindered by structural complexity and strict parameter constraints. In this work, we introduce a simplified anti-parity-time (anti-PT) symmetric platform consisting of two independently cavities, which are indirectly coupled to each other by a shared dissipative environment. We demonstrate a significantly enhanced sensing response at the EPs compared to non-EP configurations. This improvement is attributed to the dominant second-order term in the Laurent series expansion of the eigenvalue response to external perturbations-a characteristic feature of higher-order singularities at EPs. This mechanism not only reinforces the foundation for sensitivity enhancement but also offers a structurally compact and robust strategy for quantum sensing. Our results underscore the potential of anti-PT symmetric systems in enabling high-precision sensing technologies and bridging non-Hermitian physics with scalable photonic device platforms.</p>

            <p>This study investigates nonclassical effects of photons in the anisotropic quantum Rabi-Stark model by using a quantum dressed master equation. We analyze second- and higher-order correlation functions, and demonstrate that the nonlinear Stark coupling significantly modulates photon statistics, inducing distinct and tunable photon antibunching and bunching effects. Successive transition signatures of correlation functions provide a potential experimental probe for predicting quantum phase transitions. We further reveal that Stark coupling provides direct control over photon squeezing, achieving significant enhancement and suppression. These findings not only uncover rich nonclassical phenomena in the anisotropic quantum Rabi-Stark model but also establish the nonlinear Stark coupling as a crucial new dimension for quantum detection. It may open a new avenue for precise manipulation of strongly coupled light-matter systems, with potential applications in quantum information processing and quantum-enhanced technologies.</p>

            <p>Diamond tin-vacancy (SnV) centers are promising candidates for building quantum network nodes. However, their native photon emission at 619 nm is incompatible with metropolitan-scale networks operating at low-loss telecom wavelengths. To address this, we demonstrate highly efficient, low-noise quantum frequency conversion (QFC) of 619 nm photons to the telecom S-band at 1480 nm. The conversion process combines 619 nm photons with 1064 nm pump light in an actively stabilized cavity containing a bulk monocrystalline potassium titanyl arsenate (KTA) crystal. We achieve an internal (external) conversion efficiency of (48 +/- 3)% ((28 +/- 2)%) and a noise photon rate per wavelength of 2.2 +/- 0.9 cts/s/pm, which is spectrally flat in the investigated frequency range of 40 GHz. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the efficiency remains above 80% of its maximum over a frequency range of 70 GHz. Finally, we generate a string of photons from a single waveguide-embedded SnV center using a train of excitation pulses and send these through the QFC. After the QFC, we observe a string of telecom photons displaying the SnV lifetime, confirming successful conversion. These results represent a critical step towards metropolitan-scale fiber-based quantum networks using SnV centers.</p>

Our results show that ICO can create entanglement between two distant cavity fields that never interact directly, and for the case of two cavity fields in the vacuum state, ICO presents an advantage over the fixed-order scenario by always generating large entanglement between the two cavity fields. Furthermore, we show that ICO can interchange one photon between both cavities with a total probability equal to one, without changing the quantum state of the atom, something that is impossible to achieve when two cQED systems are in well-defined order. Our results show the potential that ICO can offer in the paradigm of light-matter interaction for coherently controlling atom-field observables.</p>

We employ interferometers with the minimum number of modes, optimizing also over the protocol's success probability. The developed protocol is experimentally validated with a platform featuring a demultiplexed quantum dot source interfaced with a programmable eight-mode laser-written integrated photonic processor.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Keren Li</p>
            <p>Characterizing time-periodic Hamiltonians is pivotal for validating and controlling driven quantum platforms, yet prevailing and unadjusted reconstruction methods demand dense time-domain sampling and heavy post-processing. We introduce a scalable Floquet-informed learning algorithm that represents the Hamiltonian as a truncated Fourier series and recasts parameter estimation as a compact linear inverse problem in the Floquet band picture. The algorithm is well-suited to problems satisfying mild smoothness/band-limiting. In this regime, its sample and runtime complexities scale polynomially with the Fourier cutoff, time resolution, and the number of unknown coefficients. For local Hamiltonian models, the coefficients grows polynomially with system size, yielding at most polylogarithmic dependence on the Hilbert-space dimension. Furthermore, numerical experiments on one- and two-dimensional Ising and Heisenberg lattices show fast convergence to time resolution and robustness to higher-order perturbations. An adaptive rule learns the cutoff of Fourier series, removing the need to set known truncation \textit{a priori}. These features enable practical certification and benchmarking of periodically driven platforms with rapidly decaying higher-order content, and extend naturally to near-periodic drives.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tim Weaving, Angus Mingare, Alexis Ralli, Peter V. Coveney</p>
            <p>A recent direction in quantum computing for molecular electronic structure sees the use of quantum devices as configuration sampling machines integrated within high-performance computing (HPC) platforms. This appeals to the strengths of both the quantum and classical hardware; where state-sampling is classically hard, the quantum computer can provide computational advantage in the selection of high quality configuration subspaces, while the final molecular energies are evaluated by solving an interaction matrix on HPC and is therefore not corrupted by hardware noise. In this work, we present an algorithm that leverages stochastic Hamiltonian time evolution in Quantum-Selected Configuration Interaction (QSCI), with multireference perturbation theory capturing missed correlations outside the configuration subspace. The approach is validated through a hardware demonstration utilising 42 qubits of an IQM superconducting device to calculate the potential energy curve of the inorganic silane molecule, SiH4 using a 6-31G atomic orbital basis set, under a stretching of the Si-H bond length. In the regime of strong correlation we obtain energies comparable to Heatbath Configuration Interaction, but with a configuration space more than 200 times smaller, providing the first evidence that QSCI can produce more compact representations of the ground state wavefunction compared with conventional heuristics. This result is achieved with a configuration sampling scheme that predicts likely single and double excitations to generate connected configurations based on the orbital occupancies of a time-evolved quantum state.</p>

            <p>Quantum annealing offers a promising paradigm for solving NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems, but its practical application is severely hindered by two challenges: the complex, manual process of translating problem descriptions into the requisite Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) format and the scalability limitations of current quantum hardware. To address these obstacles, we propose a novel end-to-end framework, LLM-QUBO, that automates this entire formulation-to-solution pipeline. Our system leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to parse natural language, automatically generating a structured mathematical representation. To overcome hardware limitations, we integrate a hybrid quantum-classical Benders' decomposition method. This approach partitions the problem, compiling the combinatorial complex master problem into a compact QUBO format, while delegating linearly structured sub-problems to classical solvers. The correctness of the generated QUBO and the scalability of the hybrid approach are validated using classical solvers, establishing a robust performance baseline and demonstrating the framework's readiness for quantum hardware. Our primary contribution is a synergistic computing paradigm that bridges classical AI and quantum computing, addressing key challenges in the practical application of optimization problem. This automated workflow significantly reduces the barrier to entry, providing a viable pathway to transform quantum devices into accessible accelerators for large-scale, real-world optimization challenges.</p>

            <h2>Solving Optimal Power Flow using a Variational Quantum Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thinh Viet Le, Mark M. Wilde, Vassilis Kekatos</p>
            <p>The optimal power flow (OPF) is a large-scale optimization problem that is central in the operation of electric power systems. Although it can be posed as a nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic program, the complexity of modern-day power grids raises scalability and optimality challenges. In this context, this work proposes a variational quantum paradigm for solving the OPF. We encode primal variables through the state of a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC), and dual variables through the probability mass function associated with a second PQC. The Lagrangian function can thus be expressed as scaled expectations of quantum observables. An OPF solution can be found by minimizing/maximizing the Lagrangian over the parameters of the first/second PQC. We pursue saddle points of the Lagrangian in a hybrid fashion. Gradients of the Lagrangian are estimated using the two PQCs, while PQC parameters are updated classically using a primal-dual method. We propose permuting primal variables so that OPF observables are expressed in a banded form, allowing them to be measured efficiently. Numerical tests on the IEEE 57-node power system using Pennylane's simulator corroborate that the proposed doubly variational quantum framework can find high-quality OPF solutions. Although showcased for the OPF, this framework features a broader scope, including conic programs with numerous variables and constraints, problems defined over sparse graphs, and training quantum machine learning models to satisfy constraints.</p>

We show that the genuine multi-entropy can be expressed in terms of mutual information and logarithmic negativity. For general tripartite pure states, we demonstrate that dihedral invariants are directly related to Rényi reflected entropies. In particular, we show that the dihedral permutations of replicas are equivalent to the reflected construction, or alternatively to the realignment of density matrices.</p>

            <p>We consider the quantum integrable spin chain models associated with the Jimbo R-matrix based on the quantum affine algebra $D^{(2)}_{n+1}$, subject to quantum-group-invariant boundary conditions parameterized by two discrete variables $p=0,\dots, n$ and $\varepsilon = 0, 1$. We develop the analytical Bethe ansatz for the previously unexplored case $\varepsilon = 1$ with any $n$, and use it to investigate the effects of different boundary conditions on the finite-size spectrum of the quantum spin chain based on the rank-$2$ algebra $D^{(2)}_3$. Previous work on this model with periodic boundary conditions has shown that it is critical for the range of anisotropy parameters $0<\gamma<\pi/4$, where its scaling limit is described by a non-compact CFT with continuous degrees of freedom related to two copies of the 2D black hole sigma model. The scaling limit of the model with quantum-group-invariant boundary conditions depends on the parameter $\varepsilon$: similarly as in the rank-$1$ $D^{(2)}_2$ chain, we find that the symmetry of the lattice model is spontaneously broken, and the spectrum of conformal weights has both discrete and continuous components, for $\varepsilon=1$. For $p=1$, the latter coincides with that of the $D^{(2)}_2$ chain, which should correspond to a non-compact brane related to one black hole CFT in the presence of boundaries. For $\varepsilon=0$, the spectrum of conformal weights is purely discrete.</p>

            <h2>Observation of moiré trapped biexciton through sub-diffraction-limit probing using hetero-bilayer on nanopillar</h2>

            <p>The ability to tune the degree of interaction among particles at the nanoscale is highly intriguing. The spectroscopic signature of such interaction is often subtle and requires special probes to observe. To this end, inter-layer excitons trapped in the periodic potential wells of a moiré superlattice offer rich interaction physics, specifically due to the presence of both attractive and repulsive components in the interaction. Here we show that the Coulomb force between two inter-layer excitons switches from repulsive to attractive when the length scale reduces from inter-moiré-pocket to intra-moiré-pocket in a WS$_2$/WSe$_2$ hetero-bilayer - thanks to the complex competition between direct and exchange interaction. The finding is a departure from the usual notion of repelling inter-layer excitons due to layer polarization. This manifests as the simultaneous observation of an anomalous superlinear power-law of moiré exciton and a stabilization of moiré trapped biexciton. The experimental observation is facilitated by placing the hetero-bilayer on a polymer-nanopillar/gold-film stack which significantly reduces the inhomogeneous spectral broadening by selectively probing a smaller ensemble of moiré pockets compared with a flat sample. This creates an interesting platform to explore interaction among moiré trapped excitons and higher order quasiparticles.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zoia A. Mandrykina, Moritz Thierfeld, Natalia S. Oreshkina</p>
            <p>The hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) corrections to energy levels in muonic atoms are studied systematically across the periodic table. Two nuclear charge distribution models have been considered, with partly analytical solution for an homogeneously charged sphere model and direct numerical integration for a Fermi nuclear charge distribution. Our comparison reveals a good agreement between both approaches with differences typically below a few percent. The magnitude of HVP corrections increases with nuclear charge, displaying irregularities that correlate directly with the non-monotonic behavior of nuclear radii. Despite strong relativistic effects at high $Z$, the ratio of hadronic to muonic vacuum polarization remains remarkably stable, deviating by less than $10\%$ from the established $67\%$ non-relativistic benchmark value</p>

            <h2>Reduced fidelities for free fermions out of equilibrium: From dynamical quantum phase transitions to Mpemba effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gilles Parez, Vincenzo Alba</p>
            <p>We investigate the out-of-equilibrium dynamics after a quantum quench of the reduced fidelities between the states of a subregion $A$ at different times. Precisely, we consider the fidelity between the time-dependent state of $A$ and its initial value, as well as with the state at infinite time. We denote these fidelities as the reduced Loschmidt echo (RLE) and the final-state fidelity (FSF), respectively. If region $A$ is the full systems, the RLE coincide with the standard Loschmidt echo. We focus on quenches from Gaussian states in several instances of the XY spin chain. In the hydrodynamic limit of long times and large sizes of $A$, with their ratio fixed, the reduced fidelities admit a quasiparticle picture interpretation. Interestingly, for some quenches in the hydrodynamic regime the RLE features a complicated structure with an infinite sequence of nested lightcones, corresponding to quasiparticles with arbitrary large group velocities. This leads to a ''staircase'' of cusp-like singularities in the time-derivative of the fidelity. At the sub-hydrodynamic regime for some quenches the RLE exhibits cusp-like singularities, similar to the so-called dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPT). We conjecture a criterion for the occurrence of the DQPT and for the ''critical'' times at which the singularities occur. Finally, we discuss the hydrodynamic limit of the FSF. In particular, we show that it provides a valuable tool to detect the so-called quantum Mpemba effect.</p>

            <h2>Can We Conjugate the Orbital Angular Momentum of a Single Photon with Nonlinear Optics? A Theoretical Analysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tobey Luck, Aarón Aguilar-Cardoso, Cheng Li, Manuel Ferrer-Garcia, Jeremy Upham, Jeff Lundeen, Robert Boyd</p>
            <p>Stimulated parametric down-conversion (StimPDC) produces an idler beam that exhibits a phase conjugate of the spatial structure of the classical seed beam. Extending this effect to the single-photon regime can, in principle, enable the control of the orbital angular momentum of single photons. However, its experimental implementation remains challenging due to the lower photon flux of realistic single-photon sources compared to a classical pump beam, which causes the StimPDC process to occur less frequently compared to its spontaneous counterpart. To overcome this, we propose a cascaded parametric down-conversion scheme, in which the signal photon from a spontaneously down-converted pair seeds the StimPDC process, while the idler photon heralds the seed's presence. This configuration uses coincidence detection to effectively post-select for stimulated events among the background of spontaneous contributions. We show that phase conjugation at the single-photon level manifests as a bias towards equal orbital angular momentum between the heralding idler and the stimulated idler. Our results offer a practical route to manipulate single-photon correlations in the orbital angular momentum degree of freedom and could have implications for applications such as free-space quantum communication and quantum-enhanced sensing.</p>

            <p>Rydberg-atom electrometry, as an emerging cutting-edge technology, features high sensitivity, broad bandwidth, calibration-free operation, and beyond. However, until now the key atomic vapor cells used for confining electric field-sensitive Rydberg atoms nearly made with traditional glass-blown techniques, hindering the miniaturization, integration, and batch manufacturing. Here, we present the wafer-level MEMS atomic vapor cells with glass-silicon-glass sandwiched structure that are batch-manufactured for both frequency stability and electric field measurement. We use specially customized ultra-thick silicon wafers with a resistivity exceeding 10,000 cm, three orders of magnitude higher than that of typical silicon, and a thickness of 6 mm, providing a 4-fold improvement in optical interrogation length. With the as-developed MEMS atomic vapor cell, we configured a high-sensitivity Rydberg-atom electrometry with the minimal detectable microwave field to be 2.8 mV/cm. This combination of miniaturization and sensitivity represents a significant advance in the state-of-the-art field of Rydberg-atom electrometry, paving the way for chip-scale Rydberg-atom electrometry and potentially opening up new applications in a wider variety of fields.</p>

            <h2>Thermality and athermality in the Unruh effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> D. Jaffino Stargen, Vivishek Sudhir</p>
            <p>In idealized treatments of the Unruh effect, a two-level atom is accelerated in a prescribed classical trajectory through the vacuum of a quantum field -- the Unruh bath -- which causes the atom's internal state to thermalize to a temperature proportional to the acceleration. This happens via emission and absorption of quanta by the atom, leading to a detailed balance between fluctuations in the Unruh bath and associated dissipation of the atom's internal energy. In any physical manifestation of the Unruh effect, the center-of-mass (CoM) degree of freedom of the atom is dynamical, and is therefore coupled to the Unruh bath via momentum recoil during the absorption/emission process. We study this scenario and show how the fluctuation-dissipation theorem fails for the CoM degree of freedom, while still being upheld for the internal energy. That is, the CoM of an accelerated atom is not in thermal equilibrium with the Unruh bath, while its internal level can be.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiyan Wang, Zhe Wang, Yi-Ming Ding, Zenan Liu, Zheng Yan, Long Zhang</p>
            <p>We investigate the second order Rényi entanglement entropy at the quantum critical point of spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on a columnar dimerized square lattice. The universal constant $\gamma$ in the area-law scaling $S_{2}(\ell) = \alpha\ell - \gamma$ is found to be sensitive to the entangling surface configurations, with $\gamma_{\text{sp}} > 0$ for strong-bond-cut (special) surfaces and $\gamma_{\text{ord}} < 0$ for weak-bond-cut (ordinary) surfaces, which is attributed to the distinct conformal boundary conditions. Introducing boundary dimerization drives a renormalization group (RG) flow from the special to the ordinary boundary criticality, and the constant $\gamma$ decreases monotonically with increasing dimerization strength, demonstrating irreversible evolution under the boundary RG flow. These results provide strong numerical evidence for a higher-dimensional analog of the $g$-theorem, and suggest $\gamma$ as a characteristic function for boundary RG flow in (2+1)-dimensional conformal field theory.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniele Toniolo, Sougato Bose</p>
            <p>We prove that the dynamics of the one-dimensional $ XY $ model with random magnetic field perturbed by a sparse set of $ ZZ $ terms with a large coupling constant $ \Delta $ gives rise to Lieb-Robinson (L-R) bounds with a logarithmic lightcone and amplitude proportional to $ \Delta^{-1} $. These spin systems are equivalent to a set of spinless lattice fermions subjected to a random on site potential and sparse density-density interactions. In the absence of the random magnetic field we also obtain a suppression of the L-R bounds as $ \Delta^{-1} $. These results follow from the application of a general theorem about the L-R bound of a generic local time-dependent one-dimensional spin system with local time-dependent perturbations. Adopting the interaction picture of the dynamics, the large and sparse $ ZZ $ perturbations of the $ XY $ model, with or without disorder, are mapped into high-frequency periodic perturbations. All our results are non-perturbative.</p>

            <p>Digital quantum simulation (DQS) is one of the most promising paths for achieving first useful real-world applications for quantum processors. Yet even assuming rapid progress in device engineering and development of fault-tolerant quantum processors, algorithmic resource optimisation will long remain crucial to exploit their full power. Currently, Trotterisation provides state-of-the-art resource scaling. And recent theoretical studies of Trotterised Ising models suggest that even better performance than expected may be possible up to a distinct breakdown threshold in empirical performance. Here, we study multiple paradigmatic DQS models with experimentally realisable Trotterisations, and evidence the universality of a range of Trotterisation performance behaviours, including not only the threshold, but also new features in the pre-threshold regime that is most important for practical applications. In each model, we observe a distinct Trotterisation threshold shared across widely varying performance signatures; we further show that an onset of quantum chaotic dynamics causes the performance breakdown and is directly induced by digitisation errors. In the important pre-threshold regime, we are able to identify new distinct regimes displaying qualitatively different quasiperiodic performance behaviours, and show analytic behaviour for properly defined operational Trotter errors. Our results rely crucially on diverse new analytical tools, and provide a previously missing unified picture of Trotterisation behaviour across local observables, the global quantum state, and the full Trotterised unitary. This work provides new insights and tools for addressing important questions about the algorithm performance and underlying theoretical principles of sufficiently complex Trotterisation-based DQS, that will help in extracting maximum simulation power from future quantum processors.</p>

            <p>Quantum reservoir computing has emerged as a promising paradigm within the field of quantum machine learning, harnessing the inherent properties of quantum systems to optimise and enhance information processing capabilities. Here, we explore the potential of quantum-inspired machine learning methodologies by leveraging the complex dynamics of quantum reservoirs to address computationally challenging tasks with enhanced efficiency and accuracy. To this end, we employ an open quantum system model comprising two-level atomic ensembles coupled to Lorentzian photonic cavities to construct a quantum physical reservoir computer layer for a recurrent neural network. We evaluate the effectiveness of this approach by applying it to a standard machine learning image-recognition problem and benchmarking its performance against a conventional neural network of similar architecture, but lacking the quantum physical reservoir computer layer. Remarkably, as the dataset size increases, the quantum physical reservoir computer outperforms the conventional neural network, requiring fewer training epochs and a smaller dataset to achieve comparable accuracy. Furthermore, we employ the quantum physical reservoir computing approach to model the dynamics of open quantum systems, focusing on atomic system ensembles interacting with a structured photonic reservoir associated with a photonic band-gap material. Our results reveal that the quantum reservoir computer provides equally powerful representations for quantum dynamical problems, maintaining effectiveness even under constraints of limited training data.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emily A Van Milligen, Eliana Jacobson, Ashlesha Patil, Gayane Vardoyan, Don Towsley, Saikat Guha</p>
            <p>Quantum networks will be able to service consumers with long-distance entanglement by use of quantum repeaters that generate Bell pairs (or links) with their neighbors, iid with probability $p$ and perform Bell State Measurements (BSMs) on the links that succeed iid with probability $q$. While global link state knowledge is required to maximize the rate of entanglement generation between any two consumers, it increases the protocol latency due to the classical communication requirements and requires long quantum memory coherence times. We propose two entanglement routing protocols that require only local link state knowledge to relax the quantum memory coherence time requirements and reduce the protocol latency. These protocols utilize multi-path routing protocol and time multiplexed repeaters. The time multiplexed repeaters first generate links for $k$-time steps before performing BSMs on any pairs of links. Our two protocols differ in the decision rule used for performing BSMs at the repeater: the first being a static path based routing protocol and second a dynamic distance based routing protocol. The performance of these protocols depends on the quantum network topology and the consumers' location. We observe that the average entanglement rate and the latency increase with the time multiplexing block length, $k$, irrespective of the protocol. When a step function memory decoherence model is introduced such that qubits are held in the quantum memory for an exponentially distributed time with mean $\mu$, an optimal $k$ ($k_\text{opt}$) value appears, such that for increasing $k$ beyond $k_{\rm opt}$ hurts the entanglement rate. $k_{\rm opt}$ decreases with $p$ and increases with $\mu$. $k_{\rm opt}$ appears due to the tradeoff between benefits from time multiplexing and the increased likelihood of previously established Bell pairs decohering due to finite memory coherence times.</p>

            <p>We introduce an explicit construction for a key distribution protocol in the Quantum Computational Timelock (QCT) security model, where one assumes that computationally secure encryption may only be broken after a time much longer than the coherence time of available quantum memories. Taking advantage of the QCT assumptions, we build a key distribution protocol called HM-QCT from the Hidden Matching problem for which there exists an exponential gap in one-way communication complexity between classical and quantum strategies. We establish that the security of HM-QCT against arbitrary i.i.d. attacks can be reduced to the difficulty of solving the underlying Hidden Matching problem with classical information. Legitimate users, on the other hand, can use quantum communication, which gives them the possibility of sending multiple copies of the same quantum state while retaining an information advantage. This leads to an everlasting secure key distribution scheme over $n$ bosonic modes. Such a level of security is unattainable with purely classical techniques. Remarkably, the scheme remains secure with up to $\mathcal{O}\big( \frac{\sqrt{n}}{\log(n)}\big)$ input photons for each channel use, extending the functionalities and potentially outperforming QKD rates by several orders of magnitudes.</p>

            <p>Subwavelength atomic arrays feature strong light-induced dipole-dipole interactions, resulting in subradiant collective resonances characterized by narrowed linewidths. In this work, we present a sideband cooling scheme for atoms trapped in subwavelength arrays that utilizes these narrow collective resonances. Working in the Lamb-Dicke regime, we derive an effective master equation for the atomic motion by adiabatically eliminating the internal degrees of freedom of the atoms, and validate its prediction with numerical simulations of the full system. Our results demonstrate that subradiant resonances enable the cooling of ensembles of atoms to temperatures lower than those achievable without dipole interactions, provided the atoms have different trap frequencies. Remarkably, narrow collective resonances can be sideband-resolved even when the individual atomic transition is not. In such scenarios, ground-state cooling becomes feasible solely due to light-induced dipole-dipole interactions. This approach could be utilized for future quantum technologies based on dense ensembles of emitters, and paves the way towards harnessing many-body cooperative decay for enhanced motional control.</p>

            <p>Bosonic codes encode quantum information into a single infinite-dimensional physical system endowed with error correction capabilities. This reduces the need for complex management of many physical constituents compared with standard approaches employing multiple physical qubits. Recent discussions of bosonic codes centre around correcting only boson-loss errors, with phase errors either actively suppressed or deferred to subsequent layers of encoding with standard qubit codes. Rotationally symmetric bosonic (RSB) codes, which include the well-known cat and binomial codes, are capable of simultaneous correction of loss and phase errors, offering an alternate route that deals with arbitrary errors already at the base layer. Here, we investigate the robustness of such codes, moving away from the more idealistic past studies towards a circuit-level noise analysis closer to the practical situation where every physical component in the device is potentially faulty. We extend the concept of fault tolerance to the case of RSB codes, and then examine the performance of two known error correction circuits under circuit-level noise. Our analysis reveals a significantly more stringent noise threshold for fault-tolerant operation than found in past works; nevertheless, we show how, through waiting-time optimization and the use of squeezing, we can restore the noise requirements to a regime achievable with near-term quantum hardware. While our focus here is on cat codes for concreteness, a similar analysis applies for general RSB codes.</p>

            <p>Starting from a coarse-grained map of a quantum many-body system, we construct the inverse map that assigns a microscopic state to a coarse-grained state based on the maximum entropy principle. Assuming unitary evolution in the microscopic system, we examine the resulting dynamics in the coarse-grained system using the assignment map. We investigate both a two-qubit system, with \swap\ and controlled-\textsc{not}\ gates, and $n$-qubit systems, configured either in an Ising spin chain or with all-to-all interactions. We demonstrate that these dynamics exhibit atypical quantum behavior, such as nonlinearity and non-Markovianity. Furthermore, we find that these dynamics depend on the initial coarse-grained state and establish conditions for general microscopic dynamics under which linearity is preserved. As the effective dynamics induced by our coarse-grained description of many-body quantum systems diverge from conventional quantum behavior, we anticipate that this approach could aid in describing the quantum-to-classical transition and provide deeper insights into the effects of coarse graining on quantum systems.</p>

            <p>The performance of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is promising compared to other quantum algorithms, but also depends significantly on the appropriate design of the underlying quantum circuit. Recent research by Bowles, Ahmend \& Schuld, 2024 [1] raises questions about the effectiveness of entanglement in circuits for quantum machine learning algorithms. In our paper we want to address questions about the effectiveness of state preparation via Hadamard gates and entanglement via CNOT gates in the realm of quantum optimisation. We have constructed a total of eight different circuits, varying in implementation details, solving a total of 100 randomly generated MaxCut problems. Our results show no improvement with Hadamard gates applied at the beginning of the circuits. Furthermore, also entanglement shows no positive effect on the solution quality in our small scale experiments. In contrast, the investigated circuits that used entanglement generally showed lower, as well as deteriorating results when the number of circuit layers is increased. Based on our results, we hypothesise that entanglement can play a coordinating role, such that changes in individual parameters are distributed across multiple qubits in quantum circuits, but that this positive effect can quickly be overdosed and turned negative. The verification of this hypothesis represents a challenge for future research and can have a considerable influence on the development of new hybrid algorithms.</p>

            <p>Quantum computers can efficiently simulate highly entangled quantum systems, offering a solution to challenges facing classical simulation of Quantum Field Theories (QFTs). This paper presents an alternative to traditional methods for simulating the real-time evolution in QFTs by leveraging Hamiltonian Truncation (HT). As a use case, we study the Schwinger model, systematically reducing the complexity of the Hamiltonian via HT while preserving essential physical properties. For the observables studied in this paper, the HT approach converges quickly with the number of qubits, allowing for the interesting physics processes to be captured without needing many qubits. Identifying the truncated free Hamiltonian's eigenbasis with the quantum device's computational basis avoids the need for complicated and costly state preparation routines, reducing the algorithm's overall circuit depth and required coherence time. As a result, the HT approach to simulating QFTs on a quantum device is well suited to Noisy-Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, which have a limited number of qubits and short coherence times. We validate our approach by running simulations on a NISQ device, showcasing strong agreement with theoretical predictions. We highlight the potential of HT for simulating QFTs on quantum hardware.</p>

            <p>Distributed quantum computing (DQC) has emerged as a promising approach to overcome the scalability limitations of monolithic quantum processors in terms of computational capability. However, realising the full potential of DQC requires effective resource management and circuit scheduling. This involves efficiently assigning each circuit to a subset of quantum processing units (QPUs), based on factors such as their computational power and connectivity. In heterogeneous DQC networks with arbitrary connectivity topologies and non-identical QPUs, this becomes a complex challenge. This paper addresses resource management and circuit scheduling in such settings, with a focus on computing resource allocation in a quantum data center. We propose circuit scheduling algorithms based on Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP). Our MILP model accounts for errors arising from inter-QPU communication. In particular, the proposed schemes consider key factors, including network topology, QPU capacities, and quantum circuit structure, to make efficient scheduling and allocation decisions. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithms significantly improve circuit execution time and scheduling efficiency (measured by makespan and throughput), while also reducing inter-QPU communication overhead, compared to a baseline random allocation strategy. This work provides valuable insights into resource management strategies for scalable and heterogeneous DQC systems.</p>

            <p>In June 1925 Heisenberg arrived at Helgoland/Heligoland island to escape a fit of hay fever. He returned with a sketch of a strange theory of the micro-world, which we now call quantum mechanics. This essay attempts to present a look at this theory, which tries to return to the original insight of Heisenberg on what should be the essence of a theory of atomic realm: it must be a theory of the observable events, in which fundamentally unobservable quantities have no place. No ontological status is given to elements of the mathematical formulation of the theory. The theory is about our description of events in laboratories, probabilities of which are given by the Born rule. Following Bohr, these events involve macroscopic measuring apparatuses, and the accessible final events are classically describable. Information about the events is cloneable, as it is of a classical nature. The modern quantum theory of classicality is the decoherence theory. It treats "the pointer variable" of measuring apparatus as an open system interacting with an environment consisting of all other "zillions" of degrees of freedom of the device, and anything coupled to it. Because such environment is uncontrollable we have no possibility to reverse measurements. The quantum mechanical measurement theory based on decoherence theory is reproducing the predictions of Born rule. Notwithstanding, possibility of reversing measurements and of application of Born rule in situations other than these which lead to macroscopically observable events are features of a modification of quantum mechanics which is called by its adherents "unitary quantum mechanics". As its predictions, which go beyond quantum mechanics, are not testable - we claim that unitary quantum mechanics in an interpretation of quantum mechanics. As such it is metaphysics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shuheng Liu, Jiajie Guo, Qiongyi He, Matteo Fadel</p>
            <p>While commonly used entanglement criteria for continuous variable systems are based on quadrature measurements, here we study entanglement detection from measurements of the Wigner function. These are routinely performed in platforms such as trapped ions and circuit QED, where homodyne measurements are difficult to be implemented. We provide complementary criteria which we show to be tight for a variety of experimentally relevant Gaussian and non-Gaussian states. Our results show novel approaches to detect entanglement in continuous variable systems and shed light on interesting connections between known criteria and the Wigner function.</p>

            <h2>Resolvent-based quantum phase estimation: Towards estimation of parametrized eigenvalues</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhijeet Alase, Salini Karuvade</p>
            <p>Quantum algorithms for estimating the eigenvalues of matrices, including the phase estimation algorithm, serve as core subroutines in a wide range of quantum algorithms, including those in quantum chemistry and quantum machine learning. The standard quantum eigenvalue (phase) estimation algorithm accepts a Hermitian (unitary) matrix and a state in an unknown superposition of its eigenstates as input, and coherently records the estimates for real eigenvalues (eigenphases) in an ancillary register. Extension of quantum eigenvalue and phase estimation algorithms to the case of non-normal input matrices is obstructed by several factors such as non-orthogonality of eigenvectors, existence of generalized eigenvectors and the fact that eigenvalues may lie anywhere on the complex plane. In this work, we propose a novel approach for estimating the eigenvalues of non-normal matrices based on preparation of a state that we call the "resolvent state". We construct the first efficient algorithm for estimating the phases of the unimodular eigenvalues of a given non-unitary matrix. We then construct an efficient algorithm for estimating the real eigenvalues of a given non-Hermitian matrix, achieving complexities that match the best known results while operating under significantly relaxed assumptions on the non-real part of the spectrum. The resolvent-based approach that we introduce also extends to estimating eigenvalues that lie on a parametrized complex curve, subject to explicitly stated conditions, thereby paving the way for a new paradigm of parametric eigenvalue estimation.</p>

            <h2>Systematic construction of stabilizer codes via gauging abelian boundary symmetries</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bram Vancraeynest-De Cuiper, José Garre-Rubio</p>
            <p>We propose a systematic framework to construct a (d+1)-dimensional stabilizer model from an initial generic d-dimensional abelian symmetry. Our approach builds upon the iterative gauging procedure, developed by one of the authors in [J. Garre-Rubio, Nature Commun. 15, 7986 (2024)], in which an initial symmetric state is repeatedly gauged to obtain an emergent model in one dimension higher that supports the initial symmetry at its boundary. This method not only enables the construction of emergent states and corresponding commuting stabilizer Hamiltonians of which they are ground states, but it also provides a way to construct gapped boundary conditions for these models that amount to spontaneously breaking part of the boundary symmetry. In a detailed introductory example, we showcase our paradigm by constructing three-dimensional Clifford-deformed surface codes from iteratively gauging a global 0-form symmetry that lives in two dimensions. We then provide a proof of our main result, hereby drawing upon a slight extension of the gauging procedure of Williamson. We additionally provide two more examples in d=2 in which different type-I fracton orders emerge from gauging initial linear subsystem and Sierpinski fractal symmetries. En passant, we provide explicit tensor network representations of all of the involved gauging maps and the emergent states.</p>

            <h2>A new general quantum state verification protocol by the classical shadow method</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaodi Li</p>
            <p>Verifying whether a quantum device produces a specific state is a fundamental task in many applications of modern quantum technologies. In the conventional framework of quantum state verification, designing an optimal or efficient protocol for each type of state often requires intricate customization. Recently, Hsin-Yuan Huang et al. introduced a novel approach called the shadow overlap protocol in arXiv:2404.07281v1, which leverages classical shadows to efficiently verify multiple types of states simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a new verification protocol that integrates key ideas from both the conventional framework and the shadow overlap protocol. To achieve this, we first reformulate the shadow overlap protocol using the language of hypothesis testing, which also underpins the conventional framework, and then analyze the similarities and differences between them. Our approach enhances the capabilities of the shadow overlap protocol while addressing some of its limitations, leading to improved sample complexity and a more natural treatment of states with specific structures. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our protocol by applying it to GHZ states and stabilizer states.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peter O'Donovan, Philipp Strasberg, Kavan Modi, John Goold, Mark T. Mitchison</p>
            <p>We use the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis to derive a quantum master equation for a system weakly coupled to a chaotic finite-sized bath prepared in a pure state. We show that the emergence of Markovianity is controlled by the spectral function of the ETH and that local detailed balance emerges in the Markovian regime for a broad class of pure bath states. We numerically verify this result by comparing the master equation to dynamics computed using exact diagonalization of a chaotic Hamiltonian. We also compare the master equation to exact dynamics for an integrable bath and find that at finite size they strongly disagree. Our work puts forward eigenstate thermalization as a foundation for open quantum systems theory, thus extending it beyond ensemble bath preparations to chaotic many-body environments in generic pure states.</p>

            <h2>Quantum-Optimal Frequency Estimation of Stochastic AC Fields</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anirban Dey, Sara Mouradian, Cosmo Lupo, Zixin Huang</p>
            <p>Resolving frequencies in a time-dependent field is classically limited by the measurement bandwidth. Using tools from quantum metrology and quantum control may overcome this limit, yet the full advantage afforded by entanglement so far remains elusive. Here we map the problem of frequency measurement to that of estimating a global dephasing quantum channel. In this way, we determine the ultimate quantum limits of {frequency estimation in stochastic AC} sensing. We find exact {quantum Fisher information bounds} for estimating frequency and frequency differences of stochastic fields. In particular, given two close signals with frequency separation $\omega_r$, we find that the quantum Fisher information (QFI) for the separation estimation is approximately $2/\omega_r^2$, {i.e.}~\emph{inversely} proportional to the separation parameter. The bounds are achievable in certain regimes by superpositions of Dicke states. GHZ states are suboptimal but improve precision over unentangled states, achieving Heisenberg scaling in the low-bandwidth limit. This work establishes a robust framework for stochastic AC signal sensing that can be extended to arbitrary time-dependent and stochastic fields.</p>

            <p>In this work, we adopt the Gradient Projection Method (GPM) to problems of quantum control. For general $N$-level closed and open quantum systems, we derive the corresponding adjoint systems and gradients of the objective functionals, and provide the projection versions of the Pontryagin maximum principle and the GPM, all directly in terms of quantum objects such as evolution operator, Hamiltonians, density matrices, etc. Various forms of the GPM, including one- and two-step, are provided and compared. We formulate the GPM both for closed and open quantum systems, latter for the general case with simultaneous coherent and incoherent controls. The GPM is designed to perform local gradient based optimization in the case when bounds are imposed on the controls. The main advantage of the method is that it allows to exactly satisfy the bounds, in difference to other approaches such as adding constraints as weight to objective. We apply the GPM to several examples including generation of one- and two-qubit gates and two-qubit Bell and Werner states for models of superconducting qubits under the constraint when controls are zero at the initial and final times, and steering an open quantum system state to a target density matrix for simulating action of the Werner-Holevo channel, etc.</p>

            <h2>Subsystem Thermalization Hypothesis in Quantum Spin Chains with Conserved Charges</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Feng-Li Lin, Jhh-Jing Hong, Ching-Yu Huang</p>
            <p>We consider the thermalization hypothesis of pure states in quantum Ising chain with $Z_2$ symmetry, XXZ chain with $U(1)$ symmetry, and XXX chain with $SU(2)$ symmetries. Two kinds of pure states are considered: the energy eigenstates and the typical states evolved unitarily from the random product states for a long enough period. We further group the typical states by their expectation values of the conserved charges and consider the fine-grained thermalization hypothesis. We compare the locally (subsystem) reduced states of typical states/eigenstates with the ones of the corresponding thermal ensemble states. Besides the usual thermal ensembles such as the (micro-)canonical ensemble without conserved charges and the generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE) with all conserved charges included, we also consider the so-called partial-GGEs (p-GGEs), which include only part of the conserved charges in the thermal ensemble. Moreover, in the framework of p-GGE, the Hamiltonian and other conserved charges are on an equal footing. The introduction of p-GGEs extends quantum thermalization to a more general scope. The validity of the subsystem thermalization hypothesis can be quantified by the smallness of the relative entropy of the reduced states obtained from the GGE/p-GGE and the typical states/eigenstates. We examine the validity of the thermalization hypothesis by numerically studying the relative entropy demographics. We show that the thermalization hypothesis holds generically for the small enough subsystems for various p-GGEs. Thus, our framework extends the universality of quantum thermalization.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yunkai Wang, Yujie Zhang, Virginia O. Lorenz</p>
            <p>Previous work showed that thermal light with a blackbody spectrum cannot be decomposed into a mixture of independent localized pulses. However, we find that in the weak-source limit and under the assumption of a flat spectrum, the first non-vacuum term in the state expansion does form a mixture of such pulses. This decomposition is essential for quantum-enhanced astronomical interferometry, which typically operates on localized pulses even though stellar light is inherently continuous-wave. We present a quantum derivation of the van Cittert-Zernike theorem that incorporates finite bandwidth, thereby justifying the operations on localized pulses while processing continuous-wave thermal light. For general spectra in the weak-source limit, we establish a criterion under which correlations between pulses can be safely neglected. When this criterion is not met, we provide a corrected strategy that accurately accounts for both the spectral profile and the detector-defined pulse shape.</p>

            <p>We revisit the Extended Uncertainty Principle (EUP) from an operational viewpoint, replacing wavefunction-based widths with apparatus-defined position constraints such as a finite slit of width $\Delta x$ or a geodesic ball of radius $R$. Using Hermitian momentum operators consistent with the EUP algebra, we prove a sharp lower bound on the product of momentum spread and preparation size in one dimension and show that it reduces smoothly to the standard quantum limit as the deformation vanishes. We then extend the construction to the dimensions two and three on spaces of constant curvature and obtain the corresponding bound for spherical confinement, clarifying its geometric meaning via an isometry to $S^2$ and $S^3$. The framework links curvature-scale effects to operational momentum floors and suggests concrete tests in diffraction, cold-atom, and optomechanical settings.</p>

            <p>One of the most ambitious goals of quantum simulation of quantum field theory is the description of scattering in real time, which would allow not only for computation of scattering amplitudes, but also for studying the collision process step by step. The initial state of such simulation is made of typically two wave packets of stable particles moving on top of the vacuum, whose preparation is difficult. Here we extend a previous work to create wave packets of a general kind of particle from the vacuum in lattice gauge theories in various dimensions, including three-dimensional QCD for the first time. The conceptual foundation of this approach is the Haag-Ruelle scattering theory, and the only theoretical limitation is given by the presence of massless particles. In the context of digital quantum computation, the wave packet creation from the vacuum is implemented with the technique known as LCU (linear combination of unitaries). The preparation is performed successfully upon measuring an ancillary register with a certain probability, which vanishes polynomially in the lattice spacing, the wave-packet energy and the momentum narrowness.</p>

            <p>We reveal a feature of quantum scarring in systems with many particles: Quantum scars, living densely near an unstable periodic orbit, must be compensated by corresponding anti-scarred states suppressed there to establish the uniformity of the whole. The uniformity of the underlying phase space is linked to early-time dynamics -- a regime beyond the predictions of random matrix theory and encapsulated in the eigenstate stacking theorem. By extending the domain of the stacking theorem, we apply our theory to a chaotic spinor Bose-Einstein condensate, whose quantum scar dynamics have recently been observed in the laboratory. Our work uncovers how scarring of some eigenstates affects the rest of the chaotic and thermal spectrum in quantum systems with many particles.</p>

            <p>There has been tremendous progress in the physical realization of quantum computing hardware in recent times, bringing us closer than ever before to realizing the promise of quantum computing. However, noise continues to pose a crucial challenge when it comes to scaling up present day quantum processors. While decoherence limits the qubits ability to store information for long periods in the presence of uncontrollable noise sources, the erroneous implementation of control methods for state preparation and measurements leads to faulty implementations of quantum circuits. Conventional noise spectroscopy protocols can characterize and model environmental noise but are usually resource intensive and lengthy. Moreover, the underlying noise can vary in nature over time, making noise profile extraction futile as this new information cannot be harnessed to improve quantum error correction or dynamical decoupling protocols. In this work, we address this challenge using a machine learning-based methodology to quickly extract noise spectra of multiple qubits and demonstrate a possible noise mitigation strategy. The procedure involves implementing undemanding dynamical decoupling sequences to record coherence decays of the investigated qubits and then predict the underlying noise spectra with the help of a convolution neural network pre-trained on a synthetic dataset. While our protocol is virtually hardware-agnostic, we validate its effectiveness using superconducting qubits available on the IBM Quantum platform. We further use these rapidly obtained, yet accurate, noise spectra to design bespoke dynamic decoupling sequences and perform time-dependent noise spectroscopy.</p>

Focusing on ($1+1$)-dimensional $\varphi^4$ scalar field theory, the approach employs the Hamiltonian formalism to map the theory onto a spatial lattice, with fields represented as quantum harmonic oscillators. Using measurement-based quantum computing, we implement non-Gaussian operations for CQVC platforms. The study introduces methods for preparing initial states with specific momenta and simulating their evolution under the $\varphi^4$ Hamiltonian. Key quantum objects, such as two-point correlation functions, validate the framework against analytical solutions. Scattering simulations further illustrate how mass and coupling strength influence field dynamics and energy redistribution. Thus, we demonstrate CVQC's scalability for larger lattice systems and its potential for simulating more complex field theories.</p>

            <p>Coupling excitons with quantized radiation has been shown to enable coherent ballistic transport at room temperature inside optical cavities. Previous theoretical works employ a simple description of the material, depicting it as a one-dimensional single layer placed in the middle of an optical cavity, thereby ignoring the spatial variation of the radiation field. In contrast, in most experiments, the optical cavity is filled with organic molecules or multiple layers of two-dimensional materials. Here, we develop an efficient mixed-quantum-classical approach, introducing a bright layer description, to simulate the exciton-polariton quantum dynamics in three dimensions. Our simulations reveal that, for the same Rabi splitting, a multilayered material extends the quantum coherence lifetime and enhances transport compared to a single-layer material. We find that this enhanced coherence can be traced to a synchronization of phonon fluctuations over multiple layers, wherein the collective light-matter coupling in a multilayered material effectively suppresses the phonon-induced dynamical disorder.</p>

            <p>Nonreciprocal entanglement, characterized by inherently robust operation, is a cornerstone for quantum information processing and communications. However, it remains a great challenge to achieve nonreciprocal entanglement characterized by stability and robustness against environmental fluctuations. Here, we propose a universal nonlinear mechanism to engineer magnetic-free nonreciprocity in dissipative optomechanics by utilizing bistability, a phenomenon ubiquitous across nonlinear physical systems. By dynamically encircling the nexus of bistability, a cusp converged by the bistable surfaces, we obtain nonreciprocal displacement and then utilize it to achieve robust nonreciprocal entanglement. Owing to the unique landscape of bistability, our nonreciprocal displacement and entanglements exhibit stability and robustness through closed-loop operations. Our work presents a foundational framework for leveraging nonlinearity to achieve nonreciprocal quantum information processing. It paves new avenues for exploring nonreciprocal quantum information processing and designing backaction-immune quantum metrology with nonlinearity.</p>

However, widely-used schemes based on staircase circuits are often too deep to execute on current hardware.

We achieve this with ADAPT-AQC, an adaptive-ansatz preparation algorithm, and introduce a generalised initialisation procedure for the existing AQC-Tensor algorithm. We first compare these methods for the task of preparing a molecular electronic structure ground state. We then use them to prepare an antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state of the 50-site Heisenberg XXZ spin chain near the AFM-XY phase boundary. Through the execution of circuits with up to 59 CZ depth and 1251 CZ gates, we perform a global quench and observe the relaxation of magnetic ordering in a parameter regime previously inaccessible due to deep ground state preparation circuits.

We demonstrate an efficient quantum memory for hyper-dimensional photons encoded with orbital angular momentum (OAM) and spin angular momentum (SAM). OAM information is encoded from -5 to +5, combined with SAM encoding, enabling up to 22 dimensions. To ensure high memory efficiency, an artificial intelligence algorithm, a modified Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm using Chebyshev sampling, is developed to obtain a perfect signal-control waveform matching. Memory efficiency is experimentally achieved at 92% for single-mode Gaussian signal, 91% for information dimension of 6 and 80% for dimensional number to 22. The fidelity is achieved up to 99% for single-mode Gaussian signal, 95.5% for OAM information, 97.4% for SAM information, and 92% for whole hyper-dimensional signal, which is far beyond no-cloning limitation. Our results demonstrate superior performance and potential applications in high-dimensional quantum information processing.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Senwei Liang, Linghua Zhu, Xiaosong Li, Chao Yang</p>
            <p>Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) offer a promising approach to solving computationally demanding problems by combining parameterized quantum circuits with classical optimization. Estimating probabilistic outcomes on quantum hardware requires repeated measurements (shots). However, in practice, the limited shot budget introduces significant noise in the evaluation of the objective function. Gradient estimation in VQAs often relies on the finite-difference, which evaluates the noisy objective function at perturbed circuit parameter values. The accuracy of this estimation is highly dependent on the choice of step size for these perturbations. An inappropriate step size can exacerbate the impact of noise, causing inaccurate gradient estimates and hindering the classical optimization in VQAs. This paper proposes QuGStep, an algorithm that addresses the challenge of determining the appropriate step size for finite-difference gradient estimation under a shot budget. QuGStep is grounded in a theorem that proves the optimal step size, which accounts for the shot budget, minimizes the error bound in gradient estimation using finite differences. Numerical experiments approximating the ground state energy of several molecules demonstrate that QuGStep can identify the appropriate step size for the given shot budget to obtain effective gradient estimation. Notably, the step size identified by QuGStep achieved convergence to the ground state energy with over 94% fewer shots compared to using a default step size (i.e., step size of 0.01). These findings highlight the potential of QuGStep to improve the practical deployment and scalability of quantum computing technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammad Ayyash, Sahel Ashhab</p>
            <p>The dispersive regime of $n$-photon qubit-oscillator interactions is analyzed using Schrieffer-Wolff perturbation theory. Effective Hamiltonians are derived up to the second order in the perturbation parameters. These effective descriptions reveal higher-order qubit-oscillator cross-Kerr and oscillator self-Kerr terms. The cross-Kerr term combines a qubit Pauli operator with an $n$-degree polynomial in the oscillator photon number operator, while the self-Kerr term is an $(n-1)$-degree polynomial in the oscillator photon number operator. In addition to the higher-order Kerr terms, a qubit-conditional $2n$-photon squeezing term appears in the effective non-rotating-wave-approximation Hamiltonian. Furthermore, perturbation theory is applied to the case of multiple qubits coupled to a shared oscillator. A photon-number-dependent qubit-qubit interaction emerges in this case, which can be leveraged to tune the effective multiqubit system parameters using the oscillator state. Results for the converse setup of multiple oscillators and a single qubit are also derived. In this case, a qubit-conditional oscillator-oscillator nonlinear interaction is found. The spectral instabilities plaguing multiphoton qubit-oscillator models are carefully treated by introducing stabilizing higher-order terms in the Hamiltonian. The stabilizing terms preserve low-photon subspaces, avoid negative infinite energies and facilitate reliable numerical calculations used to validate analytical predictions. The effective descriptions developed here offer a simple and intuitive physical picture of dispersive multiphoton qubit-oscillator interactions that can aid in the design of implementations harnessing their various nonlinear effects.</p>

            <p>Quantum computing has recently been emerging in theoretical chemistry as a realistic avenue meant to offer computational speedup to challenging eigenproblems in the context of strongly-correlated molecular systems or extended materials. Most studies so far have been devoted to the quantum treatment of electronic structure and only a few were directed to the quantum treatment of vibrational structure, which at the moment remains not devoid of unknowns. In particular, we address here a formal problem that arises when simulating a vibrational model under harmonic second quantization, whereby the disruption of the closure relation (resolution of the identity) -- which occurs when truncating the infinite bosonic basis set -- may have some serious effects as regards the correct evaluation of Hamiltonian matrix elements. This relates intimately to the normal ordering of products of ladder operators. In addition, we discuss the relevance of choosing an adequate primitive basis set within the present context with respect to its variational convergence properties. Such fundamental, yet consequential, aspects are illustrated numerically in the present work on a one-dimensional anharmonic Hamiltonian model corresponding to a double-well potential showing strong tunneling, of interest both for vibrational spectroscopy and chemical reactivity.</p>

            <p>High-resolution array detectors are widely used in single-particle tracking, but their performance is limited by excess noise from background light and dark current. As pixel resolution increases, the diminished signal per pixel exacerbates susceptibility to noise, degrading tracking accuracy. To overcome this limitation, we use spatial-mode demultiplexing (SPADE) as a noise-robust approach for estimating the motion characteristics of an optical point-like source. We show that SPADE efficiently concentrate the information into a few key spatial modes, drastically reducing the number of detectors while maintaining high estimation precision. Furthermore, we enhance the robustness of the estimation against excess noise by elaborately designing the modes to be decomposed. We demonstrate, both theoretically and experimentally, that a SPADE with two specific modes outperforms direct imaging in estimating the micro-oscillation frequency of an optical point source in the presence of excess noise.</p>

            <p>Quantum optical systems comprising quantum emitters interacting with engineered optical modes generate non-classical states of light that can be used as resource states for quantum-enhanced interferometry. However, outside of well-controlled systems producing either single-mode states (e.g. Fock states or squeezed states) or highly symmetric multi-mode states (e.g. superradiant states), their potential for quantum advantage remains uncharacterized. In this work, we develop a framework to analyze quantum enhanced interferometry with general Markovian quantum light sources. First, we show how to compute the quantum Fisher Information (QFI) of the photons emitted by a source efficiently by just tracking its internal dynamics and without explicitly computing the state of the emitted photons. We then use this relationship to elucidate the connection between the level structure and spectrum of the source to a potential quantum advantage in interferometry. Finally, we analyze optimal measurement protocols that can be used to achieve this quantum advantage with experimentally available optical elements. In particular, we show that tunable optical elements with Kerr non-linearity can always be harnessed to implement the optimal measurement for any given source. Simultaneously, we also outline general conditions under which linear optics and photodetection is enough to implement the optimal measurement.</p>

            <p>We develop a parametric error model to construct a digital twin of a superconducting transmon qubit device. The model parameters are extracted from hardware calibration data and supplementary benchmarking circuits, providing a dynamic, system-specific representation of noise and gate imperfections. Given the strong dependence of qubit performance on calibration procedures, our approach captures real-time device fluctuations. By incorporating predominant noise sources derived from underlying physical processes, we enhance the emulation's accuracy while reducing the data required for model fitting. Finally, we validate our model by comparing its predictions with experimental results from a 5-qubit QPU, achieving a mean total variation distance of 0.15 between the shot distributions. This digital twin can be leveraged for predictive performance analysis, error mitigation strategies, and the optimization of quantum protocols, contributing to more reliable quantum computations.</p>

            <h2>Agent-Q: Fine-Tuning Large Language Models for Quantum Circuit Generation and Optimization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Linus Jern, Valter Uotila, Cong Yu, Bo Zhao</p>
            <p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable outcomes in complex problems, including math, coding, and analyzing large amounts of scientific reports. Yet, few works have explored the potential of LLMs in quantum computing. The most challenging problem is to leverage LLMs to automatically generate quantum circuits at a large scale. Fundamentally, the existing pre-trained LLMs lack the knowledge of quantum circuits. In this paper, we address this challenge by fine-tuning LLMs and injecting the domain-specific knowledge of quantum computing. We describe Agent-Q, an LLM fine-tuning system to generate and optimize quantum circuits. In particular, Agent-Q implements the mechanisms to generate training data sets and constructs an end-to-end pipeline to fine-tune pre-trained LLMs to generate parameterized quantum circuits for various optimization problems. Agent-Q provides 14,000 quantum circuits covering a large spectrum of the quantum optimization landscape: 12 optimization problem instances and their optimized QAOA, VQE, and adaptive VQE circuits. Based thereon, Agent-Q fine-tunes LLMs and constructs syntactically correct parametrized quantum circuits in OpenQASM 3.0. We have evaluated the quality of the LLM-generated circuits and parameters by comparing them to the optimized expectation values and distributions. Experimental results show superior performance of Agent-Q, compared to several state-of-the-art LLMs and better parameters than random. Agent-Q can be integrated into an agentic workflow, and the generated parametrized circuits with initial parameters can be used as a starting point for further optimization, e.g., as templates in quantum machine learning and as benchmarks for compilers and hardware.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pedro Rosario, Luiz O.R. Solak, A. Cidrim, R. Bachelard, Johannes Schachenmayer</p>
            <p>We show that idealized Dicke superradiant decay from a fully inverted state can at all times be described by a positive statistical mixture of coherent spin states (CSS). Since CSS are separable, this implies that no entanglement is involved in Dicke decay. Based on this result, we introduce a new numerical quantum trajectory approach leading to low-entanglement unravelings. This opens up new possibilities for employing matrix product state (MPS) techniques for large-scale numerical simulations with collective decay processes.</p>

            <h2>Magnetic-field dependent VB- spin decoherence in hexagonal boron nitrides: A first-principles study</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jaewook Lee, Hyeonsu Kim, Huijin Park, Hosung Seo</p>
            <p>The negatively charged boron vacancy (VB-) in h-BN is a spin-1 defect functioning as an optically addressable spin qubit in two-dimensional materials. A precise understanding of its spin decoherence is essential to advance it into a robust qubit platform. First-principles quantum many-body simulations are employed to investigate VB- decoherence in dense nuclear spin baths of h-BN under magnetic fields from 0.01 to 3 T, considering isotopic variants h-10B14N, h-11B14N, h-10B15N, and h-11B15N. A transition boundary (TB) is observed where the dominant decoherence mechanism changes: below the TB, sub-microsecond decoherence is governed by independent nuclear spin dynamics, whereas above it, pairwise flip-flops dominate, extending T2 to tens of microseconds. Analytical predictions place the TB at 0.502 T for h-10B14N and 0.205 T for h-11B14N. The larger TB in h-10BN results from the larger nuclear spin of 10B (I = 3), which produces stronger nuclear modulation over a wider field range. The analytical approach also explains the magnetic-field-insensitive fast modulation observed below the TB. These findings clarify the role of dense nuclear spin baths with large nuclear spins (I >= 1) in VB- decoherence and provide design principles for isotopically engineered h-BN spin qubits.</p>

            <h2>Integrated Multi-Wavelength Photonic Architectures for Future Scalable Trapped Ion Quantum Devices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alto Osada, Koichiro Miyanishi</p>
            <p>Recent advances of quantum technologies rely on precise control and integration of quantum objects, and technological breakthrough is anticipated for further scaling up to realize practical applications. Trapped-ion quantum technology is a promising candidates to realize them, while its scalability depends on the development of intra-node scaling up, reproducibility of quantum nodes and photonic interconnection among them. Utilization of integrated photonics instead of free-space optics is a crucial step toward mass production of trapped-ion quantum nodes and manifests itself as useful for laser delivery for various quantum operations and photon detection. However, whole architecture of the scalable photonic circuits for them is left unexplored. In this work, we discuss photonic architectures for trapped-ion quantum devices, in which lasers of multiple wavelengths are delivered to multiple trapping zones within a single chip. We analyze two methods of configuring nanophotonic waveguides and compare them in terms of loss of total laser power. This work opens up a new landscape of photonic architecture for various applications not only to quantum ones such as trapped-ion devices but also to classical photonics, e.g. optoelectronic devices and biochemical sensing.</p>

            <p>We present a hybrid quantum-classical electrostatic Particle-in-Cell (PIC) method, where the electrostatic field Poisson solver is implemented on a quantum computer simulator using a hybrid classical-quantum Neural Network (HNN) using data-driven and physics-informed learning approaches. The HNN is trained on classical PIC simulation results and executed via a PennyLane quantum simulator. The remaining computational steps, including particle motion and field interpolation, are performed on a classical system. To evaluate the accuracy and computational cost of this hybrid approach, we test the hybrid quantum-classical electrostatic PIC against the two-stream instability, a standard benchmark in plasma physics. Our results show that the quantum Poisson solver achieves comparable accuracy to classical methods. It also provides insights into the feasibility of using quantum computing and HNNs for plasma simulations. We also discuss the computational overhead associated with current quantum computer simulators, showing the challenges and potential advantages of hybrid quantum-classical numerical methods.</p>

            <p>We explore the usefulness of mid-circuit measurements to enhance quantum algorithmics. Specifically, we assess how quantum phase estimation (QPE) and mid-circuit measurements can improve the performance of variational quantum algorithms. Our focus is on the single-qubit version of QPE namely, the Hadamard test applied to the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) ansatz. We demonstrate that a mid-circuit measurement acts as a low-energy filter when the desired outcome is obtained. When the other outcome is measured we heuristically rely on the mixer to repopulate the low energy states. Numerical simulations show that this method effectively amplifies the ground state. We validate our approach on real quantum hardware namely the IBM Quantum system one ibm_quebec.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rishabh Tripathi, Krishna K. Maurya, Rohan Singh</p>
            <p>V-type three-level systems, where two excited states share a common ground state, serve as fundamental models for exploring coherent light-matter interactions in a range of quantum systems, from atomic gases to semiconductor nanostructures. In this work, we investigate the coherent evolution of such a system under strong femtosecond-pulse excitation by numerically solving the optical Bloch equations. We demonstrate that the coherent evolution of a three-level system critically depends on the product of the excitation-pulse duration and energy separation between the excited states. Using this understanding, we extend our analysis to simulate two-dimensional coherent spectra in a high-intensity regime. We show that by varying the pulse areas of the excitation pulses, one can selectively turn individual spectral features, corresponding to distinct quantum pathways, on or off. Moreover, we can precisely adjust the phase of these peaks, illustrating an advanced level of coherent control within the system. Our approach provides a simple and robust framework for achieving advanced coherent control in multilevel systems.</p>

            <h2>Partitions in quantum theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Augustin Vanrietvelde, Octave Mestoudjian, Pablo Arrighi</p>
            <p>Decompositional theories describe the ways in which a global physical system can be split into subsystems, facilitating the study of how different possible partitions of a same system interplay, e.g. in terms of inclusions or signalling. In quantum theory, subsystems are usually framed as sub-C* algebras of the algebra of operators on the global system. However, most decompositional approaches have so far restricted their scope to the case of systems corresponding to factor algebras. We argue that this is a mistake: one should cater for the possibility for non-factor subsystems, arising for instance from symmetry considerations. Building on simple examples, we motivate and present a definition of partitions into an arbitrary number of parts, each of which is a possibly non-factor sub-C* algebra. We discuss its physical interpretation and study its properties, in particular with regards to the structure of algebras' centres. We prove that partitions, defined at the C*-algebraic level, can be represented in terms of a splitting of Hilbert spaces, using the framework of routed quantum circuits. For some partitions, however, such a representation necessarily retains a residual pseudo-nonlocality. We provide an example of this behaviour, given by the partition of a fermionic system into local modes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Meng-Zhi Wu, Marko Toroš, Sougato Bose, Anupam Mazumdar</p>
            <p>Matter-wave interferometry is highly susceptible to inertial acceleration noises arising from the vibration of the experimental apparatus. There are various methods for noise suppression. In this paper, we propose leveraging the cross-correlation of multi-directional vibration noises to mitigate their dephasing effect in matter-wave interferometers. Specifically, we analyse an interferometer driven by its internal state under an external field and examine the dephasing caused by a two-dimensional random inertial force. As we will demonstrate, the coupling between the two-dimensional inertial force noise components will shift the resonance peak but not change the shape of the power spectral density. Moreover, when the noise approximately resonates with the intrinsic frequency of the test mass, we find that the standard deviation of the phase can be suppressed by a factor roughly equal to the Q-factor of the noise. This technique holds significant potential for future gravity experiments utilising quantum sensors, such as measuring gravitational acceleration and exploring quantum entanglement induced by gravity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yigal Ilin, Uzi Pereg</p>
            <p>Quantum relays are central to both quantum communication and distributed quantum computing, enabling long-distance transmission and modular architectures. Unlike classical repeaters, quantum repeaters preserve coherence without amplifying quantum information, relying on entanglement swapping and quantum error correction to overcome loss and decoherence. In this work, we investigate the transmission of quantum information via quantum relay channels. Our three-terminal relay model captures the trade-off between repeater-assisted and repeaterless communication strategies. Specifically, we propose a partial decode-forward strategy, in which quantum ``message system" consists of two components. The first component is decoded by the relay and then sent to the destination receiver, whereas the second component is decoded by the destination receiver without the relay's help. We analyze both entanglement-assisted and unassisted scenarios. As a special case, the full decode-forward strategy is recovered, with the relay decoding, re-encoding, and forwarding the entire message. Our framework allows for different entanglement topologies between the transmitter, the relay and the destination receiver, recovering known results on entanglement-assisted and unassisted communication. Furthermore, we discuss the interpretation of coding with quantum side information. These findings provide a foundation for designing secure, efficient, and reliable quantum networks and for realizing practical quantum repeaters and long-range quantum key distribution.</p>

            <p>Four-component Schrödinger cat (4C) states are important physical resources for fault-tolerant quantum computing. However, the generation of 4C states in solid-state platforms remains challenging due to stringent nonlinearity requirements. In this paper, a Floquet-engineering scheme is proposed for generating 4C states in a hybrid ferromagnet-superconductor system. Numerical simulations show that the high-fidelity 4C states can be generated even if the decoherence of the system is considered. These results provide a scalable route to multi-component cat-state engineering in solid-state platforms and open new avenues for quantum computation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ankit Gill, Keun-Young Kim, Kunal Pal, Kuntal Pal</p>
            <p>We consider the geometry of quantum states associated with different classes of random matrix Hamiltonians, in particular ensembles that show integrability to chaotic transition in terms of the nearest neighbour energy level spacing distribution. In the case that the total Hamiltonian contains a single parameter, the distance between two states is captured by the fidelity susceptibility, whereas, when the total Hamiltonian contains multiple parameters, this distance is given in terms of the quantum metric tensor. Since the fidelity susceptibility is closely related to the two-point correlation function, we first calculate the relevant correlation functions of a random matrix belonging to the Gaussian unitary ensemble in terms of the spectral form factor of the total Hamiltonian, show how to obtain the fidelity susceptibility from this correlation function, and explain the role played by energy level correlation. Next, by performing suitable coordinate transformations, we solve the geodesic equations corresponding to the quantum metric tensor obtained from an integrability-breaking random matrix Hamiltonian and obtain the geodesic distance between two points on the parameter manifold to show that any point far away from the integrable phase can be reached by a finite value of this distance. Finally, we obtain and discuss different properties of the fidelity susceptibility associated with Hamiltonians belonging to another random matrix ensemble which shows integrability to chaos transition, namely the Gaussian $\beta$-ensembles with general values of the Dyson index $\beta$, and show that the fidelity susceptibility shares generic features with the first class of Hamiltonians.</p>

Our security analysis employs the Entropy Accumulation Theorem to establish rigorous finite-size bounds, achieving finite-key rates at a detector efficiency of 89\%.

            <p>Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) is a promising protocol for demonstrating quantum computational advantage. One of the key steps for proving classical hardness of GBS is the so-called ``hiding conjecture'', which asserts that one can ``hide'' a complex Gaussian matrix as a submatrix of the outer product of Haar unitary submatrices in total variation distance. In this paper, we prove the hiding conjecture for input states with the maximal number of squeezed states, which is a setup that has recently been realized experimentally [Madsen et al., Nature 606, 75 (2022)]. In this setting, the hiding conjecture states that a $o(\sqrt{M})\times o(\sqrt{M})$ submatrix of an $M\times M$ circular orthogonal ensemble (COE) random matrix can be well-approximated by a complex Gaussian matrix in total variation distance as $M\to\infty$. This is the first rigorous proof of the hiding property for GBS in the experimentally relevant regime, and puts the argument for hardness of classically simulating GBS with a maximal number of squeezed states on a comparable level to that of the conventional boson sampling of [Aaronson and Arkhipov, Theory Comput. 9, 143 (2013)].</p>

The ansatz is constructed by combining concepts from the Hamiltonian Variational Ansatz (HVA) and the Number-Preserving Ansatz (NPA). A hybrid optimization strategy is applied, where COBYLA is used for coarse convergence and L-BFGS for fine-tuning. The resulting energies are evaluated, and the corresponding physical properties of the systems are analyzed through phase diagrams of the energy excitation gaps for different charge and spin configurations.</p>

            <p>Scattering experiments with energetic particles, such as free electrons, have been historically used to reveal the quantum structure of matter. However, realizing coherent interactions between free-electron beams and solid-state quantum systems has remained out of reach, owing to their intrinsically weak coupling. Realizing such coherent control would open up opportunities for hybrid quantum platforms combining free electrons and solid-state qubits for coincident quantum information processing and nanoscale sensing. Here, we present a framework that employs negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy centers (NV-) in diamond as quantum sensors of a bunched electron beam. We develop a Lindblad master equation description of the magnetic free-electron--qubit interactions and identify spin relaxometry as a sensitive probe of the interaction. Experimentally, we integrate a confocal fluorescence microscopy setup into a microwave-bunched electron beam line. We monitor charge-state dynamics and assess their impact on key sensing performance metrics (such as spin readout contrast), defining safe operating parameters for quantum sensing experiments. By performing $T_1$ relaxometry under controlled electron beam exposure, we establish an upper bound on the free-electron--spin coupling strength. Our results establish NV- centers as quantitative probes of free electrons, providing a metrological benchmark for free-electron--qubit coupling under realistic conditions, and chart a route toward solid-state quantum control with electron beams.</p>

In this work, we investigate the impact of ion implantation and nanofabrication-induced strain on the electronic spin levels of NV$^-$ centers. We demonstrate that the zero-field continuous-wave optically detected magnetic resonance (CW-ODMR) spectrum serves as a sensitive probe of local crystal strain, providing both quantitative and directional information.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hayato Goto, Ryo Hidaka, Kosuke Tatsumura</p>
            <p>Nonlinear dynamical systems with continuous variables can be used for solving combinatorial optimization problems with discrete variables. In particular, numerical simulations of them can be used as heuristic algorithms with a desirable property, namely, parallelizability, which allows us to execute them in a massively parallel manner using cutting-edge many-core processors, leading to ultrafast performance. However, the dynamical-system approaches with continuous variables are usually less accurate than conventional approaches with discrete variables such as simulated annealing. To improve the solution accuracy of a representative dynamical system-based algorithm called simulated bifurcation (SB), which was found from classical simulation of a quantum nonlinear oscillator network exhibiting quantum bifurcation, here we generalize it by introducing nonlinear control of individual bifurcation parameters and show that the generalized SB (GSB) can achieve almost 100% success probabilities for some large-scale problems. As a result, the time to solution for a 2,000-variable problem is shortened to 10 ms by a GSB-based machine, which is two orders of magnitude shorter than the best known value, 1.3 s, previously obtained by an SB-based machine. To examine the reason for the ultrahigh performance, we investigated chaos in the GSB changing the nonlinear-control strength and found that the dramatic increase of success probabilities happens near the edge of chaos. That is, the GSB can find a solution with high probability by harnessing the edge of chaos. This finding suggests that dynamical-system approaches to combinatorial optimization will be enhanced by harnessing the edge of chaos, opening a broad possibility to tackle intractable combinatorial optimization problems by nature-inspired approaches.</p>

The structured reservoir interacts with a charger battery model through three distinct configurations: (I) direct coupling between the reservoir qubits and the battery, (II) common coupling between the reservoir qubits, the charger, and the battery, and (III) common coupling between the reservoir qubits and the charger, together with a local charger battery interaction. For both incoherent and coherent initial states, we analyze the stored energy, ergotropy, and charging power of the battery, and establish upper and lower bounds on the maximum extractable work of the battery based on the free energy of coherence, and exchanged correlations between the subsystems. Our results show that the nature of the interaction scenario and the presence of coherence crucially determine the efficiency of charging and the maximum ergotropy. We demonstrate that correlation exchange between subsystems, quantified by the difference between global and local coherence, acts as a resource for work extraction. These findings provide a deeper understanding of coherence and population and structured environments as resources for autonomous quantum batteries, and offer experimentally accessible predictions within the regime of superconducting qubits.</p>

            <h2>Grover's search with an oracle distinguishing between solutions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hristo Tonchev, Rosen Bahtev</p>
            <p>Here we suggest a modification of Grover's algorithm, based on a multiphase oracle which marks each solution with a different phase when there is more than one solution. Such a modification can be used to maintain a high probability of finding a solution for a number of iterations equal to or more than the one required by the deterministic Grover's algorithm (the one based on generalized Householder reflections). We use various semiempirical methods to show that the interval of number of iterations for which the algorithm keeps the probability of finding solution high depends on the register size and the oracle phases.</p>

            <p>In this work, we demonstrate optical integration using heralded single photons and explore the influence of spatial correlations between photons on this process. Specifically, we experimentally harness the transverse spatial degrees of freedom of light within an optical processing framework based on heralded single photons. The integration is performed over binary phase patterns encoded via a phase-only spatial light modulator, with polarization serving as an auxiliary degree of freedom. Our findings reveal a distinct contrast in how spatial correlations affect image analysis: spatially uncorrelated photons are more effective at capturing the global features of an image encoded in the modulator, whereas spatially correlated photons exhibit enhanced sensitivity to local image details. Importantly, the optical integration scheme presented here bears a strong conceptual and operational resemblance to the DQC1 (Deterministic Quantum Computation with One Qubit) model. This connection underscores the potential of our approach for quantum-enhanced information processing, even in regimes where entanglement is minimal or absent.</p>

            <h2>Statistical Invisibility of a Physical Attack on QRNGs After Randomness Extraction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi-Fan Chen, Dong Wang, Yi-Bo Zhao, Liang Cheng, Yi Zhang, Yang Zhang</p>
            <p>Current prevailing designs of quantum random number generators (QRNGs) designs typically employ post-processing techniques to distill raw random data, followed by statistical verification with suites like NIST SP 800-22. This paper demonstrates that this widely adopted practice harbors a critical flaw. We show that the powerful extraction process can create a false sense of security by perfectly concealing physical-layer attacks, rendering the subsequent statistical tests blind to a compromised entropy source. We substantiate this claim across two major QRNG architectures. Experimentally, we severely compromise an QRNG based on amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) with a power supply ripple attack. While the resulting raw data catastrophically fails NIST tests, a standard Toeplitz extraction transforms it into a final sequence that passes flawlessly. This outcome highlights a profound danger: since the validation process is insensitive to the quality of the raw data, it implies that even a fully predictable input could be processed to produce a certified, yet completely insecure, random sequence. Our theoretical analysis confirms this vulnerability extends to phase-noise-based QRNGs, suggesting a need for security validation to evolve beyond statistical analysis of the final output and consider the entire generation process.</p>

            <h2>Algorithmic Randomness and Probabilistic Laws</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jeffrey A. Barrett, Eddy Keming Chen</p>
            <p>We apply recent ideas about complexity and randomness to the philosophy of laws and chances. We develop two ways to use algorithmic randomness to characterize probabilistic laws of nature. The first, a generative chance* law, employs a nonstandard notion of chance. The second, a probabilistic* constraining law, impose relative frequency and randomness constraints that every physically possible world must satisfy. The constraining notion removes a major obstacle to a unified governing account of non-Humean laws, on which laws govern by constraining physical possibilities; it also provides independently motivated solutions to familiar problems for the Humean best-system account (the Big Bad Bug and the zero-fit problem). On either approach, probabilistic laws are tied more tightly to corresponding sets of possible worlds: some histories permitted by traditional probabilistic laws are now ruled out as physically impossible. Consequently, the framework avoids one variety of empirical underdetermination while bringing to light others that are typically overlooked.</p>

            <p>In high-energy particle collisions, charged track finding is a complex yet crucial endeavour. We propose a quantum algorithm, specifically quantum template matching, to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of track finding. Abstracting the Quantum Amplitude Amplification routine by introducing a data register, and utilising a novel oracle construction, allows data to be parsed to the circuit and matched with a hit-pattern template, without prior knowledge of the input data. Furthermore, we address the challenges posed by missing hit data, demonstrating the ability of the quantum template matching algorithm to successfully identify charged-particle tracks from hit patterns with missing hits. Our findings therefore propose quantum methodologies tailored for real-world applications and underline the potential of quantum computing in collider physics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yifan Zhang</p>
            <p>The quadratic complexity of dot-product attention introduced in Transformer remains a fundamental bottleneck impeding the progress of foundation models toward unbounded context lengths. Addressing this challenge, we introduce the Deep Tensor Network, a new architectural framework that fundamentally reformulates attention by unifying the expressive power of tensor algebra with neural network design. Our approach moves beyond both conventional dot-product attention and subsequent linear-time approximations to capture higher-order statistical dependencies. We introduce two core operators derived from this framework: \emph{Tensor Attention}, which models complex token-mixing via data-dependent polynomial kernels, and Tensor Interaction, a novel mechanism for adaptive channel-mixing. We demonstrate that these operators are powered by second-order summaries that entirely bypass the formation of $n \times n$ matrices, enabling a causality-preserving streaming implementation with $O(d^2)$ per-token updates and $O(d^2)$ state. This efficiency rivals that of modern State Space Models while retaining an attention-like formulation. The Deep Tensor Network thus provides a principled and powerful new class of building blocks for next-generation sequence models, bridging the gap between scalable computation and rich, expressive interaction modeling.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Subhadip Bouri, Abhishek Kumar Jha, Subhashish Banerjee</p>
            <p>The quantum speed limits (QSLs) set fundamental lower bounds on the time required for a quantum system to evolve from a given initial state to a final state. In this work, we investigate $CP$ violation and the mass ordering problem of neutrino oscillations in matter using the QSL time as a key analytical tool. We examine the QSL time for the unitary evolution of two- and three-flavor neutrino states, both in vacuum and in the presence of matter. Two-flavor neutrino oscillations are used as a precursor to their three-flavor counterparts. We further compute the QSL time for neutrino state evolution and entanglement in terms of neutrino survival and oscillation probabilities, which are experimentally measurable quantities in neutrino experiments. A difference in the QSL time between the normal and inverted mass ordering scenarios, for neutrino state evolution as well as for entanglement, under the effect of a $CP$ violation phase is observed. Our results are illustrated using the length scales and energies of ongoing long-baseline accelerator neutrino experiments such as T2K, NOvA, and the upcoming DUNE experiment. Notably, three-flavor neutrino oscillations in constant matter density exhibit faster state evolution across all these neutrino experiments in the normal mass ordering scenario. Additionally, we observe fast entanglement suppression in DUNE assuming a normal mass ordering.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Hamilton-Jacobi Theory, Spectral Path Integrals and Exact-WKB Analysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mustafa Türe, Mithat Ünsal</p>
            <p>We propose a new way to perform path integrals in quantum mechanics by using a quantum version of Hamilton-Jacobi theory. In classical mechanics, Hamilton-Jacobi theory is a powerful formalism, however, its utility is not explored in quantum theory beyond approximation schemes. The canonical transformation enables one to set the new Hamiltonian to constant or zero, but keeps the information about solution in Hamilton's characteristic function. To benefit from this in quantum theory, one must work with a formulation in which classical Hamiltonian is used. This uniquely points to phase space path integral. However, the main variable in HJ-formalism is energy, not time. Thus, we are led to consider Fourier transform of path integral, spectral path integral, $\tilde Z(E)$. The evaluation of path integral reduces to determining the quantum Hamilton's characteristic functions (which can be achieved via an asymptotic analysis), and a discrete sum over the quantum period lattice, generalizing Gutzwiller's sum.</p>

We derive the leading de Sitter corrections to the flat-space entanglement entropy for subhorizon entangling radii. We analyze the structure of the finite-size effects and we show that the contribution to the entanglement entropy of the sector of the theory with vanishing angular momentum depends logarithmically on the size of the overall system, which extends beyond the horizon.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rathindra Nath Das, Takato Mori</p>
            <p>In quantum systems, purification can map mixed states into pure states and a non-unitary evolution into a unitary one by enlarging the Hilbert space. We establish a connection between the complexities of mixed quantum states and their purification, proposing new inequalities among these complexities. By examining single qubits, two-qubit Werner states, 8-dimensional Gaussian random unitary ensemble, and infinite-dimensional systems, we demonstrate how these relationships manifest across a broad class of systems. We find that the spread complexity of purification of a vacuum state evolving into a thermal state equals the average number of Rindler particles. This complexity is also shown to adhere to the Lloyd-like bound, indicating a further relation to the quantum speed limit. Finally, using mutual Krylov complexity, we observe subadditivity of the Krylov complexities, which contrasts with known results from holographic volume complexity. We put forward Krylov mutual complexity as a diagnosis of a potential gravity dual of Krylov complexities.</p>

            <p>Time-division multiplexing of cryogenic signals is a promising approach to reduce space requirements, shorten cooldown times, and increase the number of quantum devices measured per cooldown. We demonstrate time-division multiplexing of non-dissipative supercurrents using voltage-controlled hybrid superconducting demultiplexers. These chips integrate superconducting Josephson Field Effect Transistors including Al superconducting electrodes, proximitized semiconducting InAs channels, and hafnium oxide gate insulators. Each transistor fully suppresses the switching current and increases the resistance 20 times under a gate voltage of -4.5 V. A demultiplexer with one input and eight outputs showed a non-dissipative input range of +-2 uA, operating up to 100 MHz in signal frequency and 100 kHz in switching frequency at 50 mK. It achieved near-zero insertion loss in the superconducting state and an ON/OFF ratio of 17.5 dB. By optimizing the signal layout, the operation was extended up to 4 GHz using a demultiplexer with two outputs.</p>

            <p>We show how the effects of large numbers of measurements on many-body quantum ground and thermal states can be studied using Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC). Density matrices generated by measurement in this setting feature products of many local nonunitary operators, and by expanding these density matrices as sums over operator strings we arrive at a generalized stochastic series expansion (SSE). Our 'post-measurement SSE' is based on importance sampling of operator strings contributing to a measured thermal density matrix. We demonstrate our algorithm by probing the effects of measurements on the spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the square lattice. Thermal states of this system have SU(2) symmetry, and at first we preserve this symmetry by measuring SU(2) symmetric observables. We identify classes of post-measurement states for which correlations can be calculated efficiently, as well as states for which SU(2) symmetric measurements generate a QMC sign problem when working in any site-local basis. For the first class, we show how deterministic loop updates can be leveraged. Using our algorithm we demonstrate the creation of long-range Bell pairs and symmetry-protected topological order, as well as the measurement-induced enhancement of antiferromagnetic correlations. We then study the effects of measuring the system in a basis where the standard (unmeasured) SSE is sign-free: For measurement schemes with this property, we can calculate correlations in all post-measurement states without a sign problem. The method developed in this work opens the door to scalable experimental probes of measurement-induced collective phenomena, which require numerical estimates for the effects of measurements.</p>

            <p>We show strong coupling between antiferromagnetic magnons and microwave cavity photons at both high and externally controllable magnon frequencies. Using the fully quantum mechanical path-integral method, we study an antiferromagnetic insulator (AFM) interfaced with a topological insulator (TI), taking Bi$_2$Se$_3$--MnSe as a representative example. We show that the mutual coupling of the spin-polarized surface states of the TI to both the squeezed magnons and the circularly polarized cavity photons results in a Chern-Simons term that activates the stronger electric, rather than magnetic, dipole coupling. Moreover, a squeezing-mediated enhancement of the coupling is achieved due to the unequal interfacial exchange coupling to the AFM sublattices, resulting in a coupling strength up to several orders stronger than for direct magnon-photon coupling. While direct cavity-AFM coupling has so far been limited in its applicability due to weak or low frequency coupling, this result may advance the utilization of high-frequency cavity magnonics and enable its incorporation into quantum information technology.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we present a Hoare-style logic for reasoning about quantum programs with classical variables. Our approach offers several improvements over previous work: (1) Enhanced expressivity of the programming language: Our logic applies to quantum programs with classical variables that incorporate quantum arrays and parameterised quantum gates, which have not been addressed in previous research on quantum Hoare logic, either with or without classical variables. (2) Intuitive correctness specifications: In our logic, preconditions and postconditions for quantum programs with classical variables are specified as a pair consisting of a classical first-order logical formula and a quantum predicate formula (possibly parameterised by classical variables). These specifications offer greater clarity and align more closely with the programmer's intuitive understanding of quantum and classical interactions. (3) Simplified proof system: By introducing a novel idea in formulating a proof rule for reasoning about quantum measurements, along with (2), we develop a proof system for quantum programs that requires only minimal modifications to classical Hoare logic. Furthermore, this proof system can be effectively and conveniently combined with classical first-order logic to verify quantum programs with classical variables. As a result, the learning curve for quantum program verification techniques is significantly reduced for those already familiar with classical program verification techniques, and existing tools for verifying classical programs can be more easily adapted for quantum program verification.</p>

            <p>We construct relational observables in group field theory (GFT) in terms of covariant positive operator-valued measures (POVMs), using techniques developed in the context of quantum reference frames. We focus on matter quantum reference frames; this can be generalized to other types of frames within the same POVM-based framework. The resulting family of relational observables provides a covariant framework to extract localized observables from GFT, which is typically defined in a perspective-neutral way. Then, we compare this formalism with previous proposals for relational observables in GFT. We find that our quantum reference frame-based relational observables overcome the intrinsic limitations of previous proposals while reproducing the same continuum limit results concerning expectation values of the number and volume operators on coherent states. Nonetheless, there can be important differences for more complex operators, as well as for other types of GFT states. Finally, we also use a specific class of POVMs to show how to project states and operators from the more general perspective-neutral GFT Fock space to a perspective-dependent one where a scalar matter field plays the role of a relational clock.</p>

            <p>Dispersive readout of superconducting qubits is often limited by readout-drive-induced transitions between qubit levels. While there is a growing understanding of such effects in transmon qubits, the case of highly nonlinear fluxonium qubits is more complex. We theoretically analyze measurement-induced state transitions (MIST) during the dispersive readout of a fluxonium qubit. We focus on a new mechanism: a simultaneous transition/excitation involving the qubit and an internal mode of the Josephson junction array in the fluxonium circuit. Using an adiabatic Floquet approach, we show that these new kinds of MIST processes can be relevant when using realistic circuit parameters and relatively low readout drive powers. They also contribute to excess qubit dephasing even after a measurement is complete. In addition to outlining basic mechanisms, we also investigate the dependence of such transitions on the circuit parameters. We find that with a judicious choice of frequency allocations or coupling strengths, these parasitic processes can most likely be avoided.</p>

Quantum computing (QC), does offer the hope that its inherent probabilistic functionality can be utilised in this field of generative artificial intelligence. In this study, we use quantum-classical hybrid generative adversarial networks (QuGANs) to artificially generate graphs of shipping routes. We create a training dataset based on real shipping data and investigate to what extent QuGANs are able to learn and reproduce inherent distributions and geometric features of this data. We compare hybrid QuGANs with classical Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), with a special focus on their parameter efficiency. Our results indicate that QuGANs are indeed able to quickly learn and represent underlying geometric properties and distributions, although they seem to have difficulties in introducing variance into the sampled data. Compared to classical GANs of greater size, measured in the number of parameters used, some QuGANs show similar result quality. Our reference to concrete use cases, such as the generation of shipping data, provides an illustrative example and demonstrate the potential and diversity in which QC can be used.</p>

            <p>We consider a spinning primordial black hole (PBH) described by the Kerr metric in Kerr-Schild polar coordinates. We derive an analytical expression for the four-vector gravitational potential in the underlying Hermitian Dirac Hamiltonian using these coordinates. This gravitational potential introduces an axial vector term in the Dirac equation in curved spacetime. We find that the magnitudes of the temporal and spatial components of the four-vector gravitational potential are significantly affected by the angle of the position vector of the spinor with respect to the spin axis of the PBH, its radial distance from the PBH, and the strength of the specific angular momentum of the PBH. These potentials modify the effective mass matrix of the neutrino-antineutrino system and significantly affect the transition probabilities during the flavor oscillation of the neutrino-antineutrino system. We then use the transition probability to investigate the quantum speed limit time bound ratio for the two-flavor oscillation of the neutrino-antineutrino system in curved spacetime. This helps us estimate how quickly the initial neutrino flavor state evolves over time under the influence of the gravitational field. Finally, we discuss quantum correlations such as entanglement entropy during the two-flavor oscillation of the neutrino-antineutrino system near a spinning PBH.</p>

While the free-fermion states are adiabatically connected, we find that the projected states undergo a phase transition detected by the topological entanglement entropy. Our work underscores the profound impact of the Gutzwiller projection and cautions against inferring properties of quantum spin liquids solely from their unprojected counterparts.</p>

            <h2>Single-atom imaging of ${}^{173}$Yb in optical tweezers loaded by a five-beam magneto-optical trap</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Omar Abdel Karim, Alessandro Muzi Falconi, Riccardo Panza, Wenliang Liu, Francesco Scazza</p>
            <p>We report on the trapping and imaging of individual ytterbium atoms in arrays of optical tweezers, loaded from a magneto-optical trap (MOT) formed by only five beams in an orthogonal configuration. In our five-beam MOT, operating on the narrow ${}^1$S${}_0 \rightarrow {}^3$P${}_1$ intercombination transition, gravity balances the radiation pressure of a single upward-directed beam. This approach enables efficient trapping and cooling of the most common ytterbium isotopes (${}^{171}$Yb, ${}^{173}$Yb and ${}^{174}$Yb) to $\lesssim 20\,\mu$K at densities $\sim 10^{11}$ atoms/cm$^3$ within less than one second. This configuration allows for significantly reducing the complexity of the optical setup, potentially benefiting any ytterbium-atom based quantum science platform leveraging single-atom microscopy, from quantum processors to novel optical clocks. We then demonstrate the first single-atom-resolved imaging of the fermionic, large-spin isotope ${}^{173}$Yb ($I=5/2$), employing a two-color imaging scheme that does not rely on magic-wavelength trapping. We achieve a high single-atom detection fidelity of $99.96(1)\%$ and a large survival probability of $98.5(2)\%$, despite large differential light shifts affecting all nuclear spin sublevels of the excited ${}^3$P${}_1$ state involved in the cooling transition. The demonstrated capabilities will play a key role in future quantum simulations and computing applications with ${}^{173}$Yb arrays.</p>

            <h2>$\mathcal{P}$, $\mathcal{T}$-violating axion-mediated interactions in RaOH molecule</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anna Zakharova</p>
            <p>If axion simultaneously has the scalar couplings to the nucleons and pseudo-scalar couplings to the electrons, it may mediate a $\mathcal{P}$, $\mathcal{T}$-violating interaction between the electronic shell and nuclei in the molecules. The polyatomic molecule RaOH, which is considered as a promising platform for the $\mathcal{P}$, $\mathcal{T}$ violation searches, is studied for its sensitivity to such interactions. Due to the long-range nature (on molecular scales) of the axion-mediated interaction, it is important whether the enhancement parameter would be sensitive to the vibration of the molecule. Our results imply that the impact of the vibrations on the axion-mediated electron-nucleon interaction in the molecule is similar to the impact on the short-range electron-nucleon scalar-pseudoscalar interaction studied earlier.</p>

            <h2>Floquet Möbius topological insulators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Longwen Zhou, Fan Zhang, Jiaxin Pan</p>
            <p>Möbius topological insulators have dispersive edge bands with Möbius twists in momentum space, which are protected by the combination of chiral and $Z_2$-projective translational symmetries. In this work, we reveal a unique type of Möbius topological insulator, whose edge bands could twist around the quasienergy $\pi$ of a periodically driven system and are thus of Floquet origin. By applying time-periodic quenches to an experimentally realized Möbius insulator model, we obtain interconnected Möbius edge bands around zero and $\pi$ quasienergies, which can coexist with a gapped or gapless bulk. These Möbius bands are topologically characterized by a pair of generalized winding numbers, which are integer-quantized due to an emergent chiral symmetry at a high-symmetry point in momentum space. Numerical investigations of the quasienergy and entanglement spectra provide consistent evidence for the presence of such Möbius topological phases. A protocol based on the adiabatic switching of edge-band populations is further introduced to dynamically characterize the topology of Floquet Möbius edge bands. Our findings thus extend the scope of Möbius topological phases to nonequilibrium settings and unveil a unique class of Möbius-twisted topological edge states without static counterparts.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sergio E. Aguilar-Gutierrez, Yichao Fu, Kuntal Pal, Klaas Parmentier</p>
            <p>We study SU($N$) spin systems that mimic the behavior of particles in $N$-dimensional de Sitter space for $N=2,3$. Their Hamiltonians describe a dynamical system with hyperbolic fixed points, leading to emergent quasinormal modes at the quantum level. These manifest as quasiparticle peaks in the density of states. For a particle in 2-dimensional de Sitter, we find both principal and complementary series densities of states from a PT-symmetric version of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, having two hyperbolic fixed points in the classical phase space. We then study different spectral and dynamical properties of this class of models, including level spacing statistics, two-point functions, squared commutators, spectral form factor, Krylov operator and state complexity. We find that, even though the early-time properties of these quantities are governed by the saddle points -- thereby in some cases mimicking corresponding properties of chaotic systems, a close look at the late-time behavior reveals the integrable nature of the system.</p>

            <h2>Symmetry Sectors in Chord Space and Relational Holography in the DSSYK</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sergio E. Aguilar-Gutierrez</p>
            <p>In holography, gauging symmetries of the boundary theory leads to important modifications in the bulk. In this work, we study constraints to gauge symmetry sectors in the chord Hilbert space of the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) with matter, and we connect them to different proposals of its bulk dual. These sectors include chord parity symmetry, corresponding to End-Of-The-World (ETW) branes and Euclidean wormholes in sine dilaton gravity; and relative time-translations in a doubled DSSYK model (resulting from a single DSSYK with an infinitely heavy matter chord) used in de Sitter holography. We define and evaluate partition functions and thermal correlation functions of the ETW brane and Euclidean wormhole systems in the boundary theory. We deduce the holographic dictionary by matching geodesic lengths in the bulk with the spread complexity of the parity-gauged DSSYK. The Euclidean wormholes of fixed size are perturbatively stable, and their baby universe Hilbert space is non-trivial only when matter is added. We conclude studying the constraints in the path integral of the doubled DSSYK. We derive the gauge invariant operator algebra of one of the DSSYKs dressed to the other one and discuss its holographic interpretation.</p>

These tools offer an efficient means to study entanglement generation and particle production, particularly when analytical methods become insufficient and numerical simulations are essential. By evolving an initial Bunch-Davies vacuum through a two-mode squeezer, we simulate the behavior of the von Neumann entropy and logarithmic negativity across a wide range of cosmological backgrounds, each characterized by a distinct equation of state. The von Neumann entropy obtained via QuGIT simulations is compared with analytic Rényi entropy bounds, thereby validating the accuracy of our circuit implementation of the cosmological squeezing Hamiltonian in both accelerating and decelerating scenarios. We further investigate the role of thermal noise and demonstrate how the von Neumann entropy and logarithmic negativity are affected by its presence.</p>

            <p>The selection of a balanced active space is a critical step in multi-reference quantum chemistry calculations, particularly for systems with strong electron correlation. Likewise, active space selection is a key to unlock the potential of contemporary quantum computing in quantum chemistry. Albeit recent progress, there remains a lack of a unified, robust, and fully automated framework for active space selection that performs reliably across a wide range of molecular systems. In this work, we present a novel approach inspired by both the AVAS (Atomic Valence Active Space) and AutoCAS methods. Our method unifies orbital entropy analysis with atomic orbital projections to guide the construction of chemically and physically meaningful active spaces. This integrated scheme enables a more consistent and flexible selection of active orbitals while retaining automation and scalability. We validate our approach on a set of molecular systems relevant to photodynamic therapy, in particular a set of Ru(II)-complexes, selected to span increasing levels of electron correlation and structural complexity. These molecules serve as challenging test cases due to the presence of strong static correlation and the need for highly accurate electronic structure descriptions. Our results demonstrate that the method can reliably identify compact, chemically intuitive active spaces that capture the essential physics, making it suitable for both classical and quantum computational frameworks. Furthermore, we have developed this approach in a package that is intuitive to use for users and can be interfaced with both standard quantum chemistry and quantum computing applications, making it accessible to a broad research community.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Patrick Maier, Alexander Kubanek</p>
            <p>The integration of membranes into optical resonators plays a key role in a variety of applications, including optomechanics. If such membranes host atom-like systems, ideally with access to spin states, new roads in quantum photonics and also in optomechanics can be taken. Layered, two-dimensional materials have emerged as candidates for membranes hosting atom-like quantum emitters. Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is among the most promising two-dimensional platforms showing good mechanical properties combined with the ability to host various kinds of optical active (spin-) defects. However, the determinisitc creation of optically active defect centers in hBN membranes is an outstanding challenge. Commercially available flakes of hBN host defect centers with promising optical properties, but the integration into optical resonators suffers from scattering losses due to the flakes topography and suitable transfer, handling and manipulation techniques need to be established. Here, we develope a toolset of nano-scaled manipulation techniques to extract membrane-like structures of commercially-available hBN containing spectrally narrow single photon emitters. We demonstrate the transfer and integration into photonic devices, by coupling a single photon emitter in membran-like hBN to the mode of an open Fabry-Perot fiber cavity (FPFC) and observe cavity induced spectral enhancement by a factor of up to 100 at room temperature. Overcoming hBN-induced scattering for extracted hBN membranes, which host single photon emitters, paves the way for future applications such as its use as an optomechanical system.</p>

            <p>We present a new constrained Random Phase Approximation (cRPA) method, termed spectral cRPA (s-cRPA), and compare it to established cRPA approaches for Scandium and Copper by varying the 3d shell filling. The s-cRPA consistently yields larger Hubbard $U$ interaction values. Applied to the realistic system CaFeO$_3$, s-cRPA produces interaction parameters significantly closer to those required within DFT+$U$ to induce the experimentally observed insulating state, overcoming the metallic behavior predicted by standard density functionals. We also address the issue of negative interaction values found in the projector cRPA method for filled d-shells, demonstrating that s-cRPA offers superior numerical stability through electron conversion. Overall, s-cRPA is more robust and effectively overcomes the known underestimation of $U$ in standard cRPA, making it a promising tool for the community. Additionally, we have enhanced our implementation with features for computing multi-center interactions to analyze spatial decay and developed a low-scaling variant with a compressed Matsubara grid to efficiently obtain full frequency-dependent interactions.</p>

            <p>Hybrid systems composed of a single nitrogen-vacancy center spin magnetically coupled to a macroscopic mechanical resonator constitute promising platforms for the realization of quantum information protocols and for quantum sensing applications. The magnetic structure that mediates the interaction must ensure high field gradients while preserving the spin and mechanical properties. We present a spin-mechanical setup built around a cobalt nanomagnet grown with focused electron beam-induced deposition. The magnetic structure is fully characterized, and a maximum gradient of $170\,\mathrm{kT/m}$ is directly measured at a spin-oscillator distance of a few hundred nanometers. Spin coherence was preserved at the value of $20\,\mathrm{ \mu s}$ up to a gradient of $25\,\mathrm{kT/m}$. The effect of the mechanical motion onto the spin dynamics was observed, thus signifying the presence of spin-mechanics coupling. Given the noninvasive nature of the nanomagnet deposition process, we foresee the adoption of such structures in hybrid platforms with high-quality factor resonators, in the "magnet on oscillator" configuration.</p>

            <h2>Correlated decoherence and thermometry with mobile impurities in a 1D Fermi gas</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sindre Brattegard, Thomás Fogarty, Thomas Busch, Mark T. Mitchison</p>
            <p>We theoretically investigate the correlated decoherence dynamics of two mobile impurities trapped within a gas of ultracold fermionic atoms. We use a mean-field approximation to self-consistently describe the effect of impurity-gas collisions on impurity motion, while decoherence of the impurities' internal state is computed exactly within a functional determinant approach. At equilibrium, we find that the impurities undergo bath-induced localisation as the impurity-gas interaction strength is increased. We then study the non-equilibrium dynamics induced by a sudden change of the impurities' internal state, which can be experimentally probed by Ramsey interferometry. Our theoretical approach allows us to investigate the effect of impurity motion on decoherence dynamics, finding strong deviations from the universal behaviour associated with Anderson's orthogonality catastrophe when the mass imbalance between impurity and gas atoms is small. Finally, we show that mobile impurities can be used as thermometers of their environment and that bath-mediated correlations can be beneficial for thermometric performance at low temperatures, even in the presence of non-trivial impurity motion. Our results showcase the interesting open quantum dynamics of mobile impurities dephasing in a common environment, and could help provide more precise temperature estimates of ultracold fermionic mixtures.</p>

The integration is realized over the binary phases encoded with a phase-only spatial light modulator assisted by polarization. As a result, while spatially uncorrelated photons can capture the global properties of an image displayed in a spatial light modulator, correlated photons capture the local properties of the image better. Also, emphasize the strong connection between the optical integration scheme implemented here and the DQC1 (deterministic quantum computation with one qubit) model.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> F. Bemani, O. Černotík, R. Filip</p>
            <p>Detailed understanding of physical measurements is essential for devising efficient metrological strategies and measurement-feedback schemes, as well as finding fundamental limitations on measurement sensitivity. In the quantum regime, measurements modify the state of the system of interest through measurement backaction as a direct consequence of the Heisenberg principle. In cavity optomechanics and electromechanics, a plethora of strategies exist for measuring the mechanical motion using electromagnetic fields, each leading to different competition between measurement imprecision and backaction. While this range of techniques allows broad applications of optomechanical and electromechanical devices, it makes direct comparison of different measurement methods difficult. We develop a formalism for quantifying the performance of optomechanical measurements using a few relevant figures of merit. Our approach is inspired by similar characterizations in quantum optics and quantifies the main properties of quantum measurements -- the ability to distinguish different quantum states and preservation of signal in the presence of measurement noise. We demonstrate our concept on the most common optomechanical measurements -- displacement detection, coherent quantum noise cancellation, and quantum nondemolition measurements -- and perform detailed analysis of errors in optomechanical nondemolition measurements. This newly acquired knowledge allows us to propose a strategy for quantum nondemolition measurements in levitodynamics using coherent scattering. Our results complement existing knowledge of linear optomechanical interactions and open the way to new understanding of optomechanical measurements, thus allowing also novel applications of optomechanical devices in fundamental physics and quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>Future optical quantum technologies, such as quantum networks, distributed quantum computing and sensing, demand efficient, broadband quantum memories. However, achieving high efficiency without introducing noise, reducing bandwidth, or limiting scalability remains a challenge. Here, we present a new approach to enhance quantum memory protocols by leveraging constructive light-matter interference, leading to an increase in memory efficiency without increasing atomic density or laser intensity. We implement this method in a Raman quantum memory in warm Cesium vapor, and achieve more than a three-fold improvement in total efficiency reaching $(34.3\pm8.4)\%$, while retaining GHz-bandwidth operation and low noise levels. Numerical simulations predict that this approach can boost efficiencies in systems limited by atomic density, such as cold atomic ensembles, from $65\%$ to beyond $96\%$, while in warm atomic vapors it could reduce the laser intensity needed to reach a given efficiency by over an order-of-magnitude, exceeding $95\%$ total efficiency. Furthermore, our method preserves the single-mode nature of the memory at high efficiencies. This new protocol is applicable to various memory architectures, paving the way toward scalable, efficient, low-noise, and high-bandwidth quantum memories.</p>

We also demonstrate and quantify the measurement back-action induced, on the embedded spin qubit, by the detection of a single reflected photon. We show that the induced population and coherence of the spin state can be tuned by the chosen polarization basis of the measurement.

By precisely engineering the light matter interaction, our memory coherently stores the optimal temporal mode with high fidelity and retrieves it on-demand, realizing a mode crosstalk as low as 0.34%. To estimate the separation between two spectral lines, we experimentally measure the mean squared error of the frequency estimate, achieving a sensitivity of 1/20 of the linewidth with a ($34\pm4$)-fold enhancement in precision over direct intensity measurements. This enhanced frequency resolution, combined with the memory's on-demand storage, retrieval, and mode conversion capabilities, paves the way for multifunctional memory-based time-frequency sensors and their integration within quantum networks.</p>

            <p>In this work, we perform optical integration with heralded single photons and investigate the role played by the spatial correlation between the photons in this task. To address this, we experimentally investigate the use of the transverse spatial degrees of freedom of light in an optical processing scheme utilizing heralded single photons. The integration is realized over the binary phases encoded with a phase-only spatial light modulator assisted by polarization. As a result, while spatially uncorrelated photons can capture the global properties of an image displayed in a spatial light modulator, correlated photons capture the local properties of the image better. Also, emphasize the strong connection between the optical integration scheme implemented here and the DQC1 (deterministic quantum computation with one qubit) model.</p>

            <h2>Characterization of Linear Measurements in Cavity Optomechanics: Examples and Applications</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> F. Bemani, O. Černotík, R. Filip</p>
            <p>Detailed understanding of physical measurements is essential for devising efficient metrological strategies and measurement-feedback schemes, as well as finding fundamental limitations on measurement sensitivity. In the quantum regime, measurements modify the state of the system of interest through measurement backaction as a direct consequence of the Heisenberg principle. In cavity optomechanics and electromechanics, a plethora of strategies exist for measuring the mechanical motion using electromagnetic fields, each leading to different competition between measurement imprecision and backaction. While this range of techniques allows broad applications of optomechanical and electromechanical devices, it makes direct comparison of different measurement methods difficult. We develop a formalism for quantifying the performance of optomechanical measurements using a few relevant figures of merit. Our approach is inspired by similar characterizations in quantum optics and quantifies the main properties of quantum measurements -- the ability to distinguish different quantum states and preservation of signal in the presence of measurement noise. We demonstrate our concept on the most common optomechanical measurements -- displacement detection, coherent quantum noise cancellation, and quantum nondemolition measurements -- and perform detailed analysis of errors in optomechanical nondemolition measurements. This newly acquired knowledge allows us to propose a strategy for quantum nondemolition measurements in levitodynamics using coherent scattering. Our results complement existing knowledge of linear optomechanical interactions and open the way to new understanding of optomechanical measurements, thus allowing also novel applications of optomechanical devices in fundamental physics and quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>Giant quantum emitters, whose effective size is comparable to the wavelength of the radiation they couple to, give rise to interference effects and non-Markovian dynamics that lie beyond the scope of the standard Weisskopf-Wigner approximation. Here we study minimal models of giant emitters coupled to cavit$-array waveguides and identify symmetric configurations where the dynamics can be solved exactly. This allows us to capture the emergence of bound states both inside and outside the photonic continuum, and to demonstrate the possibility of engineering their coherent superpositions. Our results provide analytical insight into non-Markovian light-matter interaction and suggest a feasible implementation using superconducting circuit platforms.</p>

            <p>Future optical quantum technologies, such as quantum networks, distributed quantum computing and sensing, demand efficient, broadband quantum memories. However, achieving high efficiency without introducing noise, reducing bandwidth, or limiting scalability remains a challenge. Here, we present a new approach to enhance quantum memory protocols by leveraging constructive light-matter interference, leading to an increase in memory efficiency without increasing atomic density or laser intensity. We implement this method in a Raman quantum memory in warm Cesium vapor, and achieve more than a three-fold improvement in total efficiency reaching $(34.3\pm8.4)\%$, while retaining GHz-bandwidth operation and low noise levels. Numerical simulations predict that this approach can boost efficiencies in systems limited by atomic density, such as cold atomic ensembles, from $65\%$ to beyond $96\%$, while in warm atomic vapors it could reduce the laser intensity needed to reach a given efficiency by over an order-of-magnitude, exceeding $95\%$ total efficiency. Furthermore, our method preserves the single-mode nature of the memory at high efficiencies. This new protocol is applicable to various memory architectures, paving the way toward scalable, efficient, low-noise, and high-bandwidth quantum memories.</p>

Through a single tomography experiment, we infer all the relevant spin dynamics timescales, including precession, decoherence and relaxation times. We also demonstrate and quantify the measurement back-action induced, on the embedded spin qubit, by the detection of a single reflected photon. We show that the induced population and coherence of the spin state can be tuned by the chosen polarization basis of the measurement. The control of the photon-induced back-action on the embedded spin qubit constitutes a crucial requirement for the use of spin-photon interfaces as quantum receivers.</p>

            <p>High-precision optical frequency measurement is indispensable to modern science and technology, yet conventional spectroscopic techniques struggle to resolve sub-linewidth spectral features. We introduce a unique platform for super-resolving frequency estimation utilizing a mode-selective atomic Raman quantum memory implemented in warm cesium vapor. By precisely engineering the light matter interaction, our memory coherently stores the optimal temporal mode with high fidelity and retrieves it on-demand, realizing a mode crosstalk as low as 0.34%. To estimate the separation between two spectral lines, we experimentally measure the mean squared error of the frequency estimate, achieving a sensitivity of 1/20 of the linewidth with a ($34\pm4$)-fold enhancement in precision over direct intensity measurements. This enhanced frequency resolution, combined with the memory's on-demand storage, retrieval, and mode conversion capabilities, paves the way for multifunctional memory-based time-frequency sensors and their integration within quantum networks.</p>

            <h2>Symmetry enforces entanglement at high temperatures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amir-Reza Negari, Leonardo A. Lessa, Subhayan Sahu</p>
            <p>Many-body quantum systems with local interactions undergo "sudden death of entanglement" at high temperatures, whereby thermal states become classical mixtures of product states. We investigate whether symmetry constraints can prevent this phenomenon. We prove that strongly symmetric thermal states (canonical ensemble) of generic Hamiltonians with on-site Abelian symmetries remain entangled with non-zero entanglement negativity at arbitrarily high temperatures, under mild conditions on the symmetry actions and the charge sector of the strong symmetry. Our results extend to weakly symmetric thermal states (Gibbs ensemble) under superselection rules, which restrict state decompositions to be symmetric. In particular, we show that fermionic Gibbs states do not exhibit sudden death of entanglement and have persistent fermionic negativity at high temperatures. These findings demonstrate that global symmetry correlations can preserve quantum entanglement despite thermal decoherence, providing new insights into the interplay between symmetry and quantum information in thermal equilibrium.</p>

            <p>The potential of quantum computers to outperform classical ones in practically useful tasks remains challenging in the near term due to scaling limitations and high error rates of current quantum hardware. While quantum error correction (QEC) offers a clear path towards fault tolerance, overcoming the scalability issues will take time. Early applications will likely rely on QEC combined with quantum error mitigation (QEM). We introduce a QEM scheme against both compilation errors and logical-gate noise that is circuit-, QEC code-, and compiler-agnostic. The scheme builds on quasi-probability distribution methods and uses information about the circuit's gates' compilations to attain an unbiased estimation of noiseless expectation values incurring a constant sample-complexity overhead. Moreover, it features maximal circuit size and QEC code-distance both independent of the target precision, in contrast to strategies based on QEC alone. We formulate the mitigation procedure as a linear program, demonstrate its efficacy through numerical simulations, and illustrate it for estimating the Jones polynomials of knots. Our method significantly reduces quantum resource requirements for high-precision estimations, offering a practical route towards fault-tolerant quantum computation with precision-independent overheads.</p>

            <p>Device-independent (DI) certification allows the verification of quantum systems based solely on observed statistics, without assumptions about their internal structure. While self-testing, the strongest DI certification, of a wide range of quantum states and measurements is done, the self-testing of quantum operations remains underdeveloped.

For our purpose, we utilise the framework of quantum networks with multiple independent sources. Our work provides a fundamental step toward certifying quantum interactions directly from data, without detailed modelling assumptions. Moreover, the result also serves as a crucial ingredient for quantum computation, where verifying that quantum gates perform as intended is essential for building secure and reliable quantum processors.</p>

            <h2>Engineering Non-Gaussian Bosonic Gates through Quantum Signal Processing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pak-Tik Fong, Hoi-Kwan Lau</p>
            <p>Non-Gaussian operations are essential for most bosonic quantum technologies. Yet, realizable non-Gaussian gates are rather limited in type and generally suffer from accuracy-duration trade-offs. In this work, we propose to use quantum signal processing (QSP) techniques to engineer non-Gaussian gates on hybrid qumode-qubit systems. For systems with dispersive coupling, our scheme can generate a new non-Gaussian gate that produces a phase shift depending on the modulus of the boson number. This gate reproduces the selective number-dependent arbitrary phase (SNAP) gates under certain parameter choices, but with higher accuracy within a short, fixed and excitation-independent interaction time. The gate unlocks new applications, for example, in entangling logical qudits and deterministically generating multi-component cat states. Additionally, our versatile QSP formalism can be extended to systems with other interactions, and also engineer non-unitary operations, such as noiseless linear amplification and generalized-parity measurement.</p>

            <h2>Non-spatial symmetries in quantum nonlinear spectroscopy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Li Sun, Chong Chen, Ren-Bao Liu</p>
            <p>Nonlinear spectroscopy is a powerful approach to extracting information, in particular higher-order correlations of physical quantities. Quantum nonlinear spectroscopy (QNS) can access exponentially more types of correlations than its classical counterpart, since the responses to ``classical forces'' correspond to contour-time-ordered correlations (CTOCs) that involve only commutators, while in QNS ``quantum forces'' from a quantum sensor induce responses corresponding to CTOCs that involve both commutators and anti-commutators. Symmetries are important for constraining and analyzing nonlinear spectroscopy. Quantum and classical nonlinear spectroscopy have similar spatial symmetry properties. QNS, however, is expected to have its characteristic non-spatial symmetry properties since commutators and anti-commutators of physical quantities can behave differently under non-spatial transformations (such as exchange of operators). Here, we investigate how higher-order correlations extracted by QNS are constrained by non-spatial symmetries, including particle-hole (C), time-reversal (T), and their combination, i.e., chiral (S) symmetry. We find that the generalized C-symmetry imposes special selection rules on QNS, and the generalized T- and S-symmetry relate CTOCs to out-of-time-order correlations (OTOCs). This work discloses deep structures in higher-order quantum correlations due to non-spatial symmetries and provides access to certain types of OTOCs that are not directly observable.</p>

            <p>Lithium niobate (LN) microring resonators, characterized by an exceptionally high second-order nonlinear coefficient and superior electro-optic tunability, serve as an outstanding platform for the precise control of integrated quantum frequency combs (QFCs). In this study, we introduce a bipartite entanglement criterion to investigate the pairwise entanglement characteristics of QFCs generated via the spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) process in lithium niobate microring resonators operating below threshold. Furthermore, we propose a universal framework for analyzing multimode squeezing in quadratic frequency combs, enabling the realization of ultrabroadband and high-degree multimode squeezing. We further reveal the underlying physical mechanism: modulation instability (MI), regulated by temporal walk-off control, not only enables the formation of frequency combs but also induces multimode squeezing in the corresponding resonant modes. This study uncovers the previously unexplored role of on-chip multimode squeezing in quadratic frequency combs while facilitating collective noise suppression across multiple modes, thus holding substantial potential for advancing quantum precision measurement and quantum information processing.</p>

            <h2>Optimal Work Extraction from Finite-Time Closed Quantum Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shoki Sugimoto, Takahiro Sagawa, Ryusuke Hamazaki</p>
            <p>Extracting useful work from quantum systems is a fundamental problem in quantum thermodynamics. In scenarios where rapid protocols are desired -- whether due to practical constraints or deliberate design choices -- a fundamental trade-off between power and efficiency emerges as a key concern. Here, we investigate the problem of finite-time optimal work extraction from closed quantum systems, subject to a constraint on the magnitude of the control Hamiltonian. We first establish the trade-off relation between power and work under a general setup, stating that these fundamental performance metrics cannot be maximized simultaneously. Next, we introduce a framework of Lie-algebraic control, which involves a wide range of control problems including many-body control of the Heisenberg model and the SU(n)-Hubbard model. Within this framework, the optimal work extraction protocol becomes remarkably simple: it suffices to use a time-independent Hamiltonian, which is determined by a nonlinear self-consistent equation. We obtain an analytical solution for su(2) control, and a numerical solution for more complex cases like su(n) control using the steepest gradient descent method. Moreover, by exploiting the Lie-algebraic structure of the controllable terms, our approach is applicable to quantum many-body systems, enabling an efficient numerical computation. Our results highlight the necessity of rapid protocols to achieve the maximum power and establish a theoretical framework for designing optimal work extraction protocols under realistic time constraints.</p>

            <p>For decades, computational chemistry has been posited as one of the areas in which quantum computing would revolutionize. However, the algorithmic advantages that fault-tolerant quantum computers have for chemistry can be overwhelmed by other disadvantages, such as error correction, processor speed, etc. To assess when quantum computing will be disruptive to computational chemistry, we compare a wide range of classical methods to quantum computational methods by extending the framework proposed by Choi, Moses, and Thompson. Our approach accounts for the characteristics of classical and quantum algorithms, and hardware, both today and as they improve. We find that in many cases, classical computational chemistry methods will likely remain superior to quantum algorithms for at least the next couple of decades. Nevertheless, quantum computers are likely to make important contributions in two important areas. First, for simulations with tens or hundreds of atoms, highly accurate methods such as Full Configuration Interaction are likely to be surpassed by quantum phase estimation in the coming decade. Secondly, in cases where quantum phase estimation is most efficient less accurate methods like Couple Cluster and Moller-Plesset, could be surpassed in fifteen to twenty years if the technical advancements for quantum computers are favorable. Overall, we find that in the next decade or so, quantum computing will be most impactful for highly accurate computations with small to medium-sized molecules, whereas classical computers will likely remain the typical choice for calculations of larger molecules.</p>

            <p>The study of phase transitions and critical phenomena arising in quantum driven-dissipative systems, and whether a correspondence can be drawn to their equilibrium counterparts, is a pressing question in contemporary physics. The development of large-scale superconducting circuits provides an experimental platform for these theoretical models. We report an experimental study of a multi-mode dissipative first-order phase transition in a 1D Bose-Hubbard chain consisting of 21 superconducting resonators. This phase transition manifests itself as a simultaneous frequency jump in all resonator modes as the frequency or power of a pump tone is swept. By measuring the system's emission spectrum through the transition, we characterize the dim-to-bright phase transition and construct the full phase diagram. We further perform time-dependent measurements of the switching between the two phases in the transition region, from which we corroborate the transition line and extract transition times ranging from a few ms up to 143~s. Our model, based on single-mode mean-field theory and cross-Kerr interactions, captures the features at moderate pump powers and quantitatively reproduces the transition line. Our results open a new window into non-equilibrium quantum many-body physics and mark a step toward realizing and understanding dissipative phase transitions in the thermodynamic limit using superconducting quantum circuits.</p>

In addition to the well-known {\it scissor effect}-which effectively partitions the chain and isolates free MZMs in the bulk-we provide evidence of non-trivial fusion rules and braiding operations, hallmark signatures of non-Abelian anyons, enabled by spatially selective ultrastrong KC-cavity coupling. We propose that these distinctive MZM properties can be experimentally probed via fermionic parity measurements and photon-induced Berry phases. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, in the so-called sweet-spot regime, the coupled system can be mapped onto a Rabi-like model with a homodyne-rotated quadrature, offering a simplified yet powerful theoretical description. Exploiting the symmetry of fermionic modes within a two-site cavity configuration, we also show the feasibility of generating hybrid MZM-polariton Schrödinger cat states. Our findings offer a novel approach to manipulating topological quantum matter through local light-matter interactions and provide theoretical tools for future experimental realizations in platforms such as quantum materials or superconducting circuits.</p>

            <p>We investigate spectral singularities in an alkali-metal atomic vapor modeled using four and effectively three hyperfine states. By comparing the eigenvalue spectra of a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian (NHH) and a Liouvillian superoperator, we analyze the emergence and characteristics of both semiclassical and quantum exceptional points. Our results reveal that, for atomic systems, the NHH approach alone may be insufficient to fully capture the system's spectral properties. While NHHs can yield accurate predictions in certain regimes, a comprehensive description typically requires the Liouvillian formalism, which governs the Lindblad master equation and explicitly incorporates quantum jump processes responsible for repopulation dynamics. We demonstrate that the inclusion of quantum jumps fundamentally alters the spectral structure of the system. In particular, we present examples in which the existence, location in parameter space, or even the order of spectral degeneracies differ significantly between the two approaches, thereby highlighting the impact of quantum jumps and the limitations of the NHH method. Finally, using the hybrid-Liouvillian formalism, we show how quantum jumps reshape spectral features initially predicted by the NHH, ultimately determining the full Liouvillian spectrum.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Torin Stetina, Nathan Wiebe</p>
            <p>We provide a simulation algorithm that properly addresses light matter interaction between non-relativistic first-quantized charged particles and quantum electromagnetic fields. Unlike previous work, our Hamiltonian does not include an explicit Coulomb interaction between particles. Rather, the Coulomb interaction emerges from the imposition of Gauss' law as a constraint upon the system in an appropriate non-relativistic limit. Furthermore, a form of topological protection emerges in our formalism, analogous to that of the Toric code Hamiltonian. This mechanism prevents simulation-induced electric field errors that can be contracted to a point from causing any deviations from Coulomb's law in the non-relativistic limit and any error that forms a non-contractable loop is energetically dissallowed in the limit of large volume. We find that, under appropriate continuity assumptions, the number of non-Clifford gates required by our algorithm scales in the thermodynamic limit as $\widetilde{O}(N^{2/3}\eta^{4/3} t \log^5(1/\epsilon))$ for $\eta$ particles, $N$ spatial grid points, simulation time $t$ and error tolerance $\epsilon$. In comparison, the more specific problem of simulating the Coulomb interaction scales as $\widetilde{O}(N^{1/3} \eta^{8/3} t \log^2(1/\epsilon))$. This suggests that if $N \in \tilde{o}(\eta^4)$ that our non-relativistic electrodynamic simulation method could provide a computational advantage for electronic structure problems in the thermodynamic limit under appropriate continuity assumptions as it obviates the need to compute the $O(\eta^2)$ pairwise interactions in the Coulomb Hamiltonian.</p>

The time-dependent Jaynes-Cummings (TDJC) model introduces temporal variations in certain parameters, which often require numerical methods. However, under the resonance condition, exact solutions can be obtained, offering insight into a variety of physical scenarios. In this work, we study the resonant TDJC model considering different modulations of the atom-field coupling. The model is presented and an analytical solution derived in a didactic way, allowing us to examine how time-dependent couplings affect atomic population inversion and atom-field entanglement. We also consider an atom traversing a partially cooled cavity, which induces periodicity and reveals the combined effects of atomic motion and thermal fluctuations. The Bloch vector is used to analyze the dynamics of the system, including the atomic state purity, and reveals phenomena such as atomic dipole alignment with the field due to the oscillating coupling, as well as atomic population trapping, which arises by increasing the initial mean thermal photon number.</p>

            <p>Quantum networks, capable of transmitting arbitrary quantum states, provide a foundation for a wide range of quantum applications, including distributed quantum computing, distributed quantum sensing, and quantum communication. Photons are the natural carrier of information in quantum networks, but the exponential loss of optical fiber channels prevents the construction of large-scale quantum networks. A potential solution is implementing quantum repeaters based on quantum memories, which can efficiently establish long-distance entanglement from short-distance entanglement. In the past decades, intense efforts have been devoted to constructing large-scale quantum networks based on various atomic quantum memories. In this Perspective, we present a concise overview of current advancements in remote quantum networks, elucidate the imminent challenges that must be addressed, and discuss the future directions.</p>

            <p>Integrated photonic quantum memories are essential components for scalable quantum networks and photonic information processors. However, prior implementations have been confined to single-channel operation, limiting their capacity to manipulate multiple photonic pulses and support high-dimensional information. In this work, we introduce an 11-channel integrated quantum memory based on laser-written waveguide arrays in $^{151}$Eu$^{3+}$:Y$_2$SiO$_5$ crystals. On-chip electrode arrays enable independent control over the readout times for each channel via Stark-shift-induced atomic interference. Our device achieves random-access quantum storage of three time-bin qubits with a fidelity exceeding 99%, as well as storage of five-dimensional path-encoded quantum states with a fidelity above 96%. This multichannel integrated storage device enables versatile applications through its random access capability and lays a solid foundation for the development of high-dimensional quantum networks in integrated architectures.</p>

            <h2>Near-Ultimate Quantum-Enhanced Sensitivity in Dissipative Critical Sensing with Partial Access</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dingwei Zhao, Abolfazl Bayat, Victor Montenegro</p>
            <p>Quantum sensors are powerful devices that exploit quantum effects to detect minute quantities with extremely high precision. Two obstacles to harnessing the full capacity of quantum probes are the resource-intensive preparation of the probe and the need for sophisticated measurements that typically require full access to the entire probe. Here, we address these challenges by investigating the driven Jaynes-Cummings system undergoing a dissipative quantum phase transition as a quantum sensor. We show that detuning the system off resonance significantly improves sensing performance by adequately selecting a preferred bistable state in phase space. Our dissipative sensor, independent of the initial probe preparation, exhibits a super-linear enhancement in sensitivity with respect to a specific sensing resource -- the strong-coupling regime ratio -- which manifests in both the full system and partial subsystem. Hence, quantum-enhanced sensitivity persists even when only partial system accessibility is available. Remarkably, we show that a homodyne detection of the field state, combined with Bayesian estimation, nearly saturates the ultimate sensitivity limit of the entire system.</p>

            <h2>Selective Preparation of Collective States in Coupled Quantum Emitters Using the SUPER Excitation Scheme</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Johannes Kerber, Laurin Ostermann, Vikas Remesh, Helmut Ritsch, Arpita Pal</p>
            <p>The efficient preparation of collective eigenstates of subwavelength-spaced optical dipoles is a prerequisite for observing their signature radiative properties and for their applications in quantum information processing. We theoretically investigate the deterministic preparation of superradiant and subradiant states of two dipole-coupled two-level quantum emitters at deep-subwavelength separation using the Swing-UP of Quantum Emitter Population (SUPER) excitation scheme. Utilizing suitable pulse parameters for two red-detuned, time-overlapping Gaussian pulses, the SUPER scheme enables close-to-unity population inversion in the targeted collective eigenstates. Furthermore, a tunable optical phase in the SUPER scheme enables the simultaneous inversions in both pure super- and subradiant states with finite populations, thereby resulting in the preparation of hybrid collective states. These results are possible to realize with or without an optical cavity. Our approach to populating the collective eigenstates in a cavity environment paves the way for the efficient preparation of these states in the presence of environmental decoherence. Our scheme enables single-photon generation, which is measured using the second-order correlation function. We also discuss in detail possible experimental realizations, in particular using solid-state emitters and molecules.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu. S. Barash</p>
            <p>A theory is proposed for the component of the Casimir-like force that arises between bodies embedded in a macroscopic quantum damped oscillator. When the oscillator's parameters depend on the distance between the bodies, the oscillator-induced Casimir-like force is generally determined by a broad spectral range extending to high frequencies, limited by the frequency dispersion of the damping function. Here it is shown that there is a large class of systems in which the low-frequency range dominates the forces. This allows for the use of the Ohmic approximation, which is crucial for extending the theory to the lumped element description of fluctuation-induced forces in electrical circuits. Estimates of the circuit-induced Casimir-Lifshitz force suggest that under certain conditions it can be identified experimentally due to its dependence on various circuit elements.</p>

            <p>In this work, we develop an optimal control theory on open quantum system and its environment, and exemplify the method with the application to the non-Condon photo-induced electron transfer (PET) in condensed phase. This method utilizes the dissipaton theory, proposed by Yan in 2014 for open quantum systems, which provides an exact description of the dissipative system while also enables rigorous characterization and control of environmental hybridization modes, fully taking into account the non-perturbative and non-Markovian effects. Leveraging the advantage of the dissipaton phase-space algebra, we present in this communication the theoretical strategy for optimal control on both system and environment simultaneously. The control protocol is successfully demonstrated on PET for the environment-targeted-control facilitated transfer. This work sheds the light on manipulating open systems dynamics via polarized environment.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michael Reitz, Stephan van den Wildenberg, Arghadip Koner, George C. Schatz, Joel Yuen-Zhou</p>
            <p>The collective interactions of nanoparticles arranged in periodic structures give rise to high-$Q$ in-plane diffractive modes known as surface lattice resonances (SLRs). While these resonances and their broader implications have been extensively studied within the framework of classical electrodynamics and linear response theory, a quantum optical theory capable of describing the dynamics of these structures, especially in the presence of material nonlinearities, beyond the use of \textit{ad hoc} few-mode approximations is largely missing. To this end, we consider here a lattice of metallic nanoparticles coupled to the background electromagnetic field and derive the quantum input-output relations within the electric dipole approximation. As a first application, we discuss coupling of the nanoparticle array to an external array of emitters and illustrate how the formalism can be extended to molecular optomechanics. Specifically, we show how the high $Q$-factors provided by SLRs can facilitate coupling between the nanoparticle array and collective vibrational modes. Finally, we examine a scenario in which the metallic nanoparticles themselves are replaced with saturable excitonic emitters, illustrating how the nonlinearity of the emitters can be used to switch the SLR condition between different electronic transitions. We further show, using a perturbative approach that explicitly accounts for population dynamics, how the resulting switching dynamics can be observed and characterized in pump-probe experiments. Our work provides a seamless framework to rigorously model SLR phenomena with quantum emitters without resorting to phenomenological treatments of either the electromagnetic environment or the material degrees of freedom.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anwei Zhang, C. M. Wang</p>
            <p>In recent years, the investigation of nonlinear electromagnetic responses has received significant attention due to its potential for elucidating the quantum properties of matter. Although remarkable progress has been achieved in developing quantum theories of nonlinear responses to electric field, a comprehensive quantum theory framework that systematically addresses nonlinear responses to both electric and magnetic fields has yet to be thoroughly discussed. Here, we present a systematic quantum theory of nonlinear electromagnetic response using the Matsubara Green's function approach, which explicitly incorporates the wave vector dependence of external electromagnetic fields. We provide diagrammatic representation and reveal the general properties of transport coefficients. We apply our theory to second-order responses, deriving the nonlinear Hall effects and magneto-nonlinear Hall effects in both time-reversal symmetric and time-reversal breaking systems. These effects stem from diverse quantum geometric quantities. Additionally, we analyze the contributions arising from the Zeeman interaction. Our work presents a unified quantum theory of nonlinear electromagnetic response, paving the way for further exploration of novel phenomena in this field.</p>

            <h2>Gain-Assisted and Dynamically Controlled Optical Bistability for Quantum Logic Gate Applications</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Parkhi Bhardwaj, Poonam Yadav, Bodhaditya Santra, Shubhrangshu Dasgupta</p>
            <p>The propagation of a probe field in an N-type four level cold atomic system is investigated under the influence of multiple coherent fields. Coherent control of quantum interference enables switching of the probe field between transparency and gain regimes. Subsequent analysis focuses on how the introduction of gain in the probe transition lowers the threshold for optical bistability, thereby enhancing the nonlinear response of the system at reduced input intensities. A detailed analysis of optical bistability is presented, focusing on its threshold, stability, and switching efficiency as functions of field strengths and detunings. Structured light beams, specifically Laguerre Gaussian modes carrying orbital angular momentum, are employed to tailor the bistable characteristics. The impact of Orbital angular momentum through the topological charge and azimuthal phase is shown to significantly influence the bistable behavior. Based on these features, a theoretical scheme is proposed to realize a Controlled-NOT gate via dynamic modulation of bistability. These results highlight the potential of integrating nonlinear optical effects with structured light in cold atomic systems for implementing scalable quantum logic and advancing photonic information processing.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Markovian master equation in the high-temperature limit</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ricardo C. Zamar, J. Agustín Taboada</p>
            <p>We present a critical derivation of the high-temperature quantum Markovian master equation (HTME), examining its foundational assumptions, their quantum-mechanical implications, and its range of validity. Starting from the Born-Markov master equation, and combining the spin Hamiltonian eigenoperator formalism with a linear expansion in statistical coefficients, as the only assumption, we obtain a quantum dissipator that generalizes the Abragam-Redfield-Hubbard inhomogeneous master equation (ARH-IME). Our derivation naturally incorporates an additional term for non-thermal, high-order initial states, while reducing to ARH-IME for spin states evolving near thermal equilibrium (weak-order). Through an alternative operator-based derivation of the HTME, we confirm these results and reveal a symmetrization condition for the spectral densities in the linear thermal regime. We rigorously analyze the internal consistency of both approaches and compare them with prior literature. To illustrate these findings, we study: (i) A canonical spin-1/2 system interacting with a bosonic bath, demonstrating first-principles symmetrization of spectral densities at high temperatures. (ii) Singlet-triplet conversion in a correlated two-spin system, where the ARH-IME fails, exposing the limitations of the weak-order hypothesis in strongly correlated regimes. Our results challenge the traditional boundaries of NMR spin-lattice relaxation theory and provide a refined framework for modeling open quantum systems beyond weak order.</p>

            <p>We present a novel approach to chiral discrimination using gate-based quantum processors, addressing a key challenge in adapting conventional control techniques using modern quantum computing. Schemes such as stimulated rapid adiabatic passage (STIRAP) and shortcuts to adiabaticity (STAP) have shown strong potential for enantiomer discrimination; their reliance on analog and continuous-time control makes them incompatible with digital gate-based quantum computing architectures. Here, we adapt these protocols for quantum computers by discretizing their Gaussian-shaped pulses through Trotterization. We simulate the chiral molecule 1,2-propanediol and experimentally validate this gate-based implementation on IBM quantum hardware. Our results demonstrate that this approach is a viable foundation for advancing chiral discrimination protocols, preparing the way for quantum-level manipulation of molecular chirality on accessible quantum architectures.</p>

The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, first introduced in the context of polyacetylene, provides a paradigmatic example of a system exhibiting topological and non-topological phases. We explore the transmission of one and two excitations in anisotropic Heisenberg SSH spin chains and analyze the relationship between topological properties and state transfer efficiency. We examine the robustness of quantum state transmission against static disorder in the trivial and topological regimes, exploring how topological protection influences transmission fidelity. We also consider the effect of dipolar interactions, introducing long-range couplings and breaking the conservation of total magnetization. Furthermore, we employ optimal control theory to design driving pulses for state transmission, finding substantial differences between optimizing in the trivial and topological regimes. Our results provide insights about the interplay between topology, disorder, interactions, and control strategies in quantum state transfer.</p>

            <p>Faithfully simulating the dynamics of open quantum systems requires efficiently addressing the challenge of an infinite Hilbert space. Inspired by the shifted boson operator technique used in ground-state studies of the spin-boson model (SBM), we develop a novel algorithm that integrates a shifted optimized boson basis with the time-evolving block decimation method. We validate our approach by accurately reproducing the polarization dynamics of the sub-Ohmic SBM at a significantly reduced computational cost. For the Ohmic SBM, we demonstrate that the time-evolved final state converges precisely to the variational prediction at both zero and finite temperatures. Furthermore, our method reveals a new aperiodic pseudocoherent phase in the super-Ohmic SBM with an initially polarized bath. This work establishes an efficient and powerful approach for simulating the real-time dynamics of open quantum systems.</p>

            <p>The emerging hard X-ray - nuclear interfaces offer unique potential advantages over traditional optical-atomic interfaces for room-temperature, solid-state quantum information processing, including lower background noise, tighter focusing, and exceptionally high resonance quality. Leveraging such interfaces, a major milestone was recently achieved with the first implementation of nuclear quantum memory in the hard X-ray range [S. Velten et al., Nuclear quantum memory for hard X-ray photon wave packets, Sci. Adv. 10, eadn9825 (2024)] using the Doppler frequency comb protocol. However, this approach relies on the synchronous mechanical motion of multiple nuclear absorbers, posing experimental challenges for on-demand photon retrieval. We propose an on-demand hard X-ray quantum memory based on reversing the direction of an external magnetic field in a single stationary solid-state nuclear absorber with sets of Zeeman sublevels. This scheme is exemplified by the quantum storage of an 1.41-$\mu$s single photon wave packet at 6.2 keV for over 10 $\mu$s in a $^{181}$Ta metallic foil, providing a feasible pathway for the first experimental demonstration of on-demand hard X-ray photon storage.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zijun Wei, Mingdi Xu, Xiang-Ping Jiang, Lei Pan</p>
            <p>The Quantum Mpemba Effect (QME) is the quantum counterpart of the classical Mpemba effect--a counterintuitive phenomenon in which a system initially at a higher temperature relax to thermal eauilibrium faster than one at a lower temperature. In this work, we investigate the QME in one-dimensional quantum spin chains coupled to a Markovian environment. By analyzing the full relaxation dynamics governed by the Lindblad master equation, we reveal the emergence of a strong quantum Mpemba effect at quantum critical points. Our findings reveal that criticality enhances the non-monotonic dependence of relaxation times on the initial temperature, leading to anomalously accelerated equilibration. This phenomenon is directly linked to the structure of the Liouvillian spectrum at criticality and the associated overlaps with the initial states. These findings demonstrate that quantum phase transitions could provide a natural setting for realizing and enhancing non-equilibrium phenomena in open quantum systems.</p>

For uniform coupling along the line, we show that the ergotropy of the battery, evaluated at the point of maximum power transfer, decreases with the length of the charging line and vanishes beyond a critical size. By carefully engineering the initial state of the charger, nonzero ergotropy can still be harvested even beyond this critical length. We further examine scenarios in which the charging line is initialized in an entangled state, as well as configurations with nonuniform, parabolically varying coupling strengths. In the latter case, we demonstrate that high ergotropy values can be restored, highlighting the potential of spatially engineered interactions to enhance quantum battery performance.</p>

            <p>Twisted light (TL), a special kind of light carrying orbital angular momentum, provides a powerful tool for driving symmetry resolved transitions in quantum confined nanostructures. We study a realistic model where a TL pulse excites two interacting electrons in a nanostructure under a perpendicular magnetic field. To include image charge effects in layered systems, we use an effective electron electron potential of the form 1/r^n. For n = 2, the system exhibits an underlying su(1,1) dynamical symmetry, enabling analytical solutions and a clear interpretation of selection rules, parity changes, and angular momentum resolved absorption. We show that the bare Coulomb 1/r interaction produces similar spectra, indicating that twisted light driven excitations are robust against the precise interaction form. The excitation spectrum reveals strong chiral properties: TL pulses, unlike conventional dipolar fields, directly access interaction-driven transitions otherwise symmetry-forbidden. In particular, TL breaks the generalized Kohn theorem, exposing internal excitations through multi quanta orbital processes. More broadly, our results establish TL as a sensitive probe of correlations, symmetry, and magneto-optical dynamics in strongly interacting quantum systems, uncovering features that remain invisible to standard infrared absorption.</p>

            <p>In the pursuit of robust quantum computing, we put forth a platform based on photonic qubits in a circuit-QED environment. Specifically, we propose a versatile two-qubit gate based on two cavities coupled via a transmon, constituting a selective number-dependent phase gate operating on the in-phase eigenmodes of the two cavities, the Eigen-SNAP gate. This gate natively operates in the dispersive coupling regime of the cavities and the transmon, and operates by driving the transmon externally, to imprint desired phases on the number states. As an example for the utility of the Eigen-SNAP gate, we implement a $\sqrt{\text{SWAP}}$ gate on a system of two logical bosonic qubits encoded in the cavities. Further, we use numerical optimization to determine the optimal implementation of the $\sqrt{\text{SWAP}}$. We find that the fidelities of these optimal protocols are only limited by the coherence times of the system's components. These findings pave the way to continuous variable quantum computing in cavity-transmon systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S. Bayati, M.H. Naderi</p>
            <p>In this paper, we propose and explore an experimentally viable scheme to realize tunable optomechanically induced transparency (OMIT) and optomechanically induced absorption (OMIA) phenomena in a hybrid microwave-optomechanical circuit in which two single-Cooper-pair transistors (SCPTs) are coupled to a common microwave $LC$ resonator and two independent micromechanical resonators. We show that under special conditions such a system can be equivalently modeled as a two-mechanical-modes optomechanical cavity in which, besides the standard radiation-pressure coupling, the cavity mode interacts with the mechanical modes through the cross-Kerr (CK), a higher-order generalized CK, and a three-mode CK type of coupling. Furthermore, there is an induced CK coupling between the two-mechanical modes. Assuming that the cavity mode is simultaneously driven by a strong control field and a weak probe field, we analyze the response of the output probe field affected by the above-mentioned nonlinear couplings. In particular, our results reveal that the higher-order nonlinear CK and the three-mode CK couplings have remarkable impact on the characteristics of the OMIT and OMIA phenomena. Moreover, we find that these nonlinear couplings can give rise to the occurrence of the gain in the absorption profile and contribute to the amplification of the output probe field in specific frequency regions. We also show that the system offers tunable switching between slow and fast light behaviors. The proposed hybrid optomechanical circuit may find potential applications in light propagation, quantum sensing of physical quantities, and information processing.</p>

            <p>Accurately computing the free energies of biological processes is a cornerstone of computer-aided drug design but it is a daunting task. The need to sample vast conformational spaces and account for entropic contributions makes the estimation of binding free energies very expensive. While classical methods, such as thermodynamic integration and alchemical free energy calculations, have significantly contributed to reducing computational costs, they still face limitations in terms of efficiency and scalability. We tackle this through a quantum algorithm for the estimation of free energy differences by adapting the existing Liouvillian approach and introducing several key algorithmic improvements. We directly implement the Liouvillian operator and provide an efficient description of electronic forces acting on both nuclear and electronic particles on the quantum ground state potential energy surface. This leads to super-polynomial runtime scaling improvements in the precision of our Liouvillian simulation approach and quadratic improvements in the scaling with the number of particles. Second, our algorithm calculates free energy differences via a fully quantum implementation of thermodynamic integration and alchemy, thereby foregoing expensive entropy estimation subroutines used in prior works. Our results open new avenues towards the application of quantum computers in drug discovery.</p>

We investigate a galvanically connected direct-current superconducting quantum interference device (dc SQUID) as a minimal tunable coupling element for fluxonium qubits. Comparing grounded and floating fluxonium designs, we find that the latter contains an extra sloshing mode that strongly hybridizes with the qubit modes, leading to significant static ZZ crosstalk. In contrast, the grounded design avoids this issue and allows suppression of static ZZ crosstalk using a shunting capacitor. Leveraging fast flux control, we present two schemes to implement two-qubit gates, predicting a $\sqrt{i\text{SWAP}}$-like gate with $99.9\%$ open-system fidelity in less than 6 nanoseconds assuming modest relaxation and dephasing rates.</p>

This range is well-aligned to the operational frequencies of highly coherent micro- and nano-mechanical resonators, making fluxonium an at- tractive candidate for hybrid electromechanical systems. In this work, we theoretically investigate a flux-tunable electromechanical system consisting of a fluxonium qubit coupled to a suspended mechanical resonator. The coupling arises from the motion-induced modulation of magnetic flux through the fluxonium loop, enabling both transverse and longitudinal electromechanical interac- tions that are tunable via external magnetic fields. By optimizing the design parameters of the fluxonium qubit, we demonstrate the feasibility of achieving strong resonant single-photon coupling near the flux-frustration point. We analyze the system dynamics across different coupling regimes, identifying signatures of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in the longitudinal regime and mode splitting in the transverse regime. Additionally, we show that ground-state preparation of both subsystems is possible through sideband cooling of the mechanical resonator. These results suggest that a fluxonium-based hybrid electromechanical device could be a promising platform for studying macroscopic quantum phenomena and for applications in quantum technology.</p>

Previous work has shown that two giant atoms in a braided configuration can interact through a one-dimensional infinite waveguide, with both individual and collective atomic relaxation being fully suppressed. In this paper, however, we show that the decoherence-free interaction (DFI) between two giant atoms can be realized in both braided and nested configurations when the waveguide is semi-infinite. This protected interaction fails to appear in semi-infinite waveguide systems containing two separate giant atoms or two small atoms. We also study the entanglement generation between two giant atoms coupled to a one-dimensional semi-infinite waveguide. The results show that the maximally entangled state is generated in both braided and nested configurations due to the formation of DFI, and in the separate configuration, the maximally achievable entanglement can exceed 0.5. This study presents a new scheme for realizing DFI and generating maximally entangled states in giant-atom waveguide-QED systems.</p>

            <h2>Harnessing the edge of chaos for combinatorial optimization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hayato Goto, Ryo Hidaka, Kosuke Tatsumura</p>
            <p>Nonlinear dynamical systems with continuous variables can be used for solving combinatorial optimization problems with discrete this http URL particular, numerical simulations of them can be used as heuristic algorithms with a desirable property, namely, parallelizability, which allows us to execute them in a massively parallel manner using cutting-edge many-core processors, leading to ultrafast performance. However, the dynamical-system approaches with continuous variables are usually less accurate than conventional approaches with discrete variables such as simulated annealing. To improve the solution accuracy of a representative dynamical system-based algorithm called simulated bifurcation (SB), which was found from classical simulation of a quantum nonlinear oscillator network exhibiting quantum bifurcation, here we generalize it by introducing nonlinear control of individual bifurcation parameters and show that the generalized SB (GSB) can achieve almost 100% success probabilities for some large-scale problems. As a result, the time to solution for a 2,000-variable problem is shortened to 10 ms by a GSB-based machine, which is two orders of magnitude shorter than the best known value, 1.3 s, previously obtained by an SB-based machine. To examine the reason for the ultrahigh performance, we investigated chaos in the GSB changing the nonlinear-control strength and found that the dramatic increase of success probabilities happens near the edge of chaos. That is, the GSB can find a solution with high probability by harnessing the edge of chaos. This finding suggests that dynamical-system approaches to combinatorial optimization will be enhanced by harnessing the edge of chaos, opening a broad possibility to tackle intractable combinatorial optimization problems by nature-inspired approaches.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement Detection with Quantum-inspired Kernels and SVMs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ana Martínez-Sabiote, Michalis Skotiniotis, Jara J. Bermejo-Vega, Daniel Manzano, Carlos Cano</p>
            <p>This work presents a machine learning approach based on support vector machines (SVMs) for quantum entanglement detection. Particularly, we focus in bipartite systems of dimensions 3x3, 4x4, and 5x5, where the positive partial transpose criterion (PPT) provides only partial characterization. Using SVMs with quantum-inspired kernels we develop a classification scheme that distinguishes between separable states, PPT-detectable entangled states, and entangled states that evade PPT detection. Our method achieves increasing accuracy with system dimension, reaching 80%, 90%, and nearly 100% for 3x3, 4x4, and 5x5 systems, respectively. Our results show that principal component analysis significantly enhances performance for small training sets. The study reveals important practical considerations regarding purity biases in the generation of data for this problem and examines the challenges of implementing these techniques on near-term quantum hardware. Our results establish machine learning as a powerful complement to traditional entanglement detection methods, particularly for higher-dimensional systems where conventional approaches become inadequate. The findings highlight key directions for future research, including hybrid quantum-classical implementations and improved data generation protocols to overcome current limitations.</p>

            <h2>Polarization-dependent chiral transport and chiral solitons in spin Kitaev models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chenwei Lv, Thomas Bilitewski, Ana Maria Rey, Qi Zhou</p>
            <p>Recent advances in synthetic quantum matter allow researchers to design quantum models inaccessible in traditional materials. Here, we propose protocols to engineer a new class of quantum spin models, which we call spin Kitaev models. The building blocks are basic spin-exchange interactions combined with locally selective Floquet pulses, a capability recently demonstrated in a range of experimental platforms. The resulting flip-flip and flop-flop terms lead to intriguing quantum transport dynamics beyond conventional spin models. For instance, in the absence of a magnetic field, spin excitations polarized along the $x$ and $y$ axes propagate chirally in opposite directions, producing polarization-dependent spin transport. In the large-spin limit, the spin Kitaev model maps to a nonlinear Hatano-Nelson model, where the interplay of nonlinearity and the underlying curvature yields polarization-dependent chiral solitons. A magnetic field binds two oppositely polarized chiral solitons into a chiral solitonic molecule, whose travel direction depends on its orientation. Our results, directly accessible in current experiments, open new opportunities for simulating transport in curved spaces and for applications in spintronics, information processing, and quantum sensing.</p>

            <p>The creation of large-scale, high-fidelity quantum computers is not only a fundamental scientific endeavour in itself, but also provides increasingly robust proofs of quantum computational advantage (QCA) in the presence of unavoidable noise and the dynamic competition with classical algorithm improvements. To overcome the biggest challenge of photon-based QCA experiments, photon loss, we report new Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) experiments with 1024 high-efficiency squeezed states injected into a hybrid spatial-temporal encoded, 8176-mode, programmable photonic quantum processor, Jiuzhang 4.0, which produces up to 3050 photon detection events. Our experimental results outperform all classical spoofing algorithms, particularly the matrix product state (MPS) method, which was recently proposed to utilise photon loss to reduce the classical simulation complexity of GBS. Using the state-of-the-art MPS algorithm on the most powerful supercomputer EI Capitan, it would take > $10^{42}$ years to construct the required tensor network for simulation, while our Jiuzhang 4.0 quantum computer takes 25.6 $\mu$s to produce a sample. This work establishes a new frontier of QCA and paves the way to fault-tolerant photonic quantum computing hardware.</p>

By incorporating the probability of null-entropy events, we obtain tighter bounds on finite-time thermodynamic uncertainty relations derived from fluctuation theorems.

            <p>Manipulating the frequency and bandwidth of light is crucial in classical and quantum applications including communication, spectroscopy, imaging, and signal processing. Such capabilities also offer potential for interfacing disparate quantum systems in quantum networking and for quantum information processing. We experimentally demonstrate deterministic, broadband frequency control of heralded telecom-band single photons via cross-phase modulation in a short length of single-mode fiber. An intense, ultrafast pump pulse imposes a transient, intensity-dependent refractive-index gradient which imparts a tunable phase shift on the single photons. We present absolute frequency shifts of up to $+6.46\pm0.01$\,THz and $-5.74\pm0.01$\,THz, and bandwidth manipulation ranging from a factor of $0.66\pm0.03$ to $8.4\pm0.3$ times that of the input. Spectral measurements are acquired with a time-of-flight spectrometer and superconducting nanowire detectors.

            <h2>Learning measurement-induced phase transitions using attention</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hyejin Kim, Abhishek Kumar, Yiqing Zhou, Yichen Xu, Romain Vasseur, Eun-Ah Kim</p>
            <p>Measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPTs) epitomize new intellectual pursuits inspired by the advent of quantum hardware and the emergence of discrete and programmable circuit dynamics. Nevertheless, experimentally observing this transition is challenging, often requiring non-scalable protocols, such as post-selecting measurement trajectories or relying on classical simulations. We introduce a scalable data-centric approach using Quantum Attention Networks (QuAN) to detect MIPTs without requiring post-selection or classical simulation. Applying QuAN to dynamics generated by Haar random unitaries and weak measurements, we first demonstrate that it can pinpoint MIPTs using their interpretation as "learnability" transitions, where it becomes possible to distinguish two different initial states from the measurement record, locating a phase boundary consistent with exact results. Motivated by sample efficiency, we consider an alternative "phase recognition" task-classifying weak- and strong-monitoring data generated from a single initial state. We find QuAN can provide an efficient and noise-tolerant upper bound on the MIPT based on measurement data alone by coupling Born-distribution-level (inter-trajectory) and dynamical (temporal) attention. In particular, our inspection of the inter-trajectory scores of the model trained with minimal sample size processing test data confirmed that QuAN paid special attention to the tail of the distribution of the Born probabilities at early times. This reassuring interpretation of QuAN's learning implies the phase-recognition approach can meaningfully signal MIPT in an experimentally accessible manner. Our results lay the groundwork for observing MIPT on near-term quantum hardware and highlight attention-based architectures as powerful tools for learning complex quantum dynamics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco Calcagno, Delmar G. A. Cabral, Ivan Rivalta, Victor S. Batista</p>
            <p>Designing molecules with optimized properties remains a fundamental challenge due to the intricate relationship between molecular structure and properties. Traditional computational approaches that address the combinatorial number of possible molecular designs become unfeasible as the molecular size increases, suffering from the so-called `curse of dimensionality' problem. Recent advances in quantum computing hardware present new opportunities to address this problem. Here, we introduce the Quantum Ensemble Variational Optimization (QEVO) method for near-term and early fault-tolerant quantum computing platforms. QEVO efficiently maps molecular structures onto an orthonormal basis of Pauli strings and samples from a superposition state generated by a variational ansatz. The ansatz is iteratively optimized to identify molecular candidates with the desired property. Our numerical simulations demonstrate the potential of QEVO in designing drug-like molecules with anticancer properties, employing a shallow quantum circuit that requires only a modest number of qubits. We envision that QEVO could be applied to a wide range of complex problems, offering practical solutions to problems with combinatorial complexity.</p>

            <p>The dynamic structure factor (DSF) is a central quantity for interpreting a vast array of inelastic scattering experiments in chemistry and materials science, but its accurate simulation is a considerable challenge for classical computational methods. In this work, we present a quantum algorithm and an end-to-end simulation framework to compute the DSF, providing a general approach for simulating momentum-resolved spectroscopies. We apply this approach to the simulation of electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) in the core-level electronic excitation regime, a spectroscopic technique offering sub-nanometer spatial resolution and capable of resolving element-specific information, crucial for analyzing battery materials. We derive a quantum algorithm for computing the DSF for EELS by evaluating the off-diagonal terms of the time-domain Green's function, enabling the simulation of momentum-resolved spectroscopies. To showcase the algorithm, we study the oxygen K-edge EELS spectrum of lithium manganese oxide ($Li_2MnO_3$), a prototypical cathode material for investigating the mechanisms of oxygen redox in battery materials. For a representative model of an oxygen-centered cluster of $Li_2MnO_3$ with an active space of 18 active orbitals, the algorithm requires a circuit depth of $3.25\times10^{8}$ T gates, 100 logical qubits, and roughly $10^4$ shots.</p>

            <p>Designing multi-qubit quantum logic gates with experimental constraints is an important problem in quantum computing. Here, we develop a new quantum optimal control algorithm for finding unitary transformations with constraints on the Hamiltonian. The algorithm, geodesic pulse engineering (GEOPE), uses differential programming and geodesics on the Riemannian manifold of $\textrm{SU}(2^n)$ for $n$ qubits. We demonstrate significant improvements over the widely used gradient-based method, GRAPE, for designing multi-qubit quantum gates. Instead of a local gradient descent, the parameter updates of GEOPE are designed to follow the geodesic to the target unitary as closely as possible. We present numerical results that show that our algorithm converges significantly faster than GRAPE for a range of gates and can find solutions that are not accessible to GRAPE in a reasonable amount of time. The strength of the method is illustrtated with varied multi-qubit gates in 2D neutral Rydberg atom platforms.</p>

            <h2>Dissipation-Driven Topological Phase Transition in Quantum Open Systems Independent of system Hamiltonian</h2>

            <p>We investigate dissipation-driven topological phase transitions in one-dimensional quantum open systems governed by the Lindblad equation with linear dissipation operators, which ensure the density matrix retains its Gaussian form throughout the dynamics. By employing the modular Hamiltonian framework, we rigorously demonstrate that the $\rm{Z}_2$ topological invariant characterizing steady states in one-dimensional class D systems is exclusively dependent on the dissipation operators, rather than the system Hamiltonian. Through a quench protocol where the system evolves from the steady state of one Lindbladian to another, we reveal that topological transitions can occur at analytically predictable critical times, even when the initial and final steady states share identical topological indices. These transitions are shown, both theoretically and numerically, to depend solely on dissipation parameters. Entanglement spectrum analysis demonstrates bulk-edge correspondence in non-equilibrium density matrices via coexisting single-particle gap closures (periodic boundaries) and topologically protected zero modes (open boundaries), directly underpinning the detection of dissipation-induced topology in quantum simulators.</p>

            <p>The quantum Fisher information, the quantum analogue of the classical Fisher information, is a central quantity in quantum metrology and quantum sensing because of its connection to parameter estimation and fidelity susceptibility. Using numerically exact methods applied to a paradigmatic open quantum system, the spin-boson model, we calculate both static and dynamical quantum Fisher information matrix elements with respect to spin-bath couplings and magnetic field strengths. As the spin-bath interaction increases, we first show that the coupling-coupling matrix elements relative to the ground state of the Hamiltonian serve as a genuine witness of bipartite entanglement and the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless quantum phase transition through their non-monotonic behavior. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the time-dependent matrix elements can reveal non-Markovian effects as well as the transition from the coherent to incoherent regime at the Toulouse point. In the paradigmatic spin-boson model, the non-monotonic features of the quantum Fisher information matrix signal changes in quantum resources such as entanglement and coherence, quantify non-Markovian behavior, and enable criticality-enhanced quantum sensing, thereby shedding light on key features of open quantum systems.</p>

            <p>Drazin inverses are a special kind of generalized inverses that can be defined for endomorphisms in any category. A natural question to ask is whether one can somehow extend the notion of Drazin inverse to arbitrary maps - not simply endomorphisms. It turns out that this is possible and, indeed, natural to do so for dagger categories. This paper, thus, introduces the notion of a dagger-Drazin inverse, which is a new kind of generalized inverse appropriate for arbitrary maps in a dagger category. This inverse is closely related to the Drazin inverse, for having dagger-Drazin inverses is equivalent to asking that positive maps have Drazin inverses. Moreover, dagger-Drazin inverses are also closely related to Moore-Penrose inverses as we observe that a map has a Moore-Penrose inverse if and only if it is a Drazin inverse. Furthermore, we explain how Drazin inverses of opposing pairs correspond precisely to dagger-Drazin inverses in cofree dagger categories. We also give examples of dagger-Drazin inverses for matrices over (involutive) fields, bounded linear operators, and partial injections.</p>

            <p>Nonlocality is an essential concept that distinguishes quantum from classical models and has been extensively studied in systems of qubits. For higher-dimensional systems, certain results for their two-level counterpart, like Bell violations with stabilizer states and Clifford operators, do not generalize. On the other hand, similar to continuous variable systems, Wigner negativity is necessary for nonlocality in qudit systems. We propose a new generalization of the CHSH inequality for qudits by inquiring correlations related to the Wigner negativity of stabilizer states under the adjoint action of a generalization of the qubit $\pi/8$-gate. A specified stabilizer state maximally violates the inequality among all qudit states based on its Wigner negativity. The Bell operator not only serves as a measure for the singlet fraction but also quantifies the volume of Wigner negativity. Additionally, we show how a bipartite entangled qudit state can serve as a witness for contextuality when it exhibits Wigner negativity. Furthermore, we identify rational-phase diagonal unitaries as the key resource that exactly reproduce the CGLMP violation with the maximally entangled state through simple phase-difference alignment.</p>

By employing a real-space scattering approach, we obtain analytical solutions for the scattering amplitudes that remain valid in both Markovian and non-Markovian regimes. We observe that an external driving field induces a splitting of the transmission spectrum's dip into double dips, with the distance between the two dips increasing as the strength of the driving field increases. The chiral nature of the coupling allows for controlled switching between complete transmission and perfect reflection of incident photons. In the Markovian limit, we predict robust perfect transmission at specific phase values, independent of the driving field this http URL, in the non-Markovian regime, as the size of the giant atom increases, the oscillatory behavior of the scattering spectrum becomes more pronounced. Adjusting the giant atom size enables control over the number of decoupling points as well as the number of complete reflection points.</p>

            <p>The topologically protected configuration embedded in skyrmions has prompted some investigations into their fundamental properties and versatile applications, sparking interest and guiding ongoing development. The topological protection associated with skyrmions was initially observed in systems with interactions. It is widely believed that skyrmions are stable yet relevant confirmation and empirical research remain limited. A pertinent question is whether skyrmion configurations formed by a single classical beam with two coupled degrees of freedom also exhibit topological stability. In this study, we affirm this hypothesis by investigating the effects of local decoherence. We analytically and numerically demonstrate the topological resilience of skyrmions and the occurrence of transition points of skyrmion numbers in local decoherence across three typical decoherence channels. On the other hand, we show that these qualities are independent of the initial state. From the numerical results, we find that inhomogeneous but continuous decoherence channels also have the same behaviors and maintain topological stability of skyrmions as homogeneous decoherence channels do. These properties of skyrmions contribute to further applications in various areas, including communication and imaging.</p>

            <p>It is believed that the theory of quantum gravity describing our universe is unitary. Nonetheless, if we only have access to a subsystem, its dynamics is described by nonequilibrium physics. Motivated by this, we investigate the planar limit of large $N$ one-matrix quantum mechanics obeying the Lindblad master equation with dissipative jump terms, focusing on the existence, uniqueness, and properties of steady states. After showing that Lindblad dissipation is absent in the gauged model at large $N$, we study nonequilibrium phase transitions in planar ungauged matrix quantum mechanics. In the first class of examples, where potentials are unbounded from below, we study nonequilibrium critical points above which strong dissipation allows for the existence of normalizable steady states that would otherwise not exist. In the second class of examples, termed matrix quantum optics, we find evidence of nonequilibrium phase transitions analogous to those recently reported in the quantum optics literature for driven-dissipative Kerr resonators. Preliminary results on two-matrix quantum mechanics are also presented. We implement bootstrap methods to obtain concrete and rigorous results for the nonequilibrium steady states of matrix quantum mechanics in the planar limit.</p>

            <p>We study the anticoncentration properties of quantum circuits in the presence of different sources of noise. In the \textit{weak-noise regime}, we show that different types of noise act in a similar fashion, leading to a universal distribution for the probability of a given bit-string, largely independent of the specific noise channel or circuit architecture. In addition, we can identify three distinct depth-dependent regimes, each signaled by a different scaling of cross-entropy benchmarking (XEB) fidelity over time. In the shallow-depth regime, noise effects are perturbatively small; in the intermediate regime, circuit-induced fluctuations and noise compete on equal footing; and in the deep-depth regime, the output distribution becomes effectively classical, up to corrections that are exponentially small in the noise strength. We provide quantitative predictions for the anticoncentration of generic circuits at finite depth, which we benchmark with numerical simulations giving perfect agreement even for shallow circuits. Our findings are directly applicable to current quantum processors and demonstrate universal behavior beyond random-matrix-theory regimes which are only applicable at large depths.</p>

            <p>The exploration of tomography of bosonic Gaussian states is presumably as old as quantum optics, but only recently, their precise and rigorous study have been moving into the focus of attention, motivated by technological developments. In this work, we present an efficient and experimentally feasible Gaussian state tomography algorithm with provable recovery trace-distance guarantees, whose sample complexity depends only on the number of modes, and - remarkably - is independent of the state's photon number or energy, up to doubly logarithmic factors. Our algorithm yields a doubly-exponential improvement over existing methods, and it employs operations that are readily accessible in experimental settings: the preparation of an auxiliary squeezed vacuum, passive Gaussian unitaries, and homodyne detection. At its core lies an adaptive strategy that systematically reduces the total squeezing of the system, enabling efficient tomography. Quite surprisingly, this proves that estimating a Gaussian state in trace distance is generally more efficient than directly estimating its covariance matrix. Our algorithm is particularly well-suited for applications in quantum metrology and sensing, where highly squeezed - and hence high-energy - states are commonly employed. As a further contribution, we establish improved sample complexity bounds for standard heterodyne tomography, equipping this widely used protocol with rigorous trace-norm guarantees.</p>

            <h2>Stochastic Modeling of a Memory-Assisted Measurement-Device-Independent Quantum Key Distribution System in Free-Space Metropolitan Environments</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fares Nada, Amber Hussain, Tasmi R. Ahmed, Connor Kupchak</p>
            <p>On the pathway to quantum key distribution on a global scale, will be the realization of metropolitan-sized Memory Assisted Measurement-Device-Independent Quantum Key Distribution (MA-MDI-QKD) systems. Here, we present a simplistic and intuitive stochastic model to predict key distribution rates in a MA-MDI-QKD scheme that addresses the real-world parameters inherent to free-space quantum communication channels. Specific to our algorithm, the memory-assisted based system allows us to leverage the advantage of asynchronously loaded quantum memory when predicting the distribution rates. Specifically, by focusing on metropolitan distances, we perform simulations tailored toward a system based on free-space links and field-deployable quantum memory. We show the capabilities of our model to predict key rate distributions over ranges of 10-50 km for a set of atmospheric-based parameters and selection of QM efficiencies and coherence times. This tool provides impactful insights into the deployment and optimization of practical MA-MDI-QKD networks in urban environments. Our streamlined approach is a valuable addition to existing quantum network simulators for the smooth integration of quantum networking into the field of communications engineering.</p>

            <h2>Contextuality from the vacuum</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Caroline Lima, María Rosa Preciado-Rivas, Sanchit Srivastava</p>
            <p>Contextuality, a key resource for quantum advantage, is a phenomenon where the outcome of a measurement is not independent of other compatible measurements, violating the premise of classical hidden variable descriptions of the theory. We investigate the harvesting of contextuality from the vacuum of a quantum field using Unruh-DeWitt detectors. We show that interactions with the field can endow initially non-contextual detectors with contextuality with respect to Heisenberg-Weyl measurements, as quantified by contextual fraction. The harvested contextuality correlates with the emergence of Wigner function negativity, in agreement with known equivalences between these notions. Our results establish contextuality harvesting as a fundamental phenomenon in relativistic quantum information, highlighting it as a resource that can be extracted directly from the quantum vacuum.</p>

            <h2>Improving VQE Parameter Quality on Noisy Quantum Processors with Cost-Effective Readout Error Mitigation</h2>

            <p>The inherent noise in current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices presents a major obstacle to the accurate implementation of quantum algorithms such as the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) for quantum chemistry applications. This study examines the impact of error mitigation strategies on VQE performance. We show that, for small molecular systems, an older-generation 5-qubit quantum processing unit (IBMQ Belem), when combined with optimized Twirled Readout Error Extinction (T-REx), achieves ground-state energy estimations an order of magnitude more accurate than those obtained from a more advanced 156-qubit device (IBM Fez) without error mitigation. Our findings demonstrate that T-REx, a computationally inexpensive error mitigation technique, substantially improves VQE accuracy not only in energy estimation, but more importantly in optimizing the variational parameters that characterize the molecular ground state. Consequently, state-vector simulated energies suggest that the accuracy of the optimized variational parameters provides a more reliable benchmark of VQE performance than quantum hardware energy estimates alone. Our results point to the critical role of error mitigation in extending the utility of noisy quantum hardware for molecular simulations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sahil Patel, Sean Doan, Chen Shang, Frederic Grillot, Frank Jahnke, John Bowers, Galan Moody, Weng Chow</p>
            <p>We present a cavity-QED theory for generating squeezed light from semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) integrated in microcavities. We formulate equations of motion for an inhomogeneously broadened QD ensemble that is incoherently pumped and simultaneously driven by a coherent seed field, solve for steady states, and compute the output-field quadrature variances. The analysis identifies operating conditions that yield amplitude-quadrature squeezing, with photon-number fluctuations reduced below the coherent-state limit and squeezing levels as large as 5 dB attainable with presently accessible QD and cavity parameters using only ~ 1 uW pump power. We further show that quantum correlations originating from four-wave mixing play a dual role: they both shape the gain spectrum and generate squeezing. These correlations constitute the quantum counterpart of the mean-field (semiclassical) mechanisms responsible for self-mode-locking in QD lasers and the ultra-narrow lasing linewidths achieved under self-injection locking.</p>

            <p>Implementations of quantum key distribution (QKD) need vulnerability assessment against loopholes in their optical scheme. Most of the optical attacks involve injecting or receiving extraneous light via the communication channel. An eavesdropper can choose her attack wavelengths arbitrarily within the quantum channel passband to maximise the attack performance, exploiting spectral transparency windows of system components. Here we propose a wide-spectrum security evaluation methodology to achieve full optical spectrum safety for QKD systems. This technique requires transmittance characterisation in a wide spectral band with a high sensitivity. We report a testbench that characterises insertion loss of fiber-optic components in a wide spectral range of 400 to 2300 nm and up to 70 dB dynamic range. To illustrate practical application of the proposed methodology, we give a full Trojan-horse attack analysis for some typical QKD system configurations and discuss briefly induced-photorefraction and detector-backflash attacks. Our methodology can be used for certification of QKD systems.</p>

            <p>Deterministically tailoring optical Fock states beyond the single-photon level is crucial for boson sampling, loss-tolerant photonic qubits, and quantum-enhanced sensing, however has yet remained elusive. Here, we report an all-linear-optical protocol that converts a resonantly driven single-photon emitter into a deterministic generator of vacuum--single-photon--two-photon states. A phase-stabilized, path-unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer combines vacuum--single-photon interference and Hong-Ou-Mandel effect, providing two knobs to shape photon-number probabilities. By tuning these knobs, we observe a dynamic transition from antibunching to strong bunching in correlation measurements. A fully quantum-mechanical, discrete time-bin model maps these results onto the tailored photon statistics. The same framework predicts that two indistinguishable emitters would extend the accessible space to deterministic NOON states and single-photon filtering. This protocol relying on linear optics and available single-photon sources provides a scalable, chip-compatible, and platform-independent route to on-demand and deterministic few-photon resources for quantum metrology, photonic computing, as well as long-distance quantum networks.</p>

            <p>Light-matter interaction models invariably rely on the multipole expansion of the electromagnetic potentials generated by complex charge distributions. These multipoles are typically taken to be traceless, however, for a correct evaluation of dispersion forces at all distances, the validity of this assumption has to be checked carefully. Here, we revisit the concept of dispersion forces on an atom near a dielectric surface from the perspective of macroscopic quantum electrodynamics and find that, beyond the quadrupole, the multipoles cannot always be taken as fully traceless. In particular, we show that the trace of the octupole moment contributes to Casimir-Polder interactions beyond the electrostatic regime.</p>

            <p>We investigate quantum-enhanced parameter estimation in boundary time crystals (BTCs) via continuous monitoring. By analytically deriving the global quantum Fisher information rate, we show that in the time-crystal phase the ultimate precision exhibits a cubic scaling with the system size, $f_{\mathrm{global}}\sim N^3$, surpassing both the sensitivity at the critical point and the standard quantum limit (SQL). We then numerically demonstrate that this bound can be attained already at finite $N$ using experimentally accessible strategies: continuous photodetection and, in particular, continuous homodyne detection. Moving towards realistic implementations, we derive the fundamental precision limits for inefficient detection ($\eta<1$). While inefficiencies asymptotically restore SQL scaling, a constant-factor quantum advantage remains possible, diverging as $\eta\!\to\!1$. Numerical simulations show that homodyne detection outperforms photodetection in approaching the ultimate bound and consistently provides a collective advantage over independent single-qubit protocols, which grows with $N$.</p>

A matter-wave interferometer with a massive particle can test numerous fundamental ideas, including the spatial superposition principle - a foundational concept in QM - in previously unexplored regimes. It also opens the possibility of probing the interface between QM and GR, such as testing the quantization of gravity. Consequently, there exists an intensive effort to realize such an interferometer. While several approaches are being explored, we focus on utilizing nanodiamonds with embedded spins as test particles which, in combination with Stern-Gerlach forces, enable the realization of a closed-loop matter-wave interferometer in space-time. There is a growing community of groups pursuing this path [1]. We are posting this technical note (as part of a series of seven such notes), to highlight our plans and solutions concerning various challenges in this ambitious endeavor, hoping this will support this growing community.

Our simulations show that the current state of the art for spin coherence time in nanodiamonds of a few tens of microseconds, is good enough to enable an SGI spatial splitting on the order of nanometers for an ND composed of 10^7 atoms.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arturo Konderak, Wojciech Bruzda, Remigiusz Augusiak</p>
            <p>Self-testing is a powerful device-independent technique that enables one to deduce the forms of both the quantum state and the measurements involved in a physical experiment based solely on observed correlations. Although numerous schemes for self-testing multipartite entangled states have been proposed, they are typically difficult to implement experimentally, as their complexity increases significantly with the number of subsystems or the local dimension. In this work, we introduce the first self-testing scheme of a relevant class of multiqudit genuinely entangled states that exploits only a constant number of binary measurements per observer, which significantly reduces the experimental effort to implement the scheme. Specifically, it enables the self-testing of multipartite Slater (or supersinglet) states composed of $d$ qu\textit{d}its with odd $d$ using only four two-outcome measurements per observer. Moreover, we prove that our scheme is robust to noise and experimental imperfections. For systems of even local dimension $d$, we also provide an adapted version of the scheme that requires only $d$ binary measurements per observer.</p>

            <p>Quantum machine learning has the potential to computationally outperform classical machine learning, but it is not yet clear whether it will actually be valuable for practical problems. While some artificial scenarios have shown that certain quantum machine learning techniques may be advantageous compared to their classical counterpart, evidence does not yet suggest that quantum machine learning has surpassed conventional approaches in dealing with standard classical datasets, such as MNIST dataset. In contrast, dealing with quantum data, such as quantum states or circuits, may be the task where we can benefit from quantum methods. Therefore, it is important to develop practically meaningful quantum datasets for which we expect quantum methods to be superior. In this paper, we propose a machine learning task that is likely to soon arise in the real world: clustering and classification of quantum circuits. We provide a dataset of quantum circuits optimized by the variational quantum eigensolver. We utilized six common types of Hamiltonians in condensed matter physics, with a range of 4-20 qubits, and applied ten different ansatz with varying depths (ranging from 3 to 32) to generate a quantum circuit dataset of six distinct classes, each containing 300 samples. We show that this dataset can be easily learned using quantum methods. In particular, we demonstrate a successful classification of our dataset using real four-qubit devices available through IBMQ. By providing a setting and an elementary dataset where quantum machine learning is expected to be beneficial, we hope to encourage and ease the advancement of the field.</p>

            <p>It is well known in quantum optics that any process involving the preparation of a multimode gaussian state, followed by a gaussian operation and gaussian measurements, can be efficiently simulated by classical computers. Here, we provide evidence that computing transition amplitudes of Gaussian processes with a single-layer of non-linearities is hard for classical computers. To do so, we show how an efficient algorithm to solve this problem could be used to efficiently approximate outcome probabilities of a Gaussian boson sampling experiment. We also extend this complexity result to the problem of computing transition probabilities of Gaussian processes with two layers of non-linearities, by developing a Hadamard test for continuous-variable systems that may be of independent interest. Given recent experimental developments in the implementation of photon-photon interactions, our results may inspire new schemes showing quantum computational advantage or algorithmic applications of non-linear quantum optical systems realizable in the near-term.</p>

Other QEC codes beyond surface code are being experimentally studied, such as color codes and quantum Low-Density Parity Check (qLDPC) codes, that could benefit from new quantum processing unit (QPU) architectures. We introduce the six-qubit star lattice architecture that offers parallelism and effective local all-to-all connectivity and thus enables hardware-efficient implementation of certain QEC codes. As a first demonstration of this new architecture, we encode two logical qubits in a six-qubit superconducting QPU with a star-topology using the [[4, 2, 2]] code and characterize the logical states with the classical shadow framework. Logical life-time and logical error rate are measured over repeated quantum error detection cycles for various logical states including a logical Bell state. We measure logical state fidelities above 96 % for every cardinal logical state, find logical life-times above the best physical element, and logical error-per-cycle values ranging from 0.25(2) % to 0.91(3) %. In future, such star QPU can be tiled to enable QEC codes with high-weight and overlapping stabilizers for improved encoding rates.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we have provided exact two-body solutions to the 2D and 3D Schrödinger equations with isotropic van der Waals potentials of the form \(\pm 1/r^6\). Based on these solutions, we developed an analytical quantum defect theory (QDT) applicable to both quasi-2D and 3D geometries, and applied it to study the scattering properties and bound-state spectra of ultracold polar molecules confined in these geometries. Interestingly, we find that in the attractive (repulsive) van der Waals potential case, the short-range interaction can be effectively modeled by an infinite square barrier (finite square well), which leads to narrow and dense (broad and sparse) resonance structures in the quantum defect parameter. In the quasi-2D attractive case, shape resonances can appear in an ordered fashion across different partial waves, characterized by sharp phase jumps as the scattering energy is varied. Furthermore, the low-energy analytical expansions derived from QDT show excellent agreement with the exact numerical results, validating the accuracy and usefulness of our analytical approach in describing two-body physics governed by long-range van der Waals interactions.</p>

It sets a limit on dark photon dark matter at 148 GHz (0.6 meV) that is around 75 times better than previous constraints.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xing Fan, Gerald Gabrielse, Peter W. Graham, Harikrishnan Ramani, Samuel S. Y. Wong, Yawen Xiao</p>
            <p>We propose using highly excited cyclotron states of a trapped electron to detect meV axion and dark photon dark matter, marking a significant improvement over our previous proposal and demonstration [Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 261801]. When the axion mass matches the cyclotron frequency $\omega_c$, the cyclotron state is resonantly excited, with a transition probability proportional to its initial quantum number, $n_c$. The sensitivity is enhanced by taking $n_c \sim 10^6 \left( \frac{0.1~\text{meV}}{\omega_c} \right)^2$. By optimizing key experimental parameters, we minimize the required averaging time for cyclotron detection to $t_{\text{ave}} \sim 10^{-6} $ seconds, permitting detection of such a highly excited state before its decay. An open-endcap trap design enables the external photon signal to be directed into the trap, rendering our background-free detector compatible with large focusing cavities, such as the BREAD proposal, while capitalizing on their strong magnetic fields. Furthermore, the axion conversion rate can be coherently enhanced by incorporating layers of dielectrics with alternating refractive indices within the cavity. Collectively, these optimizations enable us to probe the QCD axion parameter space from 0.1 meV to 2.3 meV (25-560 GHz), covering a substantial portion of the predicted post-inflationary QCD axion mass range. This sensitivity corresponds to probing the kinetic mixing parameter of the dark photon down to $\epsilon \approx 2 \times 10^{-16}$.</p>

            <h2>Single-shot readout of the nuclear spin of an on-surface atom</h2>

            <p>Nuclear spins owe their long-lived magnetic states to their excellent isolation from the environment. At the same time, a finite degree of interaction with their surroundings is necessary for reading and writing the spin state. Therefore, detailed knowledge of and control over the atomic environment of a nuclear spin is key to optimizing conditions for quantum information applications. While various platforms enabled single-shot readout of nuclear spins, their direct environments were either unknown or impossible to controllably modify on the atomic scale. Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM), combined with electron spin resonance (ESR), provides atomic-scale information of individual nuclear spins via the hyperfine interaction. Here, we demonstrate single-shot readout of an individual $^{\text{49}}$Ti nuclear spin with an STM. Employing a pulsed measurement scheme, we find its lifetime to be in the order of seconds. Furthermore, we shed light on the pumping and relaxation mechanisms of the nuclear spin by investigating its response to both ESR driving and tunnelling current, which is supported by model calculations. These findings give an atomic-scale insight into the nature of nuclear spin relaxation and are relevant for the development of atomically assembled qubit platforms.</p>

            <h2>MC-PDFT Nuclear Gradients and L-PDFT Energies with Meta and Hybrid Meta On-Top Functionals for Ground- and Excited-State Geometry Optimization and Vertical Excitation Energies</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthew R. Hennefarth, Younghwan Kim, Bhavnesh Jangid, Jacob Wardzala, Matthew R. Hermes, Donald G. Truhlar, Laura Gagliardi</p>
            <p>Multiconfiguration pair-density functional theory (MC-PDFT) is a post-MCSCF multireference electronic-structure method that explicitly models strong electron correlation, and linearized pair-density functional theory (L-PDFT) is a recently developed multi-state extension that can accurately model conical intersections and locally-avoided crossings. Because MC-PDFT and L-PDFT rely on an on-top energy functional, their accuracy depends on the quality of the on-top functional used. Recent work has introduced translated meta-gradient-approximation (meta-GA) on-top functionals, and specifically the MC23 hybrid meta-GA on-top functional, which is the first on-top functional specifically optimized for MC-PDFT. Here we report the derivation and implementation of analytic nuclear gradients for MC-PDFT calculations using meta-GA and hybrid meta-GA on-top functionals. This development also enables analytic nuclear gradients for the widely successful tPBE0 hybrid on-top functional. Because MC-PDFT nuclear-gradient calculations involve the derivative of the on-top functional, this development also enables the use of meta-GA on-top functionals in L-PDFT single-point energy calculations. We use the new capabilities to test MC23 for ground-state geometries, excited-state geometries, and vertical excitation energies of s-trans-butadiene and benzophenone as well as to test MC23, another hybrid meta-GA, and seven other meta-GA on-top functionals for 441 vertical excitation energies. We find MC23 performs the best of all nine meta and hybrid meta functionals for vertical excitation energies and is comparable in accuracy to tPBE0 and to the NEVPT2 multireference wave function method. Additionally, we directly compare our MC-PDFT vertical excitation results to previously computed TD-DFT values and find that MC-PDFT outperforms even the best performing Kohn-Sham density functional.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rachel E. Johnson, Joshua A. Job, Steve Adachi</p>
            <p>Error mitigation is essential for near-term quantum devices, and one promising technique is frame randomization. This method inserts random twirling gates into a circuit to reduce errors while preserving unitarity and depth. We apply frame randomization to the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) with $p=1$ on a superconducting quantum circuit system, demonstrating its potential to improve energy calculations. Specifically, we investigate the use of QAOA to calculate the lowest energy state of a frustrated Ising ring system and compare the results of randomized circuits generated using two different randomized techniques. Our results show that both methods can mitigate errors, with expected extremal energy values of $5.25\pm0.145$ and $4.08\pm0.36$, for Randomized Compilation and Pauli frame randomization respectively, compared to $2.63\pm0.068$ without randomization and $5.676\pm0.006$ with a noiseless simulator.</p>

            <h2>Importance of Correlations for Neural Quantum States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fabian Döschl, Annabelle Bohrdt</p>
            <p>Neural quantum states (NQS) have emerged as a powerful variational ansatz for representing quantum many-body wave functions. Their internal mechanisms, however, remain poorly understood. We investigate the role of correlations for NQS-like quantum state representation by employing a correlation-based interpretable neural network architecture and thereafter proving our observations based on Boolean function theory. The correlator neural network demonstrates that, even for simple product states, up to all system-size correlation orders in the chosen computational basis are required to represent a quantum state faithfully. We explain these observations using the Fourier expansion, which reveals the correlator basis as the effective basis of the internal NQS structure, the resulting necessity for high-order correlations, potential linear dependencies in constrained Hilbert spaces, and connections between spin basis-rotations and the correlator basis. Furthermore, we analyze how activation functions, network architectures, and choice of reference basis influence correlation requirements. Our results provide new insights and a better understanding of the internal structure and requirements of NQS, enabling a more systematic use of NQS in future research.</p>

            <p>We investigate a three-level maser quantum thermal machine in which the system-reservoir interaction is modeled via Unruh-DeWitt type coupling, with one or both reservoirs undergoing relativistic motion relative to the working medium. Motion induces Doppler reshaping of the reservoir spectra, modifying energy-exchange rates and enabling operation beyond the Carnot efficiency at finite power. We numerically analyze families of efficiency-power curves and extract the analytic form of a generalized Carnot bound, which recovers the Carnot limit. In addition, Doppler reshaping alters the boundaries between heat-engine and refrigerator operation, making it possible to extract positive work even in the absence of a temperature gradient. These findings establish relativistic motion as a genuine thermodynamic resource.</p>

            <h2>Excitonic Coupling and Photon Antibunching in Venus Yellow Fluorescent Protein Dimers: A Lindblad Master Equation Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ian T. Abrahams</p>
            <p>Strong excitonic coupling and photon antibunching have been observed together in Venus yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) dimers -- a cryptic combination under prevailing theoretical models. In 2019, Kim et al. demonstrated Davydov splitting in Venus dimer circular dichroism (CD) spectra, revealing large negative dimer coupling energy, while antibunching was confirmed by antibunching-fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (AB/FCS fingerprinting). To explain this coexistence, Venus dimer population dynamics are modeled here within a Lindblad master equation framework, justified by the separation of characteristic coupling, dephasing, and thermal relaxation rates. Simulations predict rapid decoherence, consistent with antibunching, indicating that coherence in both the excitonic and site bases is too short-lived to affect photon emission statistics. Despite the absence of long-lived coherence, Venus dimers provide a tractable platform for probing evolutionary pressures on fluorescent protein photophysics and quantum dynamics. Cryogenic cooling could extend coherence lifetimes into the regime required for quantum gate operations, suggesting a route toward fluorescent protein-based qubits. More broadly, the results highlight a structural design principle -- a "bioexciton motif" -- that links excitonic coupling, decoherence, and protein architecture, pointing to general rules by which biology both constrains and inspires quantum technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryotaro Fukuzumi, Kosei Hatakeyama, Daisuke Miki, Kazuhiro Yamamoto</p>
            <p>We analyze the conditional quantum state of a mechanical mirror in an optomechanical system under continuous measurement, feedback control, and quantum filtering. Our study identifies a regime in which the mirror's momentum is squeezed beyond the standard quantum limit achievable through appropriate tuning of the homodyne detection angle. We show that in this regime, optimal filtering effectively realizes a free-particle-like state. Notably, when applied to a setup involving two optomechanical systems, this phenomenon significantly boosts the signal of gravity-induced entanglement (GIE) because the momentum squeezing not only accentuates the difference between the common mode and the differential mode but, when the purity is high, also increases the position uncertainty due to the uncertainty principle, thereby enlarging the spatial extent of the superposition. Our results provide new insights into strategies for verifying the quantum nature of gravity using optomechanical platforms.</p>

            <p>Exploiting quantum features allows for estimating external parameters with precisions well beyond the capacity of classical sensors, a phenomenon known as quantum-enhanced precision. Quantum criticality has been identified as a resource for achieving such enhancements with respect to the probe size. However, they demand complex probe preparation and measurement and the achievable enhancement is ultimately restricted to narrow parameter regimes. On the other hand, non-equilibrium probes harness dynamics, enabling quantum-enhanced precision with respect to time over a wide range of parameters through simple probe initialization. Here, we unify these approaches through a Stark-Wannier localization platform, where competition between a linear gradient field and particle tunneling enables quantum-enhanced sensitivity across an extended parameter regime. The probe is implemented on a 9-qubit superconducting quantum device, in both single- and double-excitation subspaces, where we explore its performance in the extended phase, the critical point and the localized phase. Despite employing only computational-basis measurements we have been able to achieve near-Heisenberg-limited precision by combining outcomes at distinct evolution times. In addition, we demonstrate that the performance of the probe in the entire extended phase is significantly outperforming the performance in the localized regime. Our results highlight Stark-Wannier systems as versatile platforms for quantum sensing, where the combination of criticality and non-equilibrium dynamics enhances precision over a wide range of parameters without stringent measurement requirements.</p>

            <p>Entangled photon sources (EPS) are essential for quantum science and technology. Despite advancements in integrated optical platforms like thin-film lithium niobate, a scalable, high-performance, chip-scale EPS has remained elusive.

By injecting current into the chip, we realize a high-performance EPS with a bandwidth of 73 nm and an entanglement pair generation rate of 4.5*10^10 pairs/s/mW. The polarization entanglement shows Bell-state fidelities above 96% across frequency-correlated modes. This compact, integrated EPS enables key applications, including high-speed quantum key distribution via wavelength division multiplexing, satellite-based quantum communication, and entanglement-based quantum metrology.</p>

            <p>We present the experimental realisation of a robust CNOT quantum gate using Majorana zero modes simulated on a photonic platform. Three Kitaev chains supporting Majorana zero modes at their endpoints are used to encode two logical qubits, and both intra-chain and inter-chain braiding operations are performed to implement the CNOT gate. While the topological encoding of quantum information in Majorana fermions does not offer full topological protection in our non-interacting photonic setting, it nevertheless exhibits a natural resilience to the dominant noise and decoherence effects present in the experiment. Consequently, the fidelity of the CNOT gate is significantly enhanced, surpassing 0.992 and addressing a key limitation in the path toward scalable quantum computation. These results represent a major advancement in topological quantum computing with Majorana fermions and underscore the potential of photonic platforms for realising high-fidelity quantum gates.</p>

            <p>Quantum mechanics (QM) and General relativity (GR), also known as the theory of gravity, are the two pillars of modern physics. A matter-wave interferometer with a massive particle can test numerous fundamental ideas, including the spatial superposition principle - a foundational concept in QM - in previously unexplored regimes. It also opens the possibility of probing the interface between QM and GR, such as testing the quantization of gravity. Consequently, there exists an intensive effort to realize such an interferometer. While several approaches are being explored, we focus on utilizing nanodiamonds with embedded spins as test particles which, in combination with Stern-Gerlach forces, enable the realization of a closed-loop matter-wave interferometer in space-time. There is a growing community of groups pursuing this path [1]. We are posting this technical note (as part of a series of seven such notes), to highlight our plans and solutions concerning various challenges in this ambitious endeavor, hoping this will support this growing community. In this work we detail the trapping of a nanodiamond at 10^-8 mbar, which is good enough for the realization of a short-duration Stern-Gerlach interferometer. We describe in detail the cooling we have performed to sub-Kelvin temperatures, and demonstrate that the nanodiamond remains confined within the trap even under high-intensity 1560 nm laser illumination.

            <p>Quantum communication in the microwave regime is set to play an important role in distributed quantum computing and hybrid quantum networks. However, typical superconducting quantum circuits require millikelvin temperatures for operation, which poses a significant challenge for largescale microwave quantum networks. Here, we present a solution to this challenge by demonstrating the successful quantum teleportation of microwave coherent states between two spatially-separated dilution refrigerators over a thermal microwave channel with a temperature of $4$ K. We distribute two-mode squeezed states over the noisy channel and employ the resulting quantum entanglement for quantum teleportation of coherent states with fidelities of $72.3 \pm 0.5 ~\%$ at $1$ K and $59.9 \pm 2.5 ~\%$ at $4$ K, exceeding the no-cloning and classical communication thresholds, respectively. We successfully model the teleportation protocol using a Gaussian operator formalism that includes losses and noise. This analysis shows that the teleportation infidelity mainly stems from a parasitic heating of the cold quantum nodes due to the hot network connection. Our results prove the experimental feasibility of distributed superconducting architectures and motivate practical applications of noisy quantum networks in various frequency regimes.</p>

            <h2>Exploring the Interplay Between Quantum Entanglement and Decoherence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samuel Marquez Gonzalez</p>
            <p>Quantum entanglement manifests as a distinctive correlation between particles that transcends classical boundaries when their quantum states cannot be described independently. On the other hand, as quantum systems interact with their surroundings, decoherence emerges, leading to the gradual decay of quantum coherence and entanglement. In the case of entanglement, this is known as entanglement sudden death (ESD). Decoherence mechanisms are examined, focusing on how various environmental factors, such as thermal, electromagnetic, and collisional decoherence, influence the integrity of entangled states. The role of quantum noise, such as amplitude damping, phase damping, and depolarizing, is also analyzed. By integrating theoretical insights with experimental findings, this study highlights the delicate balance between maintaining entanglement and mitigating decoherence. The findings have significant implications for the development of quantum technologies, including quantum computing and quantum communication, where preserving entanglement is crucial for achieving robust and reliable performance.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Po-Han Tseng, Yong-Fan Chen</p>
            <p>Quantum memories are indispensable for quantum repeater networks, deterministic generation of single- or multi-photon states, and linear optical quantum computing. Although experiments have demonstrated that electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) quantum memories can store entangled photons, a definitive theoretical framework verifying the preservation of entanglement and nonlocality has not been rigorously established. Here, we develop a comprehensive model by integrating the dark-state polariton framework with reduced-density-operator theory to derive the retrieved density operator under realistic ground-state decoherence conditions. Our analysis reveals that decoherence inevitably causes probe photon loss, converting a Bell state into a mixed state. Crucially, we predict a critical storage efficiency threshold of 89.7%. Only when this threshold is exceeded does the retrieved probe photon state violate the Clauser-Horne inequality, thereby preserving nonlocality; below this point, nonlocal correlations vanish. Moreover, our theory shows that multiple spatially separated EIT memories can cooperatively store and retrieve N-qubit entangled states encoded in photon number, path, and polarization with near-unity fidelity in the ideal limit. This work bridges a long-standing theoretical gap and lays a solid foundation for the application of EIT memories in scalable quantum networks and quantum information processing.</p>

            <p>Investigating physical models with photonic synthetic dimensions has been generating great interest in vast fields of science. The rapid developing thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) platform, for its numerous advantages including high electro-optic coefficient and scalability, is well compatible with the realization of synthetic dimensions in the frequency together with spatial domain. While coupling resonators with fixed beam splitters is a common experimental approach, it often lacks tunability and limits coupling between adjacent lattices to sites occupying the same frequency domain positions. Here, on the contrary, we conceive the resonator arrays connected by electro-optic tunable Mach-Zehnder interferometers in our configuration instead of fixed beam splitters. By applying bias voltage and RF modulation on the interferometers, our design extends such coupling to long-range scenario and allows for continuous tuning on each coupling strength and synthetic effective magnetic flux. Therefore, our design enriches controllable coupling types that are essential for building programmable lattice networks and significantly increases versatility. As the example, we experimentally fabricate a two-resonator prototype on the TFLN platform, and on this single chip we realize well-known models including tight-binding lattices, topological Hall ladder and Creutz ladder. We directly observe the band structures in the quasi-momentum space and important phenomena such as spin-momentum locking and the Aharonov-Bohm cage effect. These results demonstrate the potential for convenient simulations of more complex models in our configuration.</p>

            <p>A chiral supersolid is a quantum phase that simultaneously exhibits crystalline order, superfluidity, and topological spin texture, with spontaneously broken translational, U(1) gauge, and chiral symmetries. Here, we demonstrate a chiral supersolid with tunable non-equilibrium dynamics in a spin-orbit coupled dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate. By adjusting dipolar interaction and spin-orbit coupling, we uncover two distinct quantum phase transitions: (i) a first-order transition from a single skyrmion superfluid to a triangular meron supersolid, and (ii) a second-order transition from this superfluid to a square skyrmion supersolid. These phases are characterized by their lattice symmetries, nonclassical rotational inertia, and spin textures. Under parity-time symmetric dissipation, we predict phase-dependent damping of the current oscillations, directly linked to the superfluid fraction. The predicted chiral supersolid phase can be experimentally observed in ultracold magnetic atoms with spin-orbit coupling. Our results establish dipolar quantum gases as a platform for designing topological matter with spintronic functionality.</p>

            <p>Spin defects in two-dimensional materials are a promising platform for quantum sensing. Simulating the defect's optical response and optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) contrast is key to identifying suitable candidates. However, existing simulation methods are typically unable to supply the required accuracy. Here, we propose two quantum algorithms to detect an imbalance in the triplet-to-singlet intersystem crossing (ISC) rates between excited states with the same and different spin projections -- a necessary condition for nonzero ODMR response. The lowest-cost approach evaluates whether the evolution of an $S=0$ state under the spin-orbit coupling induces ISC to $S=1$, and also whether there is an imbalance in its intensity depending on the final state spin projection. The second approach works by comparing the emission spectrum of a spin defect with and without the spin-orbit coupling operator, inferring ISC intensity for different spin transition channels from spectrum intensity changes. Additionally, we present an improved scheme to evaluate the defect's optical response, building upon previous work. We study these quantum algorithms in the context of the negatively charged boron vacancy in hexagonal boron nitride. We generate an embedded active space of 18 spatial orbitals using quantum defect embedding theory (QDET) and show that the ISC rate imbalance can be detected with as few as 105 logical qubits and $2.2 \times 10^8$ Toffoli gates. By avoiding direct and costly rate calculations, our methods enable faster screening of candidate defects for ODMR activity, advancing the prospect of using quantum simulations to aid the development of high-performing sensing devices.</p>
