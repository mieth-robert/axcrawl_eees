            <h2>Coherent enhancement of collection of light from linear ion crystals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> T. D. Tran, D. Babjak, A. Kovalenko, K. Singh, M. T. Pham, P. Obšil, A. Lešundák, O. Číp, L. Slodička</p>
            <p>The efficient detection of light from trapped ions in free space is paramount for most of their applications. We propose a scheme to enhance the photon collection from linear ion strings. It employs the constructive interference of light scattered from ions along the axial direction in linear Paul traps. The coherent enhancement of photon collection is numerically optimized for a range of feasible spatial angles and realistic ion positions in a single harmonic Coulomb potential. Despite the large mutual distance of scatterers on the order of many wavelengths of scattered light, presented experimental tests confirm the feasibility of enhancements by a factor of $3.05 \pm 0.09$ with a crystal of nine $^{40}$Ca$^+$ ions. Further significant improvements using different ion species, which allow for suppression of the sensitivity to the residual thermal motion, are predicted. The proposed collection geometry is intrinsic to diverse linear ion trap designs and the methodology can be directly applied to an observation of scattering from ion crystals prepared in collective electronic excitations.</p>

            <h2>Polynomially efficient quantum enabled variational Monte Carlo for training neural-network quantum states for physico-chemical applications</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Manas Sajjan, Vinit Singh, Sabre Kais</p>
            <p>Neural-network quantum states (NQS) offer a versatile and expressive alternative to traditional variational ansätze for simulating physical systems. Energy-based frameworks, like Hopfield networks and Restricted Boltzmann Machines, leverage statistical physics to map quantum states onto an energy landscape, functioning as memory descriptors. Here, we show that such models can be efficiently trained using Monte Carlo techniques enhanced by quantum devices. Our algorithm scales linearly with circuit width and depth, requires constant measurements, avoids mid-circuit measurements, and is polynomial in storage, ensuring optimal efficiency. It applies to both phase and amplitude fields, significantly expanding the trial space compared to prior methods. Quantum-assisted sampling accelerates Markov Chain convergence and improves sample fidelity, offering advantages over classical approaches. We validate our method by accurately learning ground states of local spin models and non-local electronic structure Hamiltonians, even in distorted molecular geometries with strong multi-reference correlations. Benchmark comparisons show robust agreement with traditional methods. This work highlights the potential of combining machine learning protocols with near-term quantum devices for quantum state learning, with promising applications in theoretical chemistry and condensed matter physics.</p>

            <h2>Perturbation theory scope for predicting vibronic selectivity by entangled two photon absorption</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> C. D. Rodriguez-Camargo, H. O. Gestsson, C. Nation, A. R. Jones, A. Olaya-Castro</p>
            <p>Using second-order perturbation theory in the light-matter interaction, we derive an analytical approximation for the vibronic populations of a diatomic system excited by ultrabroadband frequency entangled photons and evaluate the population dynamics for different degrees of entanglement between photon pairs. Our analytical approach make the same predictions as previously derived via numerical solutions of the complete Schrödinger equation [H. Oka, Physical Review A 97, 063859 (2018)], with the added advantage of providing clear physical insights into the vibronic selectivity as a function of the degree of photon correlations while requiring significantly reduced computational effort. Specifically, our analytical expression for the probability of vibronic excitation includes a factor which predicts the enhancement of vibrational selectivity as a function of the degree correlation between the entangled photon pairs, the targeted vibrational energy level, and the vibrational molecular structure encoded in the Franck-Condon factors. Our results illustrate the importance of going beyond the usual approximations in second-order perturbation theory to capture the relevance of the vibrational structure of the molecular system of interest in order to gain a deeper understanding of the possible quantum-enhancement provided by the interaction between quantum light and matter.</p>

            <h2>Microwave-optics entanglement via coupled opto- and magnomechanical microspheres</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hao-Tian Li, Zhi-Yuan Fan, Huai-Bing Zhu, Simon Gröblacher, Jie Li</p>
            <p>Microwave-optics entanglement plays a crucial role in building hybrid quantum networks with quantum nodes working in the microwave and optical frequency bands. However, there are limited efficient ways to produce such entanglement due to the large frequency mismatch between the two regimes. Here, we present a new mechanism to prepare microwave-optics entanglement based on a hybrid system of two coupled opto- and magnomechanical microspheres, i.e., a YIG sphere and a silica sphere. The YIG sphere holds a magnon mode and a vibration mode induced by magnetostriction, while the silica sphere supports an optical whispering-gallery mode and a mechanical mode coupled via an optomechanical interaction. The two mechanical modes are close in frequency and directly coupled via physical contact of the two microspheres. We show that by simultaneously activating the magnomechanical (optomechanical) Stokes (anti-Stokes) scattering, stationary entanglement can be established between the magnon and optical modes via mechanics-mechanics coupling. This leads to stationary microwave-optics entanglement by further coupling the YIG sphere to a microwave cavity and utilizing the magnon-microwave state swapping. Our protocol is within reach of current technology and may become a promising new approach for preparing microwave-optics entanglement, which finds unique applications in hybrid quantum networks and quantum information processing with hybrid quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>Black Hole Multi-Entropy Curves</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Norihiro Iizuka, Simon Lin, Mitsuhiro Nishida</p>
            <p>We investigate the multi-partite entanglement structure of an evaporating black hole and its Hawking radiation by dividing the radiation into finer subsystems. Using the multi-entropy of these configurations, we define a black hole multi-entropy curve, which describes how the multi-entropy changes during the black hole evaporation. This black hole multi-entropy curve is a natural generalization of the Page curve since the multi-entropy reduces to the entanglement entropy for the bi-partite case. The multi-entropy curve keeps increasing in the early time. It reaches the maximum value at the multi-entropy time, which is later than the Page time, and starts to decrease. However, it does not decrease to zero at the end of the black hole evaporation. This non-zero value of the multi-entropy represents the secret entanglement between Hawking particles.</p>
