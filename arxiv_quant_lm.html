            <h2>Universal Predictors for Mixing Time more than Liouvillian Gap</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi-Neng Zhou</p>
            <p>We analyze the mixing time of open quantum systems governed by the Lindblad master equation, showing it is not only determined by the Liouvillian gap, but also the trace norm of the lowest excited state of Liouvillian superoperator. By utilizing these universal predictors of mixing time, we establish general conditions for the fast and rapid mixing respectively. Specifically, we derive rapid mixing conditions for both the strong and weak dissipation regimes, formulated as sparsity constraints on the Hamiltonian and the local Lindblad operators. Our findings provide a general framework for calculating mixing time and offer a guide for designing dissipation to achieve desired mixing speeds, which has significant implications for efficient experimental state preparation.</p>

            <h2>Quantum algorithm for dephasing of coupled systems: decoupling and IQP duality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sabrina Yue Wang, Raul A. Santos</p>
            <p>Noise and decoherence are ubiquitous in the dynamics of quantum systems coupled to an external environment. In the regime where environmental correlations decay rapidly, the evolution of a subsytem is well described by a Lindblad quantum master equation. In this work, we introduce a quantum algorithm for simulating unital Lindbladian dynamics by sampling unitary quantum channels without extra ancillas. Using ancillary qubits we show that this algorithm allows approximating general Lindbladians as well. For interacting dephasing Lindbladians coupling two subsystems, we develop a decoupling scheme that reduces the circuit complexity of the simulation. This is achieved by sampling from a time-correlated probability distribution - determined by the evolution of one subsystem, which specifies the stochastic circuit implemented on the complementary subsystem. We demonstrate our approach by studying a model of bosons coupled to fermions via dephasing, which naturally arises from anharmonic effects in an electron-phonon system coupled to a bath. Our method enables tracing out the bosonic degrees of freedom, reducing part of the dynamics to sampling an instantaneous quantum polynomial (IQP) circuit. The sampled bitstrings then define a corresponding fermionic problem, which in the non-interacting case can be solved efficiently classically. We comment on the computational complexity of this class of dissipative problems, using the known fact that sampling from IQP circuits is believed to be difficult classically.</p>

            <h2>The pros and cons of using deep reinforcement learning or genetic algorithms to design control schemes for quantum state transfer on qubit chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sofía Perón Santana, Ariel Fiuri, Martín Domínguez, Omar Osenda</p>
            <p>In recent years, control methods based on different optimization techniques have shed light on the possibilities of processing information in many quantum systems. When exploring the transmission of quantum states, faster transmission times are mandatory to avoid the deleterious effects of multiple sources of decoherence that spoil the transmission process. In particular, using Reinforcement Learning to devise sequences of step-wise external controls provides good transfer policies at short transmission times. We present two approaches to control the transmission of quantum states in qubit chains using external controls to force the dynamical evolution of the chain state. The first approach relies on the well-known Genetic Algorithm to generate a sequence of external controls, while the second approach uses a variant of Reinforcement Learning. The Genetic algorithm achieves excellent transmission fidelity at as short transmission times as Reinforcement Learning, surpassing the fidelities achieved by the latter method. Nevertheless, the Reinforcement Learning method offers robust control policies when the control pulses are noisy enough, owing to an imperfect timing of the pulses, deficient control devices, or other sources of phase decoherence. We present the regime where each method is best suited to control the transmission of arbitrary qubit states.</p>

            <h2>Continual Quantum Architecture Search with Tensor-Train Encoding: Theory and Applications to Signal Processing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jun Qi, Chao-Han Huck Yang, Pin-Yu Chen, Javier Tejedor, Ling Li, Min-Hsiu Hsieh</p>
            <p>We introduce CL-QAS, a continual quantum architecture search framework that mitigates the challenges of costly amplitude encoding and catastrophic forgetting in variational quantum circuits. The method uses Tensor-Train encoding to efficiently compress high-dimensional stochastic signals into low-rank quantum feature representations. A bi-loop learning strategy separates circuit parameter optimization from architecture exploration, while an Elastic Weight Consolidation regularization ensures stability across sequential tasks. We derive theoretical upper bounds on approximation, generalization, and robustness under quantum noise, demonstrating that CL-QAS achieves controllable expressivity, sample-efficient generalization, and smooth convergence without barren plateaus. Empirical evaluations on electrocardiogram (ECG)-based signal classification and financial time-series forecasting confirm substantial improvements in accuracy, balanced accuracy, F1 score, and reward. CL-QAS maintains strong forward and backward transfer and exhibits bounded degradation under depolarizing and readout noise, highlighting its potential for adaptive, noise-resilient quantum learning on near-term devices.</p>

            <h2>Informationally Complete Distributed Metrology Without a Shared Reference Frame</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hua-Qing Xu, Gong-Chu Li, Xu-Song Hong, Lei Chen, Si-Qi Zhang, Yuancheng Liu, Geng Chen, Chuan-Feng Li, Guang-Can Guo</p>
            <p>In quantum information processing, implementing arbitrary preparations and measurements on qubits necessitates precise information to identify a specific reference frame (RF). In space quantum communication and sensing, where a shared RF is absent, the interplay between locality and symmetry imposes fundamental restrictions on physical systems. A restriction on realizable unitary operations results in a no-go theorem prohibiting the extraction of locally encoded information in RF-independent distributed metrology. Here, we propose a reversed-encoding method applied to two copies of local-unitary-invariant network states. This approach circumvents the no-go theorem while simultaneously mitigating decoherence-like noise caused by RF misalignment, thereby enabling the complete recovery of the quantum Fisher information (QFI). Furthermore, we confirm local Bell-state measurements as an optimal strategy to saturate the QFI. Our findings pave the way for the field application of distributed quantum sensing, which is inherently subject to unknown RF misalignment and was previously precluded by the no-go theorem.</p>

            <h2>Even Odd Splitting of the Gaussian Quantum Fisher Information: From Symplectic Geometry to Metrology</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kaustav Chatterjee, Tanmoy Pandit, Varinder Singh, Pritam Chattopadhyay, Ulrik Lund Andersen</p>
            <p>We introduce a canonical decomposition of the quantum Fisher information (QFI) for centered multimode Gaussian states into two additive pieces: an even part that captures changes in the symplectic spectrum and an odd part associated with correlation-generating dynamics. On the pure-state manifold, the even contribution vanishes identically, while the odd contribution coincides with the QFI derived from the natural metric on the Siegel upper half-space, revealing a direct geometric underpinning of pure-Gaussian metrology. This also provides a link between the graphical representation of pure Gaussian states and an explicit expression for the QFI in terms of graphical parameters. For evolutions completely generated by passive Gaussian unitaries (orthogonal symplectics), the odd QFI vanishes, while thermometric parameters contribute purely to the even sector with a simple spectral form; we also derive a state-dependent lower bound on the even QFI in terms of the purity-change rate. We extend the construction to the full QFI matrix, obtaining an additive even odd sector decomposition that clarifies when cross-parameter information vanishes. Applications to unitary sensing (beam splitter versus two-mode squeezing) and to Gaussian channels (loss and phase-insensitive amplification), including joint phase loss estimation, demonstrate how the decomposition cleanly separates resources associated with spectrum versus correlations. The framework supplies practical design rules for continuous-variable sensors and provides a geometric lens for benchmarking probes and channels in Gaussian quantum metrology.</p>

            <h2>Rydberg atom parity gate based on dark state resonances</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sinchan Snigdha Rej, Snigdhadev Ray, Bimalendu Deb</p>
            <p>Quantum computation (QC) and digital quantum simulation (DQS) essentially require two- or multi-qubit controlled-NOT or -phase gates. We propose an alternative pathway for QC and DQS using a three-qubit parity gate in a Rydberg atom array. The basic principle of the Rydberg atom parity gate (RPG) is that the operation on the target qubit is controlled by the parity of the control qubits. First, we discuss how to construct an RPG based on a dark state resonance. We optimize the gate parameters by numerically analyzing the time evolution of the computational basis states to maximize the gate fidelity. We also show that our proposed RPG is extremely robust against the Rydberg blockade error. To demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed RPG over the conventional CNOT or CZ gate in QC and DQS, we implement the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm and simulate the Ising Hamiltonian. The results show that RPG can be a better substitute of the CNOT gate to yield better results, as it decreases the circuit noise by reducing circuit depth.</p>

            <h2>A paradigm for universal quantum information processing with integrated acousto-optic frequency beamsplitters</h2>

            <p>Frequency-bin encoding offers tremendous potential in quantum photonic information processing, in which a single waveguide can support hundreds of lightpaths in a naturally phase-stable fashion. This stability, however, comes at a cost: arbitrary unitary operations can be realized by cascaded electro-optic phase modulators and pulse shapers, but require nontrivial numerical optimization for design and have thus far been limited to discrete tabletop components. In this article, we propose, formalize, and computationally evaluate a new paradigm for universal frequency-bin quantum information processing using acousto-optic scattering processes between distinct transverse modes. We show that controllable phase matching in intermodal processes enables 2$\times$2 frequency beamsplitters and transverse-mode-dependent phase shifters, which together comprise cascadable FRequency-transverse-mODe Operations (FRODOs) that can synthesize any unitary via analytical decomposition procedures. Modeling the performance of both random gates and discrete Fourier transforms, we demonstrate the feasibility of high-fidelity quantum operations with existing integrated photonics technology, highlighting prospects of parallelizable operations achieving 100\% bandwidth utilization. Our approach is realizable with CMOS technology, opening the door to scalable on-chip quantum information processing in the frequency domain.</p>

            <p>The motion of atoms in programmable optical tweezer arrays offers many new opportunities for neutral atom quantum science. These include inter- and intra-site atom motion for resource-efficient implementations of fermionic and bosonic modes, respectively, as well as tweezer transport for efficient compilation of arbitrary circuits. However, the exploitation of atomic motion for all three purposes and others is limited by the inertia of the atoms. We present a comprehensive architectural blueprint for the use of fermionic metastable helium-3 ($^3$He$^*$) atoms -- the lightest trappable atomic species -- in programmable optical tweezer arrays. This includes a concrete analysis of atomic structure considerations as well as Rydberg-mediated interactions. We show that inter-tweezer hopping of $^3$He$^*$ atoms can be $\gtrsim3\times$ faster than previous demonstrations with lithium-6. We also demonstrate a new toolbox for encoding and manipulating qubits directly in the tweezer trap potential, uniquely enabled by the light mass of $^3$He$^*$. Finally, we provide several examples of new opportunities for fermionic quantum simulation and computation that leverage the transport and inter-tweezer hopping of $^3$He$^*$ atom arrays. These tools present new methods to improve the resource efficiency of neutral atom quantum science that may also enable quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories and quantum chemistry outside the Born-Oppenheimer approximation</p>

            <h2>Experimental Coherent One-Way Quantum Key Distribution with Simplicity and Practical Security</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiao-Yu Cao, Xiao-Ran Sun, Ming-Yang Li, Yu-Shuo Lu, Hua-Lei Yin, Zeng-Bing Chen</p>
            <p>Coherent one-way quantum key distribution (COW-QKD) has been widely investigated, and even been deployed in real-world quantum network. However, the proposal of the zero-error attack has critically undermined its security guarantees, and existing experimental implementations have not yet established security against coherent attacks. In this work, we propose and experimentally demonstrate an information-theoretically secure COW-QKD protocol that can resist source side-channel attacks, with secure transmission distances up to 100 km. Our system achieves a secure key rate on the order of kilobits per second over 50 km in the finite-size regime, sufficient for real-time secure voice communication across metropolitan networks. Furthermore, we demonstrate the encrypted transmission of a logo with information-theoretic security over 100 km of optical fiber. These results confirm that COW-QKD can simultaneously provide simplicity and security, establishing it as a strong candidate for deployment in small-scale quantum networks.</p>

            <h2>Geometric and Operational Characterization of Two-Qutrit Entanglement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ankita Jana</p>
            <p>We investigate the entanglement structure of bipartite two-qutrit pure states from both geometric and operational this http URL the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix, we analyze how symmetric polynomials characterize pairwise and genuinely three-level correlations. We show that the determinant of the coefficient matrix defines a natural, rank-sensitive geometric invariant that vanishes for all rank-2 states and is nonzero only for rank-3 entangled states. An explicit analytic constraint relating this determinant-based invariant to the I-concurrence is derived, thereby defining the physically accessible region of two-qutrit states in invariant space. Furthermore, we establish an operational correspondence with three-path optical interferometry and analyze conditional visibility and predictability in a qutrit quantum erasure protocol, including the effects of unequal path transmittances. Numerical demonstrations confirm the analytic results and the associated complementarity relations. These findings provide a unified geometric and operational framework for understanding two-qutrit entanglement.</p>

            <h2>Extending the Handover-Iterative VQE to Challenging Strongly Correlated Systems: $N_2$ and Fe-S Cluster</h2>

            <p>Accurately describing strongly correlated electronic systems remains a central challenge in quantum chemistry, as electron-electron interactions give rise to complex many-body wavefunctions that are difficult to capture with conventional approximations. Classical wavefunction-based approaches, such as the Semistochastic Heat-bath Configuration Interaction (SHCI) and the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG), currently define the state of the art, systematically converging toward the Full Configuration Interaction (FCI) limit, but at a rapidly increasing computational cost. Quantum computing algorithms promise to alleviate this scaling bottleneck by leveraging entanglement and superposition to represent correlated states more compactly. We introduced the Handover-Iterative Variational Quantum Eigensolver (HI-VQE) as a practical quantum computing algorithm with an iterative "handover" mechanism that dynamically exchanges information between quantum and classical computers, even using Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers. In this work, we extend the HI-VQE to benchmark two prototypical strongly correlated systems, the nitrogen molecule $N_2$ and iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster, which serve as stringent tests for both classical and quantum electronic-structure methods. By comparing HI-VQE results against Heat-bath Configuration Interaction (HCI) benchmarks, we assess its accuracy, scalability, and ability to capture multireference correlation effects. Achieving quantitative agreement on these canonical systems demonstrates a viable pathway toward quantum-enhanced simulations of complex bioinorganic molecules, catalytic mechanisms, and correlated materials.</p>

            <h2>Dynamical Correlation of the Post-quench Non-thermal Equilibrium State</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang-Yang Chen, Song Cheng</p>
            <p>After a quantum quench, the integrable system is expected to relax to a non-thermal equilibrium state (NTES) whose local properties are believed to be governed by a generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE). Combining quench action and the form factor approach, we compute the field-field correlation in the NTES produced by an interaction quench of the Lieb-Liniger model. The spectral distribution is shown to be qualitatively different from that of a thermal equilibrium state (TES): a new dispersion branch appears whose microscopic mechanism can be traced to the algebraic decaying tail for the root density distribution function, and indicates the existence of a broader family of NTES featuring similar spectral property.</p>

            <h2>Quantum state engineering of spin-orbit coupled ultracold atoms in a Morse potential</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yue Ban, Xi Chen, J. G. Muga, E. Ya Sherman</p>
            <p>Achieving full control of a Bose-Einstein condensate can have valuable applications in metrology, quantum information processing, and quantum condensed matter physics. We propose protocols to simultaneously control the internal (related to its pseudospin-1/2) and motional (position-related) states of a spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensate confined in a Morse potential. In the presence of synthetic spin-orbit coupling, the state transition of a noninteracting condensate can be implemented by Raman coupling and detuning terms designed by invariant-based inverse engineering. The state transfer may also be driven by tuning the direction of the spin-orbit-coupling field and modulating the magnitude of the effective synthetic magnetic field. The results can be generalized for interacting condensates by changing the time-dependent detuning to compensate for the interaction. We find that a two-level algorithm for the inverse engineering remains numerically accurate even if the entire set of possible states is considered. The proposed approach is robust against the laser-field noise and systematic device-dependent errors.</p>

            <h2>Irreversibility of decorrelating processes: an experimental assessment in cavity QED</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guillaume Cœuret Cauquil, Patrice A. Camati, Irénée Frerot, Zheng Tan, Alexia Auffèves, Igor Dotsenko</p>
            <p>Entropy production quantifies the amount of irreversibility of a physical process, leading to fundamental bounds for thermodynamic quantities. Particularly in the quantum realm, considerable research has been carried out in the last decades extending entropy production to nonequilibrium processes. We experimentally investigate the entropy production of forward-backward cycles containing different decorrelating processes realized to erase different types of correlations between two interacting systems, from obliterating solely quantum coherence to completely decorrelating local states. We apply these processes to the entanglement of a two-level atom, realized with a circular Rydberg atom, and a light field of a high-quality microwave cavity. The entropy production is computed from the full quantum-state tomography of the system performed at different stages of the interaction-decorrelation sequence. Due to the quantum nature of the atom-cavity system, we find that, although standard, the maximum likelihood estimation method for the density matrix leads to spurious divergences of the entropy production. We propose and implement an alternative estimator that remedies such divergences. Our work experimentally assesses irreversibility of non-thermal processes and addresses the care that must be taken in handling experimental data to estimate the entropy production.</p>

            <h2>Strong coupling of virtual negative states in the Kapitza-Dirac effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qianlong Wang, Sven Ahrens, Baifei Shen</p>
            <p>Negative states are an intrinsic property of relativistic quantum theory and related to anti-particles in the context of the Dirac sea concept. We show that negative states can dominantly contribute to the diffraction amplitude in the quantum dynamics of the two-photon Kapitza-Dirac effect. We draw our conclusion by investigating solutions from time-dependent perturbation theory, where the perturbative solutions are in match with numeric solutions of the relativistic quantum system and also with the numeric and analytic solutions from the relativistic equations of motion of a classical point-like electron in an external standing wave light field. While our numeric solutions assume a strong laser field, the analytic solutions indicate that negative state coupling remains dominant for arbitrary low field amplitudes, where in the single-photon case (Compton scattering) negative state coupling can be mathematically associated with the interaction of a virtual electron-positron pair in the context of a quantized theory in old-fashioned perturbation theory.</p>

            <p>Rydberg atoms represent a platform underpinning many recent developments in quantum computation, simulation, sensing, and metrology. They further facilitate optical nonlinearity at the single-photon level when coupled to photons propagating in atomic clouds, which form collective atomic excitations called Rydberg polaritons, strongly interacting with each other. Here, we experimentally explore interactions between a Rydberg polariton in an atomic ensemble and a single, adjacent, Rydberg atom. We discover three different regimes of quantum dynamics corresponding to polariton blockade, coherent exchange, and probabilistic hopping, which are defined by their distinct transmission characteristics, with a transition through an exceptional point occurring between blockade and coherent exchange. We investigate the applications of such interactions for fast, non-destructive detection of Rydberg atoms and present proof-of-principle demonstrations for their potential application in nonlinear photonic networks.</p>

A remarkable example is the case of weakly interacting bosonic systems, whose ground state is a squeezed vacuum state, and whose elementary excitations have a collective nature. In this work, we report on the direct observation of the peculiar microscopic quantum structure of these elementary excitations. We perform time- and frequency-resolved two-photon correlation measurements on the fluctuations of weakly interacting polaritons in a resonantly-driven microcavity, and observe that upon decreasing the average number of fluctuation quanta below unity, large pair correlations build up together with strong time-ordering of the emitted photons. This behavior is a direct signature of the particle-hole quantum superposition which is at the heart of Bogoliubov excitations.</p>

            <h2>Wave Function Realism and the Mathematization of Nature. A Phenomenological Perspective</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Philipp Berghofer, Harald A. Wiltsche</p>
            <p>This chapter reexamines wave function realism (WFR) through the lens of phenomenology. We begin by situating WFR within the broader debate about the ontology of the quantum state and the temptation to "read off" metaphysics from mathematical formalism. Against this background, we turn to the London-Bauer interpretation (LBI), the most explicit attempt to interpret quantum mechanics through phenomenological categories. On this view, the measurement transition is not a physical discontinuity but a reflective articulation of objectivity, and the wave function formally encodes the horizonal structure of world-givenness. We develop this idea by reconfiguring the notion of realism itself: not as objectivist, but as correlational and transcendental. The resulting picture suggests that quantum mechanics, rather than depicting a world "minus observers," mathematically articulates the very correlation through which a world becomes manifest at all.</p>

            <h2>Coherent Control of the Goos-Hänchen Shift in Polariton Optomechanics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shah Fahad, Gao Xianlong</p>
            <p>We propose a theoretical scheme for controlling the Goos-Hänchen shift (GHS) of a reflected probe field in a polariton optomechanical system. The system comprises an optical mode, a molecular vibrational mode, and $N$ excitonic modes, where excitons couple to molecular vibrations via conditional displacement interactions and to photons through electric dipole interactions. We show that the effective exciton-vibration coupling provides a powerful mechanism for coherent GHS control: in its absence, the system exhibits a pronounced GHS at resonance, while activating it strongly suppresses the shift. The effective cavity detuning and the cavity length serve as additional tunable parameters for GHS manipulation. Furthermore, increasing the collective exciton-optical coupling enhances the GHS. Our results establish a framework for probing the GHS in polariton optomechanical systems and offer new avenues for designing optical devices that exploit beam-displacement phenomena.</p>

We evaluate analytically and numerically the excitation spectrum for both cases of a homogeneous and of a localized density distribution. We identify in the excitation spectrum the emergence of the analogous to the Goldstone and the Higgs modes, evaluating various relevant observables, gaining insight into these two fundamental modes of excitation.</p>

The transition is first-order immune to magnetic field perturbations and displays a lifetime of 25 s, around three times the longest single-spin $T_2^*$. Sensitivity to effective pseudo-fields is also demonstrated, including the internal dipolar field of the sample.</p>

            <p>We investigate superconducting transmission lines as a novel platform for realizing a quantum fluid of microwave photons in a propagating geometry. We predict that the strong photon-photon interactions provided by the intrinsic nonlinearity of Josephson junctions are sufficient to enter a regime of strongly interacting photons for realistic parameters. A suitable tapering of the transmission line parameters allows for the adiabatic conversion of an incident coherent field into a Tonks-Girardeau gas of fermionized photons close to its ground state. Signatures of the strong correlations are anticipated in the correlation properties of the transmitted light.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jithin D. George, Julian Koellermeier, Samuel Y. Jung, Niall M. Mangan</p>
            <p>Most numerical methods for time integration use real-valued time steps. Complex time steps, however, can provide an additional degree of freedom, as we can select the magnitude of the time step in both the real and imaginary directions. We show that specific paths in the complex time plane lead to expanded stability regions, providing clear computational advantages for complex-valued systems. In particular, we highlight the Schrödinger equation, for which complex time integrators can be uniquely optimal. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these benefits extend to certain classes of real-valued stiff systems by coupling complex time steps with the Projective Integration method.</p>

            <h2>Phase transition, phase separation and mode softening of a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate in an optical cavity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jia-Ying Lin, Wei Qin, Renyuan Liao</p>
            <p>We investigate the superradiant phase transition in a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate with distinct atomic detunings, confined in an optical cavity and driven by a transverse pump laser. By combining perturbation theory and numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the phase transition is dominated by the red-detuned component, resulting in a phase diagram completely different from that of a single-component case under blue-detuned condition. The system exhibits spontaneous phase separation between the two components, manifested as alternating stripe patterns in the normal phase and distinct Bragg gratings in the superradiant phase. Furthermore, the Bogoliubov excitation spectrum reveals roton-type mode softening, indicating that the phase transition also corresponds to the superfluid-to-lattice supersolid transition. Our findings provide insights into the interplay between atomic detunings and collective quantum many-body phenomena, offering potential applications in quantum simulation and optical switching technologies.</p>

            <p>Analog coprocessors are intensively developing nowadays with the aim to optimize energy computations of neural networks. In this work we focus on the possibility of using detection of collective oscillations in optical systems for computational purposes. We show that in a system of coupled resonators, collective oscillations can be used to implement matrix-vector multiplication. The matrix is formed by the coupling constants between the resonators, and the input vector is formed by the initial occupancies of the involved modes. The frequency of the collective oscillations is growing with the number of the involved modes, similarly to Rabi oscillations. The time needed for their detection, i.e., averaging, decreases with an increase in the input vector dimension. We discuss the limitations imposed on parallel computation in the system by restriction of the allowed optical frequency band.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Caroline L. Jones, Stefan L. Ludescher, Albert Aloy, Markus P. Mueller</p>
            <p>We demonstrate a fundamental relation between the structures of physical space and of quantum theory: the set of quantum correlations in a rotational prepare-and-measure scenario can be derived from covariance alone, without assuming quantum physics. To show this, we consider a semi-device-independent randomness generation scheme where one of two spatial rotations is performed on an otherwise uncharacterized preparation device, and one of two possible measurement outcomes is subsequently obtained. An upper bound on a theory-independent notion of spin is assumed for the transmitted physical system. It turns out that this determines the set of quantum correlations and the amount of certifiable randomness in this setup exactly. Interestingly, this yields the basis of a theory-independent protocol for the secure generation of random numbers. Our results support the conjecture that the symmetries of space and time determine at least part of the probabilistic structure of quantum theory.</p>

            <h2>Efficient Lattice Hamiltonian Encoding for the Shortest Vector Problem</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eden Schirman, Cong Ling, Florian Mintert</p>
            <p>The advent of quantum computing necessitates the transition of worldwide cryptosystems to post-quantum cryptography (PQC), which is founded upon the problem of finding short vectors in high-dimensional structured lattices. It is assumed that the structure of these lattices cannot be exploited by quantum or classical algorithms attempting to find short vectors. In this work, we focus on the structure of the lattices used in PQC protocols - nega-cyclic (and cyclic)lattices - and provide a quantum algorithmic framework that efficiently encodes the structured lattices into Hamiltonians by exploiting their underlying symmetries. The efficient encoding substantially reduces the dimension of the corresponding Hilbert space by limiting it to a relevant subspace where short vectors are likely to be found - leading to significant savings in quantum resources (e.g. qubit count and circuit depth) required to implement a quantum algorithm for finding short vectors. We analytically prove the efficient encoding procedure and benchmark the proposed framework using the variational quantum eigensolver, demonstrating improved results with reduced quantum resources.</p>

            <p>The paper by C. Bradac et al. [Nat. Commun. 8, 1205 (2017)] discusses room-temperature superradiance from NV color centers in diamonds. It presents a new model intended to reflect experimental characteristics of this phenomenon. To validate the model, the authors provide experimental results that are subsequently compared with numerical calculations derived from the scheme. Motivated by our own experiments with the fluorescence of similar NV samples, we attempted to create a theoretical model to accurately describe experimental systems. Initially, we aimed to incorporate the numerical equations from Bradac et al.'s paper's supplement into our own theoretical framework. However, we encountered numerous issues resulting in non-physical results such as negative photon counts or non-zero asymptotic fluorescence intensity. We identified these inconsistencies and proposed amendments to rectify them. We have developed our own framework by correctly reinterpreting the terms of the master equation. The resulting formulas produce physically meaningful results consistent with experimental data.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tzu-Hsuan Huang, Yeong-Luh Ueng</p>
            <p>Recent research has shown that syndrome-based belief propagation using layered scheduling (sLBP) can not only accelerate the convergence rate but also improve the error rate performance by breaking the quantum trapping sets for quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes, showcasing a result distinct from classical error correction codes. In this paper, we consider edge-wise informed dynamic scheduling (IDS) for QLDPC codes based on syndrome-based residual belief propagation (sRBP). However, the construction of QLDPC codes and the identical prior intrinsic information assignment will result in an equal residual in many edges, causing a performance limitation for sRBP. Two heuristic strategies, including edge pool design and error pre-correction, are introduced to tackle this obstacle and quantum trapping sets. Then, a novel sRBP equipped with a predict-and-reduce-error mechanism (PRE-sRBP) is proposed, which can provide over one order of performance gain on the considered bicycle codes and symmetric hypergraph (HP) code under similar iterations compared to sLBP.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniele Lamberto, Gabriele Orlando, Salvatore Savasta</p>
            <p>The occurrence of a second-order quantum phase transition in the Dicke model is a well-established feature. On the contrary, a comprehensive understanding of the corresponding open system, particularly in the proximity of the critical point, remains elusive. When approaching the critical point, the system inevitably enters first the system-bath ultrastrong coupling regime and finally the deepstrong coupling regime, causing the failure of usual approximations adopted to describe open quantum systems. We study the interaction of the Dicke model with bosonic bath fields in the absence of additional approximations, which usually relies on the weakness of the system-bath coupling. We find that the critical point is not affected by the interaction with the environment. Moreover, the interaction with the environment is not able to affect the system ground-state condensates in the superradiant phase, whereas the bath fields are infected by the system and acquire macroscopic occupations. The obtained reflection spectra display lineshapes which become increasingly asymmetric, both in the normal and superradiant phases, when approaching the critical point.</p>

Towards helping the reader to spot trends and pick winners, we have surveyed the various families of optically addressable spin qubits and attempted to benchmark and identify the most promising ones in each. We go on to reveal further trends that demonstrate how qubit lifetimes depend on the material's synthesis, the concentration/distribution of its embedded qubits, and the experimental conditions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryo B. Tanaka, Goro Oohata, Takayuki Uozumi</p>
            <p>We theoretically investigated the mechanism of quantum entanglement between the spin of photoelectrons and linear polarization of emitted X-ray photons in the 3$d\rightarrow\ $2$p$ XEPECS process for $\rm Ti_{2}O_{3}$. In the calculation, we used a realistic $\rm TiO_{6}$-type cluster model with the full multiplet structure of the Ti ion and the charge-transfer effect between the Ti 3$d$ and ligand O 2$p$ orbitals. We found that quantum entanglement occurs between the spin of photoelectrons and linear polarization of emitted X-ray photons and that it depends on the angular geometry in the XEPECS process. In addition, we found that the degree of spin and polarization entanglement decreases as the Ti 3$d\ $- O 2$p$ hybridization becomes stronger and as the crystal field modifies the electronic states in terms of the tangle, an index for the degree of entanglement. These results highlight the crucial role of the charge transfer and crystal field effects in determining entanglement properties in real material systems.</p>

            <p>Magnetic impurities are known to degrade superconductivity. For this reason, physical vapor deposition chambers that have previously been used for magnetic materials have generally been avoided for making high-quality superconducting resonator devices. In this article, we show by example that such chambers can be used for this purpose; with Nb films sputtered in a chamber that continues to be used for magnetic materials, we demonstrate compact (\SI{3}{\micro\meter} gap) coplanar waveguide resonators with low-power internal quality factors near one million. We achieve this using a resist strip bath with no post-fabrication acid treatment, which results in performance comparable to previous strip baths with acid treatments. We also find evidence that this improved resist strip bath provides a better surface chemical template for post-fabrication hydrogen fluoride processing. These results are consistent across three Si substrate preparation methods, including a \SI{700}{\celsius} anneal. These results will inform nanofabrication for other superconducting materials and the integration of magnetic materials for hybrid systems.</p>

            <p>The advection-diffusion equation is simulated on a superconducting quantum computer via several quantum algorithms. Three formulations are considered: (1) Trotterization, (2) variational quantum time evolution (VarQTE), and (3) adaptive variational quantum dynamics simulation (AVQDS). These schemes were originally developed for the Hamiltonian simulation of many-body quantum systems. The finite-difference discretized operator of the transport equation is formulated as a Hamiltonian and solved without the need for ancillary qubits. Computations are conducted on a quantum simulator (IBM Qiskit Aer) and an actual quantum hardware (IBM Fez). The former emulates the latter without the noise. The predicted results are compared with direct numerical simulation (DNS) data with infidelities of the order $10^{-5}$. In the quantum simulator, Trotterization is observed to have the lowest infidelity and is suitable for fault-tolerant computation. The AVQDS algorithm requires the lowest gate count and the lowest circuit depth. The VarQTE algorithm is the next best in terms of gate counts, but the number of its optimization variables is directly proportional to the number of qubits. Due to current hardware limitations, Trotterization cannot be implemented, as it has an overwhelming large number of operations. Meanwhile, AVQDS and VarQTE can be executed, but suffer from large errors due to significant hardware noise. These algorithms present a new paradigm for computational transport phenomena on quantum computers.</p>

            <p>Quantum Graph Neural Networks (QGNNs) offer a promising approach to combining quantum computing with graph-structured data processing. While classical Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are scalable and robust, existing QGNNs often lack flexibility due to graph-specific quantum circuit designs, limiting their applicability to diverse real-world problems. To address this, we propose a versatile QGNN framework inspired by GraphSAGE, using quantum models as aggregators. We integrate inductive representation learning techniques with parameterized quantum convolutional and pooling layers, bridging classical and quantum paradigms. The convolutional layer is flexible, allowing tailored designs for specific tasks. Benchmarked on a node regression task with the QM9 dataset, our framework, using a single minimal circuit for all aggregation steps, handles molecules with varying numbers of atoms without changing qubits or circuit architecture. While classical GNNs achieve higher training performance, our quantum approach remains competitive and often shows stronger generalization as molecular complexity increases. We also observe faster learning in early training epochs. To mitigate trainability limitations of a single-circuit setup, we extend the framework with multiple quantum aggregators on QM9. Assigning distinct circuits to each hop substantially improves training performance across all cases. Additionally, we numerically demonstrate the absence of barren plateaus as qubit numbers increase, suggesting that the proposed model can scale to larger, more complex graph-based problems.</p>

            <p>To utilize higher-dimensional quantum systems, in this Letter, we derive a generalized cross-resonance (GCR) scheme for realizing maximally entangling two-qutrit gates on fixed-frequency transmons beyond the 0-1 subspace. Our two-qutrit gates, namely, $U_{CR}^{01}$ and $U_{CR}^{12}$, acting on the $0{\text -}1$ and $1{\text -}2$ energy transitions of transmons, respectively, directly allow for entanglement on the $1{\text -}2$ levels. Unlike the known works, our gate is parametric in nature, enabling us to construct multiple entangling gates of interest. By performing simulations in Qiskit, we demonstrate two-qutrit generalized controlled-$X$ ($U_{CX}^{01}$ and $U_{CX}^{12}$) and controlled-$H$ ($U_{CH}^{01}$ and $U_{CH}^{12}$) gates, which are instances of the proposed $U_{CR}$ gates, with reported gate fidelities of $86.14\%~(99.73\%),~84.6\%~(97.88\%),~92.35\%~(99.39\%)$, and $91.99\%~(98.99\%)$, respectively with (and without) noise. We also reveal a two-qutrit Bell state with a fidelity of $99.06 \pm 0.01\%$, with a complete Bell state preparation in a $\sim514$ ns pulse sequence, which is less than the gate time of the known scheme by cross-Kerr-based entangling gates.</p>

            <p>So far, certifying quantum devices from their input-output statistics, under minimal assumptions, required the preparation of specific pure quantum states. Recently, Xu et al. [Phys.

Here, we address this problem and present an experimentally robust method that eliminates the need of preparing states with high fidelity with respect to specific pure states. We demonstrate the feasibility of the method by experimentally certifying photonic devices implementing Peres' set of 24 ququart observables [J. Phys. A 24, L175 (1991)] and Yu and Oh's set of 13 qutrit observables [Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 030402 (2012)], using maximally mixed states as input. This approach offers a crucial advantage for certifying high-dimensional quantum systems, since it works with maximally mixed and thermal states.</p>

To this effect, we focus on quantum sampling and introduce a constant-depth measurement-driven approach for efficiently sampling from a broad class of commuting diagonal quantum circuits and associated structured phase states, previously requiring polynomial-depth unitary circuits. By interleaving mid-circuit measurements with feed-forward in randomized "fan-out staircases", our dynamical circuits bypass Lieb-Robinson light-cone constraints, enabling global entanglement with flexible auxiliary qubit usage on bounded-degree lattices (e.g., two-dimensional grids). The generated phase states exhibit random-matrix statistics and anti-concentration comparable to fully random architectures. We further demonstrate measurement-driven feature maps that distinguish phases of an extended SSH model from random eigenstates in a quantum machine-learning benchmark (reservoir computing). Technologically, our results harness mid-circuit measurements to realize quantum advantages on bounded-degree hardware with a favorable topology. Conceptually, they provide complexity-theoretic support for quantum speedups by mid-circuit measurements.</p>

The resulting second law of thermodynamics is strictly tighter than the conventional one and it demands the output light to be more noisy than the input light. We illustrate our framework across several well-established models and we show how the three-level maser can be understood as an engine that reduces the noise of a coherent drive. Our framework opens a new avenue for investigating the noise properties of driven-dissipative quantum systems.</p>

By incorporating this shift in the energy cost function, we show that the LPF control can achieve the minimum phonon occupation number that is lower than cold damping with a band-pass filter, that with delayed feedback, and linear--quadratic--Gaussian (LQG) control, the last two of which are the standard methods of ground-state cooling of a levitated nanoparticle. For the detection efficiency of $90\%$, the achievable phonon occupation number with the LPF control is about one third, two fifths and one half of that of cold damping with a band-pass filter, that with delayed feedback, and LQG control, respectively. Thus our method has a decisive advantage to reach the absolute ground state.</p>

            <p>Unitary errors, such as those arising from fault-tolerant compilation of quantum algorithms, systematically bias observable estimates. Correcting this bias typically requires additional resources, such as an increased number of non-Clifford gates. In this work, we present an alternative method for correcting bias in the expectation values of observables. The method leverages a decomposition of the ideal quantum channel into a probabilistic mixture of noisy quantum channels. Using this decomposition, we construct unbiased estimators as weighted sums of expectation values obtained from the noisy channels. We provide a detailed analysis of the method, identify the conditions under which it is effective, and validate its performance through numerical simulations. In particular, we demonstrate unbiased observable estimation in the presence of unitary errors by simulating the time dynamics of the Ising Hamiltonian. Our strategy offers a resource-efficient way to reduce the impact of unitary errors, improving methods for estimating observables in noisy near-term quantum devices and fault-tolerant implementation of quantum algorithms.</p>

            <p>Photoelectron circular dichroism (PECD) manifests as a forward-backward asymmetry of electron emission in the direction orthogonal to the light polarization plane via one-photon ionization of chiral molecules with circularly polarized light. Multi-polar `PECD' currents, i.e., currents resolved along multiple directions, have also been predicted using two mutually-orthogonal linearly polarized light with carrier frequencies $\omega$ and $2\omega$. These currents arise from the interference between the one- and two-photon transitions. Here, we will show that photoelectron spin detection already reveals enantio-sensitive multi-polar currents in the one-photon regime since the two axes can be marked by the photoelectron momentum $\unitvec{k}$ and spin-detection axis $\unitvec{s}$. Specifically, we consider one-photon ionization of an isotropic ensemble of randomly oriented chiral molecules and show that the direction of the resulting photoelectron current is enantio-sensitively `locked' to the photoelectron's spin, which is mediated by two mechanisms. First, is the Bloch pseudovector which enables a collinear locking forming either a spin-sink or source for opposite enantiomers. Second, is the spin torque pseudovector that enables orthogonal locking forming a spin vortex in the polarization plane that rotates in opposite directions for opposite enantiomers. The former effect is a spin analog of photoelectron vortex dichroism (\href{this https URL}{Phys. Rev.

By diagonalizing the Hamiltonian, we identify a zero-energy defect state localized at a domain wall of the FSL, whose spin polarization is topologically protected. To address the challenge of applying band topology to the FSL, we introduce a physically motivated and directly measurable topological invariant based on phase-space geometry-the phase-space winding number. We show that the Zak phase, computed using a phase-space parameter, is related to the invariant. This quantized geometric phase reflects the spin polarization of the defect state, demonstrating a bulk-boundary correspondence. The resulting phase-space topology reveals the emergence of single-atom dressed states with contrasting properties-topologically protected spin states and driving-tunable bosonic states. Our results establish phase-space topology as a novel framework for exploring topological physics in single-atom synthetic dimensions, uncovering quantum-unique topological protection distinct from classical analogs.</p>

            <h2>State change via one-dimensional scattering in quantum mechanics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Olivia Pomerenk, Charles S. Peskin</p>
            <p>This study aims to address the nature of state change, measurement, and probabilistic outcomes in non-relativistic quantum mechanics. We consider a pair of particles that interact in a one-dimensional setting via a delta-function potential. One of the particles is confined to a one-dimensional box, and the other particle is free. The free particle is incident from the left with specified energy, and it may cause changes in state of the confined particle before flying away to the left or to the right. We present a formulation and computational scheme that avoids the use of perturbation theory and determines the probability of any such outcome as a function of the initial state of the confined particle and the energy of the incident particle. As demonstrated by a direct comparison, this presented method holds multiple advantages over a standard perturbative method. The problem formulation and corresponding computational scheme may have applications in physical settings which admit one-dimensional scattering, e.g., in the study of quantum wires or quantum dots.</p>

            <p>We propose and validate a framework for analog simulation of the Heisenberg spin model using a circuit quantum electrodynamics (circuit-QED) platform. Our method involves the Dyson-Maleev transformation, for which we develop a procedure to circumvent its inherent non-Hermiticity, yielding the extended Bose-Hubbard (EBH) Hamiltonian. We demonstrate the equivalence of this approach to the Holstein-Primakoff encoding for spin-1/2 systems. For the experimental realization of this EBH model, we design a scalable circuit-QED architecture based on an engineered Josephson junction array. Numerical simulations confirm that the microwave photon dynamics in this simulator accurately reproduces the original spin dynamics. Our work establishes an experimentally accessible method for investigating complex quantum spin dynamics in a highly controllable bosonic setting.</p>

            <h2>Do mixed states exhibit deep thermalisation?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alan Sherry, Sthitadhi Roy</p>
            <p>Deep thermalisation -- where ensembles of pure states on a local subsystem, conditioned on measurement outcomes on its complement, approach universal maximum-entropy ensembles -- represents a stronger form of ergodicity than conventional thermalisation. We show that this framework fails dramatically for mixed initial states, evolved unitarily, even with infinitesimal initial mixedness. To address this, we introduce a new paradigm of deep thermalisation for mixed states, fundamentally distinct from that for pure-state ensembles. In our formulation, the deep thermal ensemble arises by tracing out auxiliary degrees of freedom from a maximum-entropy ensemble defined on an augmented system, with the ensemble structure depending explicitly on the entropy of the initial state. We demonstrate that such ensembles emerge dynamically in generic, locally interacting chaotic systems. For the self-dual kicked Ising chain, which we show to be exactly solvable for a class of mixed initial states, we find exact emergence of the so-defined mixed-state deep thermal ensemble at finite times. Our results therefore lead to fundamental insights into how maximum entropy principles and deep thermalisation manifest themselves in unitary dynamics of states with finite entropy.</p>

            <h2>The spatiotemporal Born rule is quasiprobabilistic</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> James Fullwood, Zhihao Ma, Zhen Wu</p>
            <p>Contrary to general relativity, quantum theory treats space and time in fundamentally different ways. In particular, while joint probabilities associated with spacelike separated measurements are defined in terms of the Born rule, joint probabilities associated with measurements performed in sequence are defined in terms of the state-update rule. In this work, we show that one obtains a more unified perspective of space and time in quantum theory by embracing a quasiprobabilistic description of sequential measurements. More precisely, we show that there exists a unique \emph{pseudo}-density operator encoding canonical quasiprobabilities associated with sequential measurements in precisely the same manner that a density operator encodes joint probabilities associated with spacelike separated measurements, thus providing a natural extension of the Born rule into the temporal domain. As an application, we show how such a spatiotemporal Born rule combined in conjunction with a quantum Bayes' rule yields an operational notion of time-reversal symmetry for sequential measurements on an \emph{open} quantum system.</p>

            <h2>Complexity in multi-qubit and many-body systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Imre Varga</p>
            <p>Characterizing complexity and criticality in quantum systems requires diagnostics that are both computationally tractable and physically insightful. We apply a measure of quantum state complexity for n-qubit systems, defined as the divergence between the Shannon or von Neumann entropy of the computational basis distribution and the second-order Renyi entropy. This quantity has already been used earlier termed as structural entropy and it is particularly powerful as the Renyi entropy is directly related to state purity, linear entropy, and the inverse participation ratio, providing a clear physical grounding. While other Renyi orders could be used, the second order offers a deep and established connection to these key physical quantities. We first validate the measure in canonical noise channels, showing it peaks at the boundary between quantum and classical regimes. We then demonstrate its power in many-body physics. For systems exhibiting a many-body localization transition - including deformed random matrix ensembles and a disordered Heisenberg spin chain - the complexity measure reliably signals the crossover from integrable/localized to quantum-chaotic/ergodic phases. Crucially, the maximum complexity occurs in the non-ergodic yet extended states at the transition, precisely capturing the critical region where the system is neither fully localized nor thermalized. Furthermore, within the chaotic phase, the measure correlates with the survival probability of local excitations, revealing a spectrum of thermalization properties. Our results establish that the entropic complexity is a simple, versatile, and effective probe for identifying nontrivial quantum regimes and transitions giving a new and alternative insight into such systems.</p>

            <h2>Entangling Power and Its Deviation: A Quantitative Analysis on Input-State Dependence and Variability in Entanglement Generation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kyoungho Cho, Jeongho Bang</p>
            <p>Quantifying the entangling capability of quantum operations is a fundamental task in quantum information science. Traditionally, this capability is measured by the entangling power (EP), defined as the average entanglement generated when a quantum operation acts uniformly on all possible product states. However, EP alone cannot capture the intricate input-state-dependent nature of entanglement generation. To address this, we define a complementary metric -- entangling power deviation (EPD) -- as the standard deviation of entanglement generated over all product input states, thereby capturing the multifaceted nature of entangling behavior. We develop a general group-theoretical framework that yields closed-form expressions for both EP and EPD. Our analysis shows that any nontrivial entangling operation necessarily exhibits input-state dependence: nonzero EP implies a nonzero EPD. By analyzing representative two-qubit gates, we show that the gates with identical EP can exhibit markedly different EPD values, illustrating that the nature of entanglement generation can significantly differ depending on the gate functionality. Extending our framework to a class of generalized controlled-unitary operations acting on bipartite Hilbert spaces of arbitrary dimensions, we further analyze the interplay between the entangling strength and uniformity, as quantified by EP and EPD. Moreover, we uncover a subtle dimension-parity-dependent behavior in entanglement generation, which EP alone fails to detect. These findings highlight EPD as an indispensable diagnostic tool -- one that, alongside EP, provides a deeper and more complete characterization of the entangling structure.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maria-Andreea Filip, Nathan Fitzpatrick</p>
            <p>We consider a quantum algorithm for ground-state preparation based on a Chebyshev series approximation to the wall function. In a classical setting, this approach is appealing as it guarantees rapid convergence. We analyze the asymptotic scaling and success probabilities of different quantum implementations and provide numerical benchmarks, comparing the performance of the wall-Chebyshev projectors with current state-of-the-art approaches. We find that this approach requires fewer serial applications of the Hamiltonian oracle to achieve a given ground state fidelity, but is severely limited by exponentially decaying success probability. However, we find that some implementations maintain non-trivial success probability in regimes where wall-Chebyshev projection leads to a fidelity improvement over other approaches. As the wall-Chebyshev projector is highly robust to loose known upper bounds on the true ground state energy, it offers a potential resource trade-off, particulary in the early fault-tolerant regime of quantum computation.</p>

            <p>Variational Quantum Computing (VQC) faces fundamental scalability barriers, primarily due to barren plateaus and sensitivity to quantum noise. To address these challenges, we introduce TensorHyper-VQC, a novel tensor-train (TT)-guided hypernetwork framework that significantly improves the robustness and scalability of VQC. Our framework fully delegates the generation of quantum circuit parameters to a classical TT network, effectively decoupling optimization from quantum hardware. This innovative parameterization mitigates gradient vanishing, enhances noise resilience through structured low-rank representations, and facilitates efficient gradient propagation. Grounded in Neural Tangent Kernel and statistical learning theory, our rigorous theoretical analyses establish strong guarantees on approximation capability, optimization stability, and generalization performance. Extensive empirical results across quantum dot classification, Max-Cut optimization, and molecular quantum simulation tasks demonstrate that TensorHyper-VQC consistently achieves superior performance and robust noise tolerance, including hardware-level validation on a 156-qubit IBM Heron processor. These results position TensorHyper-VQC as a scalable and noise-resilient framework for advancing practical quantum machine learning on near-term devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohamed Hatifi</p>
            <p>We show that the distance between two qubits coupled to a structured reservoir acts as a single geometric control that can store, revive, or suppress Bell nonlocality. In a mirror-terminated guide, quantum correlations lost to the bath return at discrete recurrence times, turning a product state into a Bell-violating one without any entangling drive (only local basis rotations/readout). In the continuum limit, we derive closed-form criteria for the emergence of nonlocality from backflow, and introduce a Bell-based analogue of the BLP measure to quantify this effect. We also show how subwavelength displacements away from a decoherence-free node quadratically reduce the lifetime of a dark state or bright state, enabling highly sensitive interferometric detection. All results rely on analytically solvable models and are compatible with current superconducting and nanophotonic platforms, offering a practical route to passive, geometry-controlled non-Markovian devices.</p>

            <p>Periodic driving is used to steer physical systems to unique stationary states or nonequilibrium steady states (NESS), producing enhanced properties inaccessible to non-driven systems. For open quantum systems, characterizing the NESS is challenging and existing results are generally limited to specific types of driving and the Born-Markov approximation. Here we go beyond these limits by studying a generic periodically driven $ N$-level quantum system interacting with a low-density thermal gas. Exploiting the framework of Floquet scattering theory, we establish general Floquet thermalization conditions constraining the nature of the NESS and the transition rates. Moreover, we examine theoretically the structure of the NESS in the high temperature limit, and find out that the NESS complies, rather surprisingly, with an uniform probability distribution (predicted by the Boltzmann law) for any driving. Numerical calculations illustrate our theoretical elaborations for a simple toy model.</p>

            <p>This study investigates quantum-enhanced parameter estimation through continuous monitoring in open quantum systems that exhibit a dissipative time crystal phase. We first analytically derive the global quantum Fisher information (QFI) rate for boundary time crystals (BTCs), demonstrating that within the time-crystal phase, the ultimate precision exhibits a cubic scaling with the system size, $f_{\mathrm{global}}\sim N^3$. We then generalize this finding to a broader class of dynamics, including the transverse collective dephasing (TCD) model, which achieves a time-crystal phase through a closing Liouvillian gap without requiring a dissipative phase transition. We proceed to numerically demonstrate that this maximal global QFI rate is experimentally attainable for both the BTC and TCD models, even at finite system sizes, via continuous homodyne and photodetection. Moving towards practical implementations, we analyze the precision limits under inefficient detection, revealing a critical difference: for BTC dynamics, inefficiencies asymptotically restore a classical scaling, and only a constant-factor quantum advantage remains possible. In contrast, for TCD dynamics, a super-classical scaling is still in principle observable, and our numerical simulations confirm its presence, even under inefficient measurement conditions, establishing the TCD model as a highly robust platform for quantum metrology.</p>

However, optimal pathfinding is computationally intensive, particularly in complex topologies. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to quantum routing, which avoids the inherent overhead of conventional quantum pathfinding, by establishing directly entanglement between remote nodes. Our approach exploits graph complement strategies.

            <h2>Polynomial-time Extraction of Entanglement Resources</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Si-Yi Chen, Angela Sara Cacciapuoti, Marcello Caleffi</p>
            <p>The extraction of EPR pairs and n-qubits GHZ states among remote nodes in quantum networks constitutes the resource primitives for end-to-end and on-demand communications. However, the Bell-VM problem, which determines whether a given graph state can be transformed into a set of Bell pairs on specific vertices (not necessarily remote), is known to be NP-complete. In this paper, we extend this problem, not only by focusing on nodes remote within generic graph states, but also by determining the number of extractable n-qubit remote GHZ states -- beside the number of remote EPR pairs. The rationale for tackling the extraction of GHZ states among remote nodes, rather than solely remote EPR pairs, is that a GHZ state enables the dynamic extraction of an EPR pair between any pair of nodes sharing the state. This, in turn, implies the ability of accommodating the traffic requests on-the-fly. Specially, we propose a polynomial-time algorithm for solving the aforementioned NP-complete problem. Our results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is able to effectively adapt to generic graph states for extracting entanglement resources across remote nodes.</p>

In this work, we present preliminary theoretical results demonstrating that, by applying tools of the quantum random walk framework to the spatial superposition of channels, it is possible to replicate the output of a quantum switch.

            <p>We introduce a unified framework -- Quantum Neural Ordinary and Partial Differential Equations (QNODEs and QNPDEs) -- which extends the continuous-time formalism of classical neural ordinary and partial differential equations into quantum machine learning and quantum control. QNODEs denote the evolution of finite-dimensional quantum systems, whereas QNPDEs denote their infinite-dimensional (continuous-variable) counterparts; both are governed by generalised Schrödinger-type Hamiltonian dynamics, coupled with a corresponding loss function. This formalism permits gradient estimation via an adjoint-state method, facilitating efficient learning of quantum dynamics, and other dynamics that can be mapped (relatively easily) to quantum dynamics. Using this method, we present quantum algorithms for computing gradients with and without time discretisation, achieving efficient gradient computation that would otherwise be intractable on classical devices. We provide detailed resource estimates for these algorithms and investigate the local energy landscape for training. The formalism subsumes a wide array of applications, including quantum state preparation, Hamiltonian learning, learning dynamics in open systems, and the learning of both autonomous and non-autonomous classical ODEs and PDEs. In many cases of interest, the Hamiltonian is composed of a relatively small number of local operators, yet the corresponding classical simulation remains inefficient, making quantum approaches advantageous for gradient estimation. This continuous-time perspective can also serve as a blueprint for designing novel quantum neural network architectures, generalising discrete-layered models into continuous-depth models.</p>

Yet experimental validation of such higher-order interference effects in deployed metropolitan fiber networks remains limited. Here, we report a field demonstration of polarization-controlled reconfigurable four-photon interference over a commercially deployed metropolitan fiber network. Using a fully fiber-coupled linear-optical platform, we observe a fusion-type four-photon interference signature in the presence of real-world impairments, including photon loss, polarization drift, and timing uncertainty. By performing polarization-resolved measurements on two locally retained photons, we conditionally select distinct two-photon coincidence channels that exhibit Bell-like and N00N-like behavior under an idealized source model. Rather than pursuing multi-partite entanglement verification, this work focuses on establishing the technical feasibility of multi-photon interference and reconfigurable conditional state preparation in an operational network environment. These results serve as a systems-level validation milestone toward future multi-photon quantum-networking architectures that require robust interference performance outside the laboratory.</p>

            <p>Within the familiar circuit-based quantum computational setting, we introduce and analyze a toy model of a quantum physical device capable of internal, self-referential deliberation. The key idea is to represent ``deliberation'' as a coherent iterative branching process, in which competing branch-dependent system evolutions are maintained in superposition, with additional control and memory registers recording branch histories, and the policy register adaptively biasing subsequent development. We provide explicit quantum circuit realizations and carry out detailed step-by-step derivations of the entangled control--memory--system--policy dynamics. We carefully distinguish between internally adaptive and internally reinforced deliberations, proposing the architectures for both, and briefly discuss categorical and controlled--Stinespring reformulations, as well as their conceptual implications. The primary construction models a memory-driven deliberation where the policy update depends on which actions were taken, not on their results. We also present a simple extension that allows for minimalistic, outcome-driven policy updates, implementing a coherent feedback loop that steers the system toward a target state regardless of initial branch-dependent evolution. This loop can be interpreted as a quantum autopilot or search-and-rescue mechanism, illustrating how a device can autonomously correct and optimize its internal strategy in superposition. Finally, we briefly consider various implementations of a dialogue that may take place between two deliberating machines. Taken together, this frames the proposed model as a plausible setting for exploring how such devices may maintain multiple alternatives in parallel, while performing an internal decision-making process through coherent branching, entanglement, adaptive policy updates, and policy-driven self-modifying unitary dynamics.</p>

            <p>Quantum detectors of single photons are an essential component for quantum information processing across computing, communication and networking. Today's quantum detection system, which consists of single photon detectors, timing electronics, control and data processing software, is primarily used for counting the number of single photon detection events. However, it is largely incapable of extracting other rich physical characteristics of the detected photons, such as their wavelengths, polarization states, photon numbers, or temporal waveforms. This work, for the first time, demonstrates a smart quantum detection system, SQuaD, which integrates a field programmable gate array (FPGA) with a neural network model, and is designed to recognize the features of photons and to eliminate detector dark-count. The SQuaD is a fully integrated quantum system with high timing-resolution data acquisition, onboard multi-scale data analysis, intelligent feature recognition and extraction, and feedback-driven system control. Our \name experimentally demonstrates 1) reliable photon counting on par with the state-of-the art commercial systems; 2) high-throughput data processing for each individual detection events; 3) efficient dark count recognition and elimination; 4) up to 100\% accurate feature recognition of photon wavelength and polarization.

PhotonIDs ~demonstrates: 1) an FPGA-based high-speed data acquisition platform that selectively captures the full waveform of signal only while filtering out the background data in real time; 2) an efficient signal preprocessing pipeline, and a novel pseudo-position metric that is derived from the physical temporal-spatial features of each detected event; 3) a hybrid machine learning model with near 98% accuracy achieved on photon/dark count classification. Additionally, proposed PhotonIDs ~ is evaluated on the dark count elimination performance with two real-world case studies: (1) 20 km quantum link, and (2) Erbium ion-based photon emission system.

            <p>In this work, we investigate the velocity effects on information degradation due to the Unruh effect in accelerated quantum systems (with finite interaction time). We consider a detector moving along a spatial trajectory within a two-dimensional plane. The quantum systems studied were: accelerated single-qubit, quantum interferometric circuit, and which-path distinguishability circuit. Thus, for non-relativistic velocity regime, we obtained analytical expressions such as transition rates, quantum coherence, visibility, distinguishability, and the complementarity relation. On the other hand, for the ultra-relativistic velocity regime, we saw that the Unruh effect is suppressed and therefore the detector does not respond in this case. Our findings revealed that velocity effects imply mitigation of information degradation, this interesting behaviors happen because of the composite effect of both velocity and acceleration. The results obtained show that the addition of the non-relativistic, transverse and constant motion of an accelerated detector can play a protective role in quantumness in systems at high accelerations, although the effects are very small.</p>

            <p>We pose and solve the problem of quantum filtering based on continuous-in-time quadrature measurements (homodyning) for the case where the quantum process is in a thermal state. The standard construction of quantum filters involves the determination of the conditional expectation onto the von Neumann algebra generated by the measured observables with the non-demolition principle telling us to restrict the domain (the observables to be estimated) to the commutant of the algebra. The finite-temperature case, however, has additional structure: we use the Araki-Woods representation for the measured quadratures, but the Tomita-Takesaki theory tells us that there exists a separate, commuting representation and therefore the commutant will have a richer structure than encountered in the Fock vacuum case. We apply this to the question of quantum trajectories to the Davies-Fulling-Unruh model. Here, the two representations are interpreted as the fields in the right and left Rindler wedges.</p>

            <h2>Self-dual bivariate bicycle codes with transversal Clifford gates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zijian Liang, Yu-An Chen</p>
            <p>Bivariate bicycle codes are promising candidates for high-threshold, low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum memories. Meanwhile, color codes are the most prominent self-dual CSS codes, supporting transversal Clifford gates that have been demonstrated experimentally. In this work, we combine these advantages and introduce a broad family of self-dual bivariate bicycle codes. These codes achieve higher encoding rates than surface and color codes while admitting transversal CNOT, Hadamard, and $S$ gates. In particular, we enumerate weight-8 self-dual bivariate bicycle codes with up to $n \leq 200$ physical qubits, realized on twisted tori that enhance code distance and improve stabilizer locality. Representative examples include codes with parameters $[[n,k,d]]$: $[[16,4,4]]$, $[[40,6,6]]$, $[[56,6,8]]$, $[[64,8,8]]$, $[[120,8,12]]$, $[[152,6,16]]$, and $[[160,8,16]]$.</p>

            <h2>A quantum state transfer protocol with Ising Hamiltonians</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oscar Michel, Matthias Werner, Arnau Riera</p>
            <p>Quantum state transfer is a fundamental requirement for scalable quantum computation, where fast and reliable communication between distant subsystems is essential. In this work, we present a protocol for quantum state transfer in linear Ising chains. Starting from a perfect state transfer scheme via a Heisenberg Hamiltonian with inhomogeneous couplings, we adapt it for architectures implementing the transverse-field Ising model by encoding the information in domain walls. The resulting linear Ising chain makes quantum transport experiments accessible to many platforms for analog quantum simulation. We test the protocol for 1-, 2-, and 3- spin states, obtaining high transfer fidelities of up to 0.99 and study the accuracy dependence on the domain wall approximation. These results are the first step in paving the way for an experimental implementation of the protocol.</p>

            <p>The state hidden subgroup problem (StateHSP) is a recent generalization of the hidden subgroup problem. We present an algorithm that solves the non-abelian StateHSP over $N$ copies of the dihedral group of order $8$ (the symmetries of a square).

Our algorithm is polynomial in the number of samples and computational time, and requires only constant depth circuits. This result extends previous work on the abelian StateHSP and, as a special case, provides a solution for the ordinary hidden subgroup problem on this specific non-abelian group.</p>

            <h2>An Information-Minimal Geometry for Qubit-Efficient Optimization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gordon Ma, Dimitris G. Angelakis</p>
            <p>Qubit-efficient optimization studies how large combinatorial problems can be addressed with quantum circuits whose width is far smaller than the number of logical variables. In quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO), objective values depend only on one- and two-body statistics, yet standard variational algorithms explore exponentially large Hilbert spaces. We recast qubit-efficient optimization as a geometric question: what is the minimal representation the objective itself requires? Focusing on QUBO problems, we show that enforcing mutual consistency among pairwise statistics defines a convex body -- the level-2 Sherali-Adams polytope -- that captures the information on which quadratic objectives depend. We operationalize this geometry in a minimal variational pipeline that separates representation, consistency, and decoding: a logarithmic-width circuit produces pairwise moments, a differentiable information projection enforces local feasibility, and a maximum-entropy ensemble provides a principled global decoder. This information-minimal construction achieves near-optimal approximation ratios on large unweighted Max-Cut instances (up to N=2000) at shallow depth, indicating that pairwise polyhedral geometry already captures the relevant structure in this regime. By making the information-minimal geometry explicit, this work establishes a clean baseline for qubit-efficient optimization and sharpens the question of where genuinely quantum structure becomes necessary.</p>

            <p>Quantum walks, the quantum analogue to the classical random walk, have been shown to model fluid dynamics. Neutral atom hardware is a promising choice of platform for implementing quantum walks due to its ability to implement native multiqubit ($\geq\!3$-qubit) gates and to dynamically re-arrange qubits. Using error modelling for multiqubit Rydberg gates via two-photon adiabatic rapid passage, we present the gate sequences and predicted final state fidelities for some toy quantum walks, including `lazy' quantum walks. These `lazy' quantum walks include a rest state and therefore provide an integral step towards quantum walks for fluid simulation.</p>

            <h2>From Device to Dynamics: An Iterative Architectural Framework for High-Performance Single-Photon Detection at Room Temperature</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hao Shu</p>
            <p>Photon detection is a cornerstone of quantum technology, traditionally regarded as a static device-level operation constrained by the intrinsic physical properties of single-photon detectors (SPDs). Consequently, high-performance detection has been heavily reliant on superconducting technologies, whose requirement for cryogenic temperatures imposes significant infrastructure burdens and limits scalable deployment. To circumvent these constraints, we propose the Enhanced Single-Photon Detection (ESPD) framework, which shifts the photon-detection paradigm from device-centric optimization to an integrated quantum-information-processing (QIP) task. By incorporating state preparation, controlled operations, projective measurements, and multi-copy decision analysis, we establish a nonlinear dynamical model that reformulates detection as an iteratively enhanced process. This architecture enables systematic performance upgrades through structural design rather than material modification, allowing high-performance detection with exclusively room-temperature hardware. Through analytical approximations, Monte Carlo analysis, and numerical simulations, we show that the ESPD dynamics converge to a high-performance basin of attraction even when initialized by low-performance SPDs. While physical realization requires further component integration efforts, this work establishes a rigorous theoretical foundation for enhancing detection via architectural QIP principles. It provides not only a blueprint for next-generation room-temperature photon detection but also a general methodology for transcending device-level constraints in broader quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Automated Compilation Including Dropouts: Tolerating Defective Components in Stabiliser Codes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stasiu Wolanski</p>
            <p>Utility-scale solid-state quantum devices will need to fabricate quantum devices at scale using imperfect processes. By introducing tolerance to fabrication defects into the design of the quantum devices, we can improve the yield of usable quantum chips and lower the cost of useful systems. Automated Compilation Including Dropouts (ACID) is a framework that works in the ancilla-free (or `middle-out') paradigm, to generate syndrome extraction circuits for general stabiliser codes in the presence of defective couplers or qubits. In the ancilla-free paradigm, we do not designate particular qubits as measurement ancillas, instead measuring stabilisers using any of the data qubits in their support. This approach leads to a great deal of flexibility in how syndrome extraction circuits can be implemented. ACID works by constructing and solving an optimisation problem within the ancilla-free paradigm to find a short syndrome extraction circuit. Applied to the surface code, ACID produces syndrome-extraction circuits of depth between $1\times$ (no overhead) and $1.5\times$ relative to the depth of defect-free circuits. The LUCI algorithm, the best prior art, yielded a $2 \times$ overhead, so ACID offers a significant time saving. The yield of surface code chips with a logical error rate at most $10\times$ the dropout-free baseline is up to $3\times$ higher using ACID than using LUCI. I demonstrate the broad applicability of ACID by compiling syndrome extraction circuits for bivariate bicycle codes and the colour code. For these circuits, we incur a circuit-depth overhead of between $1\times$ (no overhead) and $2.5\times$ relative to defect-free circuits. I believe this work is the first to simulate both of these families of codes in the presence of fabrication defects.</p>

            <h2>Leveraging Symmetry Merging in Pauli Propagation</h2>

            <p>We introduce a symmetry-adapted framework for simulating quantum dynamics based on Pauli propagation. When a quantum circuit possesses a symmetry, many Pauli strings evolve redundantly under actions of the symmetry group. We exploit this by merging Pauli strings related through symmetry transformations. This procedure, formalized as the symmetry-merging Pauli propagation algorithm, propagates only a minimal set of orbit representatives. Analytically, we show that symmetry merging reduces space complexity by a factor set by orbit sizes, with explicit gains for translation and permutation symmetries. Numerical benchmarks of all-to-all Heisenberg dynamics confirm improved stability, particularly under truncation and noise. Our results establish a group-theoretic framework for enhancing Pauli propagation, supported by open-source code demonstrating its practical relevance for classical quantum-dynamics simulations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maria Dincă, Tim Chan, Simon C. Benjamin</p>
            <p>Fault-tolerant quantum computers use decoders to monitor for errors and find a plausible correction. A decoder may provide a decoder confidence score (DCS) to gauge its success. We adopt a swim distance DCS, computed from the shortest path between syndrome clusters. By contracting tensor networks, we compare its performance to the well-known complementary gap and find that both reliably estimate the logical error probability (LEP) in a decoding window. We explore ways to use this to mitigate the LEP in entire circuits. For shallow circuits, we just abort if any decoding window produces an exceptionally low DCS: for a distance-13 surface code, rejecting a mere 0.1% of possible DCS values improves the entire circuit's LEP by more than 5 orders of magnitude. For larger algorithms comprising up to trillions of windows, DCS-based rejection remains effective for enhancing observable estimation. Moreover, one can use DCS to assign each circuit's output a unique LEP, and use it as a basis for maximum likelihood inference. This can reduce the effects of noise by an order of magnitude at no quantum cost; methods can be combined for further improvements.</p>

            <p>Time-dependent electromagnetic drives are fundamental for controlling complex quantum systems, including superconducting Josephson circuits. In these devices, accurate time-dependent Hamiltonian models are imperative for predicting their dynamics and designing high-fidelity quantum operations. Existing numerical methods, such as black-box quantization (BBQ) and energy-participation ratio (EPR), excel at modeling the static Hamiltonians of Josephson circuits. However, these techniques do not fully capture the behavior of driven circuits stimulated by external microwave drives, nor do they include a generalized approach to account for the inevitable noise and dissipation that enter through microwave ports. Here, we introduce novel numerical techniques that leverage classical microwave simulations that can be efficiently executed in finite element solvers, to obtain the time-dependent Hamiltonian of a microwave-driven superconducting circuit with arbitrary geometries. Importantly, our techniques do not rely on a lumped-element description of the superconducting circuit, in contrast to previous approaches to tackling this problem. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach by characterizing the driven properties of realistic circuit devices in complex electromagnetic environments, including coherent dynamics due to charge and flux modulation, as well as drive-induced relaxation and dephasing. Our techniques offer a powerful toolbox for optimizing circuit designs and advancing practical applications in superconducting quantum computing.</p>

            <p>Electrons bound to shallow donors in ZnSe quantum wells are promising candidates for optically addressable spin qubits and single-photon sources. However, their optical coherence and indistinguishability are often limited by spectral broadening arising from charge fluctuations in the local environment. Here, we report electrical control of single donor qubits in ZnSe quantum wells. The applied field induces a DC Stark shift that tunes the emission energy over a range exceeding 30 times the inhomogeneous linewidth, effectively compensating for emitter-to-emitter variations. Concurrently, the field stabilizes trap occupancy, yielding a twofold reduction in optical linewidth and the suppression of spectral wandering. A statistical model based on trap dynamics qualitatively reproduces these observations and elucidates the mechanism of field-assisted charge noise suppression. Our results identify electrical control as a versatile pathway to significantly improve optical and spin addressability.</p>

            <h2>Partial Collapse and Ensemble Invariance under Continuous Quantum Measurement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shalender Singh, Santosh Kumar</p>
            <p>Wavefunction collapse is commonly associated with unavoidable physical disturbance of the measured system. Here we show that in driven-dissipative quantum systems, continuous measurement can induce strong trajectory-level collapse while leaving the ensemble-averaged steady state strictly invariant. We identify measurement-invariant steady states whose unconditional density matrix remains unchanged under continuous monitoring, despite pronounced measurement-induced localization in conditioned quantum trajectories. This separation between trajectory-level collapse and ensemble invariance defines a regime of partial collapse, in which measurement-induced localization is continuously counteracted by dissipative dynamics. We derive a necessary and sufficient condition for steady-state invariance under continuous measurement and identify Liouvillian symmetry as a concrete dynamical mechanism enforcing it. Our results clarify the distinction between conditional collapse and physical disturbance in open quantum systems and provide a framework for non-invasive continuous monitoring in driven-dissipative settings.</p>

            <p>A theoretical analysis of the Casimir interaction between an arc and plate is conducted, which remains unexplored despite its relevance to Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) fabrication. The configuration consists of a rigid finite plate and a flexible curved nanomembrane, with radius 100 micrometers, initially concave toward the rigid plate. The maximum thickness is evaluated for which the nanomembrane undergoes a change in curvature: from concave to convex with respect to the plate, due to the Casimir interaction. The Casimir energy for a curved surface is derived using the Proximity Force Approximation (PFA) with next-to-leading-order (NTLO) corrections. Kirchhoff-Love theory for a thin isotropic plate of constant thickness is used to estimate the bending energy. Material-dependent effects on the Casimir interaction are evaluated by comparing Au and Ag plates. The maximum thickness is derived where U_Casimir > U_bending for distances in the range of 0.1-1 micrometers. Results show curvature reversal occurs for nanomembranes with nanoscale thicknesses at the studied distances. Silver nanomembranes tolerate greater thickness than gold nanomembranes due to material-dependent properties. Comparison between NTLO-corrected PFA and perturbative PFA confirms the accuracy of the NTLO approach. The Casimir arc-to-plate geometry in MEMS enables Casimir-based actuation, enhances devices reliability, and prevents stiction. These findings provide thickness constraints for MEMS design and performance, accounting for the Casimir force.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xian Shi</p>
            <p>Entanglement distillation and entanglement cost are fundamental tasks in quantum entanglement theory. This work studies both in the probabilistic setting and focuses on the asymptotic error exponent of probabilistic entanglement distillation when the operational model is $\delta$-approximately nonentangling or $\delta$-approximately dually nonentangling quantum instruments. While recent progress has clarified limitations of probabilistic transformations in general resource theories, an analytic formula for the error exponent of probabilistic entanglement distillation under approximately (dually) nonentangling operations has remained unavailable. Building on the framework of postselected quantum hypothesis testing, we establish a direct connection between probabilistic distillation and postselected hypothesis testing against the set of separable states. In particular, we derive an analytical characterization of the distillation error exponent under $\delta$-approximately nonentangling quantum instruments. Besides, we relate the exponent to postselected hypothesis testing with measurements restricted to be separable. We further investigate probabilistic entanglement dilution and establish a relation between probabilistic entanglement costs under approximately nonentangling and approximately dually nonentangling instruments, together with a bound on the probabilistic entanglement cost under nonentangling instruments.</p>

            <p>Scalable distributed quantum computing (DQC) has motivated the design of multiple quantum data-center (QDC) architectures that overcome the limitations of single quantum processors through modular interconnection. While these architectures adopt fundamentally different design philosophies, their relative performance under realistic quantum hardware constraints remains poorly understood. In this paper, we present a systematic benchmarking study of four representative QDC architectures-QFly, BCube, Clos, and Fat-Tree-quantifying their impact on distributed quantum circuit execution latency, resource contention, and scalability. Focusing on quantum-specific effects absent from classical data-center evaluations, we analyze how optical-loss-induced Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pair generation delays, coherence-limited entanglement retry windows, and contention from teleportation-based non-local gates shape end-to-end execution performance. Across diverse circuit workloads, we evaluate how architectural properties such as path diversity and path length, and shared BSM (Bell State Measurement) resources interact with optical-switch insertion loss and reconfiguration delay. Our results show that distributed quantum performance is jointly shaped by topology, scheduling policies, and physical-layer parameters, and that these factors interact in nontrivial ways. Together, these insights provide quantitative guidance for the design of scalable and high-performance quantum data-center architectures for DQC.</p>

This Perspective focuses on erasure qubits, which enable hardware-efficient quantum error correction, by concatenating an inner code built-in to the hardware with an outer code. We focus on implementations of dual-rail encoded erasure qubits using superconducting qubits, giving an overview of recent developments in theory and simulation, and hardware demonstrators.

We obtain the Weyl covariant derivative by complexifying the electromagnetic gauge coupling parameter.

The conserved current density is modified from $|\psi|^2$ to the local scale invariant, trajectory-dependent ratio $|\psi|^2/ \mathbf{1}^2[\mathcal{C}]$, where $\mathbf 1[\mathcal C]$ is a scale factor that depends on the pilot-wave trajectory $\mathcal C$ in configuration space. Our approach is general, and we implement it for the Schrödinger, Pauli, and Dirac equations coupled to an external electromagnetic field. We also implement it in quantum field theory for the case of a quantized axion field interacting with a quantized electromagnetic field. We discuss the equilibrium probability density and show that the corresponding trajectories are unique.</p>

Within passive lumped-element circuit theory, we prove that junction participation decays as $O(\omega_n^{-1})$ at high frequencies when the junction port has finite shunt capacitance, ensuring ultraviolet convergence of perturbative sums without imposed cutoffs. The standard circuit QED parameters, coupling strength $g$, anharmonicity $\alpha$, and dispersive shift $\chi$, emerge as controlled limits with explicit validity conditions.</p>

            <p>A quantum system that interacts with an environment generally undergoes nonunitary evolution described by a non-Markovian or Markovian master equation. In this paper, we construct the non-Markovian Redfield master equation for a quantum scalar field that interacts with a second field through a bilinear or nonlinear interaction on a Minkowski background. We use the resulting master equation to set up coupled differential equations that can be solved to obtain the equal-time two-point function of the system field. We show how the equations simplify under various approximations including the Markovian limit and argue that the Redfield equation-based solution provides a perturbative resummation to the standard second-order Dyson series result. For the bilinear interaction, we explicitly show that the Redfield solution is closer to the exact solution compared to the perturbation theory-based one. Further, the environment correlation function is oscillatory and nondecaying in this case, making the Markovian master equation a poor approximation. For the nonlinear interaction, on the other hand, the environment correlation function is sharply peaked and the Redfield solution matches that obtained using a Markovian master equation in the late-time limit.</p>

The instrument may also be used as an interferometer, to probe fundamental questions in quantum mechanics. In this paper we detail both the continuous and Time of Flight options of the instruments. In addition we demonstrate the applicability of our interferometer to ultra small angle scattering in a white beam. Finally we demonstrate a new spin echo interferometry tool, which uses incomplete recombination of the two path states to generate composite wavefunctions with special structure. In particular we show that this method produces neutron wavefunctions that exist in a superposition of two quantum mechanical OAM modes, l =+1 or -1 We illustrate that just as this method can be used to generate certain structured waves, it may also be used to characterize the structure of the input wavefunction.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhi-Qiang Zhang, Yu-Hang Li, Ming Lu, Hongfang Liu, Hailong Li, Hua Jiang, X. C. Xie</p>
            <p>The quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) is a quantum phenomenon in which a two-dimensional system exhibits a quantized Hall resistance $h/e^2$ in the absence of magnetic field, where $h$ is the Planck constant and $e$ is the electron charge. In this work, we extend this novel phase to three dimensions and thus propose a three-dimensional QAHE exhibiting richer and more versatile transport behaviors. We first confirm this three-dimensional QAHE through the quantized Chern number, then establish its bulk-boundary correspondence, and finally reaffirm it via the distinctive transport properties. Remarkably, we find that the three-dimensional QAHE hosts two chiral surface states along one spatial direction while a pair of chiral hinge states along another direction, and the location of the hinge states depends sensitively on the Fermi energy. These two types of boundary states are further connected through a perpendicular chiral surface states, whose chirality is also Fermi energy dependent. Consequently, depending on the transport direction, its Hall resistance can quantize to $0$, $h/e^2$, or $\pm h/e^2$ when the Fermi energy is tuned across the charge neutral point. This three-dimensional QAHE not only fill the gap in the Hall effect family but also holds significant potentials in device applications such as in-memory computing.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Simulations of Chemical Reactions: Achieving Accuracy with NISQ Devices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maitreyee Sarkar, Lisa Roy, Akash Gutal, Atul Kumar, Manikandan Paranjothy</p>
            <p>Quantum computing is viewed as a promising technology because of its potential for polynomial growth in complexity, in contrast to the exponential growth observed in its classical counterparts. In the current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), a hybrid variational algorithm, is utilized to simulate molecules using qubits and calculate molecular properties. However, simulating a chemical reaction to compute the reaction energy using VQE algorithm has not yet reached chemical accuracy relative to the benchmark computational chemistry methods due to limitations such as the number of qubits, circuit depth, and noise introduced within the model. To address this issue, we propose the definition of different active spaces for studying chemical reactions, incorporating irreducible representations of both the ground and excited states of the molecules. Our results demonstrate that this approach achieves chemical accuracy in predicting the reaction energy for various reactions. For all reactions studied, the difference in reaction energies between conventional computational chemistry methods and the quantum-classical hybrid VQE algorithm is less than 1 kcal/mol. Furthermore, our analysis simplifies the process of selecting active spaces and electrons for each reaction, reducing it to a single optimal combination that ensures the chemical accuracy for each reaction.</p>

            <h2>Frustration-free free fermions and beyond</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rintaro Masaoka, Seishiro Ono, Hoi Chun Po, Haruki Watanabe</p>
            <p>Frustration-free Hamiltonians provide pivotal models for understanding quantum many-body systems. In this paper, we establish a general framework for frustration-free fermionic systems. First, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition for a free fermion model to be frustration-free. In the case of translation-invariant, noninteracting systems, we show that any band touching between the valence and conduction bands is at least quadratic. Furthermore, by extending the Gosset-Huang inequality to fermionic systems, we demonstrate that even in interacting and non-translation-invariant cases, the finite-size gap of gapless excitations scales as $O((\log L)^2/L^2)$, provided the ground-state correlation function exhibits a power-law decay. Our results provide a foundation for studying frustration-free fermionic systems, including flat-band ferromagnetism and $\eta$-pairing states.</p>

            <p>We develop a general theory of frustration-free free-fermion systems and derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for such Hamiltonians. Assuming locality and translation invariance, we find that any band touching between the valence and the conduction bands is always quadratic or softer, which rules out the possibility of describing Dirac and Weyl semimetals using frustration-free local Hamiltonians. We further construct a frustration-free free-fermion model on the honeycomb lattice and show that its density fluctuations acquire an anomalous gap originating from the diverging quantum metric associated with the quadratic band-touching points. Nevertheless, an $O(1/L^2)$ finite-size scaling of the charge-neutral excitation gap can be verified even in the presence of interactions, consistent with the more general results we derive in an accompanying work [arXiv:2503.12879].</p>

            <p>The development of large-scale, programmable photonic circuits capable of performing generic matrix-vector multiplication is essential for both classical and quantum information processing. However, this goal is hindered by high losses, hardware errors, and difficulties in programmability. We propose an enhanced architecture for programmable photonic circuits that minimizes circuit depth and offers analytical programmability, properties that have not been simultaneously achieved in previous circuit designs. Our proposal exploits a previously overlooked representation of general nonunitary matrices as sums of two unitaries. Furthermore, similar to the traditional singular value decomposition-based circuits, the circuits in our unitary-sum-based architecture inherit the advantages of the constituent unitary circuits. Overall, our proposal provides a significantly improved solution for matrix-vector multiplication compared to the established approaches.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhao-Han Zhang, Yang Li, Himadri Pathak, Takeshi Sato, Kenichi L. Ishikawa, Feng He</p>
            <p>We introduce a framework for resolving electron-hole dynamics within wavefunction-based multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree-Fock (MCTDHF) theory. Central to this framework is a time-domain generalization of the extended Koopmans' theorem, which rigorously defines time-dependent hole states through single-electron removal. From this foundation, we prove the existence of exact equations of motion for time-dependent Dyson orbitals, enabling instantaneous construction of photofragments' reduced density matrices. The formalism further yields a systematic procedure to extract hole-resolved observables, such as channel-resolved photoelectron momentum distributions, directly from time-dependent \textit{ab initio} wavefunctions. As a demonstration, we employ an attosecond $\omega-2\omega$ laser strategy to control hole dynamics, thereby resolving a long-standing challenge in MCTDHF simulations. This advance opens a pathway for exploring correlated multielectron dynamics in atoms and molecules under ultrafast laser fields.</p>

            <h2>Three-boson scattering hypervolume for a nonzero orbital angular momentum</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pui In Ip, Shina Tan</p>
            <p>We analyze the zero energy collision of three identical bosons in the same internal state with total orbital angular momentum $L=2$, assuming short range interactions. By solving the Schrödinger equation asymptotically, we derive two expansions of the wave function when three bosons are far apart or a pair of bosons and the third boson are far apart. The scattering hypervolume $D$ is defined for this collision. Unlike the scattering hypervolume defined by one of us in 2008, whose dimension is length to the fourth power, the dimension of $D$ studied in the present paper is length to the eighth power. We then derive the expression of $D$ when the interaction potentials are weak, using the Born's expansion. We also calculate the energy shift of such three bosons with three different momenta $\hbar \mathbf{k_{1}}$, $\hbar\mathbf{k_{2}}$ and $\hbar\mathbf{k_{3}}$ in a large periodic box. The obtained energy shift depends on $D^{(0)}/\Omega^{2}$ and $D/\Omega^{2}$, where $D^{(0)}$ is the three-body scattering hypervolume defined for the three-body $L=0$ collision and $\Omega$ is the volume of the periodic box. We also calculate the contribution of $D$ to the three-body T-matrix element for low-energy collisions. We then calculate the shift of the energy and the three-body recombination rate due to $D^{(0)}$ and $D$ in the dilute homogeneous Bose gas. The contribution to the three-body recombination rate constant from $D$ is proportional to $T^2$ if the temperature $T$ is much larger than the quantum degeneracy temperature but still much lower than the temperature scale at which the thermal de Broglie wave length becomes comparable to the physical range of interaction.</p>

            <p>Cold atom systems in optical lattices have long been recognized as an ideal platform for bridging condense matter physics and quantum optics. Here, we investigate the 1D fermionic superradiance in an optical lattice, and observe novel tricritical phenomena and multistability in finite-temperature cases. As a starting point, which can be analytically calculated, we compare the 1D and 2D Fermi gases in zero-temperature limit. It turns out that the tricritical point originates from the higher-order Fermi surface nesting (FSN), and the infrared divergence in 1D systems is absent in 2D cases. When extending to finite-temperature cases, our numerical results reveal that both quantum- and classical-type trcritical phenomena can be observed simultaneously. Moreover, there exists an optimal temperature for observing superradiance. This work provides a new approach to understanding the relation between quantum and classical phase transitions.</p>

            <h2>Spin ladder quantum simulators from spin-orbit-coupled quantum dot spin qubits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang-Zhi Chou, Sankar Das Sarma</p>
            <p>Motivated by the recent Ge hole spin qubit experiments, we construct and study a two-leg spin ladder from a quantum dot array with spin-orbit couplings (SOCs), aiming to uncover the many-body phase diagrams and provide concrete guidance for the Ge hole spin qubit experiments. The spin ladder is described by an unprecedented, complex spin Hamiltonian, which contains antiferromagnetic Heisenberg exchange, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM), and anisotropic exchange interactions. We analyze the spin ladder Hamiltonian in two complementary situations, the strong rung coupling limit and the weak rung coupling limit. In the strong rung coupling limit, we systematically construct effective spin-1/2 chain models, connecting the well-studied one-dimensional spin models and providing a recipe for Hamiltonian engineering. It is worth emphasizing that effective DM interactions can be completely turned off while the microscopic DM interactions are generically inevitable. Moreover, the staggered DM interactions, which are not possible in the microscopic spin model, can also be realized in the effective spin-1/2 model. In the weak rung coupling limit, we employ Abelian bosonization and Luther-Emery fermionization, uncovering a multitude of phases. Several commensurate-incommensurate transitions are driven by both the longitudinal magnetic field and the DM interactions in the legs (chains). Remarkably, the low-energy phase diagrams show strong dependence in the DM interaction, providing a concrete way to identify the strength of SOC in the experiments. Our work bridges quantum many-body theory and spin qubit device physics, establishing spin ladders made of spin-orbit-coupled quantum dots as a promising platform for engineering exotic spin models, constructing quantum many-body states, and enabling programmable quantum computations.</p>

            <h2>Julia Set in Quantum Evolution: The case of Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Manmeet Kaur, Somendra M. Bhattacharjee</p>
            <p>Dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) are a class of non-equilibrium phase transitions that occur in many-body quantum systems during real-time evolution, rather than through parameter tuning as in conventional phase transitions. This paper presents an exact analytical approach to studying DQPTs by combining complex dynamics with the real-space renormalization group (RG). RG transformations are interpreted as iterated maps on the complex plane, establishing a connection between DQPTs and the Julia set, the boundary separating the basins of attraction of the stable fixed points. This framework is applied to a quantum quench in the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model, where we examine the sensitivity of DQPTs to variations in boundary conditions. We show that altering the topology of the spin chain can suppress DQPTs and provide a qualitative explanation based on quantum speed limits.</p>

Lattice solitons are generated through rapid quenches of the atomic interaction strength and the external trapping potential. We systematically optimize the quench parameters, such as duration and final scattering length, to maximize soliton stability. Our results provide insight into nonlinear matter-wave dynamics in discretized systems and establish a versatile platform for the controlled study of lattice solitons.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gianluca Giacchi</p>
            <p>Time-frequency representations stemmed in 1932 with the introduction of the Wigner distribution. For most of the 20th century, research in this area primarily focused on defining joint probability distributions for position and momentum in quantum mechanics. Applications to electrical engineering were soon established with the seminal works of Gabor and the researchers at Bell Labs. In 2012, Bai, Li and Cheng used for the first time metaplectic operators, defined in the middle of 20th century by Van Hove, to generalize the Wigner distribution and unify effectively the most used time-frequency representations under a common framework. This work serves as a comprehensive up-to-date survey on time-frequency representations defined by means of metaplectic operators, with particular emphasis on the recent contributions by Cordero and Rodino, who exploited metaplectic operators to their limits to generalize the Wigner distributions. Their idea provides a fruitful framework where properties of time-frequency representations can be explained naturally by the structure of the symplectic group.</p>

Furthermore, we extend the method to holographic CFTs, where subsystem fidelity serves to analyze the distinguishability of black hole microstates through the AdS/CFT correspondence. This work establishes a unified framework for quantifying quantum state distinguishability across various 2D CFTs, bridging quantum information techniques with applications in quantum gravity.</p>

            <h2>Empirical Quantum Advantage in Constrained Optimization from Encoded Unitary Designs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chinonso Onah, Roman Firt, Kristel Michielsen</p>
            <p>We introduce the Constraint-Enhanced Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (CE-QAOA), a shallow, constraint-aware ansatz that operates inside the one-hot product space [n]^m, where m is the number of blocks and each block is initialized in an n-qubit W_n state. We give an ancilla-free, depth-optimal encoder that prepares W_n using n-1 two-qubit rotations per block, and a two-local block-XY mixer that preserves the one-hot manifold and has a constant spectral gap on the one-excitation sector. At the level of expressivity, we establish per-block controllability, implying approximate universality per block. At the level of distributional behavior, we show that, after natural block and symbol permutation twirls, shallow CE-QAOA realizes an encoded unitary 1-design and supports approximate second-moment (2-design) behavior; combined with a Paley-Zygmund argument, this yields finite-shot anticoncentration guarantees. Algorithmically, we wrap constant-depth sampling with a deterministic feasibility checker to obtain a polynomial-time hybrid quantum-classical solver (PHQC) that returns the best observed feasible solution in O(S n^2) time, where S is a polynomial shot budget. We obtain two advantages. First, when CE-QAOA fixes r >= 1 locations different from the start city, we achieve a Theta(n^r) reduction in shot complexity even against a classical sampler that draws uniformly from the feasible set. Second, against a classical baseline restricted to raw bitstring sampling, we show an exp(Theta(n^2)) minimax separation. In noiseless circuit simulations of traveling salesman problem instances with n in {4,...,10} locations from the QOPTLib benchmark library, we recover the global optimum at depth p = 1 using polynomial shot budgets and coarse parameter grids defined by the problem size.</p>

Furthermore, we find $\sqrt{\sigma}/m_1 = 0.249(1)$ where $\sigma$ is the string tension between two static quarks and $m_1$ is the mass of the lightest glueball.</p>

            <p>We investigate quantum entanglement and coherence for four classes of Bell-like fermionic states in the vicinity of the event horizon of a Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger (GHS) dilaton black hole. Contrary to the common expectation that maximally entangled states always provide superior quantum resources, our results show that their entanglement can be lower than that of suitably chosen non-maximally entangled states in this curved spacetime background. This reveals that non-maximally entangled states may offer operational advantages for entanglement-based tasks under gravitational effects. In contrast, quantum coherence exhibits monotonic behavior: larger initial coherence leads to systematically enhanced robustness against the dilaton induced degradation. These results indicate that the optimal choice of initial quantum states depends sensitively on the specific quantum resource, either quantum entanglement or quantum coherence, required for quantum information processing near a dilaton black hole.</p>

            <h2>Determinism and Indeterminism as Model Artefacts: Toward a Model-Invariant Ontology of Physics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Nolland</p>
            <p>This paper argues that the traditional opposition between determinism and indeterminism in physics is representational rather than ontological. Deterministic-stochastic dualities are available in principle, and arise in a non-contrived way in many scientifically important models. When dynamical systems admit mathematically equivalent deterministic and stochastic formulations, their observable predictions depend only on the induced structure of correlations between preparations and measurement outcomes. I use this model-equivalence to motivate a model-invariance criterion for ontological commitment, according to which only structural features that remain stable across empirically equivalent representations, and whose physical effects are invariant under such reformulations, are candidates for realism. This yields a fallibilist form of structural realism grounded in modal robustness rather than in the specifics of any given mathematical representation. Features such as conservation laws, symmetries, and causal or metric structure satisfy this criterion and can be encoded in observable relations in mathematically intelligible ways. By contrast, the localisation of modal selection -- whether in initial conditions, stochastic outcomes, or informational collapse mechanisms -- is not invariant under empirically equivalent reformulations and is therefore best understood as a gauge choice rather than an ontological feature. The resulting framework explains how certain long-standing problems in the foundations of physics, including the measurement problem and the perceived conflict between physical determinism and free agency, arise from the reification of representational artefacts. By distinguishing model-invariant structure from modelling conventions, I offer a realist ontology for modern physics that combines empirical openness with resistance to metaphysical overreach.</p>

            <p>We investigate the non-Hermitian Kitaev chain with non-reciprocal hopping amplitudes and asymmetric superconducting pairing. We work out the symmetry structure of the model and show that particle-hole symmetry (PHS) is preserved throughout the entire parameter regime. As a consequence of PHS, the topological phase transition point of a finite open chain coincides with that of the periodic (infinite) system. By explicitly constructing the zero-energy wave functions (Majorana modes), we show that Majorana modes necessarily occur as reciprocal localization pairs accumulating on opposite boundaries, whose combined probability density exhibits an exact cancellation of the non-Hermitian skin effect for the zero energy modes. Excited states, by contrast, generically display skin-effect localization, with particle and hole components accumulating at opposite ends of the system. At the level of bulk topology, we further construct a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant in restricted parameter regimes that correctly distinguishes the topological and trivial phases. Finally, we present the topological phase diagram of the non-Hermitian Kitaev chain across a broad range of complex parameters and delineate the associated phase boundaries.</p>

            <p>Cloud-accessible quantum processors enable direct execution of quantum algorithms on heterogeneous hardware platforms. Unlike classical systems, however, identical quantum circuits may exhibit substantially different behavior across devices due to architectural variations in qubit connectivity, gate fidelity, and coherence times. In this work, we systematically benchmark five representative quantum algorithms - Bell state preparation, GHZ state generation, Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), Grover's Search, and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) - across trapped-ion, superconducting, and simulator backends using Amazon Braket. Performance metrics including fidelity, CHSH violation, success probability, circuit depth, and gate counts are evaluated. Our results demonstrate a strong dependence of algorithmic performance on hardware topology and noise characteristics. For example, 10-qubit GHZ states achieved fidelities above 0.8 on trapped-ion hardware, while superconducting platforms dropped below 0.15 due to routing overhead and accumulated two-qubit gate errors. These findings highlight the importance of hardware-aware algorithm selection and provide practical guidance for benchmarking in the NISQ era.</p>

Despite a growing body of temporal state formalisms, their precise operational relationships and conceptual distinctions remain unclear. In this work, we resolve this issue by extending the Kirkwood-Dirac (KD) quasiprobability distribution to arbitrary multi-time quantum processes and, more broadly, to general spatiotemporal settings. We define left, right, and doubled temporal KD quasiprobabilities, together with their real components, which we identify as temporal Margenau-Hill (MH) quasiprobabilities. All of these quantities are experimentally accessible through interferometric measurement schemes. By characterizing their nonclassical features, we show that the generalized KD framework provides a unified operational foundation for a wide class of temporal state approaches and can be directly implemented via temporal or spatiotemporal Bloch tomography.</p>

As a mathematical framework, Quantum Darwinism also provides guiding principles that determine what physical models support emergent classical behavior, what specific observables obey classical laws, and much more. For instance, in a recent work we elucidated that the limit under which Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability distributions become effectively classical coincides with the regime where the underlying physical model obeys the rules of Quantum Darwinism. In the present work, we study the breaking of Quantum Darwinism in a specific model and how that translates to non-classical measurement statistics. Interestingly, this provides effective tools for benchmarking the genuine quantum characteristics of NISQ hardware, which we demonstrate with IonQ's trapped-ion and IBM's superconducting quantum computing platforms.</p>

            <p>We report a three-dimensional lumped-element multimode microwave resonator that enables homogeneous collective manipulation and dispersive readout of a macroscopic spin ensemble. By exploiting geometric symmetry, two antisymmetric modes with strongly suppressed cross-talk are engineered to spatially overlap and couple to the same ensemble at distinct frequencies. Using negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond at 28 mK, we observe collective strong coupling with a coupling strength of 5.0 MHz and demonstrate non-destructive dispersive readout via a detuned mode. The compact design, tunable coupling, and high field homogeneity make this resonator a versatile device for hybrid spin-photon systems and multimode solid-state quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>We observe time-correlated four photons within a correlation window of 20ns from spontaneous four-wave mixing via a double-Lambda scheme in a cold cloud of Rb-87 atoms. In contrast to high-power pulsed pumping of chi^(2) nonlinear processes in crystals, our scheme generates correlated four-photon states by direct continuous-wave pumping at nominal powers. We verify the presence of genuinely correlated four-photon states over accidentals by higher-order intensity cross-correlation measurements and accidental subtraction. We infer a time-correlated four-photon generation rate of 2.5(4)x10^6 counts per second close to saturation. The photons produced are near-resonant with atomic transitions, and have a bandwidth in the order of MHz, making them readily compatible with quantum networking applications involving atoms.</p>

            <h2>Bath-free squeezed phonon lasing via intrinsic ion-phonon coupling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chen-Yu Lee, Guin-Dar Lin</p>
            <p>We present a theoretical model for realizing squeezed lasing in a trapped-ion system without relying on engineered baths or tailored dissipative reservoirs. Our approach leverages the intrinsic ion-phonon interactions, where two trapped ions, each interacting with a shared vibrational mode, are driven on both red- and blue-sideband transitions. This enables the creation of a squeezed state of motion through the dynamic coupling between the ions' internal states and the phonon mode. Unlike traditional methods that require bath engineering, our model demonstrates that squeezed lasing can be achieved through a direct manipulation of ion-phonon interactions, with no external reservoirs required. We explore the steady-state behavior of the system, analyzing the onset of lasing, gain-loss balance, and the role of the squeezing parameter in shaping the phonon field's statistical properties. Furthermore, we show how external coherent drives can stabilize phase coherence and achieve controlled quadrature squeezing, offering a simple yet effective method for achieving squeezed lasing in quantum mechanical systems. Our findings provide new insights into the realization of squeezed states in phonon-based systems, with potential applications in quantum metrology and information processing.</p>

            <h2>Squeezing-Enhanced Two-Phase Estimation with N-Particle W-type States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Huan Zhang, Ying Xia, Xiuxing Zhang, Shoukang Chang, Wei Ye</p>
            <p>We investigate the simultaneous estimation of two optical phases in a three-mode interferometer assisted by optical parametric amplification (OPA). By employing the normally ordered characteristic-function formalism, we analytically obtain all photon-number moments of the output quantum state, enabling an explicit evaluation of the quantum Fisher information matrix for multiparameter phase estimation. In the lossless scenario, we show that uniformly applied OPA significantly enhances the attainable precision beyond that of an unamplified interferometer. By analyzing the second-order correlation functions, we demonstrate that this enhancement originates from the amplification of intra-mode photon-number correlations, rather than from inter-mode correlations. We further extend our analysis to realistic interferometers with photon loss using a purification-based variational approach. Although loss degrades the achievable precision, the OPA-assisted scheme retains a clear advantage for moderate loss, indicating a degree of robustness against dissipation. Our results clarify the physical mechanism underlying OPA-enhanced multiparameter quantum metrology and provide guidelines for optimizing phase estimation protocols in realistic noisy environments.</p>

            <p>We investigate the spontaneous emission of a two-level system coupled to a photonic waveguide, showing that dynamical dephasing in the photon modes profoundly alters the decay law. In the absence of dephasing, the emitter displays conventional exponential decay followed by a long-time power-law tail -- observable only at extremely low survival probabilities. Strikingly, when dephasing is introduced, a robust power-law decay emerges already at short times, driven by photon diffusion in the dynamically disordered environment rather than spectral edge effects. These results reveal a novel, decoherence-induced mechanism for non-exponential spontaneous emission in waveguide QED platforms.</p>

            <p>We propose and analyze a scheme to generate squeezed light by storing a classical probe pulse in a Bose--Einstein condensate (BEC) and exploiting the nonlinear evolution caused by atom--atom collisions during the storage time. A $\Lambda$-type optical memory interface maps a chosen temporal probe mode onto a single phase-matched collective spin wave; for a coherent input this prepares a tunable coherent spin state of a two-component BEC, with its initial spin orientation set by the stored mean excitation number and the phase relation between the probe and control fields. Collisional interactions during storage then implement one-axis-twisting dynamics and generate spin squeezing in the atomic ensemble. We account for realistic loss and finite memory and retrieval efficiencies, and model readout as a single-mode beam-splitter mapping that transfers the atomic quadrature squeezing onto a propagating optical mode. We identify optimal storage times and predict that, under realistic conditions, several dB of squeezing can be transferred to the retrieved light.</p>

            <h2>From Superradiance to Superabsorption: An Exact Treatment of Non-Markovian Cooperative Radiation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ignacio González, Ángel Rivas</p>
            <p>We investigate the emergence of cooperative radiation phenomena in ensembles of two-level atoms coupled to a lossy resonant cavity beyond the Markovian and mean-field approximations. By deriving a complete analytical solution for the two-emitter case and employing a numerically exact method for larger ensembles, we characterize the full transition from Markovian to non-Markovian collective dynamics for systems of up to $10^3$ emitters. Our results reveal three distinct regimes: a Markovian phase exhibiting the standard superradiant burst, a non-Markovian phase featuring spontaneous superabsorption of the emitted field, and a critical regime marked by pulsed collective emission. We show that the critical spectral width separating these behaviors increases monotonically with the number of emitters, demonstrating that environmental memory effects can be enhanced by cooperativity. Finally, we find that the superradiant scaling of the peak intensity progressively degrades with increasing system size, approaching a subquadratic law in the limit of a perfect cavity. In this regime, spontaneous superabsorption emerges as a distinct manifestation of non-Markovian cooperativity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniele Lamberto, Gabriele Orlando, Salvatore Savasta</p>
            <p>The occurrence of a second-order quantum phase transition in the Dicke model is a well-established feature. On the contrary, a comprehensive understanding of the corresponding open system, particularly in the proximity of the critical point, remains elusive. When approaching the critical point, the system inevitably enters first the system-bath ultrastrong coupling regime and finally the deepstrong coupling regime, causing the failure of usual approximations adopted to describe open quantum systems. We study the interaction of the Dicke model with bosonic bath fields in the absence of additional approximations, which usually relies on the weakness of the system-bath coupling. We find that the critical point is not affected by the interaction with the environment. Moreover, the interaction with the environment is not able to affect the system ground-state condensates in the superradiant phase, whereas the bath fields are infected by the system and acquire macroscopic occupations. The obtained reflection spectra display lineshapes which become increasingly asymmetric, both in the normal and superradiant phases, when approaching the critical point.</p>

            <p>Entanglement detection is a fundamental task in quantum information science, serving as a cornerstone for quantum benchmarking and foundational studies. With an increasing qubit number that can be effectively controlled, there is a pressing need for a scalable and robust detection protocol which requires minimal resources while maintaining high detection capability. By integrating the Positive Partial Transposition criterion with variational quantum interference, we propose an entanglement detection protocol that requires moderate classical and quantum computation resources. We numerically show that this protocol achieves a high detection capability with shallow quantum circuits, surpassing some widely-used entanglement detection methods. The protocol also exhibits strong resilience to circuit noise, ensuring its applicability across different physical platforms. We further demonstrate the protocol experimentally on an eight-photon linear-optical platform, where it successfully detects the entanglement of a three-qubit mixed state that is inaccessible to conventional entanglement witnesses. By combining quantum interference with classical optimization, our protocol provides a scalable and resource-efficient route toward practical entanglement detection.</p>

This is an open area of research still a century after the initial development of formal quantum mechanics, highlighting the effectiveness of quantum physics in the description of all natural phenomena. These remarkable connections can be highlighted with the tools of modern quantum optics, which effectively addresses the three-fold interplay of interacting atoms, fields, and spacetime backgrounds describing gravitational fields and noninertial systems. In this review article, we select aspects of these phenomena centered on quantum features of the acceleration radiation of particles in the presence of black holes. The ensuing horizon-brightened radiation (HBAR) provides a case study of the role played by quantum physics in nontrivial spacetime behavior, and also shows a fundamental correspondence with black hole thermodynamics.</p>

            <p>We present a novel protocol to detect rare signals in a noisy environment using quantum error correction (QEC). The key feature of our protocol is the discrimination between signal and noise through distinct higher-order correlations, realized by the non-linear processing that occurs during syndrome extraction in QEC. In this scheme, QEC has two effects: First, it sacrifices part of the signal $\epsilon$ by recording a reduced, stochastic, logical phase $\phi_L = \mathcal{O}(\epsilon^3)$. Second, it corrects the physical noise and extends the (logical) coherence time for signal acquisition. For rare signals occurring at random times in the presence of local Markovian noise, we explicitly demonstrate an improved sensitivity of our approach over more conventional sensing strategies.</p>

We develop interferometric sensing protocols based on quantum critical wavefunctions and compare their performance with Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) and spin-squeezed states. Building on the idea of symmetries as a metrological resource, we introduce a symmetry-based algorithm to identify optimal measurement strategies. We illustrate this algorithm both for magnetic systems with internal symmetries and Rydberg-atom arrays with spatial symmetries. We study the robustness of criticality for quantum sensing under non-unitary deformations, symmetry-preserving and symmetry-breaking decoherence, and qubit loss -- identifying regimes where critical systems outperform GHZ states and showing that non-unitary deformation can even enhance sensing precision. Combined with recent results on log-depth preparation of critical wavefunctions, interferometric sensing in this setting appears increasingly promising.</p>

            <p>A bright source of on-demand entangled photons is needed for quantum networks. A single quantum dot in a site-selected nanowire waveguide is a promising candidate for realizing such sources. However, such sources are associated with poor single-photon indistinguishability, limiting their applicability in quantum networks. A common approach for enhancing the single-photon indistinguishability in quantum dot-based entangled photon sources is to implement a broadband optical cavity. Achieving a high-Purcell cavity while retaining the advantages of the nanowire, such as directional emission, a broad operational bandwidth, and high light extraction efficiency, has been a significant challenge. Here, we propose a nanowire cavity based on quasi-bound states in the continuum formed by the strong coupling of two resonant optical modes. We numerically predict this design to support a cavity mode with 4 nm bandwidth and a Purcell enhancement of $\sim$17. This cavity mode enables a directional far-field emission profile (88% overlap with a Gaussian) with a light extraction efficiency of $\sim$74%. Our solution opens up a route for generating entangled photon pairs with enhanced extraction efficiency and single-photon indistinguishability for the practical realization of quantum networks.</p>

            <p>The efficient interfacing of quantum emitters and photons is fundamental to quantum networking. Quantum defects embedded in integrated nanophotonic circuits are promising for such applications due to the deterministic light-matter interactions of high-cooperativity ($C>1$) cavity quantum electrodynamics and potential for scalable integration with active photonic processing. Silicon-vacancy (SiV) centers embedded in diamond nanophotonic cavities are a leading approach due to their excellent optical and spin coherence, however their long-term scalability is limited by the diamond itself, as its suspended geometry and weak nonlinearity necessitates coupling to a second processing chip. Here we realize the first high-cooperativity coupling of quantum defects to hybrid-integrated nanophotonics in a scalable, planar platform. We integrate more than 600 gallium phosphide (GaP) nanophotonic cavities on a diamond substrate with near-surface SiV centers. We examine a particular device with two strongly coupled SiV centers in detail, confirming above-unity cooperativity via multiple independent measurements. Application of an external magnetic field via a permanent magnet enables optical resolution of the SiV spin transitions from which we determine a spin-relaxation time $T_1>0.4$ ms at 4 K. We utilize the high cooperativity coupling to observe spin-dependent transmission switching and the quantum jumps of the SiV spin via single-shot readout. These results, coupled with GaP's strong nonlinear properties, establish GaP-on-diamond as a scalable planar platform for quantum network applications.</p>

In this framework, quantum gates between remote qubits can be realized using quantum teleportation protocols. The essential requirements for such non-local gates are remote entanglement, local quantum logic within each processor, and classical communication between nodes to perform operations based on measurement outcomes. Here, we demonstrate an unconditional Controlled-NOT quantum gate between remote diamond-based qubit devices. The control and target qubits are Carbon-13 nuclear spins, while NV electron spins enable local logic, readout, and remote entanglement generation. We benchmark the system by creating a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state, showing genuine 4-partite entanglement shared between nodes. Using deterministic logic, single-shot readout, and real-time feed-forward, we implement non-local gates without post-selection. These results demonstrate a key capability for solid-state quantum networks, enabling exploration of distributed quantum computing and testing of complex network protocols on fully integrated systems.</p>

            <p>Negatively charged boron vacancies (V$_{\text{B}}^{-}$) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) comprise a promising quantum sensing platform, optically addressable at room temperature and transferrable onto samples. However, broad hyperfine-split spin transitions of the ensemble pose challenges for quantum sensing with conventional resonant excitation due to limited spectral coverage. While isotopically enriched hBN using $^{10}$B and $^{15}$N isotopes (h$^{10}$B$^{15}$N) exhibits sharper spectral features, significant inhomogeneous broadening persists. We demonstrate that, implemented via frequency modulation on an FPGA, a frequency-ramped microwave pulse achieves around 4-fold greater $|0\rangle\rightarrow|-1\rangle$ spin-state population transfer and thus contrast than resonant microwave excitation and thus 16-fold shorter measurement time for spin relaxation based quantum sensing. Quantum dynamics simulations reveal that an effective two-state Landau-Zener model captures the complex relationship between population inversion and pulse length with relaxations incorporated. Our approach is robust and valuable for quantum relaxometry with spin defects in hBN in noisy environments.</p>

            <h2>Simulation of noisy quantum circuits using frame representations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Janek Denzler, Jose Carrasco, Jens Eisert, Tommaso Guaita</p>
            <p>One of the core research questions in the theory of quantum computing is to find out to what precise extent the classical simulation of a noisy quantum circuits is possible and where potential quantum advantages can set in. In this work, we introduce a unified framework for the classical simulation of quantum circuits based on frame theory, encompassing and generalizing a broad class of existing simulation strategies. Within this framework, the computational cost of a simulation algorithm is determined by the one-norm of an associated quasi-probability distribution, providing a common quantitative measure across different simulation approaches. This enables a comprehensive perspective on common methods for the simulation of noisy circuits based on different quantum resources, such as entanglement or non-stabilizerness. It further provides a clear scheme for generating novel classical simulation algorithms. Indeed, by exploring different choices of frames within this formalism and resorting to tools of convex optimization, we are able not only to obtain new insights and improved bounds for existing methods -- such as stabilizer state simulation or Pauli back-propagation -- but also to discover a new approach with an improved performance based on a generalization of the Pauli frame. We, thereby, show that classical simulation techniques can directly benefit from a perspective -- that of frames -- that goes beyond the traditional classification of quantum resources.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giorgio Facelli, Hamza Fawzi, Omar Fawzi</p>
            <p>Simulating the time dynamics of an observable under Hamiltonian evolution is one of the most promising candidates for quantum advantage as we do not expect efficient classical algorithms for this problem except in restricted settings. Here, we introduce such a setting by showing that Majorana Propagation, a simple algorithm combining Trotter steps and truncations, efficiently finds a low-degree approximation of the time-evolved observable as soon as such an approximation exists. This provides the first provable guarantee about Majorana Propagation for Hamiltonian evolution. As an application of this result, we prove that Majorana Propagation can efficiently simulate the time dynamics of any sparse quartic Hamiltonian up to time $t_{\text{max}}(u)$ depending on the interaction strength $u$. For a time horizon $t \leq t_{\text{max}}(u)$, the runtime of the algorithm is $N^{O(\log(t/\varepsilon))}$ where $N$ is the number of Majorana modes and $\varepsilon$ is the error measured in the normalized Frobenius norm. Importantly, in the limit of small $u$, $t_{\text{max}}(u)$ goes to $+\infty$, formalizing the intuition that the algorithm is accurate at all times when the Hamiltonian is quadratic.</p>

            <p>We study the entanglement negativity for the free, scalar chiral current in two spacetime dimensions, which is a simple model violating the Haag duality in regions with nontrivial topology. For the ground state of the system, both on the line and on the circle, we consider the setups given by two intervals, either adjacent or disjoint. We find analytic expressions for the moments of the partial transpose of the reduced density matrix and the logarithmic negativity. In the limit of small separation distance, this expression yields the same subleading topological contribution occurring in the mutual information. In the limit of large separation distance between the two intervals, the exponential decay of the logarithmic negativity is obtained from its analytic expression. The analytic formulas are checked against exact numerical results from a bosonic lattice model, finding a perfect agreement. We observe that, since the chiral current generates the neutral subalgebra of the full chiral Dirac fermion theory, this analysis highlights how symmetries produce nontrivial features in the entanglement structure that are analogue to those ones already observed in the mutual information for regions with nontrivial topology.</p>

            <p>Entanglement is unanimously recognized as the key communication resource of the Quantum Internet. Yet, the possibility of implementing novel network functionalities by exploiting the marvels of entanglement has been poorly investigated so far, by mainly restricting the attention to bipartite entanglement. Conversely, in this paper, we aim at exploiting multipartite entanglement as inter-network resource. Specifically, we consider the interconnection of different Quantum Local Area Networks (QLANs), and we show that multipartite entanglement allows to dynamically generate an inter-QLAN artificial topology, by means of local operations only, that overcomes the limitations of the physical QLAN topologies. To this aim, we first design the multipartite entangled state to be distributed within each QLAN. Then, we show how such a state can be engineered to: i) interconnect nodes belonging to different QLANs, and ii) dynamically adapt to different inter-QLAN traffic patterns. Our contribution aims at providing the network engineering community with a hands-on guideline towards the concept of artificial topology and artificial neighborhood.</p>

            <p>Constructing a quantum memory node with the ability of long-distance atom-photon distribution is the essential task for future quantum networks, enabling distributed quantum computing, quantum cryptography and remote sensing. Here we report the demonstration of a quantum-network node with a simple cavity-free cold atomic ensemble. This node gives an initial retrieval efficiency of approximately 50\% and memory lifetime of 160 $\mu$s for atomic qubits. With the aid of a high-efficiency and polarization-independent quantum frequency conversion (QFC) module, the generated entangled photon in the node at 780-nm wavelength is converted to telecom S band at 1522 nm, enabling atom-photon distribution over long distance. We observe an entanglement fidelity between the atoms and telecom photon exceeding 80\% after photon transmission over 20-km fiber, the remaining infidelity being dominated by atomic decoherence. The low-noise QFC with an external efficiency up to 48.5\% gives a signal-to-noise-ratio of 6.9 for transmitted photons with fiber length up to 100 km, laying the cornerstone for entanglement distribution at a hundred-km level.

            <p>While two-photon Hong-Ou-Mandel interference visibility has become a standard metric for single-photon sources, many optical quantum technologies require the generation and manipulation of larger photonic states. To date, efficiency limitations have prevented scaling quantum dot-based interference to the coalescence of more than two photons at a single beamsplitter. We overcome this limitation by combining a state-of-the-art quantum dot source with deterministic demultiplexing, enabling the direct observation of quantum interference fringes arising from up to four photons. We measure high mean interference contrasts of $93.0 \pm 0.1~\%$ for two photons, and $84.1 \pm 1.0~\%$ for four photons, with the complex fringe structure fully reproduced by a theoretical model. These results reveal the existence of "deep fringes" whose minima are unaffected by distinguishable photons, rendering the maximum contrast of four-photon interference highly sensitive to multi-photon emission but robust against photon distinguishability. We predict that these phenomena will extend to interference of larger numbers of photons, with relevance across a range of potential optical quantum technologies. A Fisher information analysis demonstrates that interference fringes from our source can exhibit phase sensitivity beyond the standard quantum limit, illustrating potential applications in quantum metrology.</p>

Consequently, the ability to prepare high-quality cat states at large fault distances is essential. While optimizations for low fault distances or small numbers of qubits exist, higher fault distances can be achieved via generalized constructions with potentially suboptimal circuit sizes. In this work, we propose a cat state preparation scheme based on preparing two cat states with low-depth circuits, followed by a transversal CNOT and measurement of one of the states. This scheme prepares $w$-qubit cat states fault-tolerantly up to fault distances of $9$ using $\lceil\log_2 w\rceil+1$ depth and at most $3w-2$ CNOTs and $2w$ qubits. We discuss that the combinatorially challenging aspect of this construction is the precise wiring of the transversal CNOT and propose three methods for finding these: two based on Satisfiability Modulo Theory solving and one heuristic search based on a local repair strategy. Numerical evaluations show that our circuits achieve a high fault-distance while requiring fewer resources as generalized constructions.</p>

            <h2>Non-Markovian dynamics of the giant atom beyond the rotating-wave approximation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mei Yu, Walter T. Strunz, Stefan Nimmrichter</p>
            <p>Superconducting qubits coupled to meandering transmission lines or surface acoustic waves may realize giant artificial atoms, whose spatially separated coupling points give rise to long-lived non-Markovian dynamics. Previous studies were limited to the zero-temperature, weak-coupling regime, where the rotating-wave approximation applies and only single-phonon processes contribute. Here we go beyond these limits using the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM). We show that HEOM accurately captures the exact dynamics at zero temperature and weak coupling, whereas perturbative Redfield theory fails due to long bath memory times. The non-Markovian effects persist at finite temperatures. In the strong-coupling regime, they are further enhanced, and we observe bound-state formation at zero temperature with only two coupling points. These results establish giant atoms as a powerful platform for exploring non-Markovian open quantum dynamics and their applications in quantum information and thermodynamics.</p>

            <h2>Multiphoton Interference with a symmetric SU(N) beam splitter and the generalization of the extended Hong-Ou-Mandel effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paul M. Alsing, Richard J. Birrittella, Peter L. Kaulfuss</p>
            <p>We examine multiphoton interference with a symmetric $SU(N)$ beam splitter $S_N$, an extension of features of the $SU(2)$ 50/50 beam splitter extended Hong-Ou-Mandel (eHOM) effect, whereby one obtains a zero amplitude (probability) for the output coincidence state (defined by equal number of photons $n/N$ in each output port), when a total number $n$ of photons impinges on the $N$-port device. These are transitions of the form $|n_1,n_2,\ldots,n_N\rangle\overset{S_N}{\to}|n/N\rangle^{\otimes N}$, where $n=\sum_{i=1}^N n_i$, which generalize the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) effect $|1,1\rangle \overset{S_2}{\to}|1,1\rangle $, the eHOM effect $|n_1,n_2\rangle \overset{S_2}{\to}|\tfrac{n_1+n_2}{2},\tfrac{n_1+n_2}{2}\rangle $, and the generalized HOM effect (gHOM) $|1\rangle^{\otimes N}\overset{S_N}{\to}|1\rangle^{\otimes N}$, which have previously been studied in the literature. The emphasis of this work is on illuminating how the overall destructive interference occurs in separate groups of destructive interferences of sub-amplitudes of the total zero amplitude. We develop symmetry properties for the generalized eHOM effect (geHOM) $|n_1,n_2,\ldots,n_N\rangle\overset{S_N}{\to}|n/N\rangle^{\otimes N}$ involving a zero amplitude governed by Perm($\Lambda$)=0, for an appropriately constructed matrix $\Lambda(S_N)$ built from the matrix elements of $S_N$. We develop an analytical constraint equation for Perm$(\Lambda)$ for arbitrary $N$ that allows us to determine when it is zero. We generalize the SU(2) beam splitter feature of central nodal line (CNL), which has a zero diagonal along the output probability distribution when one of the input states is of odd parity (containing only odd number of photons), to the general case of $N = 2 * N'$ where $N'\in odd$.</p>

            <h2>Hybrid non-degenerate parametric amplifier for a microwave cavity mode and an NV ensemble</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Roman Ovsiannikov, Kurt Jacobs, Andrii G. Sotnikov, Matthew E. Trusheim, Denys I. Bondar</p>
            <p>We introduce an implementation of a non-degenerate parametric amplifier in which the signal and idler modes, respectively, a microwave mode and an ensemble of spins (e.g., nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond), are operated in their linear regime. This paramp, which amplifies signals in both parts at room and cryogenic temperatures, can be used to generate both the two-mode and single-mode squeezing of either system. It requires merely modulating the frequency of the spin ensemble at the sum of the cavity and spin frequencies (providing the classical pump) with the two systems sufficiently detuned. This effect is remarkable given that modulating a spin ensemble by itself produces neither amplification nor squeezing, unlike modulating an oscillator, and that an off-resonant perturbative analysis would suggest that modulating the spin ensemble merely parametrically drives the cavity mode. With typical cavity parameters including a cavity quality factor~$Q=10^4$, and a 1 GHz modulation amplitude, the microwave signal can be amplified by approximately $18~\mbox{dB}$ in $1.7~\mbox{$\mu$s}$, with a resonant bandwidth of about $0.5~\mbox{MHz}$. At $10~\mbox{mK}$ with the same modulation amplitude and a cavity and spin $Q=5\times 10^4$ it generates approximately $5~\mbox{dB}$ of squeezing. We also examine the experimental requirements for implementation.</p>

            <p>Many symmetry protected or symmetry enriched phases of quantum matter have the property that every ground state in a given such phase endows measurement based quantum computation with the same computational power. Such phases are called computational phases of quantum matter. Here, we experimentally verify four theoretical predictions for them on an IBM superconducting quantum device. We comprehensively investigate how symmetric imperfections of the resource states translate into logical decoherence, and how this decoherence is mitigated. In particular, the central experiment probes the scaling law from which the uniformity of computational power follows. We also analyze the correlated regime, where local measurements give rise to logical operations collectively. We test the prediction that densest packing of a measurement-based algorithms remains the most efficient, in spite of the correlations. Our experiments corroborate the operational stability of measurement based quantum computation in quantum phases of matter with symmetry.</p>

            <h2>Tailoring Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions via Double-Mode Squeezing Manipulation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kaiyuan Cao, Haodong Wang, Xiang-Ping Jiang, Shu chen, Jian Wang</p>
            <p>We propose a protocol to tailor dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) by double-mode squeezing onto the initial state in the XY chain. The effect of squeezing depends critically on the system's symmetry and parameters. When the squeezing operator breaks particle-hole symmetry (PHS), DQPTs become highly tunable, allowing one to either induce transitions within a single phase or suppress them. Remarkably, when PHS is preserved and the squeezing strength reaches $r=\pi/4$, a universal class of DQPTs emerges, independent of the quench path. This universality is characterized by two key features: (i) the collapse of all Fisher zeros onto the real-time axis, and (ii) the saturation of intermode entanglement to its maximum in each $(k,-k)$ modes. Moreover, the critical momenta governing the DQPTs coincide exactly with the modes attaining the maximal entanglement. At this universal point, the dynamical phase vanishes, leading to a purely geometric evolution marked by $\pi$-jumps in the Pancharatnam geometric phase. Our work establishes initial-state squeezing as a versatile tool for tailoring far-from-equilibrium criticality and reveals a direct link between entanglement saturation and universal nonanalytic dynamics.</p>

            <p>Aluminum remains the central material for superconducting qubits, and considerable effort has been devoted to optimizing its deposition and patterning for quantum devices. However, while post-processing of Nb- and Ta-based resonators has been widely explored, primarily focusing on oxide removal using buffered oxide etch (BOE), post-treatment strategies for Al resonators remain underdeveloped. This challenge becomes particularly relevant for industry-scale fabrication with multichip bonding, where delays between sample preparation and cooldown require surface treatments that preserve low dielectric loss during extended exposure to ambient conditions. In this work, we investigate surface modification approaches for Al resonators subjected to a 24-hour delay prior to cryogenic measurement. Passivation using self-limiting oxygen and fluorine chemistries was evaluated utilizing different plasma processes. Remote oxygen plasma treatment reduced dielectric losses, in contrast to direct plasma, likely due to additional ashing of residual resist despite the formation of a thicker oxide layer on both Si and Al surfaces. A fluorine-based plasma process was developed that passivated the Al surface with fluorine for subsequent BOE treatment. However, increasing fluorine incorporation in the aluminum oxide correlated with higher loss, identifying fluorine as an unsuitable passivation material for Al resonators. Finally, selective oxide removal using HF vapor and phosphoric acid was assessed for surface preparation. HF vapor selectively etched SiO2 while preserving Al2O3, whereas phosphoric acid exhibited the opposite selectivity. Sequential application of both etches yielded dielectric losses as low as $\delta_\mathrm{LP} = 5.2 \times 10^{-7}$ ($Q\mathrm{i} \approx 1.9\,\mathrm{M}$) in the single photon regime, demonstrating a promising pathway for robust Al-based resonator fabrication.</p>

            <h2>Extracting scattering phase shift in quantum mechanics on quantum computers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peng Guo, Paul LeVan, Frank X. Lee, Yong Zhao</p>
            <p>We investigate the feasibility of extracting infinite volume scattering phase shift on quantum computers in a simple one-dimensional quantum mechanical model, using the formalism established in Ref.~\cite{Guo:2023ecc} that relates the integrated correlation functions (ICF) for a trapped system to the infinite volume scattering phase shifts through a weighted integral. The system is first discretized in a finite box with periodic boundary conditions, and the formalism in real time is verified by employing a contact interaction potential with exact solutions. Quantum circuits are then designed and constructed to implement the formalism on current quantum computing architectures. To overcome the fast oscillatory behavior of the integrated correlation functions in real-time simulation, different methods of post-data analysis are proposed and discussed. Test results on IBM hardware show that good agreement can be achieved with two qubits, but complete failure ensues with three qubits due to two-qubit gate operation errors and thermal relaxation errors.</p>

            <p>We present an optical study of near-surface Er$^{3+}$ ensembles in waveguide-integrated CaWO$_4$ and YVO$_4$, investigating how nanophotonic coupling modifies rare-earth spectroscopy. In particular, we compare bulk excitation with evanescently coupled TE and TM waveguide modes. In Er$^{3+}$:CaWO$_4$, we observe a pronounced polarization-dependent surface effect. TE-coupled spectra closely reproduce bulk behavior. In contrast, TM coupling induces strong inhomogeneous broadening and an asymmetric low-energy shoulder of the site S1 Y1Z1 transition, with linewidths exceeding those of the bulk by more than a factor of four. Temperature-dependent measurements and surface termination studies indicate that surface charges are the dominant mechanism. Er$^{3+}$:YVO$_4$ remains largely unaffected by mode polarization, and surface termination leads only to minor spectral shifts. These observations suggest that non-charge-neutral rare-earth systems are more susceptible to surface-induced decoherence sources than charge-neutral hosts.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Manish Kumar Mohanta</p>
            <p>The Rashba, Dresselhaus, and Weyl Hamiltonians form a foundational framework for modeling spin-orbit interactions across condensed matter systems. Although they describe distinct material classes and produce seemingly different spin textures, they are conventionally treated as separate, unrelated theoretical frameworks. Here, this work demonstrates that the linear 2D Rashba and Weyl models are connected by a specific unitary transformation that maps one Hamiltonian exactly onto the other. The same unitary can be applied to map the linear Dresselhaus-1 model onto the Dresselhaus-2 models and vice versa. Such hidden correspondence establishes a unified theoretical foundation for spin-orbit interactions, deepening our conceptual understanding of spin-orbit coupling and opening new avenues for exploring complex spin textures. To illustrate the application, this work introduces a unique, improved, and more realistic model Hamiltonian H_MKM combining all known foundational spintronic models, where the stringent condition of equal spin-orbit coupling strength of Rashba and Dresselhaus may not be required to observe persistent spin texture under MKM transformation.</p>

Low-temperature scanning tunneling spectroscopy data reveal the presence of a double-peak low-energy feature in the local density of states of the hybrid system, which is rationalized via model calculations to be an emergent topological nodal-point superconducting phase with tilted Weyl cones.

            <p>We investigate the transition rates of a centripetally accelerated atom inside a high-quality cavity and show that they can be extensively tuned by adjusting the cavity resonance and the rotation frequency. Crucially, while inertial atoms cannot be excited in vacuum, rotation induces spontaneous excitation via the circular Unruh effect, with the cavity serving only as an amplifier. Using experimentally feasible parameters, we demonstrate that, in one scenario, the excitation rate can reach $\sim 10^7~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ while emission remains negligible, enabling substantial population inversion. In another scenario, both excitation and emission can simultaneously attain $\sim 10^7~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, corresponding to millions of transitions per second for a single atom. These findings highlight a powerful method for manipulating atomic transition rates for quantum applications and open a promising route toward experimental verification of the circular Unruh effect with state-of-the-art quantum technologies.</p>

We begin with covert communication of classical information under a secrecy constraint. We then leverage this result to construct a coding scheme for covert entanglement generation.</p>

Otherwise, the satellite up-link can be rerouted to the ground nodes to form a pair-wise ground network. Leveraging both the time and frequency correlations of our photon-pair source, we demonstrate an increased coincidence-to-accidental ratio without additional resource overhead in a five-node network. To contextualize these experimental findings, we project their performance in a quantum key distribution scenario and outline a feasible route toward field deployment, using integrated photonics to enable network integration of up to 72 users.</p>

The wireless design eliminates losses and impedance mismatches that become problematic at high frequencies. The WJPA achieves more than 20~dB of gain across a tunable frequency range of 21--23.5~GHz, with a typical dynamic bandwidth of 3~MHz. Through Y-factor measurements and a qubit-based photon number calibration, we show that the amplifier exhibits an added noise of approximately two photons.</p>

            <p>We develop the theory of dynamical superradiance -- the collective exchange of energy between an ensemble of initially excited emitters and a single-mode cavity -- for organic materials where electronic states are coupled to vibrational modes. We consider two models to capture the vibrational effects: first, vibrations treated as a Markovian bath for two-level emitters, via a pure dephasing term in the Lindblad master equation for the system; second, vibrational modes directly included in the system via the Holstein--Tavis--Cummings Hamiltonian. By exploiting the permutation symmetry of the emitters and weak U(1) symmetry, we develop a numerical method capable of exactly solving the Tavis-Cummings model with local dissipation for up to 140 emitters. Using the exact method, we validate mean-field and second-order cumulant approximations and use them to describe macroscopic numbers of emitters. We analyse the dynamics of the average cavity photon number, electronic coherence, and Bloch vector length, and show that the effect of vibrational mode coupling goes beyond simple dephasing. Our results show that superradiance is possible in the presence of vibrational mode coupling; for negative cavity detunings, the vibrational coupling may even enhance superradiance. We identify asymmetry of the photon number rise time as a function of the detuning of the cavity frequency as an experimentally accessible signature of such vibrationally assisted superradiance.</p>

Quantum simulation is among the most promising applications of quantum computing. However, like many quantum algorithms, it is severely constrained by noise in near-term hardware. Quantum-inspired algorithms provide an attractive alternative by avoiding the need for error-prone quantum devices. In this study, we demonstrate that the coherent Ising machine and simulated bifurcation algorithms can accurately reproduce the electronic energy profiles of H_2 and H_2O, capturing their essential energetic features. Notably, we obtain computational times of 1.2 s and 2.4 s for the H_2 and H_2O profiles, respectively, representing a substantial speed-up compared to gate-based quantum computing approaches, which typically require at least 6 s to compute a single molecular geometry with comparable accuracy.

            <p>Cold-atom experiments based on alkali-like atoms provide us with a tool to experimentally realize Hubbard models with a large number $N$ of components. The value of $N$ can be seen as a new handle to tune the properties of the system, leading to new physics both in the case of fully SU($N$) symmetric systems, or in the presence of controlled symmetry breaking. We focus on the Mott transition at global half filling and we characterize local correlations between particles through the \emph{inter-flavor mutual information}, an experimentally accessible quantity that rigorously measures the distance from the closest gaussian state, unveiling features that cannot be accessed by conventional probes of Mottness. We prove that these correlations are fully independent from local entanglement and quantum discord, and, using Dynamical Mean-Field Theory, we show that the SU(4) system has significantly smaller correlations than the SU(2) counterpart. In the atomic limit we prove that increasing $N$ further decreases the strength of the correlations. This suggests that a controlled reduction of the symmetry, reducing the number of effective components, can be used to enhance the degree of correlation. We confirm this scenario solving the model for $N=4$ and gradually breaking the symmetry via a Raman field, revealing an evolution from the SU(4) to the SU(2) Mott transition as the symmetry-breaking term increases, with a sudden recovery of the large correlations of the SU(2) model at weak Raman coupling in the Mott state. By further exploring the interplay between energy repulsion and the Raman field, we obtain a rich phase diagram with three different phases -- a metal, a band insulator, and a Mott insulator -- all coexisting at a single tricritical point.</p>

The proximity-induced altermagnetic order gaps the edge states of a topological insulator, thereby driving a transition from a first-order to a second-order topological phase. When combined with nonreciprocal hopping, the system exhibits both the non-Hermitian skin effect and a hybrid skin-topological effect, whereby first-order edge states and second-order corner states accumulate at selected corners of the lattice. We demonstrate that the spectral winding number of the edge states under cylindrical geometry dictates this corner localization and can be reversed by tuning the altermagnetic order. Consequently, both edge and corner states become directionally controllable. Our results establish altermagnets as a versatile platform for realizing and tuning skin-topological phenomena in non-Hermitian higher-order topological systems.</p>

Therefore, theories including a minimal length, like some quantum scenarios of gravity, seem to be able to enrich the current understanding of non-locality.</p>

            <h2>Gravitational time dilation in quantum clock interferometry with entangled multi-photon states and quantum memories</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mustafa Gündoğan, Roy Barzel, Dennis Rätzel</p>
            <p>Gravitational time dilation implies that clocks held at different heights accumulate different proper times. We analyze a memory-assisted quantum clock interferometer in which a frequency-bin photonic clock is stored in two vertically separated quantum memories for a controllable duration, such that the joint state evolves in a quantum superposition of two proper times. After retrieval, the photonic modes interfere in a Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interferometer, for which we derive analytic expressions for the resulting multiphoton detection statistics. Extending this HOM-based scheme from entangled photon pairs to frequency-entangled 2N-photon inputs, we show that the proper-time dependent phase is amplified by a factor N, leading to an N-times faster collapse and revival of the interference signal compared with the two-photon case. Incorporating finite memory efficiency and lifetime, we identify regimes where this modulation remains observable. For parameters compatible with demonstrated Rb and Cs memories and achievable optical frequency separations, the first collapse occurs for height differences in the order of 10-100 m with subsecond to few-second storage times, while suitable rare-earth ion and alkali memory combinations can reduce the required height to the few-metre scale. These results establish near-term laboratory conditions for observing entanglement dynamics driven by gravitational time dilation in a photonic platform.</p>

            <p>Time-translation symmetry strongly constrains physical dynamics, yet systematic characterization for continuous-variable systems lags behind its discrete-variable counterpart. We close this gap by providing a rigorous classification of Gaussian quantum operations that are covariant under time translations, termed Gaussian covariant operations. We show that several key results known for discrete-variable covariant operations break down in the Gaussian optical setting: discrepancies arise in physical and thermodynamic implementation, in the extensivity of asymmetry, and in catalytic advantages. Our results provide comprehensive mathematical and operational toolkits for Gaussian covariant operations, including a peculiar pair of asymmetry measures that are completely non-extensive. Our findings also reveal surprising consequences of the interplay among symmetry, Gaussianity, and thermodynamic constraints, suggesting that real-world scenarios with multiple constraints have a rich structure not accessible from examining individual constraints separately.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zahra Jalali-Mola, Saeid Asgarnezhad-Zorgabad</p>
            <p>Rabi oscillations characterize light-matter hybridization in the waveguide quantum electrodynamics~(WQED) framework, with their associated decay rates reflecting excitation damping, yet their behavior remains unresolved when collective emitters are coupled to a collective waveguide mode. This scenario reveals a conceptually novel collective-light-collective-matter interaction, realizable when a timed-Dicke state~(TDS) of subwavelength emitters couples to a slow, delocalized surface-plasmon mode, forming a hybridized plasmon-polariton~(HPP). The HPP acquires its directionality from the TDS via momentum matching. It also exhibits plasmonic characteristics, with excitation frequencies following the surface-plasmon dispersion relation. We obtain a Rabi oscillation and a long-time decay that describe the HPP and use them to reveal weak- and strong-coupling regimes through the emergence of normal-mode splitting. By performing a finite-time Lyapunov-exponent analysis, we show that the HPP also exhibits instantaneous decay and identify three distinct decay regimes: early-time rapid, transient-time oscillatory, and long-time classical. Finally, by analyzing the emission spectrum, we observe an anticrossing of the peak doublets~(a feature also seen in cavity QED setups) which originates from quantum vacuum effects and the resulting non-Markovian HPP evolution in our WQED.</p>

            <h2>Photon blockade effect from synergistic optical parametric amplification and driving force in Kerr-medium single-mode cavity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhang Zhiqiang</p>
            <p>This work investigates photon blockade control in a hybrid quantum system containing a Kerr-nonlinear cavity coupled to an optical parametric amplifier (OPA). The dynamics are governed by a master equation derived from an effective Hamiltonian that includes cavity decay. To obtain analytical solutions, the system's quantum state is expanded in the Fock basis up to the two-photon level. Solving the steady-state Schrodinger equation yields probability amplitudes and the analytical conditions for optimal photon blockade. Results confirm that photon blockade is achievable with suitable parameters. Excellent agreement is found between the analytical solutions and numerical simulations for the steady-state, equal-time second-order correlation function, validating both the analytical method and the blockade effect. Numerically, the average intracavity photon number increases significantly under resonance, providing a theoretical pathway for enhancing single-photon source brightness. Furthermore, the driving phase is shown to regulate the optimal blockade region: it shifts the parabolic region within the two-dimensional parameter space of driving strength and OPA nonlinearity and can even reverse its opening direction. The influence of Kerr nonlinearity is also examined. Photon blockade remains robust across a wide range of Kerr strengths. Physical analysis attributes the effect to destructive quantum interference between two distinct excitation pathways that suppress two-photon states. While Kerr nonlinearity shifts the system's energy levels, it does not disrupt this interference mechanism, explaining the effect's stability over a broad parameter range.</p>

            <h2>The Quantum State Continuity Problem and Temporal Enforcement Against Fork Attacks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samet Ünsal</p>
            <p>We introduce the Quantum State Continuity Problem (QSCP), a security objective orthogonal to identity authentication that captures whether a systems current execution is a legitimate continuation of a unique past execution. We show that classical and stateless quantum authentication mechanisms fail to enforce continuity and remain vulnerable to fork attacks. To address this gap, we propose the Quantum State Continuity Witness (QSCW), a minimal quantum-assisted primitive that enforces temporal linkage of execution through stateful quantum evolution and cumulative auditing. Using a GHZ-based toy instantiation and extensive simulation, we demonstrate that temporal enforcement suppresses fork attacks with exponential decay in success probability, while remaining robust to noise and system parameters. Our results highlight execution continuity as a distinct and underexplored dimension of system security.</p>

            <p>The research on open quantum systems is important for both quantum computing and quantum sensing. So far, we can only use the main equation to make an approximate description. The dynamics of a single Fluxonium qubit under Markovian environment satisfied Lindblad Master Equation. In experiments, pulse sequence dynamic decoupling (DD) can enhance the coherence of qubits and effectively suppress noise. Two Fluxonium qubits sensitive to two-level systems (TLS) noise. TLS formed by material defects results in noise with significant non-Markovian characteristics. The dynamics of non-Markovian noise satisfied the post Markov Master Equation (PMME). The TLS noise spectrum is mainly concentrated in low frequencies, so traditional DD cannot effectively suppress TLS noise. The relaxation and dephasing behavior with a complex dynamic characteristics. Based on Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, we put forward a novel DD sequence and design a TLS-tailored dynamical decoupling protocol by optimizing pulse locations to minimize noise power spectral overlap with the Lorentzian shape. Using PMME-consistent framework, we can obtain a stronger low frequency suppression and significantly prolong both Bell-based fidelity and entanglement. We explore specific DD design and precise modeling of entanglement dynamics under non-Markovian TLS noise.

            <p>While two-photon Hong-Ou-Mandel interference visibility has become a standard metric for single-photon sources, many optical quantum technologies require the generation and manipulation of larger photonic states. To date, efficiency limitations have prevented scaling quantum dot-based interference to the coalescence of more than two photons at a single beamsplitter. We overcome this limitation by combining a state-of-the-art quantum dot source with deterministic demultiplexing, enabling the direct observation of quantum interference fringes arising from up to four photons. We measure high mean interference contrasts of $93.0 \pm 0.1~\%$ for two photons, and $84.1 \pm 1.0~\%$ for four photons, with the complex fringe structure fully reproduced by a theoretical model. These results reveal the existence of "deep fringes" whose minima are unaffected by distinguishable photons, rendering the maximum contrast of four-photon interference highly sensitive to multi-photon emission but robust against photon distinguishability. We predict that these phenomena will extend to interference of larger numbers of photons, with relevance across a range of potential optical quantum technologies. A Fisher information analysis demonstrates that interference fringes from our source can exhibit phase sensitivity beyond the standard quantum limit, illustrating potential applications in quantum metrology.</p>

            <h2>Single-Step Hybrid CV-DV Transfer of Multipartite W States Using Cat-State Qubits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muhammad Nehal Khan, Sumrah Hussain</p>
            <p>We propose a deterministic hybrid continuous-variable-discrete-variable (CV-DV) scheme for the single-step transfer of an $n$-qubit W state encoded in photonic Schr$\ddot{o}$dinger cat-state qubits within a circuit QED architecture. Logical qubits are encoded in even- and odd-parity cat states of bosonic modes, while effective Raman-type interactions between resonator pairs are mediated by a single superconducting flux qutrit operating in the dispersive regime. The protocol coherently transfers the multipartite W state in a single collective operation without populating higher excited atomic levels, thereby strongly suppressing decoherence. Numerical simulations based on the full Lindblad master equation, including realistic cavity dissipation, qutrit relaxation and dephasing, and inter-cavity crosstalk, show that a three-qubit cat-state W state can be transferred with a maximum fidelity of approximately $0.92$. These results demonstrate the feasibility of scalable hybrid CV-DV entanglement transfer using current circuit QED technology.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arghya Maity, Ahana Ghoshal, Kelvin Onggadinata, Teck Seng Koh</p>
            <p>The Kolmogorov consistency condition (KCC) defines the statistical boundary between classical and quantum dynamics. Its violation signifies the breakdown of a classical Markov description of temporal correlations. In this work, we establish a direct analytical connection between KCC violation and non-Markovianity in open quantum dynamics, revealing how memory effects manifest as departures from classical probabilistic consistency. Within a generic two-level open quantum system framework, we establish quantitative connections between the magnitude of KCC violation and key information-theoretic and thermodynamic quantities, such as mutual information, the Fano factor, heat exchange, and entropy production rate, thereby enabling a thermodynamic interpretation of temporal quantum correlations. Furthermore, we uncover formal correspondences between KCC violation, the Leggett-Garg inequality, and the negativity of the Kirkwood-Dirac quasi-distribution, identifying them as complementary witnesses of temporal quantum non-classicality. Our results thus provide a unified framework linking information-theoretic, thermodynamic, and temporal indicators of quantumness in open quantum systems.</p>

            <p>We introduce a digital-analog quantum computing framework that enables counterdiabatic protocols to be implemented at constant circuit depth, allowing fast and resource-efficient quantum state preparation on current quantum hardware. Counterdiabatic protocols suppress diabatic excitations in finite-time adiabatic evolution, but their practical application is limited by the non-local structure of the required Hamiltonians and the resource overhead of fully digital implementations. Counterdiabatic terms can be expressed as truncated expansions of nested commutators of the adiabatic Hamiltonian and its parametric derivative. Here, we show how this algebraic structure can be efficiently realized in a digital-analog setting using commutator product formulas. Using native multi-qubit analog interactions augmented by local single-qubit rotations, this approach enables higher-order counterdiabatic protocols whose implementation requires a constant number of analog blocks for any fixed truncation order, independent of system size. We demonstrate the method for two-dimensional spin models and analyze the associated approximation errors. These results show that digital-analog quantum computing enables a qualitatively new resource scaling for counterdiabatic protocols and related quantum control primitives, with direct implications for quantum simulation, optimization, and algorithmic state preparation on current quantum devices.</p>

            <p>Non-Markovian memory effects in open quantum systems provide valuable resources for preserving coherence and enhancing controllability. However, exploiting them requires strategies adapted to history-dependent dynamics. We introduce a reinforcement-learning framework that autonomously learns to amplify information backflow in a driven two-level system coupled to a structured reservoir. Using a reward based on the positive time derivative of the trace distance associated with the Breuer-Laine-Piilo measure, we train PPO and SAC agents and benchmark their performance against gradient-based optimal control theory (OCT). While OCT enhances a single dominant backflow peak, RL policies broaden this revival and activate additional contributions in later memory windows, producing sustained positive trace-distance growth over a longer duration. Consequently, the integrated non-Markovianity achieved by RL substantially exceeds that obtained with OCT. These results demonstrate how long-horizon, model-free learning naturally uncovers distributed-backflow strategies and highlight the potential of reinforcement learning for engineering memory effects in open quantum systems.</p>

            <p>Quantum entanglement serves as a key phenomenon in understanding correlations in many-body systems, but analytical results remain scarce for coupled three-body oscillators.

It consists of deriving analytical expressions for linear entropy and purity under the bipartitions $(x|yz)$, $(y|xz)$, and $(xy|z)$ using the Wigner function framework. Our results indicate that excitations in any oscillator basically enhance the redistribution of correlations across the system. The mixing angle $\theta$ governs entanglement intensity, ranging from separability to maximal correlation. Moreover, we reveal the symmetry relations, notably $S_{Ly}[(n,m,l),\theta]=S_{Lz}[(n,m,l),-\theta]$ and an intrinsic symmetry within $(x|yz)$. Hence, we clarify how excitation levels and mixing angles create and enhance entanglement in the three coupled harmonic oscillators.</p>

            <p>Quantum steering is one of the most intriguing phenomena in quantum mechanics and is essential for understanding correlations in multi-body systems. Despite its importance, analytical results for coupled three-body oscillators remain scarce. In this work, we investigate this phenomenon through a geometrical diagonalization approach, which reduces the degrees of freedom associated with the system's steering properties. Specifically, we derive analytical expressions for quantum steering in all possible directions using the Wigner function framework, as it provides a complete description of the system's quantum state. Our results indicate that excitations significantly enhance quantum steering across the system; this stands in contrast to the ground state $(0,0,0)$, which exhibits no steerable correlations. Furthermore, both the directionality and topology of these correlations are governed by the spatial distribution of the excitations rather than their magnitude. We also observe symmetric steering behavior between oscillators $x$, $y$, and $z$ under equivalent excitation conditions, which can be formalized as $S^{(n,m,l)}_{x\to z}(\theta)=S^{(n,m,l)}_{x\to y}(-\theta),\quad S^{(n,m,l)}_{z\to x}(\theta)=S^{(n,m,l)}_{y\to x}(-\theta)$, and $S^{(n,m,l)}_{y\to z}(\theta)=S^{(n,m,l)}_{z\to y}(-\theta)$. Therefore, we elucidate how excitation levels and mixing angles generate and enhance steering in three coupled harmonic oscillators.</p>

            <p>We propose an efficient two-stage protocol for generating distant entanglement in a magnon-mediated hybrid quantum system, where magnons serve dual roles as both interaction mediators and qubits. This integrated design reduces the physical component count while leveraging the inherent advantages of magnons, such as their strong coupling via magnetic dipole interactions, low dissipation, and high integrability. In our setup, a superconducting resonator interfaces between a local superconducting qubit (SQ) and a local magnonic system (QM1), which is waveguide-coupled to a remote magnonic system (QM2). The protocol comprises two stages: (i) deterministic Bell-state generation between the SQ and QM1 using shortcuts to adiabaticity, and (ii) coherent state transfer to QM2 via engineered Hamiltonian dynamics. This adiabatic characteristic enhances robustness against environmental dissipation. Numerical simulations under realistic noise conditions confirm strong resilience to decoherence, achieving fidelity $F > 0.90$ and negativity $\mathcal{N}_2 > 0.40$. These results establish the protocol as a scalable and practical building block for distributed quantum networks.</p>

            <p>Quantum resources can, in principle, enable Heisenberg-limited (HL) sensing, yet no-go theorems imply that HL scaling is generically unattainable in realistic noisy devices. While quantum error correction (QEC) can suppress noise, its use in quantum sensing is constrained by stringent requirements, including prior noise characterization, restrictive signal-noise compatibility conditions, and measurement-based syndrome extraction with global control. Here we introduce an ICO-based QEC protocol, providing the first application of indefinite causal order (ICO) to QEC. By coherently placing auxiliary controls and noisy evolution in an indefinite causal order, the resulting noncommutative interference enables an auxiliary system to herald and correct errors in real time, thereby circumventing the limitations of conventional QEC and restoring HL scaling. We rigorously establish the protocol for single- and multi-noise scenarios and demonstrate its performance in single-qubit, many-body, and continuous-variable platforms. We further identify regimes in which error correction can be implemented entirely by unitary control, without measurements. Our results reveal ICO as a powerful resource for metrological QEC and provide a broadly applicable framework for noise-resilient quantum information processing.</p>

            <h2>Implicitly Restarted Lanczos Enables Chemically-Accurate Shallow Neural Quantum States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei Liu, Wenjie Dou</p>
            <p>The variational optimization of high-dimensional neural network models, such as those used in neural quantum states (NQS), presents a significant challenge in machine intelligence. Conventional first-order stochastic methods (e.g., Adam) are plagued by slow convergence, sensitivity to hyperparameters, and numerical instability, preventing NQS from reaching the high accuracy required for fundamental science. We address this fundamental optimization bottleneck by introducing the implicitly restarted Lanczos (IRL) method as the core engine for NQS training. Our key innovation is an inherently stable second-order optimization framework that recasts the ill-conditioned parameter update problem into a small, well-posed Hermitian eigenvalue problem. By solving this problem efficiently and robustly with IRL, our approach automatically determines the optimal descent direction and step size, circumventing the need for demanding hyperparameter tuning and eliminating the numerical instabilities common in standard iterative solvers. We demonstrate that IRL enables shallow NQS architectures (with orders of magnitude fewer parameters) to consistently achieve extreme precision (1e-12 kcal/mol) in just 3 to 5 optimization steps. For the F2 molecule, this translates to an approximate 17,900-fold speed-up in total runtime compared to Adam. This work establishes IRL as a superior, robust, and efficient second-order optimization strategy for variational quantum models, paving the way for the practical, high-fidelity application of neural networks in quantum physics and chemistry.</p>

The results show that no squeezing of $S_y$ occurs under any condition and that variance squeezing of $S_x$ appears only when $\Delta>0$. Entropy squeezing quantifies quantum fluctuations more precisely than variance squeezing. Moreover, the atomic squeezing of $S_x$ clearly depends on $\theta$, $\gamma_0/\kappa$, $\Delta$ and the initial state.

            <p>The atomic response to an ultra-intense driving field produces a characteristic high-harmonic spectrum featuring a rapid drop in intensity for the lower harmonics, followed by a plateau and a sharp cutoff. This response vanishes for circularly polarized classical drivers -- a limitation that can be overcome by introducing quantum features into the driving field. In this work, we show that squeezed highly elliptically polarized drivers not only enable the high-harmonic generation (HHG) process in classically forbidden regimes of large ellipticity, but also yield highly elliptical harmonic radiation with pronounced super-Poissonian photon statistics. Moreover, we show that the HHG spectral features encode information about the quantum nature of the driving field, revealing the presence of its squeezed field fluctuations. By analyzing the HHG spectral intensity dependence as a function of the driver's ellipticity and squeezing orientation, we identify a means to probe the driving field's quantum properties that intrinsically lie in the high-photon number regime.</p>

            <p>Quantum simulation of interacting many-body spin systems is routinely performed with cold trapped ions, and systems with hundreds of spins have been studied in one and two dimensions. In the most common realizations of these platforms, spin degrees of freedom are encoded in low-lying electronic levels, and interactions among the spins are mediated through crystal vibrations. Here we propose a new approach which enables the quantum simulation of two-dimensional spin systems with interaction strengths that are increased by orders of magnitude. This, together with the unprecedented longevity of trapped ions, opens an avenue for the exploration of phenomena that take place on long timescales, e.g., slow and collective relaxation in frustrated and kinetically constrained systems. Our platform makes use of the strong dipolar interactions among electronic Rydberg states and planar confinement provided by a Penning trap. We investigate how the strong electric and magnetic fields that form this trap affect the properties of the Rydberg states and show that spin-spin interaction strengths on the order of MHz are achievable under experimentally realistic conditions. As a brief illustration of the capabilities of this quantum simulator, we study the entanglement in a frustrated spin system realized by three ions.</p>

The usage of qutrits in our implementation allows hardware efficiently encoding of the walker position and the coin degree of freedom. By exploiting the flexibility and intrinsic symmetries of qutrit-based DTQWs, we successfully prepare two topological phases in the chain. For the first time, particle-hole-symmetry-protected edge states, bounded at the interface between these two topological phases, are observed in the superconducting platform.

            <h2>Global Parametric Gates for Multi-qubit Entanglement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jize Yang, Lin Guo, Haonan Xiong, Jiahui Wang, Yan Li, Yunfan Yang, Chenjie An, Hongyi Zhang, Luyan Sun, Yipu Song, Luming Duan</p>
            <p>We propose and experimentally demonstrate a global parametric gate that generates multi-qubit entangled states in a single step. By applying a parametric drive to a common qubit at precise detunings relative to computational qubits, we directly produce two-, three-, and four-qubit entanglement with state fidelities of 99.4\%\pm0.2\%, 93.4\%\pm0.3\%, and 91.4\%\pm0.3\%, respectively. This scheme enables efficient, reconfigurable control using only microwave drives and is compatible with fixed-frequency qubits. Error analyses indicate that infidelity stems primarily from decoherence and coherent control errors, with negligible contributions from static ZZ coupling and flux noise. Furthermore, simulations with state-of-the-art parameters predict this global gate can generate high-fidelity (99.70\%) entanglement in systems of up to six qubits.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Interaction Between Free Electrons and Light Involving First-order and Second-order Process</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongteng Lin, Xiaotong Xiong, Junjie Liu, Yidong Huang, Fang Liu</p>
            <p>Photon-induced Near-field Electron Microscopy (PINEM) effect has revealed the quantum interaction between free electrons and optical near filed, which demonstrated plenty of novel phenomena of manipulating free electron wave packet and detecting/shaping quantum photonic states. However, free electrons generally only absorb/emit one photon at a time, while the physical mechanism and phenomena of free electron-two-photon interaction have not been studied yet. Moreover, the relationship between PINEM and Kapitza-Dirac (KD) effect and nonlinear Compton scattering is still unclear. Here we develop the full quantum theory of electron-photon interaction considering the two-photon process. It is revealed that the emission/absorption of two photons by electrons can be greatly enhanced by manipulating the electric field component of optical near field, and the quantum interference between single-photon and two-photon processes can occur in some circumstances, which affects the photon number state, electron energy states and electron-photon entanglement. Meanwhile, it is found that the KD effect (elastic electron-photon scattering) and nonlinear Compton scattering (inelastic electron-photon scattering) are also a kind of two-photon process and the distribution of electrons can be deduced analytically based on the full quantum theory. Our work uncovers the possible abundant phenomena when free electron interacting with two photons, paves the way for more in-depth studies of nonlinear processes in electron-photon quantum interactions in the future.</p>

            <p>Frequency-tunable superconducting transmon qubits are a cornerstone of scalable quantum processors, yet their performance is often degraded by sensitivity to low-frequency flux noise. Here we present a doubly-connected gradiometric transmon (the ``8-mon") that incorporates a nano-airbridge to link its two loops. This design preserves full electrical tunability and remains fully compatible with standard X-mon control and readout, requiring no additional measurement overhead. The airbridge interconnect eliminates dielectric loss, which enables the 8-mon to achieve both energy relaxation times $T_{\rm 1}$ comparable to reference X-mons and, in the small flux-bias regime, a nearly threefold enhancement in Ramsey coherence time $T_{\rm 2}^*$. This improved $T_{\rm 2}^*$ reaches the same order as $T_{\rm 1}$ without employing echo decoupling. The device also exhibits superior long-term frequency stability even without any magnetic field shielding. We develop a spatially correlated flux-noise model whose simulations quantitatively reproduce the experimental coherence trends, revealing the coexistence of short- and long-correlation-length magnetic noise in the superconducting chip environment. By unifying high tunability with intrinsic flux-noise suppression through a robust geometric design, the 8-mon provides a practical pathway toward more coherent and stable superconducting quantum processors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arisa Ikeda, Akitada Sakurai, Kae Nemoto, Mayu Muramatsu</p>
            <p>Quantum machine learning (QML) is expected to offer new opportunities to process high-dimensional data efficiently by exploiting the exponentially large state space of quantum systems. In this work, we apply quantum extreme reservoir computing (QERC) to the classification of microstructure images of polymer alloys generated using self-consistent field theory (SCFT). While previous QML efforts have primarily focused on benchmark datasets such as MNIST, our work demonstrates the applicability of QERC to engineering data with direct materials relevance. Through numerical experiments, we examine the influence of key computational parameters-including the number of qubits, sampling cost (the number of measurement shots), and reservoir configuration-on classification performance. The resulting phase classifications are depicted as phase diagrams that illustrate the phase transitions in polymer morphology, establishing an understandable connection between quantum model outputs and material behavior. These results illustrate QERC performance on realistic materials datasets and suggest practical guidelines for quantum encoder design and model generalization. This work establishes a foundation for integrating quantum learning techniques into materials informatics.</p>

            <h2>Topological Obstructions for Quantum Adiabatic Algorithms: Evidence from MaxCut Instances</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Prathamesh S. Joshi</p>
            <p>Quantum adiabatic algorithms are commonly analyzed through local spectral properties of an interpolating Hamiltonian, most notably the minimum energy gap. While this perspective captures an important constraint on adiabatic runtimes, it does not fully describe the global structure of spectral evolution in optimization problems with degenerate solution manifolds. In this work, we show that degeneracy alone imposes unavoidable global constraints on spectral flow, even in instances where adiabatic algorithms succeed with high probability. Focusing on digitized quantum adiabatic evolutions, we analyze the eigenphases of the cumulative unitary operator generated along the interpolation path. By explicitly tracking eigenphase trajectories, we demonstrate that multiple spectral bands are forced to interact, braid, and permute before coalescing into a degenerate manifold at the end of the evolution. This global reordering manifests as persistent spectral congestion and nontrivial band permutations that cannot be removed by increasing evolution time or refining the digitization. Using MaxCut instances with controlled degeneracy as a concrete setting, we extract quantitative diagnostics of spectral congestion and explicitly compute the induced band permutations. Our results show that successful adiabatic optimization can coexist with complex and constrained spectral flow, revealing a form of topological obstruction rooted in the global connectivity of eigenstates rather than in local gap closures. These findings highlight intrinsic limitations of gap-based analyses and motivate spectral-flow-based diagnostics for understanding adiabatic algorithms in degenerate optimization landscapes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stefan Kettemann</p>
            <p>We extend the recently introduced strong disorder renormalization group method in real space, well suited to study bond disordered antiferromagnetic power law coupled quantum spin chains, to study excited states, and finite temperature properties. First, we apply it to a short range coupled spin chain, which is defined by the model with power law interaction, keeping only interactions between adjacent spins. We show that the distribution of the absolute value of the couplings is the infinite randomness fixed point distribution. However, the sign of the couplings becomes distributed, and the number of negative couplings increases with temperature $T.$ Next, we derive the Master equation for the power law long range interaction between all spins with power exponent $\alpha$. While the sign of the couplings is found to be distributed, the distribution of the coupling amplitude is given by the strong disorder distribution with finite width $2\alpha,$ with small corrections for $\alpha >2$. Resulting finite temperature properties of both short and power law long ranged spin systems are derived, including the magnetic susceptibility, concurrence and entanglement entropy.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xidi Wang</p>
            <p>Can purely mechanical systems generate intelligent language? We prove that dissipative quantum dynamics with analytically tractable non-local context aggregation produce coherent text generation, while conservation laws cause fundamental failure. Employing Koopman operators with closed-form path integral propagators, we show irreversible computation fundamentally requires both controlled information dissipation and causal context aggregation. Spectral analysis reveals emergent eigenvalue structure, separating into decay modes (forgetting), growth modes (amplification), and neutral modes (preservation) -- the essential ingredients for directed information flow. Hamiltonian constraints force the elimination of these dissipative modes and degrading performance despite unchanged model capacity. This establishes language generation as dissipative quantum field theory, proving mechanical systems acquire intelligence through the combination of dissipation and non-locality, not through conservation.</p>

            <p>We investigate the non-Hermitian Kitaev chain with non-reciprocal hopping amplitudes and asymmetric superconducting pairing. We work out the symmetry structure of the model and show that particle-hole symmetry (PHS) is preserved throughout the entire parameter regime. As a consequence of PHS, the topological phase transition point of a finite open chain coincides with that of the periodic (infinite) system. By explicitly constructing the zero-energy wave functions (Majorana modes), we show that Majorana modes necessarily occur as reciprocal localization pairs accumulating on opposite boundaries, whose combined probability density exhibits an exact cancellation of the non-Hermitian skin effect for the zero energy modes. Excited states, by contrast, generically display skin-effect localization, with particle and hole components accumulating at opposite ends of the system. At the level of bulk topology, we further construct a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant in restricted parameter regimes that correctly distinguishes the topological and trivial phases. Finally, we present the topological phase diagram of the non-Hermitian Kitaev chain across a broad range of complex parameters and delineate the associated phase boundaries.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Heat Transformers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arghya Maity, Paranjoy Chaki, Ahana Ghoshal, Ujjwal Sen</p>
            <p>We propose a quantum heat transformer (QHT), a quantum thermodynamic device that modulates temperature gradients between two thermal junctions in quantum systems. Functionally, the QHT is analogous to classical absorption heat transformers in its ability to redistribute thermal energy without external work input. Moreover, we show that its performance ratio mirrors that of classical voltage transformers, where the intrinsic parameters of the system play a role similar to the coil turn ratios. We initially design the device for a three-qubit system, representing the smallest possible self-contained heat transformer model. Subsequently we extend to four-qubit systems, with a specific emphasis on exploring the step-down mode as the primary focus. We showcase the versatility and adaptability of the models by illustrating that a variety of self-contained setups can be constructed, each corresponding to different configurations of the interaction Hamiltonian and their associated self-contained conditions. An important effect in this study is the proof of existence of a necessarily transient step-down quantum heat transformer, that has a dual-mode characteristic, wherein the desired step-down mode can be realized within the transient regime of an originally designed step-up mode of the QHT. We also investigate how to control this transient domain up to which the necessarily transient mode can be achieved, by regulating the initial temperature of the qubits in the four-qubit settings. Therefore, this quantum heat transformer model not only acts as an analog to the classical transformers, but also enjoys advanced characteristics, enabling it to function in both step-up and step-down modes within the same setup, unattainable for classical transformers.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alex A. Chapple, Alexander McDonald, Manuel H. Muñoz-Arias, Alexandre Blais</p>
            <p>Multi-photon processes deteriorate the quantum non-demolition (QND) character of the dispersive readout in circuit QED, causing readout to lag behind single and two-qubit gates, in both speed and fidelity. Alternative methods such as the longitudinal readout have been proposed, however, it is unknown to what extent multi-photon processes hinder this approach. Here we investigate the QND character of the longitudinal readout of the transmon qubit. We show that the deleterious effects that arise due to multi-photon transitions can be heavily suppressed with detuning, owing to the fact that the longitudinal interaction strength is independent of the transmon-resonator detuning. We consider the effect of circuit disorder, the selection rules that act on the transmon, as well as the description of longitudinal readout in the classical limit of the transmon to show qualitatively that longitudinal readout is robust. We show that fast, high-fidelity QND readout of transmon qubits is possible with longitudinal coupling.</p>

            <p>Dispersive readout, the standard method for measuring superconducting qubits, is limited by multiphoton qubit-resonator processes arising even at moderate drive powers. These processes degrade performance, causing dispersive readout to lag behind single- and two-qubit gates in both speed and fidelity. In this work, we propose a novel readout method, termed "junction readout". Junction readout leverages the nonperturbative cross-Kerr interaction resulting from coupling a qubit and a resonator via a Josephson junction. Furthermore, by adding a capacitive coupling in parallel to the junction, Purcell decay can be suppressed without the need for a Purcell filter. We also show that junction readout is more robust against deleterious multiphoton processes, and offers greater flexibility for resonator frequency allocation. Crucially, junction readout achieves superior performance compared to dispersive readout while maintaining similar hardware overhead. Numerical simulations show that junction readout can achieve fidelities exceeding $99.99\%$ in under $30$ ns, making it a promising alternative for superconducting qubit readout with current hardware.</p>

            <p>We investigate a Lieb lattice of quantum emitters coupled to a two-dimensional waveguide network and demonstrate that this system supports an energetically isolated flat band, enabling localization despite the presence of long-range photon-mediated couplings. We then explore the two-excitation dynamics in both the softcore and hardcore interaction regimes, which arise from the nonlinearity of the emitters. In the softcore regime, we observe interaction-induced photon transport within the flat band, mediated by the formation of bound photon pairs. In the hardcore regime, corresponding to the two-level atom limit, we instead find the emergence of metastable exciton-like dressed states involving both flat and dispersive bands. Our findings highlight how the interplay between the collective behavior of emitters and effective photon-photon interactions can provide a platform for studying highly correlated photonic states in flat-band systems.</p>

Quenching the two-body dissipator, we demonstrate controlled transitions from in-phase to anti-phase synchronization. This synchronization transition is robust against noise. Signatures of the transition are observed through Pearson correlation coefficient measurements obtained via quantum simulations on superconducting circuits.

            <p>Quantum channels are not invertible in general. A quasi-inverse allows for a partial recovery of the input state, but its analytical results are found only in a restricted space of its parameters. This work explores the potential of neural networks to find the quasi-inverse of qubit channels for any values of the channel parameters while keeping the quasi-inverse as a physically realizable quantum operation. We introduce a physics-inspired loss function based on the mean of the square of the modified trace distance (MSMTD). The scaled trace distance is used so that the neural network does not increase the length of the Bloch vector of the quantum states, which ensures that the network behaves as a completely positive and trace-preserving (CPTP) quantum channel. The Kraus operators of the quasi-inverse channel were obtained by performing quantum process tomography on the trained neural network.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guruprasad Kadam</p>
            <p>In this work, we introduce a novel state-dependent quantum cloning (copying) process by introducing a new class of ancillary system -- an adaptive ancilla -- modifying the conventional state-dependent quantum copying process. This state-dependent ancillary system is not pre-engineered to match the quantum state to be cloned; rather, it dynamically aligns with the quantum state to be cloned via interaction. However, the space of states that it can clone is restricted by the symmetry principles. This process, while resembling quantum cloning, adheres to the no-cloning theorem due to its state-dependent and non-universal nature. We demonstrate that stimulated emission offers a concrete physical realization of state-dependent quantum copying via an adaptive ancilla. We explore how a quantum state, for instance, a photon polarization, can be cloned through light-matter interactions when the ancillary system, such as an excited atom, contains implicit structural information about the quantum state in the form of a structured set of dynamical response channels. We reinterpret the excited atomic state as a realization of an adaptive ancilla, and cloning of a photon polarization state occurs when the quantum state of an excited atom dynamically aligns with the polarization state of the photon through physical interaction. We demonstrate that the true limits of cloning arise solely not from the no-cloning theorem, but from the symmetries imposed on physical systems\textthreequartersemdash constraints which may, in principle, be relaxed or engineered in suitable quantum systems, for instance in Rydberg atoms.</p>

We analyze the experimental resource requirements considering the unique qubit connectivity of the dynamically reconfigurable qubits in the optical tweezer array. The required qubit number scales linearly with the problem size, representing a significant improvement over existing Rydberg-based quantum annealing approaches that incur quadratic overhead. These results provide a concrete roadmap for future experimental efforts towards demonstrating quantum advantage in NP problem solving using Rydberg atomic systems.

            <p>A fundamental task in quantum information is to approximate a pure quantum state in terms of sparse states or, for a bipartite system, states of bounded Schmidt rank. The optimal deterministic approximation in each case is straightforward, and maximizes the fidelity: keep the largest entries or singular values. On the other hand, random mixtures of sparse states can achieve quadratically improved trace distances, and yield nontrivial bounds on other distance measures like the robustness. In this work, we give efficient algorithms for finding mixtures of sparse states that optimally approximate a given pure state in either trace distance or robustness. These algorithms also yield descriptions of efficiently samplable ensembles of sparse, or less-entangled, states that correspond to these optimal mixed approximations. This can be used for the truncation step of algorithms for matrix product states, improving their accuracy while using no extra memory, and we demonstrate this improvement numerically. Our proofs use basic facts about convex optimization and zero-sum games, as well as rigorous guarantees for computing maximum-entropy distributions.</p>

Application to intermolecular interaction energy calculations of hydrogen-bonded FH dimer and FH--H$_2$O demonstrates that our approach reproduces complete active space-configuration interaction (CAS-CI) values with errors below 0.04 kcal mol$^{-1}$.</p>

            <p>We reframe the EPR argument through an operational lens, replacing the notion of fixed "elements of reality" with context-indexed conditional states - what's often referred to as a measurement assemblage. This move deliberately sidesteps the assumption of context-independent values for incompatible observables. Our updated version of the Reality Criterion works like this: if Alice measures observable x and obtains outcome a, then Bob's system must adopt a conditional state that ensures the corresponding outcome for that specific context. Crucially, we also assume operational completeness - a condition that quantum mechanics satisfies when we're dealing with quantum-reachable assemblages. Now, in any theory where one party cannot signal to the other (so-called one-sided no-signaling theories), perfect predictions do support drawing context-indexed inferences. But - and this is key - they don't legitimize assigning fixed values across all contexts. We rigorously demonstrate this distinction. To ground the argument, we offer examples: the qubit singlet scenario using Pauli settings and CJWR thresholds, a continuous-variable case based on the Reid criteria, and a counterexample in the spirit of the PR box, which highlights the boundaries of what quantum theory can actually reach.</p>

            <h2>Universal quantum control over non-Hermitian continuous-variable systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhu-yao Jin, Jun Jing</p>
            <p>Current studies of non-Hermitian continuous-variable systems heavily revolved around the singularities in the eigen-spectrum by mimicking their discrete-variable counterparts. The growing discussions over the nonunitary features in time evolution, however, are limited in scalability and controllability. We here develop a general theory to control an arbitrary number of bosonic modes under the time-dependent non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Far beyond the subspace of few excitations, our control theory operates in the full Hilbert space within the Heisenberg framework and exploits the gauge potential underlying the instantaneous frames rather than the eigen-spectrum. In particular, the instantaneous frames are defined by time-dependent ancillary operators as linear combinations of laboratory-frame operators; while the associated gauge potential arises from the unitary transformation connecting the time-dependent and stationary ancillary frames. We find that the upper triangularization condition of non-Hermitian Hamiltonian's coefficient matrix in the stationary ancillary frame gives rise to nonadiabatic passages of two time-dependent ancillary operators, also leading to exact solutions of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. At the end of these passages, the probability conservation of the system wavefunction can be automatically restored without artificial normalization. Our theory is exemplified with the perfect and nonreciprocal state transfers in a cavity magnonic system. The former holds for arbitrary initial states and is irrelevant to both parity-time symmetry of the coefficient matrix and exceptional points of eigen-spectrum; and the latter is consistent with the coherent perfect absorbtion. We essentially constructs the universal quantum control (UQC) theory for the non-Hermitian continuous-variable systems, promising a powerful and reliable approach for their coherent control.</p>

However, a direct brute-force enumeration of all Pauli strings and the corresponding expectation values from a length-$2^N$ state vector, where $N$ is the system size, yields an overall computational cost scaling as $O(8^N)$, which quickly becomes infeasible as the system size grows. Here we reformulate the second-order stabilizer Rényi entropy in a bitstring language, expose an underlying XOR-convolution structure on $\mathbb Z_2^N$, and reduce the computation to $2^N$ fast Walsh-Hadamard transforms of length, together with pointwise operations, yielding a deterministic and exact XOR fast Walsh-Hadamard transforms algorithm with runtime scaling $O(N4^N)$ and natural parallelism. This algorithm enables high-precision, medium-scale exact calculations for generic state vectors. It provides a practical tool for probing the scaling, phase diagnostics, and dynamical fine structure of quantum magic in many-body systems.</p>

            <h2>Pauli stabilizer formalism for topological quantum field theories and generalized statistics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yitao Feng, Hanyu Xue, Ryohei Kobayashi, Po-Shen Hsin, Yu-An Chen</p>
            <p>Topological quantum field theory (TQFT) provides a unifying framework for describing topological phases of matter and for constructing quantum error-correcting codes, playing a central role across high-energy physics, condensed matter, and quantum information. A central challenge is to formulate topological order on lattices and to extract the properties of topological excitations from microscopic Hamiltonians. In this work, we construct new classes of lattice gauge theories as Pauli stabilizer models, realizing a wide range of TQFTs in general dimensions. We develop a lattice description of extended excitations and systematically determine their generalized statistics. Our main example is the (4+1)D fermionic-loop toric code, obtained by condensing the $e^2m^2$-loop in the (4+1)D $\mathbb{Z}_4$ toric code. We show that the loop excitation exhibits fermionic loop statistics: the 24-step loop-flipping process yields a phase of $-1$. Our Pauli stabilizer models realize all twisted 2-form gauge theories in (4+1)D, the higher-form Dijkgraaf-Witten TQFT classified by $H^5(B^2G,U(1))$. Beyond (4+1)D, the fermionic-loop toric codes form a family of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders in arbitrary dimensions, realized as explicit Pauli stabilizer codes using $\mathbb{Z}_4$ qudits. Finally, we develop a Pauli-based framework that defines generalized statistics for extended excitations in any dimension, yielding computable lattice unitary processes to detect nontrivial statistics. For example, we propose anyonic membrane statistics in (6+1)D, as well as fermionic membrane and volume statistics in arbitrary dimensions. We construct new families of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders: the fermionic-membrane toric code and the fermionic-volume toric code. In addition, we demonstrate that $p$-dimensional excitations in $2p+2$ spatial dimensions can support anyonic $p$-brane statistics for only even $p$.</p>

            <h2>Tunable quantum criticality and pseudocriticality across the fixed-point annihilation in the anisotropic spin-boson model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Manuel Weber</p>
            <p>Spin-boson models are simple examples of quantum dissipative systems, but also serve as effective models in quantum magnetism and exhibit nontrivial criticality. Recently, they have been established as a platform to study the nontrivial renormalization-group (RG) scenario of fixed-point annihilation, in which two intermediate-coupling RG fixed points collide and generate an extremely slow RG flow near the collision. For the Bose Kondo model, a single $S=1/2$ spin where each spin component couples to an independent bosonic bath with power-law spectrum $\propto \omega^s$ via dissipation strengths $\alpha_i$, $i\in\{x,y,z\}$, such phenomena occur sequentially for the U(1)-symmetric model at $\alpha_z=0$ and the SU(2)-symmetric case at $\alpha_z = \alpha_{xy}$, as the bath exponent $s<1$ is tuned. Here we use an exact wormhole quantum Monte Carlo method for retarded interactions to explore how this nontrivial fixed-point structure affects the phase diagram and phase transitions of the anisotropic model. In particular, we show how fixed-point annihilation within a symmetry-enhanced critical manifold leads to (i) a continuous order-to-order transition beyond the Landau paradigm, (ii) a symmetry-enhanced first-order transition, and (iii) pseudocriticality, which can be tuned into each other via the bath exponent $s$. We extract critical exponents at the continuous transition, but also find scaling behavior at the symmetry-enhanced first-order transition, for which the inverse correlation-length exponent is given by the bath exponent $s$. Moreover, we provide direct numerical evidence for pseudocritical scaling on both sides of the fixed-point collision, which manifests in an extremely slow drift of the correlation-length exponent. We also study the crossover away from the SU(2)-symmetric case and determine the phase boundary of an extended U(1)-symmetric critical phase.</p>

            <h2>On the Continuity of Schur-Horn Mapping</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hengzhun Chen, Yingzhou Li</p>
            <p>The Schur-Horn theorem is a well-known result that characterizes the relationship between the diagonal elements and eigenvalues of a symmetric (Hermitian) matrix. In this paper, we extend this theorem by exploring the eigenvalue perturbation of a symmetric (Hermitian) matrix with fixed diagonals, which is referred to as the continuity of the Schur-Horn mapping. We introduce a concept called strong Schur-Horn continuity, characterized by minimal constraints on the perturbation. We demonstrate that several categories of matrices exhibit strong Schur-Horn continuity. Leveraging this notion, along with a majorization constraint on the perturbation, we prove the Schur-Horn continuity for general symmetric (Hermitian) matrices. The Schur-Horn continuity finds applications in oblique manifold optimization related to quantum computing.</p>

            <h2>A generalization of the Choi isomorphism with application to open quantum systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Heinz-Jürgen Schmidt</p>
            <p>Completely positive transformations play an important role in the description of state changes in quantum mechanics, including the time evolution of open quantum systems. One useful tool to describe them is the so-called Choi isomorphism, which maps completely positive transformations to positive semi-definite matrices. Accordingly, there are numerous proposals to generalize the Choi isomorphism. In the present paper, we show that the 1976 paper of Gorini, Kossakowski and Sudarshan (GKS) already holds the key for a further generalization and study the resulting GKS isomorphism. As an application, we compute the GKS matrix of the time evolution of a general open quantum system up to second order in time.</p>

The research identifies key trends in regional job distribution, degree and skill requirements, and the evolving demand for QT-related roles. Findings reveal a strong presence of the QT job market in the United States and Europe, with increasing corporate demand for engineers, software developers, and PhD-level researchers. Despite growing industry applications, the sector remains in its early stages, dominated by large technology firms.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hossein Hosseinabadi, Yaroslav Tserkovnyak, Eugene Demler, Jamir Marino</p>
            <p>We uncover a new class of dynamical quantum instability in driven magnets leading to emergent enhancement of antiferromagnetic correlations even for purely ferromagnetic microscopic couplings. A primary parametric amplification creates a frequency-tuned nested magnon distribution in momentum space, which seeds a secondary instability marked by the emergence of enhanced antiferromagnetic correlations, mirroring the instability of nested Fermi surfaces in electronic systems. In sharp contrast to the fermionic case, however, the magnon-driven instability is intrinsically non-equilibrium and fundamentally inaccessible in thermal physics. Its quantum mechanical origin sets it apart from classical instabilities such as Faraday and modulation instabilities, which underlie several instances of dynamical behavior observed in magnetic and cold-atom systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akilesh Venkatesh, Phay J. Ho</p>
            <p>We theoretically investigate resonant x-ray scattering from two non-interacting Ne+ ions driven by an intense attosecond pulse using a non-relativistic, QED-based time-dependent framework. Our model includes Rabi oscillations, photoionization, Auger decay, and quantum interference among elastic scattering and resonance fluorescence pathways. We analyze how the total scattering signal depends on pulse intensity, atomic configuration, and initial electronic state. We find that the total resonant scattering yield exceeds its non-resonant counterpart; the angular dependence of the signal qualitatively resembles a two-atom structure factor; and the visibility of interference fringes is sensitive to pulse area and the initial electronic state. Only a subset of final states reached via resonance fluorescence exhibits interference, determined by the indistinguishability of photon emission pathways. Fringe visibility is maximized in the linear scattering regime, where ionization is minimal and resonance fluorescence pathways can be largely indistinguishable. These results highlight optimal conditions for applying ultrafast resonant x-ray scattering to single-particle imaging.</p>

            <p>Quantum scattering calculations for strongly interacting molecular systems are computationally demanding due to the large number of molecular states coupled by the anisotropy of atom - molecule interactions. We demonstrate that thermal rate coefficients for total (elastic + inelastic) atom - molecule scattering are insensitive to the interaction anisotropy of the underlying potential energy surface. In particular, we show that the rate coefficients for Rb-H$_2$ and Rb-N$_2$ scattering at room temperature can be computed to 1% accuracy with anisotropy set to zero, reducing the complexity of coupled channel quantum scattering calculations to numerical solutions of a single differential equation. Our numerical calculations and statistical analysis based on Gaussian process regression elucidate the origin and limitations of the invariance of the total scattering rate coefficients to changes in atom - molecule interaction anisotropy.</p>

            <p>Motivated by the profound connection between quantum mechanics and spacetime geometry, particularly the conjectured correspondence between wormholes and quantum entanglement as proposed in the ER=EPR framework, this study investigate the influence of wormhole geometries on quantum information extraction. We examine the correlation-specifically mutual information (MI) and entanglement-extracted by two Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detectors from the quantum vacuum field in the presence of a BTZ wormhole featuring a null-like throat, also known as an Einstein-Rosen bridge. First, we analyze how the detector's position relative to the wormhole throat and the throat's size affect the extracted MI. Our results indicate that the wormhole enhances MI extraction, with maximal MI achieved when the detectors are located at specific image-symmetric points connected by the wormhole. By analyzing the behavior of the nonlocal contribution term and the classical noise term, it is found that the correlations extracted contain genuine non-classical components. This work highlights the feasibility of extracting quantum correlations through null-like wormhole geometries and provides a novel perspective for probing the potential relationship between spacetime topology and the nonlocal characteristics of quantum mechanics.</p>

Our findings are related to recent results obtained independently by Benedikter, Lill and Naidu, and the analysis applies to a general class of singular potentials rather than just the Coulomb case.</p>

            <h2>Classical vs quantum dynamics and the onset of chaos in a macrospin system</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haowei Fan, Vladimir Fal'ko, Xiao Li</p>
            <p>We study a periodically driven macrospin system with anisotropic long-range interactions and collective dissipation, described by a Lindblad master equation. In the thermodynamic limit ($N\to\infty$), a mean-field treatment yields classical equations of motion, whose dynamics are characterized via the maximal Lyapunov exponent (MLE). Focusing on the thermodynamic limit, we map out chaotic, quasiperiodic, and periodic phases via bifurcation diagrams, MLEs, and Fourier spectra of evolved observables, identifying classic period-doubling bifurcations and fractal boundaries in the regions of attractors. Finite-size quantum simulations in the Dicke basis reveal that while both quantum and classical systems exhibit diverse dynamical phases, finite-size effects suppress some behaviors present in the thermodynamic limit. The sign of $\lambda_{\mathrm{max}}$ serves as a key indicator of convergence between quantum and classical dynamics, which agree over timescales up to the Lyapunov time. Analysis of the density matrix shows that convergence occurs only when its nonzero elements are sharply localized. However, the nonconvergence does not imply a fundamental difference between quantum and classical dynamics: in chaotic regimes, although the evolution orbits of quantum and classical systems show significant differences, quantum evolution becomes mixed and diffusively explores the Hilbert space, signaling quantum chaos, which can be confirmed by the delocalized nature of the density matrix.</p>

Despite significant improvements in recent years, the need to operate near an instability point imposes a fundamental constraint: the instantaneous bandwidth decreases with increasing amplifier gain.

Realized in a granular aluminum dimer with Kerr nonlinearity, our method demonstrates a sixfold bandwidth increase at 20 dB gain, surpasses the conventional gain$-$bandwidth scaling up to 25 dB, and remains near the quantum limit.</p>

Under the collision model with cascade interaction, we verify that both the strength and the phase of the coherence term determine the direction and magnitude of energy transfer.

            <p>Distributed quantum computing (DQC) is a promising technique for scaling up quantum systems. While significant progress has been made in DQC for quantum circuit models, there exists much less research on DQC for measurement-based quantum computing (MBQC), which is a universal quantum computing model that is essentially different from the circuit model and particularly well-suited to photonic quantum platforms. In this paper, we propose DC-MBQC, the first distributed quantum compilation framework tailored for MBQC. We identify and address two key challenges in enabling DQC for MBQC. First, for task allocation among quantum processing units (QPUs), we develop an adaptive graph partitioning algorithm that preserves the structure of the graph state while balancing the workload across QPUs. Second, for inter-QPU communication, we introduce the layer scheduling problem and propose an algorithm to solve it. Regrading realistic hardware requirements, we optimize the execution time of running quantum programs and the corresponding required photon lifetime to avoid fatal failures caused by photon loss. Our experiments demonstrate a $7.46\times$ improvement on required photon lifetime and $6.82\times$ speedup with 8 fully-connected QPUs, which further confirm the advantage of distributed quantum computing in photonic systems.

            <p>Realizing the full potential of quantum computation requires Quantum Error Correction (QEC). QEC reduces error rates by encoding logical information across redundant physical qubits, enabling errors to be detected and corrected. A common decoder used for this task is Minimum Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) a graph-based algorithm that relies on edge weights to identify the most likely error chains. In this work, we propose a data-driven decoder named Neural Minimum Weight Perfect Matching (NMWPM). Our decoder utilizes a hybrid architecture that integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to extract local syndrome features and Transformers to capture long-range global dependencies, which are then used to predict dynamic edge weights for the MWPM decoder. To facilitate training through the non-differentiable MWPM algorithm, we formulate a novel proxy loss function that enables end-to-end optimization. Our findings demonstrate significant performance reduction in the Logical Error Rate (LER) over standard baselines, highlighting the advantage of hybrid decoders that combine the predictive capabilities of neural networks with the algorithmic structure of classical matching.</p>

            <p>This work provides an alternative derivation of third order response functions in four wave mixing spectroscopy of multichromophoric macromolecular systems considering only single exciton states. For the case of harmonic oscillator bath linearly and diagonally coupled to exciton states, closed form expressions showing all the explicit time dependences are derived. These expressions can provide more solid physical basis for understanding 2-dimensional electronic spectroscopy signals. For more general cases of system-bath coupling, the quantum master equation (QME) approach is employed for the derivation of multistep time evolution equations for Green function-like operators. Solution of these equations is feasible at the level of 2nd order non-Markovian QME, and the new approach can account for inter-exciton coupling, dephasing, relaxation, and non-Markovian effects in a consistent manner.</p>

            <p>Electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in $\Lambda$-type atomic systems underpins quantum technologies such as high-fidelity memory and nonlinear optics, but conventional setups face intrinsic limitations. Standard geometries of one-dimensional atomic chains coupled to waveguides allow only a single bright superradiant channel, while subradiant modes remain weakly accessible, limiting control over collective radiative behavior and dark-state pathways. This leads to unwanted inelastic processes, degrading memory fidelity and reducing nonlinear photon generation efficiency. Here, we propose two two-dimensional (2D) atomic lattice geometries coupled to a photonic crystal waveguide, namely Zigzag and Orthogonal structures. In the Zigzag model, engineered collective super- and subradiant modes produce a flattened EIT window, broadening the transmission bandwidth and suppressing unwanted scattering to enhance quantum memory fidelity. In the Orthogonal model, four-wave mixing (FWM) intensity is amplified by up to six orders of magnitude relative to a conventional one-dimensional $\Lambda$-type EIT chain with identical $\Gamma_{1D}$, $\Omega_c$, and probe intensity, with localized idler photons forming well-defined spectral modes. These results demonstrate a versatile route to engineer structured photonic reservoirs for on-demand photon generation, high-fidelity quantum storage, and enhanced nonlinear optical processes.</p>

            <p>As quantum dot (QD)-based spin qubits advance toward larger, more complex device architectures, rapid, automated device characterization and data analysis tools become critical. The orientation and spacing of transition lines in a charge stability diagram (CSD) contain a fingerprint of a QD device's capacitive environment, making these measurements useful tools for device characterization. However, manually interpreting these features is time-consuming, error-prone, and impractical at scale. Here, we present an automated protocol for extracting underlying capacitive properties from CSDs. Our method integrates machine learning, image processing, and object detection to identify and track charge transitions across large datasets without manual labeling. We demonstrate this method using experimentally measured data from a strained-germanium single-quantum-well (planar) and a strained-germanium double-quantum-well (bilayer) QD device. Unlike for planar QD devices, CSDs in bilayer germanium heterostructure exhibit a larger set of transitions, including interlayer tunneling and distinct loading lines for the vertically stacked QDs, making them a powerful testbed for automation methods. By analyzing the properties of many CSDs, we can statistically estimate physically relevant quantities, like relative lever arms and capacitive couplings. Thus, our protocol enables rapid extraction of useful, nontrivial information about QD devices.</p>

Differences from the commonly used single-mode Hopfield Hamiltonian are revealed. The nonresonant role of polaritons in the ground-state energy shift is also demonstrated, showing that the cavity effect is mainly caused by static screening occurring at very low frequencies.

            <p>Recent advances in combining Clifford circuits with tensor-network (TN) methods have shown that classically simulable disentanglers can suppress substantial portions of the entanglement structure, effectively alleviating the bond-dimension bottleneck in TN simulations. In this work, we develop a variational TN framework based on Grassmann tensor networks, which natively encode fermionic statistics while preserving locality. By incorporating locally defined Clifford circuits within the fermionic formalism, we simulate benchmark models including the tight-binding and $t$-$V$ models. Our results show that Clifford disentangling removes the classically simulable component of entanglement, leading to a reduced bond dimension and improved accuracy in ground-state energy estimates. Interestingly, once the natural Grassmann-evenness requirement of the fermionic formulation is taken into account and Clifford gates with identical entanglement action are grouped together, the original set of 11520 two-qubit Clifford gates reduces to only 12 distinct gates. This strong reduction leads to a more efficient disentangling scheme within the fermionic framework. These findings highlight the potential of Clifford-augmented Grassmann TNs as a scalable and accurate tool for studying strongly correlated fermionic systems, particularly in higher dimensions.</p>

Implemented for a particle confined in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, the cycle's performance is benchmarked against the classical three-stroke triangular and isochoric engines. We find that the quantum isochoric cycle achieves a higher efficiency than both classical counterparts and also surpasses the efficiency of the recently proposed three-stroke quantum isoenergetic cycle. Owing to its reduced number of strokes, the design substantially lowers control complexity in nanoscale thermodynamic devices, offering a more feasible route to experimental realization compared to conventional four-stroke architectures. We further evaluate the cycle in graphene-based systems under an external magnetic field, including monolayer graphene (MLG), AB-stacked bilayer graphene (BLG), and twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) at both magic and non-magic twist angles. Among these platforms, magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) attains the highest efficiency at fixed work output, highlighting its promise for quantum thermodynamic applications.</p>

While the optical frequency comb revolutionized timekeeping by discretizing the continuum of light into countable teeth, and the Quantum Hall Effect standardized resistance via topological invariants, a comparable standard for interaction strength remains elusive. Currently, measuring the coupling constant ($g$) between quantum systems is an estimation problem, inherently subject to drift, noise, and fabrication variance. Here, we introduce Interaction Metrology, a protocol that transforms the measurement of coupling strengths from an analog estimation into a topological counting problem. By engineering a specific class of algebraic catastrophe -- the Unimodal $X_9$ singularity -- in a driven-dissipative lattice, we prove that the system's interaction moduli are topologically forced to take discrete, quantized values, forming a "Geometric $k$-Comb." We derive the universality class of this quantization, showing that it arises from the discrepancy between the Milnor ($\mu$) and Tjurina ($\tau$) numbers of the effective potential, a strictly non-Hermitian effect forbidden in standard quantum mechanics. Finally, we provide an ab-initio blueprint for a silicon nitride implementation, demonstrating that this quantization is robust against disorder levels exceeding current foundry tolerances. This discovery establishes a universal standard for force sensing and quantum logic gates, enabling the calibration of interaction strengths with topological certainty.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lorenzo Pirovano</p>
            <p>We study the thermodynamic cost of maintaining a continuous binary record of a vacuum or no-vacuum measurement. Modeling the monitoring as a time-binned click or no-click process with finite bandwidth, we treat the outcomes as a classical register that is reset after each bin. Landauer's principle then yields an operational lower bound on the dissipated heat rate set by the Shannon entropy rate of the measurement record. We discuss the role of coarse-graining, extend the analysis to many monitored modes, including correlations and compressibility, and provide parameter estimates for circuit-QED photon monitoring, with a speculative horizon-based bookkeeping illustration.</p>

            <h2>DifGa: Differentiable Error Mitigation for Multi-Mode Gaussian and Non-Gaussian Noise in Quantum Photonic Circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dennis Delali Kwesi Wayo, Rodrigo Alves Dias, Leonardo Goliatt, Sven Groppe</p>
            <p>We introduce DifGa, a fully differentiable error-mitigation framework for continuous-variable (CV) quantum photonic circuits operating under Gaussian loss and weak non-Gaussian noise. The approach is demonstrated using analytic simulations with the this http URL backend of PennyLane, where quantum states are represented by first and second moments and optimized end-to-end via automatic differentiation. Gaussian loss is modeled as a beam splitter interaction with an environmental vacuum mode of transmissivity $\eta \in [0.3,0.95]$, while non-Gaussian phase noise is incorporated through a differentiable Monte-Carlo mixture of random phase rotations with jitter amplitudes $\delta \in [0,0.7]$. The core architecture employs a multi-mode Gaussian circuit consisting of a signal, ancilla, and environment mode. Input states are prepared using squeezing and displacement operations with parameters $(r_s,\varphi_s,\alpha)=(0.60,0.30,0.80)$ and $(r_a,\varphi_a)=(0.40,0.10)$, followed by an entangling beam splitter with angles $(\theta,\phi)=(0.70,0.20)$. Error mitigation is achieved by appending a six-parameter trainable Gaussian recovery layer comprising local phase rotations and displacements, optimized by minimizing a quadratic loss on the signal-mode quadratures $\langle \hat{x}_0\rangle$ and $\langle \hat{p}_0\rangle$ using gradient descent with fixed learning rate $0.06$ and identical initialization across experiments. Under pure Gaussian loss, the optimized recovery suppresses reconstruction error to near machine precision ($<10^{-30}$) for moderate loss ($\eta \ge 0.5$). When non-Gaussian phase noise is present, noise-aware training using Monte Carlo averaging yields robust generalization, reducing error by more than an order of magnitude compared to Gaussian-trained recovery at large phase jitter. Runtime benchmarks confirm linear scaling with the number of Monte Carlo samples.</p>

            <h2>Efficient simulation of logical magic state preparation protocols</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samyak Surti, Lucas Daguerre, Isaac H. Kim</p>
            <p>Developing space- and time-efficient logical magic state preparation protocols will likely be an essential step towards building a large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computer. Motivated by this need, we introduce a scalable method for simulating logical magic state preparation protocols under the standard circuit-level noise model. When applied to protocols based on code switching, magic state cultivation, and magic state distillation, our method yields a complexity polynomial in (i) the number of qubits and (ii) the non-stabilizerness, e.g., stabilizer rank or Pauli rank, of the target encoded magic state. The efficiency of our simulation method is rooted in a curious fact: every circuit-level Pauli error in these protocols propagates to a Clifford error at the end. This property is satisfied by a large family of protocols, including those that repeatedly measure a transversal Clifford that squares to a Pauli. We provide a proof-of-principle numerical simulation that prepares a magic state using such logical Clifford measurements. Our work enables practical simulation of logical magic state preparation protocols without resorting to approximations or resource-intensive state-vector simulations.</p>

            <p>We present here several new exact results for a number of entangled states: the W-state of three qubits and its generalization -- Dicke states for more than three qubits. We derive these results by bounding the expected values of the Bell-Mermin operators. We review the three qubit GHZ Mermin device, make its generalization to four qubits, and then construct analogous Mermin devices for the generalized Dicke states of three and four qubits. As a result of studying if their operations can be fully explained by Mermin's instructional sets, we show that the GHZ and Dicke states of three qubits and the GHZ state of four qubits do not allow such a description. However, among the two generalized Dicke states of four qubits, one does allow and the other does not allow such a description.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francisco Figueiredo, Itzhak Roditi</p>
            <p>We investigate squeezed states of composite bosons (cobosons) formed by pairs of spin-$1/2$ fermions, with emphasis on Frenkel-like cobosons. While squeezing for standard bosonic modes is well established, its extension to cobosons requires accounting for Pauli blocking and the resulting non-canonical commutation algebra. Building on earlier constructions of coboson coherent states, we define squeezed cobosons as eigenstates of a Bogoliubov transformed coboson operator and derive explicit expressions for the associated quadrature variances. We show that the underlying fermionic structure leads to state-dependent modifications of the Heisenberg--Robertson uncertainty bound, which may fall below the canonical bosonic limit without implying any violation of uncertainty principles. Numerical results based on finite-dimensional matrix representations illustrate how these effects constrain the attainable squeezing. Our framework is relevant to composite boson systems such as tightly bound electron-hole pairs and provides a physically transparent setting to probe compositeness through observable quadrature fluctuations.</p>

            <p>Multiphoton states are needed for quantum communication and computation. Multiphoton states are significantly more difficult to generate than one- and two-photon states because two individual down-conversion processes must be cascaded. Only efficiencies of $<100$ Hz/mW have been reported to date. We integrate two down-converters on the same thin-film lithium niobate waveguide, significantly enhancing the cascaded process efficiency to $237 \pm 36$ kHz/mW. The measured $4.4\times10^{-5}$ probability of the second down-converter, which sets the limit on detectable triplet rates, exceeds those of previous triplet sources by an order of magnitude and demonstrates a path towards MHz rates of triplets for quantum applications.</p>

            <p>Quantum entanglement is a crucial resource in quantum information processing, advancing quantum technologies. The greater the uncertainty in subsystems' pure states, the stronger the quantum entanglement between them. From the dual form of $q$-concurrence ($q\geq 2$) we introduce the total concurrence. A bona fide measure of quantum entanglement is introduced, the $\mathcal{C}^{t}_q$-concurrence ($q \geq 2$), which is based on the total concurrence. Analytical lower bounds for the $\mathcal{C}^{t}_q$-concurrence are derived. In addition, an analytical expression is derived for the $\mathcal{C}^{t}_q$-concurrence in the cases of isotropic and Werner states. Furthermore, the monogamy relations that the $\mathcal{C}^{t}_q$-concurrence satisfies for qubit systems are examined. Additionally, based on the parameterized $\alpha$-concurrence and its complementary dual, the $\mathcal{C}^{t}_\alpha$-concurrence $(0\leq\alpha\leq\frac{1}{2})$ is also proposed.</p>

            <h2>Parametric amplification of continuous variable entangled state for loss-tolerant multi-phase estimation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sijin Li, Wei Wang</p>
            <p>Quantum parameter estimation exploits quantum states to achieve estimation sensitivity beyond classical limit. In continuous variable (CV) regime, squeezed state has been exploited to implement deterministic phase estimation. It is however, often restricted by fragility of quantum states. The quantum phase estimation sensitivity of squeezed state is significantly affected by loss or detection inefficiency, which restrict its applications. This issue can be solved by using a method of parametric amplification of squeezed state \cite{OPA}. In this work, we implement multi-phase estimation with optical parametric amplification of entanglement generated from squeezed states. We find multi-phase estimation sensitivity is robust against loss or detection inefficiency, where we use two-mode Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen entangled state and four-mode cluster state for analysis. Our work provides a method for realizing large-scale quantum metrology in real-world applications against loss or detection inefficiency.</p>

            <p>Quantum key distribution (QKD) enables secure communication by harnessing the fundamental principles of quantum physics, which inherently guarantee information-theoretic security and intrinsic resistance to quantum computing attacks. However, the secure key rate of QKD typically decreases exponentially with increasing channel distance. In this work, by developing a novel polarization-state preparation method, an ultra-low time-jitter laser source and superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors, we demonstrate a 5-GHz integrated QKD system featuring ultra-low quantum bit error rates (QBERs). The system achieves secure key rates of 1.076 Mbps at 150 km and 105 kbps at 200 km over standard single-mode fiber channels, respectively. Our system substantially enhances the secure key rate, enabling high-resolution video calls with one-time-pad encryption over intercity backbone QKD links.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Souvik Chatterjee, Prasenjit Deb, Chandan Datta, Pankaj Agrawal</p>
            <p>Multipartite entangled states possess a number of non-intuitive properties, making them a useful resource for various quantum information-processing tasks. The three-qubit W-state is one such example where every state is robust to single-qubit loss. However, this state is not suitable for deterministic distribution, and deterministic communication protocols. Here, we focus on the distribution of a non-symmetric version of such states, namely $W_{\mathrm{mod}}$ states. These states belong to the W-class, and have one ebit of entanglement across a specific bipartition, enabling deterministic teleportation and superdense coding. In particular, we describe a few protocols through which these multipartite entangled states can be distributed {\it deterministically} in a quantum network by first preparing them locally in a central node and then transmitting individual qubits to the end nodes. We analyse the performance of these protocols based on the fidelity of the final distributed state, considering all types of noises that can act during the distribution. Finally, we compare the performance of the protocols to the case where the distribution is performed without any central node.</p>

            <h2>Gravitationally Induced Entanglement Between Particles in Harmonic Traps: Limits for Gaussian States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julia Tokarska, Andrzej Dragan</p>
            <p>Gravitationally induced entanglement has been proposed as a probe of the quantum nature of gravity. This work analyzes a system of two particles in harmonic traps interacting only through gravity, considering thermal and two-mode squeezed initial states. For thermal states, a maximum temperature is identified above which entanglement cannot be generated, and for fixed system parameters an optimal trap frequency that maximizes the logarithmic negativity is found. Squeezing the initial state does not further enhance the entanglement generation, but increases the temperature range over which it can be observed. Extending the analysis to general Gaussian states, an upper bound on the achievable entanglement is derived and shown to be saturated, for example, by ground and squeezed states. The results show that the amount of entanglement generated in this setup is extremely small, highlighting the experimental challenges of observing gravitationally induced quantum effects.</p>

            <p>An effective model for describing the relativistic quantum dynamics of a radiating electron is developed via a relativistic generalization of the Lindblad master equation. By incorporating both radiation reaction and vacuum fluctuations into the Dirac equation within an open quantum system framework, our approach captures the Zitterbewegung of the electron, ensuing noncommutativity of its effective spatial coordinates, and provides the quantum analogue of the Landau-Lifshitz (LL) classical equation of motion with radiation reaction. We develop the corresponding phase-space representation via the relativistic Wigner function and derive the semiclassical limit through a Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation. The latter elucidates the signature of quantum vacuum fluctuations in the LL equation, and shows its relationship with the corrected Sokolov equation. Our results offer a robust framework for investigating quantum radiation reaction effects in ultrastrong laser fields.</p>

            <p>In this work, we investigate the dynamics of quantum synchronization in a four-mode optomechanical system, focusing on the influence of the Coulomb interaction between two mechanical resonators. We analyze the effect of the Coulomb coupling on three distinct synchronization regimes, i.e., complete quantum synchronization, $\phi$-synchronization, and quantum phase synchronization. Our results show that while the Coulomb interaction plays a pivotal role in significantly enhancing quantum phase synchronization by facilitating energy exchange and phase coherence, it has little impact on complete and $\phi$-synchronization. This indicates that amplitude and frequency locking are primarily determined by the optical driving, whereas phase alignment depends critically on inter-resonator coupling. We also demonstrate that the oscillations of the two optical cavities, which are indirectly coupled via the mechanical resonators, can become aligned over time, resulting in classical synchronization. These findings provide a robust mechanism for controlling collective quantum dynamics and offer a foundation for applications in quantum communication, precision sensing, and the development of synchronized quantum networks.</p>

            <p>These lecture notes discuss applications of atom-light interactions in cavities to quantum metrology, simulation, and computation. A focus is on nonlocally interacting spin systems realized by coupling many atoms to a delocalized mode of light. We will build up from the fundamentals: understanding how a cavity enables light to coherently imprint information on atoms and atoms to imprint information on the light, enabling quantum non-demolition measurements that constitute a powerful means of engineering nonclassical states. By extension, letting the intracavity light act back on the atoms enables coherent photon-mediated interactions. I start by discussing collective spin models, emphasizing applications in entanglement-enhanced metrology, before proceeding to richer many-body physics enabled by incorporating spatiotemporal control or employing multiple cavity modes. I will highlight opportunities for leveraging these tools for quantum simulations inspired by problems in condensed matter and quantum gravity. Along the way, I provide a pedagogical introduction to criteria for strong atom-light coupling, illustrate how the corresponding figure of merit -- the cooperativity -- sets fundamental limits on the coherence of atom-light interactions, and discuss prospects for harnessing high-cooperativity cavity QED in quantum simulation and computation.</p>

            <p>Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) features a high key rate and compatibility with classical optical communication. Developing expandable and efficient CVQKD networks will promote the deployment of large-scale quantum communication networks in the future. This paper proposes a CVQKD network based on the entangled states of an optical frequency comb. This scheme generates Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen entangled states with a frequency comb structure through the process of a type-II optical parametric oscillator. By combining with the scheme of entanglement in the middle, a fully connected CVQKD network capable of distributing secret keys simultaneously can be formed. We analyze the security of the system in the asymptotic case. Simulation results show that under commendable controlling of system loss and noise, the proposed scheme is feasible for deploying a short-distance fully connected CVQKD network. Loss will be the main factor limiting the system's performance. The proposed scheme provides new ideas for a multi-user fully connected CVQKD network.</p>

            <p>The interplay between topology and non-Hermiticity gives rise to exotic dynamic phenomena that challenge conventional wave-packet propagation and entanglement dynamics. While recent studies have established the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) as a key mechanism for anomalous wave dynamics, a unified framework for characterizing and controlling entanglement evolution in non-Hermitian topological systems remains underdeveloped. Here, by combining theory and experiments, we demonstrate that entanglement entropy (EE) and transport currents serve as robust dynamic probes to distinguish various non-Hermitian topological regimes. Using a generalized non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model implemented in an acoustic analog platform, we identify three dynamic phases, bulk-like, edge-like, and skin-like regimes, each exhibiting unique EE signatures and transport characteristics. In particular, skin-like dynamics exhibit periodic information shuttling with finite, oscillatory EE, while edge-like dynamics lead to complete EE suppression. We further map the dynamic phase diagram and show that EE scaling and temporal profiles directly reflect the competition between coherent delocalization and NHSE-driven localization. Our results establish a programmable approach to steering entanglement and transport via tailored non-Hermitian couplings, offering a pathway for engineering quantum information dynamics in synthetic phononic, photonic, and quantum simulators.</p>

            <p>This paper focuses on the study of linear exciton Hall and Nernst effects in monolayer two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors, employing the semi-classical transport theory. By deriving the exciton Berry curvature in momentum space for a general inhomogeneous 2D system, we establish its dependence on the Berry curvature and the effective mass of electron and hole. As illustrative examples, the exciton Hall effect in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and black phosphorus (BP) are calculated. For these materials, we demonstrate that a linear Hall (Nernst) exciton current with the non-zero Berry curvature is strictly forbidden by the symmetries. This finding aligns with earlier experimental observations on the exciton Hall effect in MoSe$_2$. In contrast, a strong anisotropy in BP leads to a net linear Hall current of excitons, exhibiting a relatively large value and resembling an anomalous Hall effect rather than a valley Hall effect. Our work reveals that the specific symmetry of 2D materials can induce a significant linear exciton Hall (Nernst) effect even without Berry curvature, which is normally forbidden with non-zero Berry curvature in the monolayer 2D material. This observation holds promise for future optoelectronic applications and offers exciting possibilities for experimental exploration.</p>

            <p>Quantum simulation relies on the preparation and control of low-entropy many-body systems to reveal the behavior of classically intractable models. The development of new approaches for realizing such systems therefore represents a frontier in quantum science. Here we experimentally demonstrate a new protocol for generating ultracold, itinerant many-body states in a tunnel-coupled two-dimensional optical lattice. We do this by adiabatically connecting a near-ground-state-cooled array of up to 50 single strontium-86 atoms with a Bose-Hubbard superfluid. Through comparison with finite-temperature quantum-Monte-Carlo calculations, we estimate that the entropy per particle of the prepared many-body states is approximately $2 k_B$, and that the achieved temperatures are consistent with a significant superfluid fraction. This represents the first time that itinerant many-body systems have been prepared from rearranged atoms, opening the door to bottom-up assembly of a wide range of neutral-atom and molecular systems.</p>

            <p>Superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) cavities offer a promising platform for quantum computing due to their long coherence times, yet integrating nonlinear elements like transmons for control often introduces additional loss. We report a multimode quantum system based on a 2-cell elliptical shaped SRF cavity, comprising two cavity modes weakly coupled to an ancillary transmon circuit, designed to preserve coherence while enabling efficient control of the cavity modes. We mitigate the detrimental effects of the transmon decoherence through careful design optimization that reduces transmon-cavity couplings and participation in the dielectric substrate and lossy interfaces, to achieve single-photon lifetimes of 20.6 ms and 15.6 ms for the two modes, and a pure dephasing time exceeding 40 ms. This marks an order-of-magnitude improvement over prior 3D multimode memories. Leveraging sideband interactions and novel error-resilient protocols, including measurement-based correction and post-selection, we achieve high-fidelity control over quantum states. This enables the preparation of Fock states up to $N = 20$ with fidelities exceeding 95%, the highest reported to date to the authors' knowledge, as well as two-mode entanglement with an estimated coherence-limited fidelities of 99.9% after post-selection.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hermann L. Albrecht</p>
            <p>Although introduced for entanglement, quantum repeaters and swapping protocols have been analyzed for other quantum correlations (QC), such as quantum discord. In 2015, Mundarain and Ladrón de Guevara [Quantum Inf. Process. 14, 4493 (2015)] introduced local-available quantum correlations (LAQC), which are a promising yet understudied quantum correlation. Recently, Bellorin et al. [Int. J. Mod. Phys. B 36, 22500990 (2022), Int. J. Mod. Phys. B 36, 2250154 (2022)] obtained exact analytical results for the LAQC quantifier of general 2-qubit X states. Building up from those results, we analyzed the LAQC swapping for 2-qubit X states. As expected, we find that if the initial states are non-classical and the one used for the projective measurement is entangled, the final state will generally have non-zero LAQC. Using the properties of this quantum correlation, we establish the conditions for a QCS scheme that leads to a final state with a non-zero LAQC measure. We illustrate these results by analyzing five families of one-parameter 2-qubit X states, including families where the projective measure leads to a separable state, but whose LAQC measure is non-zero. This feature opens the possibility for this quantum correlation to be considered a genuine resource in quantum information technology.</p>

            <h2>Logical Error Rates for the Surface Code Under a Mixed Coherent and Stochastic Circuit-Level Noise Model Inspired by Trapped Ions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tyler LeBlond, Peter Groszkowski, Justin G. Lietz, Christopher M. Seck, Ryan S. Bennink</p>
            <p>With fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) on the horizon, it is critical to understand sources of logical error in plausible hardware implementations of quantum error-correcting codes (QECC). In this work, we consider logical error rates for the surface code implemented on a hypothetical grid-based trapped-ion quantum charge-coupled device (QCCD) architecture. Specifically, we construct logical channels for the idling surface code and examine its diamond error under a mixed coherent and stochastic circuit-level noise model inspired by trapped ions. We include the coherent dephasing noise that is known to accumulate during physical qubit idling and transport in these systems, determining idling and transport durations using the time-resolved output of the trapped-ion surface code compiler (TISCC). To estimate expectation values of logical Pauli observables following hardware circuits containing non-Clifford sources of noise, we utilize a Monte Carlo technique to sample from an underlying quasi-probability distribution of Clifford circuits that we independently simulate in a phase-sensitive fashion. We verify error suppression up to code distance $d=11$ at coherent dephasing rates near and below those of current-generation trapped-ion quantum computers and find that logical error rates align with those of analogous fully stochastic simulations in this regime. Exploring higher dephasing rates at $d=3-5$, we find evidence for growing coherent rotations about all three logical Pauli axes, increased diagonal logical error process matrix elements relative to those of stochastic simulations, and a reduced dephasing rate threshold. Overall, our work paves a way toward realistic hardware emulation of small fault-tolerant quantum processes, e.g., members of a FTQC instruction set.</p>

            <h2>Resolving Microscopic Correlated Electron Dynamics via 2000-Qubit Quantum Simulation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jaka Vodeb</p>
            <p>Understanding how quantum materials return to equilibrium after being driven into excited states is a fundamental problem in condensed matter physics. A prototypical material, 1T-TaS$_2$, exhibits complex electronic textures made up of domain walls, which slowly reorganize into a more uniform structure as the system relaxes. At low temperatures, this process becomes dominated by quantum rather than thermal effects. In this work, we use large-scale noise-driven quantum simulations-spanning more than 2000 qubits-to study this relaxation process through an effective model known as the transverse-field Ising model in a longitudinal field. By mathematically transforming this model into a simpler form, we identify the basic microscopic steps involved: rather than moving collectively, the domain walls evolve through a sequence of noise-driven single-particle tunneling events. A detailed analysis of how the relaxation rate depends on temperature and model parameters confirms this picture. Our findings show that quantum simulation can provide rare, predictive insight into the inner workings of real quantum materials, and establish a practical pathway for studying complex non-equilibrium processes using current-generation quantum hardware.</p>

This lends support to a continuous collapse interpretation of quantum mechanics, but can also be viewed as a model of continuous detection of a steady-state process in the incoherent limit.

            <h2>Empty-Signal Detection and the Principle-Level Feasibility of Arbitrarily Long-Distance Repeaterless Quantum Communication</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hao Shu</p>
            <p>Practical repeaterless quantum communication (PRQC) is fundamentally constrained by the divergence of the quantum bit error rate (QBER) arising from the interplay between channel loss and single-photon detector (SPD) dark counts. As the channel transmission rate decays exponentially with distance, vacuum-induced dark counts inevitably dominate detection events beyond a finite range, driving the QBER toward 50\% and rendering PRQC infeasible. Here, a theoretical framework termed empty-signal detection (ESD) is established to address this long-standing limitation at the level of principle. By encoding particle-existence information (PEI) onto an auxiliary degree of freedom (DOF) and employing controlled operations together with multi-copy analysis, the ESD paradigm enables vacuum-induced detection events to be identified and filtered without disturbing the encoded quantum information. Consequently, the non-empty signal rate (NESR) of the accepted signals can be stabilized at a distance-independent level under physically reasonable conditions, thereby suppressing the fundamental QBER within the secure bounds of PRQC, irrespective of channel attenuation. As a result, PRQC can, in principle, remain feasible over arbitrarily long distances, with the fundamental limitation shifting from distance-dependent QBER divergence to resource-dependent efficiency trade-offs. By providing a rigorous theoretical resolution of the fundamental QBER-induced distance limitation, this work clarifies the principle-level scalability of PRQC. Furthermore, the vacuum-filtering framework developed here may also be of interest in a broader class of loss-sensitive or detection-based quantum tasks.</p>

            <h2>Navigating entanglement via Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida exchange: Snake, bouncing, boundary-residing, pulse, and damping-stabilized time-frozen trajectories</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Son-Hsien Chen, Seng Ghee Tan, Ching-Ray Chang</p>
            <p>Entanglement dynamics are fundamental to quantum technologies, yet navigating their temporal profiles (trajectories) remains challenging. Here, we propose a scalable solid-state platform based on RKKY exchange, where two spin qubits couple to a central spin qudit that oscillatorily spin-polarizes the surrounding conduction electrons. We introduce the exchange-time integral (ETI), which maps the spatial motion of the qubits to a time-dependent exchange interaction and serves as an effective "trajectory clock" governing the system evolution. We focus specifically on entanglement trajectories initially near the entanglement-unentanglement boundary, with the distance to this boundary quantified by concurrence extended to include negative values. By alternating the sign changes of the exchange, implemented through vibrational motion of qubits, the ETI enables programmable entanglement trajectories. For in-phase and antiphase vibrations, including scenarios with controlled stopping at the RKKY exchange-free nodes, we identify distinctive trajectories: snake (repeatedly crossing the boundary), bouncing (immediately reversing upon reaching the boundary), boundary-residing (remaining at the transition point), and pulse (controllable entanglement intervals). The vibration phase creates asymmetric shifts to the trajectories. The proposed device offers built-in error correction against dephasing by utilizing both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic regimes. Out-of-phase vibrations drive trajectories away from the boundary, accessing larger entanglement values but with irregular/unsteady final states. To stabilize these trajectories, we introduce a damping mechanism. Our framework offers a systematic method for navigating and engineering entanglement dynamics in quantum systems, with potential applications in quantum computation, cryptography, and metrology.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Signatures of Strange Attractors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bence Dárdai, Gábor Vattay</p>
            <p>In classical mechanics, driven systems with dissipation often exhibit complex, fractal dynamics known as strange attractors. This paper addresses the fundamental question of how such structures manifest in the quantum realm. We investigate the quantum Duffing oscillator, a paradigmatic chaotic system, using the Caldirola-Kanai (CK) framework, where dissipation is integrated directly into a time-dependent Hamiltonian. By employing the Husimi distribution to represent the quantum state in phase space, we present the first visualization of a quantum strange attractor within this model. Our simulations demonstrate how an initially simple Gaussian wave packet is stretched, folded, and sculpted by the interplay of chaotic dynamics and energy loss, causing it to localize onto a structure that beautifully mirrors the classical attractor. This quantum "photograph" is inherently smoothed, blurring the infinitely fine fractal details of its classical counterpart as a direct consequence of the uncertainty principle. We supplement this analysis by examining the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC), which shows that stronger dissipation clarifies the exponential growth associated with the classical Lyapunov exponent, thereby confirming the model's semiclassical behavior. This work offers a compelling geometric perspective on open chaotic quantum systems and sheds new light on the quantum-classical transition.</p>

            <h2>Coupled-wire construction of non-Abelian higher-order topological phases</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiaxin Pan, Longwen Zhou</p>
            <p>Non-Abelian topological charges (NATCs), characterized by their noncommutative algebra, offer a framework for describing multigap topological phases beyond conventional Abelian invariants. While higher-order topological phases (HOTPs) host boundary states at corners or hinges, their characterization has largely relied on Abelian invariants such as winding and Chern numbers. Here, we propose a coupled-wire scheme of constructing non-Abelian HOTPs and analyze a non-Abelian second-order topological insulator as its minimal model. The resulting Hamiltonian supports hybridized corner modes, protected by parity-time-reversal plus sublattice symmetries and described by a topological vector that unites a non-Abelian quaternion charge with an Abelian winding number. Corner states emerge only when both invariants are nontrivial, whereas weak topological edge states of non-Abelian origins arise when the quaternion charge is nontrivial, enriching the bulk-edge-corner correspondence. The system further exhibits both non-Abelian and Abelian topological phase transitions, providing a unified platform that bridges these two distinct topological classes. Our work extends the understanding of HOTPs into non-Abelian regimes and suggests feasible experimental realizations in synthetic quantum systems, such as photonic or acoustic metamaterials.</p>

            <h2>Quantization of Physical Interaction Strengths via Singular Moduli</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Prasoon Saurabh</p>
            <p>Since the 2019 redefinition of the SI units, precision metrology has sought to anchor all physical quantities to fundamental constants and integer invariants. While the optical frequency comb revolutionized timekeeping by discretizing the continuum of light into countable teeth, and the Quantum Hall Effect standardized resistance via topological invariants, a comparable standard for interaction strength remains elusive. Currently, measuring the coupling constant ($g$) between quantum systems is an estimation problem, inherently subject to drift, noise, and fabrication variance. Here, we introduce Interaction Metrology, a protocol that transforms the measurement of coupling strengths from an analog estimation into a topological counting problem. By engineering a specific class of algebraic catastrophe -- the Unimodal $X_9$ singularity -- in a driven-dissipative lattice, we prove that the system's interaction moduli are topologically forced to take discrete, quantized values, forming a "Geometric $k$-Comb." We derive the universality class of this quantization, showing that it arises from the discrepancy between the Milnor ($\mu$) and Tjurina ($\tau$) numbers of the effective potential, a strictly non-Hermitian effect forbidden in standard quantum mechanics. Finally, we provide an ab-initio blueprint for a silicon nitride implementation, demonstrating that this quantization is robust against disorder levels exceeding current foundry tolerances. This discovery establishes a universal standard for force sensing and quantum logic gates, enabling the calibration of interaction strengths with topological certainty.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dennis Delali Kwesi Wayo, Rodrigo Alves Dias, Leonardo Goliatt, Sven Groppe</p>
            <p>We introduce DifGa, a fully differentiable error-mitigation framework for continuous-variable (CV) quantum photonic circuits operating under Gaussian loss and weak non-Gaussian noise. The approach is demonstrated using analytic simulations with the this http URL backend of PennyLane, where quantum states are represented by first and second moments and optimized end-to-end via automatic differentiation. Gaussian loss is modeled as a beam splitter interaction with an environmental vacuum mode of transmissivity $\eta \in [0.3,0.95]$, while non-Gaussian phase noise is incorporated through a differentiable Monte-Carlo mixture of random phase rotations with jitter amplitudes $\delta \in [0,0.7]$. The core architecture employs a multi-mode Gaussian circuit consisting of a signal, ancilla, and environment mode. Input states are prepared using squeezing and displacement operations with parameters $(r_s,\varphi_s,\alpha)=(0.60,0.30,0.80)$ and $(r_a,\varphi_a)=(0.40,0.10)$, followed by an entangling beam splitter with angles $(\theta,\phi)=(0.70,0.20)$. Error mitigation is achieved by appending a six-parameter trainable Gaussian recovery layer comprising local phase rotations and displacements, optimized by minimizing a quadratic loss on the signal-mode quadratures $\langle \hat{x}_0\rangle$ and $\langle \hat{p}_0\rangle$ using gradient descent with fixed learning rate $0.06$ and identical initialization across experiments. Under pure Gaussian loss, the optimized recovery suppresses reconstruction error to near machine precision ($<10^{-30}$) for moderate loss ($\eta \ge 0.5$). When non-Gaussian phase noise is present, noise-aware training using Monte Carlo averaging yields robust generalization, reducing error by more than an order of magnitude compared to Gaussian-trained recovery at large phase jitter. Runtime benchmarks confirm linear scaling with the number of Monte Carlo samples.</p>

            <h2>Efficient simulation of logical magic state preparation protocols</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samyak Surti, Lucas Daguerre, Isaac H. Kim</p>
            <p>Developing space- and time-efficient logical magic state preparation protocols will likely be an essential step towards building a large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computer. Motivated by this need, we introduce a scalable method for simulating logical magic state preparation protocols under the standard circuit-level noise model. When applied to protocols based on code switching, magic state cultivation, and magic state distillation, our method yields a complexity polynomial in (i) the number of qubits and (ii) the non-stabilizerness, e.g., stabilizer rank or Pauli rank, of the target encoded magic state. The efficiency of our simulation method is rooted in a curious fact: every circuit-level Pauli error in these protocols propagates to a Clifford error at the end. This property is satisfied by a large family of protocols, including those that repeatedly measure a transversal Clifford that squares to a Pauli. We provide a proof-of-principle numerical simulation that prepares a magic state using such logical Clifford measurements. Our work enables practical simulation of logical magic state preparation protocols without resorting to approximations or resource-intensive state-vector simulations.</p>

We derive these results by bounding the expected values of the Bell-Mermin operators. We review the three qubit GHZ Mermin device, make its generalization to four qubits, and then construct analogous Mermin devices for the generalized Dicke states of three and four qubits. As a result of studying if their operations can be fully explained by Mermin's instructional sets, we show that the GHZ and Dicke states of three qubits and the GHZ state of four qubits do not allow such a description. However, among the two generalized Dicke states of four qubits, one does allow and the other does not allow such a description.</p>

            <p>Broad applications of quantum computers will require error correction (EC). However, quantum hardware roadmaps indicate that physical qubit numbers will remain limited in the foreseeable future, leading to residual logical errors that limit the size and accuracy of achievable computations. Recent work suggested logical error mitigation (LEM), which applies known error mitigation (EM) methods to logical errors, eliminating their effect at the cost of a runtime overhead. Improving the efficiency of LEM is crucial for increasing the logical circuit volumes it enables to execute. We introduce syndrome-aware logical error mitigation (SALEM), which makes use of the syndrome data measured during error correction, when mitigating the logical errors. The runtime overhead of SALEM is exponentially lower than that of previously proposed LEM schemes, resulting in significantly increased circuit volumes that can be executed accurately. Notably, relative to the routinely used combination of error correction and syndrome rejection (post-selection), SALEM increases the size of reliably executable computations by orders of magnitude. In this practical setting in which space and time are both resources that need to be optimized, our work reveals a surprising phenomenon: SALEM, which tightly combines EC with EM, can outperform physical EM even above the standard fault-tolerance threshold. Thus, SALEM can make use of EC in regimes of physical error rates at which EC is commonly deemed useless.</p>

            <p>We present a hybrid quantum-classical framework augmented with learned error mitigation for solving the viscous Burgers equation on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. Using the Cole-Hopf transformation, the nonlinear Burgers equation is mapped to a diffusion equation, discretized on uniform grids, and encoded into a quantum state whose time evolution is approximated via Trotterized nearest-neighbor circuits implemented in Qiskit. Quantum simulations are executed on noisy Aer backends and IBM superconducting quantum devices and are benchmarked against high-accuracy classical solutions obtained using a Krylov-based solver applied to the corresponding discretized Hamiltonian. From measured quantum amplitudes, we reconstruct the velocity field and evaluate physical and numerical diagnostics, including the L2 error, shock location, and dissipation rate, both with and without zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE). To enable data-driven error mitigation, we construct a large parametric dataset by sweeping viscosity, time step, grid resolution, and boundary conditions, producing matched tuples of noisy, ZNE-corrected, hardware, and classical solutions together with detailed circuit metadata. Leveraging this dataset, we train an attention-based graph neural network that incorporates circuit structure, light-cone information, global circuit parameters, and noisy quantum outputs to predict error-mitigated solutions. Across a wide range of parameters, the learned model consistently reduces the discrepancy between quantum and classical solutions beyond what is achieved by ZNE alone. We discuss extensions of this approach to higher-dimensional Burgers systems and more general quantum partial differential equation solvers, highlighting learned error mitigation as a promising complement to physics-based noise reduction techniques on NISQ devices.</p>

            <p>We investigate squeezed states of composite bosons (cobosons) formed by pairs of spin-$1/2$ fermions, with emphasis on Frenkel-like cobosons. While squeezing for standard bosonic modes is well established, its extension to cobosons requires accounting for Pauli blocking and the resulting non-canonical commutation algebra. Building on earlier constructions of coboson coherent states, we define squeezed cobosons as eigenstates of a Bogoliubov transformed coboson operator and derive explicit expressions for the associated quadrature variances. We show that the underlying fermionic structure leads to state-dependent modifications of the Heisenberg--Robertson uncertainty bound, which may fall below the canonical bosonic limit without implying any violation of uncertainty principles. Numerical results based on finite-dimensional matrix representations illustrate how these effects constrain the attainable squeezing. Our framework is relevant to composite boson systems such as tightly bound electron-hole pairs and provides a physically transparent setting to probe compositeness through observable quadrature fluctuations.</p>

The greater the uncertainty in subsystems' pure states, the stronger the quantum entanglement between them. From the dual form of $q$-concurrence ($q\geq 2$) we introduce the total concurrence. A bona fide measure of quantum entanglement is introduced, the $\mathcal{C}^{t}_q$-concurrence ($q \geq 2$), which is based on the total concurrence. Analytical lower bounds for the $\mathcal{C}^{t}_q$-concurrence are derived. In addition, an analytical expression is derived for the $\mathcal{C}^{t}_q$-concurrence in the cases of isotropic and Werner states. Furthermore, the monogamy relations that the $\mathcal{C}^{t}_q$-concurrence satisfies for qubit systems are examined. Additionally, based on the parameterized $\alpha$-concurrence and its complementary dual, the $\mathcal{C}^{t}_\alpha$-concurrence $(0\leq\alpha\leq\frac{1}{2})$ is also proposed.</p>

In continuous variable (CV) regime, squeezed state has been exploited to implement deterministic phase estimation. It is however, often restricted by fragility of quantum states. The quantum phase estimation sensitivity of squeezed state is significantly affected by loss or detection inefficiency, which restrict its applications. This issue can be solved by using a method of parametric amplification of squeezed state \cite{OPA}. In this work, we implement multi-phase estimation with optical parametric amplification of entanglement generated from squeezed states. We find multi-phase estimation sensitivity is robust against loss or detection inefficiency, where we use two-mode Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen entangled state and four-mode cluster state for analysis. Our work provides a method for realizing large-scale quantum metrology in real-world applications against loss or detection inefficiency.</p>

            <p>Multipartite entangled states possess a number of non-intuitive properties, making them a useful resource for various quantum information-processing tasks. The three-qubit W-state is one such example where every state is robust to single-qubit loss. However, this state is not suitable for deterministic distribution, and deterministic communication protocols. Here, we focus on the distribution of a non-symmetric version of such states, namely $W_{\mathrm{mod}}$ states. These states belong to the W-class, and have one ebit of entanglement across a specific bipartition, enabling deterministic teleportation and superdense coding. In particular, we describe a few protocols through which these multipartite entangled states can be distributed {\it deterministically} in a quantum network by first preparing them locally in a central node and then transmitting individual qubits to the end nodes. We analyse the performance of these protocols based on the fidelity of the final distributed state, considering all types of noises that can act during the distribution. Finally, we compare the performance of the protocols to the case where the distribution is performed without any central node.</p>

            <h2>Gravitationally Induced Entanglement Between Particles in Harmonic Traps: Limits for Gaussian States</h2>

            <p>Gravitationally induced entanglement has been proposed as a probe of the quantum nature of gravity. This work analyzes a system of two particles in harmonic traps interacting only through gravity, considering thermal and two-mode squeezed initial states. For thermal states, a maximum temperature is identified above which entanglement cannot be generated, and for fixed system parameters an optimal trap frequency that maximizes the logarithmic negativity is found. Squeezing the initial state does not further enhance the entanglement generation, but increases the temperature range over which it can be observed. Extending the analysis to general Gaussian states, an upper bound on the achievable entanglement is derived and shown to be saturated, for example, by ground and squeezed states. The results show that the amount of entanglement generated in this setup is extremely small, highlighting the experimental challenges of observing gravitationally induced quantum effects.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andre G. Campos, Karen Z. Hatsagortsyan, Christoph H. Keitel</p>
            <p>An effective model for describing the relativistic quantum dynamics of a radiating electron is developed via a relativistic generalization of the Lindblad master equation. By incorporating both radiation reaction and vacuum fluctuations into the Dirac equation within an open quantum system framework, our approach captures the Zitterbewegung of the electron, ensuing noncommutativity of its effective spatial coordinates, and provides the quantum analogue of the Landau-Lifshitz (LL) classical equation of motion with radiation reaction. We develop the corresponding phase-space representation via the relativistic Wigner function and derive the semiclassical limit through a Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation. The latter elucidates the signature of quantum vacuum fluctuations in the LL equation, and shows its relationship with the corrected Sokolov equation. Our results offer a robust framework for investigating quantum radiation reaction effects in ultrastrong laser fields.</p>

            <h2>Dissipation-Stabilized Quantum Revivals in a Non-Hermitian Lattice Gauge Theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yevgeny Bar Lev, Jad C. Halimeh, Achilleas Lazarides</p>
            <p>With the advent of quantum simulation experiments of lattice gauge theories (LGTs), an open question is the effect of non-Hermiticity on their rich physics. The well-known PXP model, a U$(1)$ LGT with a two-level electric field in one spatial dimension, has become a paradigm of exotic physics in and out of equilibrium. Here, we introduce a non-Hermitian version in which the spin-flip rate differs between the two spin directions. While the naive expectation is that non-Hermiticity might suppress coherent phenomena such as quantum many-body scars, we find that when the facilitating direction of the spin is disfavored, the oscillations are instead \emph{enhanced}, decaying much slower than in the PXP limit. We demonstrate that this can be understood through a similarity transformation that maps our model to the standard PXP model, revealing that the oscillations are enhanced versions of the PXP scars. Our work provides an analytically tractable and conceptually simple example where non-Hermiticity enhances the stability of dynamically non-trivial coherent many-body modes.</p>

            <p>In this work, we investigate the dynamics of quantum synchronization in a four-mode optomechanical system, focusing on the influence of the Coulomb interaction between two mechanical resonators. We analyze the effect of the Coulomb coupling on three distinct synchronization regimes, i.e., complete quantum synchronization, $\phi$-synchronization, and quantum phase synchronization. Our results show that while the Coulomb interaction plays a pivotal role in significantly enhancing quantum phase synchronization by facilitating energy exchange and phase coherence, it has little impact on complete and $\phi$-synchronization. This indicates that amplitude and frequency locking are primarily determined by the optical driving, whereas phase alignment depends critically on inter-resonator coupling. We also demonstrate that the oscillations of the two optical cavities, which are indirectly coupled via the mechanical resonators, can become aligned over time, resulting in classical synchronization. These findings provide a robust mechanism for controlling collective quantum dynamics and offer a foundation for applications in quantum communication, precision sensing, and the development of synchronized quantum networks.</p>

            <p>These lecture notes discuss applications of atom-light interactions in cavities to quantum metrology, simulation, and computation. A focus is on nonlocally interacting spin systems realized by coupling many atoms to a delocalized mode of light. We will build up from the fundamentals: understanding how a cavity enables light to coherently imprint information on atoms and atoms to imprint information on the light, enabling quantum non-demolition measurements that constitute a powerful means of engineering nonclassical states. By extension, letting the intracavity light act back on the atoms enables coherent photon-mediated interactions. I start by discussing collective spin models, emphasizing applications in entanglement-enhanced metrology, before proceeding to richer many-body physics enabled by incorporating spatiotemporal control or employing multiple cavity modes. I will highlight opportunities for leveraging these tools for quantum simulations inspired by problems in condensed matter and quantum gravity. Along the way, I provide a pedagogical introduction to criteria for strong atom-light coupling, illustrate how the corresponding figure of merit -- the cooperativity -- sets fundamental limits on the coherence of atom-light interactions, and discuss prospects for harnessing high-cooperativity cavity QED in quantum simulation and computation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hai Zhong, Qianqian Hu, Zhiyue Zuo, Zhipeng Wang, Duan Huang, Ying Guo</p>
            <p>Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) features a high key rate and compatibility with classical optical communication. Developing expandable and efficient CVQKD networks will promote the deployment of large-scale quantum communication networks in the future. This paper proposes a CVQKD network based on the entangled states of an optical frequency comb. This scheme generates Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen entangled states with a frequency comb structure through the process of a type-II optical parametric oscillator. By combining with the scheme of entanglement in the middle, a fully connected CVQKD network capable of distributing secret keys simultaneously can be formed. We analyze the security of the system in the asymptotic case. Simulation results show that under commendable controlling of system loss and noise, the proposed scheme is feasible for deploying a short-distance fully connected CVQKD network. Loss will be the main factor limiting the system's performance. The proposed scheme provides new ideas for a multi-user fully connected CVQKD network.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Li-Wei Wang, Bolun Hu, Haixiao Zhang, Kefan Sun, Ying Cheng, Jian-Hua Jiang</p>
            <p>The interplay between topology and non-Hermiticity gives rise to exotic dynamic phenomena that challenge conventional wave-packet propagation and entanglement dynamics. While recent studies have established the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) as a key mechanism for anomalous wave dynamics, a unified framework for characterizing and controlling entanglement evolution in non-Hermitian topological systems remains underdeveloped. Here, by combining theory and experiments, we demonstrate that entanglement entropy (EE) and transport currents serve as robust dynamic probes to distinguish various non-Hermitian topological regimes. Using a generalized non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model implemented in an acoustic analog platform, we identify three dynamic phases, bulk-like, edge-like, and skin-like regimes, each exhibiting unique EE signatures and transport characteristics. In particular, skin-like dynamics exhibit periodic information shuttling with finite, oscillatory EE, while edge-like dynamics lead to complete EE suppression. We further map the dynamic phase diagram and show that EE scaling and temporal profiles directly reflect the competition between coherent delocalization and NHSE-driven localization. Our results establish a programmable approach to steering entanglement and transport via tailored non-Hermitian couplings, offering a pathway for engineering quantum information dynamics in synthetic phononic, photonic, and quantum simulators.</p>

            <h2>Linear exciton Hall and Nernst effects in monolayer two-dimensional semiconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weilong Guo, Lianguo Li, Qingjun Tong, Ci Li</p>
            <p>This paper focuses on the study of linear exciton Hall and Nernst effects in monolayer two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors, employing the semi-classical transport theory. By deriving the exciton Berry curvature in momentum space for a general inhomogeneous 2D system, we establish its dependence on the Berry curvature and the effective mass of electron and hole. As illustrative examples, the exciton Hall effect in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and black phosphorus (BP) are calculated. For these materials, we demonstrate that a linear Hall (Nernst) exciton current with the non-zero Berry curvature is strictly forbidden by the symmetries. This finding aligns with earlier experimental observations on the exciton Hall effect in MoSe$_2$. In contrast, a strong anisotropy in BP leads to a net linear Hall current of excitons, exhibiting a relatively large value and resembling an anomalous Hall effect rather than a valley Hall effect. Our work reveals that the specific symmetry of 2D materials can induce a significant linear exciton Hall (Nernst) effect even without Berry curvature, which is normally forbidden with non-zero Berry curvature in the monolayer 2D material. This observation holds promise for future optoelectronic applications and offers exciting possibilities for experimental exploration.</p>

            <p>Quantum simulation relies on the preparation and control of low-entropy many-body systems to reveal the behavior of classically intractable models. The development of new approaches for realizing such systems therefore represents a frontier in quantum science. Here we experimentally demonstrate a new protocol for generating ultracold, itinerant many-body states in a tunnel-coupled two-dimensional optical lattice. We do this by adiabatically connecting a near-ground-state-cooled array of up to 50 single strontium-86 atoms with a Bose-Hubbard superfluid. Through comparison with finite-temperature quantum-Monte-Carlo calculations, we estimate that the entropy per particle of the prepared many-body states is approximately $2 k_B$, and that the achieved temperatures are consistent with a significant superfluid fraction. This represents the first time that itinerant many-body systems have been prepared from rearranged atoms, opening the door to bottom-up assembly of a wide range of neutral-atom and molecular systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Veronika E. Hubeny, Massimiliano Rota</p>
            <p>We prove that the ``chordality condition'', which was established in arXiv:2412.18018 as a necessary condition for an entropy vector to be realizable by a holographic simple tree graph model, is also sufficient. The proof is constructive, demonstrating that the algorithm introduced in arXiv:2512.18702 for constructing a simple tree graph model realization of a given entropy vector that satisfies this condition always succeeds. We emphasize that these results hold for an arbitrary number of parties, and, given that any entropy vector realizable by a holographic graph model can also be realized, at least approximately, by a stabilizer state, they highlight how techniques originally developed in holography can provide broad insights into entanglement and information theory more generally, and in particular, into the structure of the stabilizer and quantum entropy cones. Moreover, if the strong form of the conjecture from arXiv:2204.00075 holds, namely, if all holographic entropy vectors can be realized by (not necessarily simple) tree graph models, then the result of this work demonstrates that the essential data that encodes the structure of the holographic entropy cone for an arbitrary number of parties, is the set of ``chordal'' extreme rays of the subadditivity cone.</p>

            <p>The performance and scalability of semiconductor quantum-dot (QD) qubits are limited by electrostatic drift and charge noise that shift operating points and destabilize qubit parameters. As systems expand to large one- and two-dimensional arrays, manual recalibration becomes impractical, creating a need for autonomous stabilization frameworks. Here, we introduce a method that uses the full network of charge-transition lines in repeatedly acquired double-quantum-dot charge stability diagrams (CSDs) as a multidimensional probe of the local electrostatic environment. By accurately tracking the motion of selected transitions in time, we detect voltage drifts, identify abrupt charge reconfigurations, and apply compensating updates to maintain stable operating conditions. We demonstrate our approach on a 10-QD device, showing robust stabilization and real-time diagnostic access to dot-specific noise processes. The high acquisition rate of radio-frequency reflectometry CSD measurements also enables time-domain noise spectroscopy, allowing the extraction of noise power spectral densities, the identification of two-level fluctuators, and the analysis of spatial noise correlations across the array. From our analysis, we find that the background noise at 100~$\mu$\si{\hertz} is dominated by drift with a power law of $1/f^2$, accompanied by a few dominant two-level fluctuators and an average linear correlation length of $(188 \pm 38)$~\si{\nano\meter} in the device. These capabilities form the basis of a scalable, autonomous calibration and characterization module for QD-based quantum processors, providing essential feedback for long-duration, high-fidelity qubit operations.</p>

Although it provides a clean framework that allows one to directly simulate continuous systems, the optimization of cMPS is known to be a very challenging task, especially in the case of multi-component systems. In this work, we have developed an improved optimization scheme for multi-component cMPS that enables simulations of bosonic quantum mixtures with substantially larger bond dimensions than previous works. We benchmark our method on the two-component Lieb-Liniger model, obtaining numerical results that agree well with analytical predictions. Our work paves the way for further numerical studies of quantum mixture systems using the cMPS ansatz.</p>

            <h2>A simple generalization of the energy gap law for nonradiative processes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seogjoo J. Jang</p>
            <p>For more than 50 years, an elegant energy gap (EG) law developed by Englman and Jortner [Mol. Phys. {\bf 18}, 145 (1970)] has served as a key theory to understand and model nearly exponential dependence of nonradiative transition rates on the difference of energy between the initial and final states. This work revisits the theory, clarifies key assumptions involved in the rate expression, and provides a generalization for the cases where the effects of temperature dependence and low frequency modes cannot be ignored. For a specific example where the low frequency vibrational and/or solvation responses can be modeled as an Ohmic spectral density, a simple generalization of the EG law is provided. Test calculations demonstrate that this generalized EG law brings significant improvement over the original EG law. Both the original and generalized EG laws are also compared with stationary phase approximations developed for electron transfer theory, which suggests the possibility of a simple interpolation formula valid for any value of EG.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mahnaz Jafarzadeh, Jonathan Conrad, Rafael N. Alexander, Ben Q. Baragiola</p>
            <p>The GKP encoding is a top contender among bosonic codes for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Analysis of the GKP code is complicated by the fact that finite-energy code states leak out of the ideal GKP code space and are not orthogonal. We analyze a variant of the GKP stabilizer measurement circuit using damped, approximate GKP states that virtually project onto the ideal GKP code space between rounds of error correction even when finite-energy GKP states are used. This allows us to identify logical maps between projectors; however, due to finite-energy effects, these maps fail to resolve completely positive, trace-preserving channels on the logical code space. We present two solutions to this problem based on channel twirling the damping operator. The first twirls over the full stabilizer group motivated by standard binning (SB) decoding that converts small amounts of damping into Gaussian random noise. The second twirls over a set of representative Pauli shifts that keeps the energy in the code finite and allow for arbitrary decoding. This approach is not limited to small damping, can be applied when logical GKP unitaries or other sources of CV noise are present, and allows us to study general decoding, which can be optimized to the noise in the circuit. Focusing on damping, we compare decoding strategies tailored to different levels of effective squeezing. While our results indicate that SB decoding is suboptimal for finite-energy GKP states, the advantage of optimized decoding over SB decoding shrinks as the energy in the code increases, and moreover the performance of both strategies converges to that of the stabilizer-twirled logical channel. These studies provide stronger arguments for commonplace procedures in the analysis of GKP error correction:(i) using stochastically shifted GKP states in place of coherently damped ones, and(ii) the use of SB decoding.</p>

            <p>Superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) cavities offer a promising platform for quantum computing due to their long coherence times, yet integrating nonlinear elements like transmons for control often introduces additional loss. We report a multimode quantum system based on a 2-cell elliptical shaped SRF cavity, comprising two cavity modes weakly coupled to an ancillary transmon circuit, designed to preserve coherence while enabling efficient control of the cavity modes. We mitigate the detrimental effects of the transmon decoherence through careful design optimization that reduces transmon-cavity couplings and participation in the dielectric substrate and lossy interfaces, to achieve single-photon lifetimes of 20.6 ms and 15.6 ms for the two modes, and a pure dephasing time exceeding 40 ms. This marks an order-of-magnitude improvement over prior 3D multimode memories. Leveraging sideband interactions and novel error-resilient protocols, including measurement-based correction and post-selection, we achieve high-fidelity control over quantum states. This enables the preparation of Fock states up to $N = 20$ with fidelities exceeding 95%, the highest reported to date to the authors' knowledge, as well as two-mode entanglement with an estimated coherence-limited fidelities of 99.9% after post-selection. These results establish our platform as a robust foundation for quantum information processing, allowing for future extensions to high-dimensional qudit encodings.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hermann L. Albrecht</p>
            <p>Although introduced for entanglement, quantum repeaters and swapping protocols have been analyzed for other quantum correlations (QC), such as quantum discord. In 2015, Mundarain and Ladrón de Guevara [Quantum Inf. Process. 14, 4493 (2015)] introduced local-available quantum correlations (LAQC), which are a promising yet understudied quantum correlation. Recently, Bellorin et al. [Int. J. Mod. Phys. B 36, 22500990 (2022), Int. J. Mod. Phys. B 36, 2250154 (2022)] obtained exact analytical results for the LAQC quantifier of general 2-qubit X states. Building up from those results, we analyzed the LAQC swapping for 2-qubit X states. As expected, we find that if the initial states are non-classical and the one used for the projective measurement is entangled, the final state will generally have non-zero LAQC. Using the properties of this quantum correlation, we establish the conditions for a QCS scheme that leads to a final state with a non-zero LAQC measure. We illustrate these results by analyzing five families of one-parameter 2-qubit X states, including families where the projective measure leads to a separable state, but whose LAQC measure is non-zero. This feature opens the possibility for this quantum correlation to be considered a genuine resource in quantum information technology.</p>

            <h2>Empty-Signal Detection and the Principle-Level Feasibility of Arbitrarily Long-Distance Repeaterless Quantum Communication</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hao Shu</p>
            <p>Practical repeaterless quantum communication (PRQC) is fundamentally constrained by the divergence of the quantum bit error rate (QBER) arising from the interplay between channel loss and single-photon detector (SPD) dark counts. As the channel transmission rate decays exponentially with distance, vacuum-induced dark counts inevitably dominate detection events beyond a finite range, driving the QBER toward 50\% and rendering PRQC infeasible. Here, a theoretical framework termed empty-signal detection (ESD) is established to address this long-standing limitation at the level of principle. By encoding particle-existence information (PEI) onto an auxiliary degree of freedom (DOF) and employing controlled operations together with multi-copy analysis, the ESD paradigm enables vacuum-induced detection events to be identified and filtered without disturbing the encoded quantum information. Consequently, the non-empty signal rate (NESR) of the accepted signals can be stabilized at a distance-independent level under physically reasonable conditions, thereby suppressing the fundamental QBER within the secure bounds of PRQC, irrespective of channel attenuation. As a result, PRQC can, in principle, remain feasible over arbitrarily long distances, with the fundamental limitation shifting from distance-dependent QBER divergence to resource-dependent efficiency trade-offs. By providing a rigorous theoretical resolution of the fundamental QBER-induced distance limitation, this work clarifies the principle-level scalability of PRQC. Furthermore, the vacuum-filtering framework developed here may also be of interest in a broader class of loss-sensitive or detection-based quantum tasks.</p>

            <p>We present a theoretical framework for a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric double-cavity molecular optomechanical system demonstrating nonreciprocal enhancement of multipartite quantum entanglement at elevated temperatures. All bipartite entanglement channels ($E_{ac}$, $E_{aB_1}$, $E_{cB_2}$, $E_{B_1B_2}$) simultaneously maximize at optimal nonreciprocal asymmetry $J_1/J_2 \approx 5$, with entanglement persisting to $T \sim \SIrange{400}{500}{\kelvin}$ (material-limited ceiling) two orders of magnitude beyond conventional optomechanical systems. This thermal resilience and balanced enhancement across all channels arise from synergistic combination of ultra-high-frequency molecular vibrations ($\omega_m/2\pi = \SI{30}{\tera\hertz}$), collective $\sqrt{N}$ coupling enhancement with $N=\num{e6}$ molecules, and directional nonreciprocal coupling shielding entanglement-generating interactions from backaction noise. Unlike optical parametric amplifier schemes where vibration-vibration enhancement suppresses optical-vibration correlations, our $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric architecture circumvents this fundamental trade-off, validated through rigorous stability analysis via Routh-Hurwitz criterion.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Son-Hsien Chen, Seng Ghee Tan, Ching-Ray Chang</p>
            <p>Entanglement dynamics are fundamental to quantum technologies, yet navigating their temporal profiles (trajectories) remains challenging. Here, we propose a scalable solid-state platform based on RKKY exchange, where two spin qubits couple to a central spin qudit that oscillatorily spin-polarizes the surrounding conduction electrons. We introduce the exchange-time integral (ETI), which maps the spatial motion of the qubits to a time-dependent exchange interaction and serves as an effective "trajectory clock" governing the system evolution. We focus specifically on entanglement trajectories initially near the entanglement-unentanglement boundary, with the distance to this boundary quantified by concurrence extended to include negative values. By alternating the sign changes of the exchange, implemented through vibrational motion of qubits, the ETI enables programmable entanglement trajectories. For in-phase and antiphase vibrations, including scenarios with controlled stopping at the RKKY exchange-free nodes, we identify distinctive trajectories: snake (repeatedly crossing the boundary), bouncing (immediately reversing upon reaching the boundary), boundary-residing (remaining at the transition point), and pulse (controllable entanglement intervals). The vibration phase creates asymmetric shifts to the trajectories. The proposed device offers built-in error correction against dephasing by utilizing both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic regimes. Out-of-phase vibrations drive trajectories away from the boundary, accessing larger entanglement values but with irregular/unsteady final states. To stabilize these trajectories, we introduce a damping mechanism.

            <h2>Quantum Signatures of Strange Attractors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bence Dárdai, Gábor Vattay</p>
            <p>In classical mechanics, driven systems with dissipation often exhibit complex, fractal dynamics known as strange attractors. This paper addresses the fundamental question of how such structures manifest in the quantum realm. We investigate the quantum Duffing oscillator, a paradigmatic chaotic system, using the Caldirola-Kanai (CK) framework, where dissipation is integrated directly into a time-dependent Hamiltonian. By employing the Husimi distribution to represent the quantum state in phase space, we present the first visualization of a quantum strange attractor within this model. Our simulations demonstrate how an initially simple Gaussian wave packet is stretched, folded, and sculpted by the interplay of chaotic dynamics and energy loss, causing it to localize onto a structure that beautifully mirrors the classical attractor. This quantum "photograph" is inherently smoothed, blurring the infinitely fine fractal details of its classical counterpart as a direct consequence of the uncertainty principle. We supplement this analysis by examining the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC), which shows that stronger dissipation clarifies the exponential growth associated with the classical Lyapunov exponent, thereby confirming the model's semiclassical behavior. This work offers a compelling geometric perspective on open chaotic quantum systems and sheds new light on the quantum-classical transition.</p>

            <h2>Applying Grover-mixer Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz Algorithm to High-order Unconstrained Binary Optimization Problems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Evgeniy O. Kiktenko, Elizaveta V. Krendeleva, Aleksey K. Fedorov</p>
            <p>The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is among leading candidates for achieving quantum advantage on near-term processors. While typically implemented with a transverse-field mixer (XM-QAOA), the Grover-mixer variant (GM-QAOA) offers a compelling alternative due to its global search capabilities. This work investigates the application of GM-QAOA to Higher-Order Unconstrained Binary Optimization (HUBO) problems, also known as Polynomial Unconstrained Binary Optimization (PUBO), which constitute a generalized class of combinatorial optimization tasks characterized by intrinsically multi-variable interactions. We present a comprehensive numerical study demonstrating that GM-QAOA, unlike XM-QAOA, exhibits monotonic performance improvement with circuit depth and achieves superior results for HUBO problems. An important component of our approach is an analytical framework for modeling GM-QAOA dynamics, which enables a classical approximation of the optimal parameters and helps reduce the optimization overhead. Our resource-efficient parameterized GM-QAOA nearly matches the performance of the fully optimized algorithm while being far less demanding, establishing it as a highly effective approach for complex optimization tasks. These findings highlight GM-QAOA's potential and provide a practical pathway for its implementation on current quantum hardware.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shiwen An, Jiayi Wang, Konstantinos Slavakis</p>
            <p>Developing robust and high performance quantum software is challenging due to the dynamic nature of existing Python-based frameworks, which often suffer from runtime errors and scalability bottlenecks. In this work, we present LogosQ, a high performance backend agnostic quantum computing library implemented in Rust that enforces correctness through compile time type safety. Unlike existing tools, LogosQ leverages Rust static analysis to eliminate entire classes of runtime errors, particularly in parameter-shift rule gradient computations for variational algorithms. We introduce novel optimization techniques, including direct state-vector manipulation, adaptive parallel processing, and an FFT optimized Quantum Fourier Transform, which collectively deliver speedups of up to 900 times for state preparation (QFT) and 2 to 5 times for variational workloads over Python frameworks (PennyLane, Qiskit), 6 to 22 times over Julia implementations (Yao), and competitive performance with Q sharp. Beyond performance, we validate numerical stability through variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) experiments on molecular hydrogen and XYZ Heisenberg models, achieving chemical accuracy even in edge cases where other libraries fail. By combining the safety of systems programming with advanced circuit optimization, LogosQ establishes a new standard for reliable and efficient quantum simulation.</p>

            <h2>Relation between time- and spacelike entanglement entropy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wu-zhong Guo, Song He, Yu-Xuan Zhang</p>
            <p>In this study, we establish a connection between timelike and spacelike entanglement entropy. We show that timelike entanglement entropy is closely related to spacelike entanglement entropy and its temporal derivative. For a broad class of states, it can be uniquely determined by a linear combination of spacelike entanglement entropy and its first-order temporal derivative. This relation holds, for instance, in states conformally equivalent to the vacuum in two-dimensional conformal field theories. For more general states, we demonstrate that the relation can be constructed perturbatively. Our results suggest that timelike entanglement entropy is constrained by causality. Moreover, this relation provides a unified framework for timelike and spacelike entanglement entropy, within which the imaginary component of timelike entanglement entropy can be understood as arising from the non-commutativity between the twist operator and its first-order temporal derivative.</p>

            <p>Classical $(r,\delta)$-locally recoverable codes are designed for avoiding loss of information in large scale distributed and cloud storage systems. We introduce the quantum counterpart of those codes by defining quantum $(r,\delta)$-locally recoverable codes which are quantum error-correcting codes capable of correcting $\delta -1$ qudit erasures from sets of at most $r+ \delta -1$ qudits. We give a necessary and sufficient condition for a quantum stabilizer code $Q(C)$ to be $(r,\delta)$-locally recoverable. Our condition depends only on the puncturing and shortening at suitable sets of both the symplectic self-orthogonal code $C$ used for constructing $Q(C)$ and its symplectic dual $C^{\perp_s}$. When $Q(C)$ comes from a Hermitian or Euclidean dual-containing code, and under an extra condition, we show that there is an equivalence between the classical and quantum concepts of $(r,\delta)$-local recoverability. A Singleton-like bound is stated in this case and examples attaining the bound are given.</p>

The results are supported by exact diagonalization calculations for chaotic Fermi-Hubbard and Bose-Hubbard models, when they have Wigner-Dyson statistics of energy spectra and demonstrate eigenstate thermalization.

            <p>This work presents a systematic account of elimination of angular dependency from nonrelativistic Schrödinger equation for a three-body quantum system with arbitrary masses, charges, angular momentum, and parity. The resulting reduced Schrödinger equation (RSE) for the reduced wave components, corresponding to the basis of solid bipolar harmonics, is presented in a compact matrix operator form. The variational form of RSE, providing a practical tool for calculating energy levels and wave functions, is also derived. The resulting angular integrals were derived by expanding bipolar harmonics in a basis of parity-adapted Wigner functions. The theoretical results are numerically validated by computing accurate energy levels for selected states of the helium atom in the explicitly correlated Hylleraas-type basis. The work aims to serve as a self-contained reference for the previously scattered throughout the scientific literature formulation of RSE, offering a convenient foundation for further analytical studies of three-particle quantum systems with arbitrary angular momentum and parity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Boris A. Khanikati, Konstantin Y. Bliokh</p>
            <p>Wave vortices constitute a large family of wave entities, closely related to phase singularities and orbital angular momentum (OAM). So far, two main classes of localized wave vortices have been explored: (i) transversely-localized monochromatic vortex beams that carry well-defined longitudinal OAM and propagate/diffract along the longitudinal $z$-axis in space, and (ii) 2D-localized spatiotemporal vortex pulses that carry the more elusive transverse (or tilted) OAM and propagate/diffract along both the $z$-axis and time. Here we introduce another class of wave vortices which are localized in a 2D $(x,y)$ plane, do not propagate in space (apart from uniform radial deformations), and instead propagate/diffract solely along time. These vortices possess well-defined transverse OAM and can naturally appear in 2D wave systems, such as surface polaritons or water waves. We provide a general integral expression for time-diffracting 2D wave vortices, their underlying ray model, and examples of approximate and exact wave solutions. We also analyze the temporal Gouy phase closely related to the rotational evolution in such vortices. Finally, we show that time-diffracting 2D vortices can provide strong spatiotemporal concentration of energy and OAM at sub-wavelength and oscillation-period scales.</p>

            <h2>Coupled-wire construction of non-Abelian higher-order topological phases</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiaxin Pan, Longwen Zhou</p>
            <p>Non-Abelian topological charges (NATCs), characterized by their noncommutative algebra, offer a framework for describing multigap topological phases beyond conventional Abelian invariants. While higher-order topological phases (HOTPs) host boundary states at corners or hinges, their characterization has largely relied on Abelian invariants such as winding and Chern numbers. Here, we propose a coupled-wire scheme of constructing non-Abelian HOTPs and analyze a non-Abelian second-order topological insulator as its minimal model. The resulting Hamiltonian supports hybridized corner modes, protected by parity-time-reversal plus sublattice symmetries and described by a topological vector that unites a non-Abelian quaternion charge with an Abelian winding number. Corner states emerge only when both invariants are nontrivial, whereas weak topological edge states of non-Abelian origins arise when the quaternion charge is nontrivial, enriching the bulk-edge-corner correspondence. The system further exhibits both non-Abelian and Abelian topological phase transitions, providing a unified platform that bridges these two distinct topological classes. Our work extends the understanding of HOTPs into non-Abelian regimes and suggests feasible experimental realizations in synthetic quantum systems, such as photonic or acoustic metamaterials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Süzen</p>
            <p>The transition to chaos for quantum dynamics is quantified via a finely tunable mixed random matrix ensemble. The {\it mixed Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (mGOE)} forms a pedagogically accessible family of systems in simulating {\it Many-Body Localization (MBL)} transitions. It can be tuned from chaotic to localized and heavy-tailed localized phases in a continuous fashion, providing an opportunity to explore new phases. We numerically study how the spectral properties of mGOE evolve during these transitions. Characterization of transition to quantum chaos is computed and analyzed via empirical spectral density, nearest-neighbor spacing, and adjacent gap ratios with statistical uncertainty quantifications that strengthens the robustness of evidence of transitions. The transition is identified as {\it Wigner Cat Phases}, because of the shape of empirical spectral densities, which depens on the tuneable parameter. These simulated phases in mGOE appear to be an ideal tool to study {\it Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH)} and its related transitions, representing a family of physical systems under different localisation and disorder strengths.</p>

            <h2>Bell-Inequality Violation for Continuous, Non-Projective Measurements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shalender Singh, Santosh Kumar</p>
            <p>Many solid-state quantum platforms do not permit sharp, projective measurements but instead yield continuous voltage or field traces under weak, non-demolition readout. In such systems, standard Bell tests based on dichotomic projective measurements are not directly applicable, raising the question of how quantum nonlocality can be certified from continuous time-series data. Here we develop a general theoretical framework showing that Bell-CHSH inequality violation can be extracted from continuous, non-projective measurements without assuming any specific collapse model or phase distribution. We show that sufficiently long continuous measurements of a single entangled pair sample its internal phase-probability structure, enabling effective dichotomic observables to be constructed through phase-sensitive projections and coarse-graining. The resulting Bell correlator is governed by two experimentally accessible resources: intrinsic single-qubit phase spread and nonlocal phase locking between qubits. We benchmark the resulting estimator against conventional projective-measurement CHSH tests implemented via quantum-circuit simulations using Qiskit, finding quantitative agreement in the Bell-violating regime without parameter fitting. Classical deterministic correlations cannot violate the CHSH bound, whereas quantum phase-locked systems recover the nonlinear angular dependence characteristic of entanglement. Our results provide a practical route to demonstrating Bell nonlocality in platforms where measurements are inherently continuous and weak.</p>

            <h2>Partial Collapse and Ensemble Invariance under Continuous Quantum Measurement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shalender Singh, Santosh Kumar</p>
            <p>Wavefunction collapse is often regarded as an unavoidable consequence of quantum measurement. Here we show that in driven-dissipative quantum systems, continuous measurement can extract information without disturbing the physical steady-state ensemble. Using the stochastic master equation formalism, we identify measurement-invariant steady states whose unconditional density matrix remains unchanged under continuous monitoring, despite the presence of measurement-induced collapse at the level of individual quantum trajectories. This separation between conditional collapse and ensemble invariance leads to a regime of partial collapse, in which measurement-induced localization is transient and continuously counteracted by dissipation and drive. We establish a necessary and sufficient condition for steady-state invariance under continuous measurement and show-that it holds over a finite range of measurement strengths. Our results clarify how information gain and measurement backaction can be dynamically decoupled in open quantum systems, with implications for continuous quantum sensing and the foundations of nonprojective measurement.</p>

            <p>The transverse-field Ising model is useful for studying interacting qubit arrays. The Lieb--Robinson correlation function can be used to characterize the propagation of quantum information in Ising chains. Considerable work has been done to establish bounds on this correlation function in various circumstances. To actually calculate the value of the correlation function directly typically requires a state space which grows exponentially with system size, and so is intractable for all but relatively small systems. We employ a recently-developed method that enables direct calculation of the value of the Lieb--Robinson correlation function and which scales linearly with system size. This enables the computation for systems with many hundreds of qubits, revealing the propagation of quantum information down the chain. We extend this technique to the problem of Ising chains with randomly disordered coupling strengths. Increasing disorder causes localization of the quantum correlations and halts propagation of quantum information.</p>

            <p>Two-stage stochastic programming often discretizes uncertainty into scenarios, but scenario enumeration makes expected recourse evaluation scale at least linearly in the scenario count. We propose qGAN-QAOA, a unified quantum-circuit workflow in which a pre-trained quantum generative adversarial network encodes the scenario distribution and QAOA optimizes first-stage decisions by minimizing the full two-stage objective, including expected recourse cost. With the qGAN parameters fixed after training, we evaluate the objective as the expectation value of a problem Hamiltonian and optimize only the QAOA variational parameters. We interpret non-anticipativity as a condition on measurement outcome statistics and prove that the first-stage measurement marginal is independent of the scenario. For uniformly discretized uncertainty, the diagonal operator encoding the uncertainty admits a sparse Pauli-Z expansion via the Walsh--Hadamard transform, yielding polylogarithmic scaling of gate count and circuit depth with the number of scenarios. Numerical experiments on the stochastic unit commitment problem (UCP) with photovoltaic (PV) uncertainty compare the expected cost of the proposed method with classical expected-value and two-stage stochastic programming baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of qGAN-QAOA as a two-stage decision model.</p>

            <p>The out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) is a powerful tool for probing quantum information scrambling, a fundamental process by which local information spreads irreversibly throughout a quantum many-body system. Experimentally measuring the OTOC, however, is notoriously challenging due to the need for time-reversed evolution. Here, we present an experimental evaluation of the OTOC on a quantum computer, using three distinct protocols to address this challenge: the rewinding time method (RTM), the weak-measurement method (WMM), and the irreversibility-susceptibility method (ISM). Our experiments investigate the quantum dynamics of an XXZ spin-1/2 chain prepared in a thermal Gibbs state. As a key contribution, we provide the first experimental demonstration of the ISM, using the numerical emulator of the trapped-ion quantum computer, reimei. We also conduct a detailed comparative analysis of all three methods, revealing method-dependent behaviors in the measured OTOC. This work not only validates these protocols as practical tools for exploring quantum chaos on near-term hardware but also offers crucial insights into their respective advantages and limitations, providing a practical framework for future experimental investigations.</p>

The protocol reaches within a factor of 2.39 (1.68) of the fundamental fidelity limit set by Rydberg lifetime for equal (asymmetric) Rabi frequencies on the control and target qubits. We generalize the gate protocol to arbitrary controlled phases. We design optimal target-qubit phase waveforms to generalize the gate across a range of interaction strengths and we find that, within this family of gates, the constant-phase protocol is time-optimal for a fixed laser Rabi frequency and tunable interaction strength. Robust control methods are used to design gates that are robust against variations in Rydberg Rabi frequency or interaction strength.</p>

            <p>Fracton codes have been intensively studied as novel topological states of matter, yet their fault-tolerant properties remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigate the optimal thresholds of self-dual fracton codes, in particular the checkerboard code, against stochastic Pauli noise. By utilizing a statistical-mechanical mapping combined with large-scale parallel tempering Monte Carlo simulations, we calculate the optimal code capacity of the checkerboard code to be $p_{th} \simeq 0.108(2)$. This value is the highest among known three-dimensional codes and nearly saturates the theoretical limit for topological codes. Our results further validate the generalized entropy relation for two mutually dual models, $H(p_{th}) + H(\tilde{p}_{th}) \approx 1$, and extend its applicability beyond standard topological codes. This verification indicates the Haah's code also possesses a code capacity near the theoretical limit $p_{th} \approx 0.11$. These findings highlight fracton codes as highly resilient quantum memory and demonstrate the utility of duality techniques in analyzing intricate quantum error-correcting codes.</p>

            <p>Variational quantum algorithms are among the most promising approaches for simulating interacting quantum many-body systems on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. However, the practical success of variational quantum eigensolvers (VQE) critically depends on the structure of the chosen variational ansatz. In this work, we investigate the ground-state properties of the one-dimensional antiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin-1/2 chain using both generic hardware-efficient ansatz and physics-informed, symmetry-preserving variational circuits. We benchmark variational results against exact diagonalization and noiseless simulations, and subsequently validate the approach on real IQM Garnet quantum hardware. Our results demonstrate that incorporating physical symmetries into the circuit design leads to significantly improved energy estimates, enhanced robustness against hardware noise, and clearer convergence behavior when compared to hardware-efficient ansatz under identical resource constraints.

            <p>Nonclassical light sources are central to emerging quantum technologies, yet current platforms offer limited tunability and typically operate at low photon numbers. In parallel, strong-field physics provides widely tunable, bright coherent radiation through high-order harmonic generation (HHG), but its quantum optical character has remained largely unexplained. While recent experiments have revealed signatures of entanglement, squeezing, and quantum-state modification in both the driving and generated fields, a unified theoretical framework capable of identifying the origin and controllability of these effects has been missing. Here we introduce a fully quantum, analytically tractable theory of intense light-matter interaction that rigorously captures the emergence of nonclassicality in HHG. Our approach employs a parametric factorization of the coupled electron-field system into a driven electronic state and a dynamically perturbed quantum optical field, derived directly from the time-dependent Schrödinger equation without requiring conditioning, homodyne detection, or mode-selection techniques. We show how quantum correlations, squeezing, and Wigner-function negativity arise intrinsically from the interaction dynamics, and we identify the precise conditions under which specific nonclassical features are amplified or suppressed. The theory enables predictive design of bright, high-photon-number quantum states at tunable frequencies, and we demonstrate its utility by outlining realistic conditions for generating bright nonclassical ultraviolet light. Our results establish a comprehensive foundation for strong-field quantum optics and open new avenues toward tabletop quantum light sources for sensing, communication, and photonic quantum information processing.</p>

Firstly, the order of topological band touching is found to determine how the metrology sensitivity scales with the system size. Engineering a topological phase transition with higher-order band touching is hence advocated, with the associated quantum Fisher information scaling as $ \mathcal{F}_Q \sim L^{2p}$, with $L$ the lattice size in one dimension, and $p$ the order of band touching. Secondly, with a topological lattice accommodating degenerate edge modes (such as multiple zero modes), preparing an $N$-particle entangled state at the edge and then adiabatically tuning the system to the phase transition point grows quantum entanglement to macroscopic sizes, yielding $\mathcal{F}_Q \sim N^2 L^{2p}$. This work hence paves a possible topological phase transition-based route to harness entanglement, large lattice size, and high-order band touching for quantum metrology.</p>

            <h2>Cavity-Free $Δ$-Type Coherent Population Trapping for Microwave Sensing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ido Fridman, Shemuel Sternklar, Eliran Talker</p>
            <p>We investigated experimentally and theoretically a cavity-free microwave field that couples the two ground states of a {\Lambda}-type atomic system, thereby forming a closed {\Delta} configuration. In this regime, the absence of cavity-imposed phase matching leads to a strong sensitivity of the ground-state coherence to the microwave field parameters. We observe that the coherent population trapping (CPT) resonance exhibits a pronounced dependence on the microwave power and detuning, resulting in measurable changes in resonance contrast, linewidth, and center frequency. To explain these effects, we develop a numerical density-matrix model in which the ground-state coherence explicitly incorporates the microwave coupling strength, capturing the essential physics of this no-phase-matching {\Delta} system. The excellent agreement between theory and experiment establishes a simple and robust framework for microwave control of cavity-free {\Delta}-type atomic systems, with direct implications for compact atomic clocks and quantum-enhanced quantum sensing platforms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> L. Saba, C. D. Fosco</p>
            <p>The van der Waals interaction between neutral atoms is typically studied using stationary perturbation theory for the short-distance (London) limit, while long-distance (Casimir-Polder) results are usually derived via semiclassical, time-dependent approaches. In this pedagogical article, we demonstrate that reformulating stationary perturbation theory calculations in terms of time-ordered correlation functions significantly simplifies the mathematical treatment. This reformulation is particularly advantageous for higher-order calculations required in the long-distance regime, where retardation effects become important. Our approach provides a unified framework that connects both limiting cases while offering a clear conceptual picture suitable for advanced quantum mechanics courses.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Carlos Cardoso-Isidoro, Enrique J. Galvez</p>
            <p>Linearly polarized projections are the tacit means for performing Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) Bell-inequality tests using polarization-entangled photon pairs. The inequality is valid for all states on the Poincaré-Bloch sphere, but few laboratory studies have investigated violations with the full sphere. In this article, we explore the experimental verifications of the predicted violations of the CHSH inequality with Bell and non-Bell states with same and different linear and elliptically polarized basis states for each photon. We find that Bell states violate CHSH when using the same basis for both photons, regardless of their ellipticity, whereas they show no violations for photon projections in different bases. We found non-Bell maximally-entangled states for which the converse is true.</p>

            <p>The study of quantum correlations within relativistic spacetimes, and the consequences of relativistic causality on information processing using such correlations, has gained much attention in recent years. In this paper, we establish a unified framework in the form of operational no-signalling constraints to study both nonlocal and temporal correlations within general relativistic spacetimes. We explore several intriguing consequences arising from our framework. Firstly, we show that the violation of the operational no-signalling constraints in Minkowski spacetime implies either a logical paradox or an operational infringement of Poincaré symmetry. We thereby examine and subvert recent claims in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 110401 (2022)] on the possibility of witnessing operationally detectable causal loops in Minkowski spacetime. Secondly, we explore the possibility of jamming of nonlocal correlations, controverting a recent claim in [Nat. Comm. 16, 269 (2025)] that a physical mechanism for jamming would necessarily lead to superluminal signalling. Finally, we show that in black hole spacetimes certain nonlocal correlations under and across the event horizon can be jammed by any agent without spoiling the operational no-signalling constraints.</p>

            <p>Divalent atoms have emerged as powerful alternatives to alkalis in ultracold atom platforms, offering unique advantages arising from their two-electron structure. Among these species, ytterbium (Yb) is especially promising, yet its anionic properties and its Rydberg spectrum remain comparatively unexplored. In this work, we perform a first and comprehensive experimental and theoretical investigation of ultralong-range Rydberg molecules (ULRMs) of $^{174}$Yb in $6sns\,^1S_0$ Rydberg states across nearly two decades in principal quantum number $n$ and three orders of magnitude in molecular binding energy. Using the Coulomb Green's function formalism, we compute Born-Oppenheimer molecular potentials describing the Rydberg atom in the presence of a ground-state perturber and achieve quantitative agreement with high-resolution molecular spectra. This enables the extraction of low-energy electron-Yb scattering phase shifts, including the zero-energy $s$-wave scattering length and the positions of two spin-orbit split $p$-wave shape resonances. Our results provide strong evidence that the Yb$^{-}$ anion exists only as a metastable resonance. We additionally show the sensitivity of ULRM spectra to the atomic quantum defects, using this to refine the value for the $6s23f\, ^1F_3$ quantum defect. Together, these findings establish Yb ULRMs as a powerful probe of electron-Yb interactions and lay essential groundwork for future Rydberg experiments with divalent atoms.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate a three-dimensional magneto-optical trap (MOT) of a metal hydride molecule, CaH. We are able to scatter $\sim$$10^{4}$ photons with vibrational loss covered up to vibrational quantum number $\nu=2$. This allows us to laser slow the molecular beam near zero velocity with a "white-light" technique and subsequently load it into a radio-frequency MOT. The MOT contains 230(40) molecules, limited by beam source characteristics and predissociative loss of CaH. The temperature of the MOT is below one millikelvin. The predissociative loss mechanism could, in turn, facilitate controlled dissociation of the molecule, offering a possible route to optical trapping of hydrogen atoms for precision spectroscopy.</p>

            <p>A massless scalar field in two spacetime dimensions splits into two independent sectors of left and right-moving modes on the light cone. At the quantum level, these two sectors carry a representation of the group of affine transformations of the real line, with translations corresponding to transformations generated by light-cone momenta and dilations given by light-cone Rindler momenta formed by a linear combination of generators of boosts and dilations. One-particle states for inertial observers are eigenvectors of translation generators belonging to irreducible representations of the affine group. Rindler one-particle states are related to eigenfunctions of the generator of dilations. We show that simple manipulations connecting these two representations involving the Mellin transform can be used to derive the thermal spectrum of Rindler particles observed by an accelerated observer. Beyond providing a representation-theoretic basis for vacuum thermal effects, our results suggest that analogous phenomena may arise in any quantum system admitting realizations of translation and dilation eigenstates.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pawel Caputa, Abhigyan Saha, Piotr Sułkowski</p>
            <p>We introduce generalisations of von Neumann entanglement entropy that are invariant with respect to certain scale transformations. These constructions are based on Unit-Invariant Singular Value Decomposition (UISVD) with its right-, left-, and bi-invariant incarnations, which itself are variations of the standard Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) that remain invariant under (appropriate set of) diagonal transformations. These measures are naturally defined for non-Hermitian or rectangular operators and remain useful when the input and output spaces possess different dimensions or metric weights. We apply the UISVD entropy and discuss its advantages in the physically interesting framework of Biorthogonal Quantum Mechanics, whose important aspect is indeed the behavior under scale transformations. Further, we illustrate features of UISVD-based entropies in other representative settings, from simple quantum mechanical bipartite states to random matrices relevant to quantum chaos and holography, and in the context of Chern-Simons theory. In all cases, the UISVD yields stable, physically meaningful entropic spectra that are invariant under rescalings and normalisations.</p>

            <p>In the present study, we apply shortcut to adiabaticity pulses (time-dependent Rabi frequency and detuning) for the efficient population transfer from the ground to the exciton state in a GaAs/InGaAs quantum dot with phonon-induced dephasing. We use the time-evolving matrix product operator (TEMPO) method to propagate system in time and find that, for temperatures below $ 20 \ \text{K} $ and pulse duration up to $ 10 \ \text{ps} $, a very good transfer efficiency is obtained in general. We explain these results using a Bloch-like equation derived from a generalized Lindblad equation, which adequately describes system dynamics at lower temperatures. For higher temperatures, the transfer efficiency is significantly reduced except for subpicosecond pulses, where the shortcut Rabi frequency reduces to a delta pulse attaining a fast population inversion. The present work is expected to find application in quantum technologies which exploit quantum dots for single-photon generation on demand.</p>

            <p>Hybrid semiconductor-superconductor qubits have recently emerged as a promising alternative to traditional platforms, combining material advantages with device-level tunability. A defining feature is their gate-tunable Josephson coupling, enabling superconducting qubit architectures with full electric-field control and offering a path toward scalable, low-crosstalk quantum processors. This approach seeks to merge benefits of superconducting and semiconductor qubits, for instance by encoding quantum information in the spin of a quasiparticle occupying an Andreev bound state, thus combining long coherence times with fast, flexible control. Progress has accelerated through bottom-up engineering of Andreev states in coupled quantum dot arrays, leading to architectures such as minimal Kitaev chains hosting Majorana zero modes. In parallel, Hamiltonian-protected designs aim to enhance resilience against local noise and decoherence by exploiting superconducting phase dynamics and discrete charge or flux degrees of freedom. This article reviews recent theoretical and experimental advances in hybrid qubits, providing an overview of physical mechanisms, device implementations, and emerging architectures, with emphasis on their potential for (topologically) protected quantum information processing. While many designs remain at proof-of-concept stage, rapid progress suggests practical demonstrations may soon be achievable.</p>

            <p>Germanium hole spin qubits based on strained Ge/SiGe quantum well have attracted much research attention due to the strong spin-orbit coupling. In particular, the strain dependence of the heavy-hole--light-hole mixing and thus the $g$-tensor anisotropy offer unique opportunities for acoustic driving and spin-phonon coupling. In this work we numerically simulate the coherent control of a Ge hole spin using surface acoustic waves. The periodic strain dynamically modulates the $g$-tensor matrix and causes fast spin rotation under a small acoustic amplitude. Moreover, we show a strong anisotropy and confinement dependence of the Rabi frequency coming from the phase-shifted longitudinal and shear strain components. Our work lays the foundations for acoustic-driven spin control and spin-phonon coupling using Ge hole spin qubits.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saranesh Prembabu, Shu-Heng Shao, Ruben Verresen</p>
            <p>Gapless quantum phases can become distinct when internal symmetries are enforced, in analogy with gapped symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. However, this distinction does not always lead to protected edge modes, raising the question of how the bulk-boundary correspondence is generalized to gapless cases. We propose that the spatial interface between gapless phases -- rather than their boundaries -- provides a more robust fingerprint. We show that whenever two 1+1d conformal field theories (CFTs) differ in symmetry charge assignments of local operators or twisted sectors, any symmetry-preserving spatial interface between the theories must flow to a non-invertible defect. We illustrate this general result for different versions of the Ising CFT with $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2^T$ symmetry, obtaining a complete classification of allowed conformal interfaces. When the Ising CFTs differ by nonlocal operator charges, the interface hosts 0+1d symmetry-breaking phases with finite-size splittings scaling as $1/L^3$, as well as continuous phase transitions between them. For general gapless phases differing by an SPT entangler, the interfaces between them can be mapped to conformal defects with a certain defect 't Hooft anomaly. This classification also gives implications for higher-dimensional examples, including symmetry-enriched variants of the 2+1d Ising CFT. Our results establish a physical indicator for symmetry-enriched criticality through symmetry-protected interfaces, giving a new handle on the interplay between topology and gapless phases.</p>

            <p>Fermi's golden rule (FGR) serves as the basis for many expressions of spectroscopic observables and quantum transition rates. The utility of FGR has been demonstrated through decades of experimental confirmation. However, there still remain important cases where the evaluation of a FGR rate is ambiguous or ill-defined. Examples are cases where the rate has divergent terms due to the sparsity in the density of final states or time dependent fluctuations of system Hamiltonians. Strictly speaking, assumptions of FGR are no longer valid for such cases. However, it is still possible to define modified FGR rate expressions that are useful as effective rates. The resulting modified FGR rate expressions resolve a long standing ambiguity often encountered in using FGR and offer more reliable ways to model general rate processes. Simple model calculations illustrate the utility and implications of new rate expressions.</p>

            <h2>Error and Disturbance as Irreversibility with Applications: Unified Definition, Wigner--Araki--Yanase Theorem and Out-of-Time-Order Correlator</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haruki Emori, Hiroyasu Tajima</p>
            <p>Defining an error of measurement has long been a foundational problem in science: even in classical experiments, data are statistical and admit no single universally optimal definition of error. In quantum mechanics, the challenge deepens: observed entities often lack preexisting definite values, and the act of measurement unavoidably disturbs the system of interest. Consequently, both error and disturbance must be quantified, and various definitions have been proposed to date. However, a unified perspective for understanding the differences and similarities among these diverse definitions of error and disturbance, and an operational framework for distinguishing between them, remain elusive. In this Letter, we propose a novel framework for defining error and disturbance using irreversibility. Our framework converts the error and disturbance of a quantum measurement of a system under consideration into the irreversibility of an ancillary qubit system, using a quantum comb composed of loss and recovery processes. The mechanism enables us to make the operational distinction that error uses the classical outputs, while disturbance uses the quantum outputs of the measurement in the recovery process. Furthermore, our framework yields several key consequences: (i) it encompasses existing definitions, (ii) it establishes a universal constraint on error and disturbance defined by any measure of an arbitrary quantum process under a conservation law, and (iii) it reveals an operational connection between irreversibility and the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC), a metric of quantum chaos. It also provides a constraint on the OTOC under a conservation law and a method for its experimental evaluation, which is demonstrated on a quantum processor.</p>

            <p>A simple 4th order propagator [Ture and Jang, {\it J. Phys. Chem. A.} {\bf 128}, 2871 (2024)] based on the Magnus expansion (ME) is extended to the Liouville space for both closed-system and Lindbladian open-system quantum dynamics. For both dynamics, commutator free versions of 4th order propagators are provided as well. These propagators are then applied to the dynamics of a driven $\Lambda$-system, where Lindblad terms represent the effect of a photonic bath. For both dynamics, the accuracy of the rotating wave approximation (RWA) for the matter-radiation interaction is assessed. We confirmed reasonable performance of RWA for weak and resonant fields. However, small errors appear for moderate fields and substantial errors can be found for strong fields where coherent population trapping can still be expected. We also found that the presence of bath for open system quantum dynamics consistently reduces the errors of the RWA. These results provide a quantitative information on how the RWA breaks down beyond weak field or for non-resonant cases. Major results are benchmarked against results of our 6th order ME-based propagator. We also provide numerical comparison of our algorithms with other 4th order algorithms for the $\Lambda$-system. These confirm reasonable performance of our simple propagators and the improvement gained through commutator-free expressions.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we study excitations and dissipation in two infinite parallel metallic plates undergoing relative motion. The degrees of freedom of the electrons in both plates are modeled using the 1+2 dimensional Dirac field, and a nonlocal potential is selected to describe the interaction between the two plates. The internal relative motion is introduced via a Galilean boost, with one plate assumed to slide relative to the other. We then calculate the effective action of the system and derive the vacuum occupation number in momentum space using a perturbative method. Numerical plots reveal that the vacuum occupation number, as a function of momentum, is isotropic for a motion speed $v = 0$ and anisotropic for nonzero $v$. The relative motion induces energy transfer between the plates, leading to on-shell excitations in a manner analogous to the dissipative process of the Schwinger effect. Consequently, we study the motion-induced dissipation effects and the dissipative forces through the quantum action. Numerical results demonstrate that both the imaginary part of the quantum action due to the motion boost and the dissipative force exhibit a threshold as functions of $v$, and both are positively correlated with $v$.</p>

The localization process has universal features for the plateaus duration and the delocalization time. Interactions among the excitations favor this process even for tiniest disorder levels. Our findings can be applied to design stroboscopic protocols where sequences of transport and localization can be tailored. We establish relevant connections to noise-engineering of quantum devices in noisy intermediate-scale quantum simulators platforms, and to realistic biological systems where noise and disorder coexist.</p>

            <p>Complex quantum networks are powerful tools in the modeling of transport phenomena, particularly for biological systems, and enable the study of emergent phenomena in many-body quantum systems. High connectivity and long-range interactions induce strong constraints on the system dynamics. Here, we study the transport properties of a quantum network described by the paradigmatic XXZ Hamiltonian, with non-trivial graph connectivity and topology, and long-range interactions. We show how long-range interactions induce memory preserving effects and strongly affect the spreading of the excitations due to cooperative shielding. We describe the memory-preserving effect in all-to-all connected regular networks with distance-independent couplings. Indeed, the memory of the number of initially injected excitations is preserved over long times, encoded in the number of frequencies present in the dynamics. Interestingly, we find that memory-preserving effects occur also in less regular graphs, such as quantum networks with either power-law node connectivity or complex, small-world type, architectures. We discuss the implications of these properties in biology-related problems, such as an application to Weber's law in neuroscience, and their implementation in specific quantum technologies via biomimicry. We also show how the presence of long-range interaction strongly affects the dynamics of the excitations in small-world networks and power law all-to-all coupled networks. Indeed, because of cooperative shielding blue, as the connectivity or the range of interaction increases, the initial excitation spreads more slowly among the network and becomes strongly dependent on the initial conditions.</p>

            <p>The energy cost of erasing quantum states depends on our knowledge of the states. We show that learning algorithms can acquire such knowledge to erase many copies of an unknown state at the optimal energy cost. This is proved by showing that learning can be made fully reversible and has no fundamental energy cost itself. With simple counting arguments, we relate the energy cost of erasing quantum states to their complexity, entanglement, and magic. We further show that the constructed erasure protocol is computationally efficient when learning is efficient. Conversely, under standard cryptographic assumptions, we prove that the optimal energy cost cannot be achieved efficiently in general. These results also enable efficient work extraction based on learning. Together, our results establish a concrete connection between quantum learning theory and thermodynamics, highlighting the physical significance of learning processes and enabling provably-efficient learning-based protocols for thermodynamic tasks.</p>

            <p>In circuit-based quantum state preparation, qubit loss and coherent errors are circuit imperfections that imperil the formation of long-range entanglement beyond a certain threshold. The critical theory at the threshold is a continuous entanglement transition known to be described by a (2+0)-dimensional non-unitary conformal field theory which, for the two types of imperfections of certain circuits, is described by either percolation or Nishimori criticality, respectively. Here we study the threshold behavior when the two types of errors simultaneously occur and show that, when moving away from the Clifford-regime of projective stabilizer measurements, the percolation critical point becomes unstable and the critical theory flows to Nishimori universality. We track this critical renormalization group (RG) crossover flow by mapping out the entanglement phase diagrams, parametrized by the probability and strength of random weak measurements, of two dual protocols preparing surface code or GHZ-class cat states from a parent cluster state via constant-depth circuits. Extensive numerical simulations, using hybrid Gaussian fermion and tensor network / Monte Carlo sampling techniques on systems with more than a million qubits, demonstrate that an infinitesimal deviation from the Clifford regime leads to a sudden, strongly non-monotonic entanglement growth at the incipient non-unitary RG flow. We argue that spectra of scaling dimensions of both the percolation and Nishimori fixed points exhibit multifractality. For percolation, we provide the exact (non-quadratic) multifractal spectrum of exponents, while for the Nishimori fixed point we show high-precision numerical results for five leading exponents characterizing multifractality.</p>

            <p>Telecom wavelength quantum dots (QDs) are emerging as a promising solution for generating deterministic single photons compatible with existing fiber optic infrastructure. Emission in the low loss C band minimizes transmission losses, making them ideal for long distance quantum communication. In this work, we present a demonstration of both Stark tuning and charge state control of individual InAs/InP QDs operating within the telecom C-band. These QDs are grown by droplet epitaxy and embedded in an InP based n++-i-n+ heterostructure fabricated using MOVPE. The gated architecture enables the tuning of emission energy via the quantum confined Stark effect, with a tuning range exceeding 2.4 nm. It also allows for control over the QD charge occupancy, enabling access to multiple discrete excitonic states. Electrical tuning of the fine structure splitting is further demonstrated, opening a route to entangled photon pair generation at telecom wavelengths. The single photon character is confirmed via second order correlation measurements. These advances enable QDs to be tuned into resonance with other systems, such as cavity modes and emitters, marking a critical step toward scalable, fiber compatible quantum photonic devices.</p>

Quantum sensing and metrology is an emerging field that lies at the cross-roads of quantum physics, quantum technology, and the discipline in which the parameter estimation is to be performed.

The current review hopes to bring together the concepts related to quantum sensing as realized in ensemble systems, like spin ensembles, light-matter systems, and Bose-Einstein condensates, and lattice systems, like those which can be modeled by the Bose- and Fermi-Hubbard models, and quantum spin models.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rahul Gupta, H.Y. Yuan, Himadri Shekhar Dhar</p>
            <p>We present a scheme for generating stable and tunable entanglement between two localized Bloch domain walls in nanomagnetic strips kept inside a chiral optical cavity. The entanglement is mediated by the effective optomechanical interaction between the cavity photons and the two macroscopic, collective modes of the pinned domain walls. By controlling the pinning potential and optical driving frequency, the robust, steady-state entanglement between the two macroscopic domain walls can survive beyond the typical milli-Kelvin temperature range.</p>

            <p>Optical non-Gaussian states hold great promise as a pivotal resource for advanced optical quantum information processing and fault-tolerant long-distance quantum communication. Establishing their faithful transmission in a real-world communication channel, therefore, marks an important milestone. In this study, we experimentally demonstrate the distribution of such non-Gaussian states in a functioning telecommunication channel that connects separate buildings within the DTU campus premises. We send photon-subtracted squeezed states, exhibiting pronounced Wigner negativity, through 300 m of deployed optical fibers to a distant building. Using quantum homodyne tomography, we fully characterize the states upon arrival. Our results show the survival of the Wigner function negativity after transmission when correcting for detection losses, indicating that the established link can potentially facilitate the violation of Bell's inequality and enable quantum steering. This achievement not only validates the practical feasibility of distributing non-Gaussian states in real-world settings, but also provides an exciting impetus towards realizing fully coherent quantum networks for high-dimensional, continuous-variable quantum information processing.</p>

            <h2>Measurement-only circuit of perturbed toric code on triangular lattice: Topological entanglement, 1-form symmetry and logical qubits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Keisuke Kataoka, Yoshihito Kuno, Takahiro Orito, Ikuo Ichinose</p>
            <p>Measurement-only (quantum) circuit (MoC) gives possibility to realize the states with rich entanglements, topological orders and quantum memories. This work studies the MoC, in which the projective-measurement operators consist of stabilizers of the toric code and competitive local Pauli operators. The former correspond to terms of the toric code on a triangular lattice and the later to external magnetic and electric fields. We employ efficient numerical stabilizer algorithm to trace evolving states undergoing phase transitions. We elucidate the phase diagram of the MoC system with the observables such as, topological entanglement entropy (TEE), disorder parameters of 1-form symmetries and emergent logical operators. We clarify the locations of the phase transitions through the observation of the above quantities and obtain precise critical exponents to examine if the observables exhibit the critical behavior simultaneously under the MoC and transitions belong to the same universality class. In contrast to the TC Hamiltonian system and toric code MoC on a square lattice, the system on the triangular lattice is not self-dual nor bipartite, and then, coincidence by symmetries, such as critical behaviors across the TC and Higgs/confined phase, does not takes place. Then, the toric code MoC on the triangular lattice provides us a suitable playground to clarify the mutual relationship between the TEE, spontaneous symmetry breaking of the 1-form symmetries, and emergence of logical operators. Obtained results indicate that toric code MoC on the triangular lattice exhibits a few distinct phase transitions with different location and critical exponents, and some of them are closely related with the two-dimensional percolation transition.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Scott Bogner, Heiko Hergert, Morten Hjorth-Jensen, Ryan LaRose, Dean Lee, Matthew Patkowski</p>
            <p>We introduce a method called resolution refinement that allows one to bootstrap eigenstate preparation on a quantum computer. We first prepare an eigenstate of a low-resolution Hamiltonian using any method of choice. The eigenstate is then lifted to higher resolution and adiabatically evolved to produce the corresponding eigenstate of a higher-fidelity Hamiltonian. We give examples of resolution refinement applied to both single-particle basis states as well as a spatial lattice grid. For basis refinement, we compute few-body ground states of the Busch model for interacting particles in a harmonic trap in one dimension. For lattice refinement, we compute Hartree-Fock nuclear states for a central Woods-Saxon potential in three dimensions, and we compute bound states and continuum states in a multi-species Hubbard model of fermions in one dimension. In all cases, the method is efficient and requires an adiabatic evolution time that scales with the inverse of the energy gap times the square root of the system size. We show that this very favorable scaling arises from the fact that resolution refinement does not make large changes to the structure or energies of the low-energy eigenstates.</p>

            <h2>Beyond Single-Device Constraints: A System-Level Theoretical Framework for High-Performance Single-Photon Detection at Room Temperature</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hao Shu</p>
            <p>Photon detection, a fundamental quantum technology, is traditionally treated as a fixed device-level operation governed by intrinsic properties of single-photon detectors (SPDs). High-performance detection has therefore largely relied on superconducting technologies whose requirement for cryogenic operation imposes substantial infrastructure constraints, limiting scalable deployments. Here, the enhanced single-photon detection (ESPD) framework is presented as a system-level theoretical paradigm that shifts photon detection from device-centric optimization to an integrated quantum-information-processing task, by reformulating it as an iteratively enhanced process integrating state-preparation, controlled operations, projective measurements, and multi-copy analysis. ESPD enables systematic performance enhancement through architectural design rather than material modification, thereby circumventing superconducting components, allowing high-performance detection using exclusively room-temperature hardware. Numerical simulations grounded in physically motivated parameters indicate that the ESPD framework can upgrade a conventional room-temperature SPD to effective DE exceeding 93\% and DCR below $10^{-9}$, which are comparable to state-of-the-art superconducting SPDs and can significantly relax the minimal tolerable channel transmission rate in quantum communications. While physical realization would require further component integration, this work establishes a rigorous theoretical framework for enhancing detection performance through architectural quantum-information principles, providing a general blueprint for transcending device-level constraints and guiding the development of next-generation room-temperature quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Universal Quantum Random Access Memory: A Data-Independent Unitary Construction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Leonardo Bohac</p>
            <p>We present a construction for Quantum Random Access Memory (QRAM) that achieves a single, data-independent unitary operator. Unlike routing-based approaches or circuit methods that yield data-dependent unitaries, our Universal QRAM encodes data in memory qubits that act as quantum control signals within a block-diagonal permutation structure. The key insight is that memory qubits serve as control signals, enabling coherent lookup when addresses are in superposition. For N addresses with K-bit data words, the construction requires $\log_2 N + K + NK$ qubits and decomposes into exactly $NK$ multi-controlled gates. We verify the construction for $N \in \{2, 4, 8, 16\}$ and $K \in \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$, confirming that the resulting unitary is a pure permutation matrix with zero error across all data configurations. This approach simplifies QRAM implementation by separating fixed circuit structure from variable data encoding.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S. Di Matteo, C. Mazzoli</p>
            <p>Recently, Sharoglazova et al. claimed to have proven a violation of the basic tenet of Bohmian mechanics, namely the phase-speed relation $\vec{v}(\vec{r},t)=\frac{\hbar}{m}\vec{\nabla}S(\vec{r},t)$. Here, $S(\vec{r},t)$ is the (real) phase of the wave function $\psi(\vec{r},t)=\rho^{\frac{1}{2}}(\vec{r},t)e^{iS(\vec{r},t)}$. In a nutshell, they have measured the speed of a claimed evanescent wave, which is real and therefore must have $\vec{\nabla}S=\vec{0}$. However, Fig. 2 clearly shows a density motion from one waveguide to the other, implying a nonzero density current, $\vec{j}(\vec{r},t)=\frac{\hbar}{m}\Im(\psi^*\vec{\nabla}\psi)$. If we combine this evidence with the mathematical identity $\vec{\nabla}S=\frac{m}{\rho}\vec{j}$, we should instead conclude that $\vec{\nabla}S\neq\vec{0}$. So, where does this apparent inconsistency come from?</p>

At low energies, eigenstates exhibit strong Anderson localization, while at higher energies a subset of states forms variational scars with anisotropic intensity patterns that violate random wave expectations. Scaling theory predicts that all states localize in two dimensions, yet energy-dependent localization lengths and finite system size allow these regimes to coexist. We demonstrate that this coexistence produces distinct, robust signatures in both spatial intensity patterns and spectral statistics that are directly observable in mesoscopic electronic, photonic, and cold atom systems.</p>

            <h2>Contraction 2.0 Natural Metrics in Contraction Analysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Winfried Lohmiller, Jean-Jacques Slotine</p>
            <p>Contraction analysis establishes exponential incremental convergence of a nonlinear system by solving a linear matrix inequality for a contraction metric, and has become a standard resource for solving problems in nonlinear control and estimation. This paper shows that, for a general nonlinear time-varying system, a contraction metric can be systematically derived by rewriting the system dynamics as a complex natural gradient dynamics. In this form, the variational dynamics can be modally decomposed with geodesic coordinates, and exact exponential convergence rates can be computed. The results are extended to systems with nonlinear inequality constraints. All derivations are tensor-based, and the computed eigenvalues themselves are coordinate-invariant, i.e., the contraction rates are independent of the chosen coordinate system. Simple examples including a gravity pendulum, gradient descent with non-convex cost, Schuler dynamics, and a two-link manipulator, illustrate that the computation of the decomposed convergence rates is straightforward. The role of inequality constraints is illustrated for a controller confined to an operational envelope.</p>

            <h2>Tensor network approximation of Koopman operators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dimitrios Giannakis, Mohammad Javad Latifi Jebelli, Michael Montgomery, Philipp Pfeffer, Jörg Schumacher, Joanna Slawinska</p>
            <p>We propose a tensor network framework for approximating the evolution of observables of measure-preserving ergodic systems. Our approach is based on a spectrally-convergent approximation of the skew-adjoint Koopman generator by a diagonalizable, skew-adjoint operator $W_\tau$ that acts on a reproducing kernel Hilbert space $\mathcal H_\tau$ with coalgebra structure and Banach algebra structure under the pointwise product of functions. Leveraging this structure, we lift the unitary evolution operators $e^{t W_\tau}$ (which can be thought of as regularized Koopman operators) to a unitary evolution group on the Fock space $F(\mathcal H_\tau)$ generated by $\mathcal H_\tau$ that acts multiplicatively with respect to the tensor product. Our scheme also employs a representation of classical observables ($L^\infty$ functions of the state) by quantum observables (self-adjoint operators) acting on the Fock space, and a representation of probability densities in $L^1$ by quantum states. Combining these constructions leads to an approximation of the Koopman evolution of observables that is representable as evaluation of a tree tensor network built on a tensor product subspace $\mathcal H_\tau^{\otimes n} \subset F(\mathcal H_\tau)$ of arbitrarily high grading $n \in \mathbb N$. A key feature of this quantum-inspired approximation is that it captures information from a tensor product space of dimension $(2d+1)^n$, generated from a collection of $2d + 1$ eigenfunctions of $W_\tau$. Furthermore, the approximation is positivity preserving. The paper contains a theoretical convergence analysis of the method and numerical applications to two dynamical systems on the 2-torus: an ergodic torus rotation as an example with pure point Koopman spectrum and a Stepanoff flow as an example with topological weak mixing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vladimir Al. Osipov, Boris Fainberg</p>
            <p>A system of several Wannier-Mott excitons interacting with phonons in a bulk material is considered. We show that strong exciton-phonon coupling causes the formation of a coherent two-exciton state -- the exciton pair. Unlike the biexcitons, where the photons play the role of force carrier, the exciton pair is formed via entanglement with the long-living phonon mode: (i) The essentially multi-particle theory requires excitons (cobosons composed of an electron and a hole) to satisfy the mixed Bose-Fermi statistics; (ii) This allows us to formulate a system of non-linear dynamic equations, using the multiconfiguration Hartree method applied to the Frohlich Hamiltonian. The system of equations possesses a stationary solution, which, for the case of a single exciton, describes the excitonic polaron and corresponds to the exciton pair in the two-exciton case. We also compare the fluorescent spectra of exciton polarons and exciton pairs estimated from our theory with those observed in experiments on room-temperature superfluorescence (collective emission of fluorescent light) in hybrid perovskites to give an additional insight into the superfluorescence phenomenon.</p>

            <p>We provide a mathematical realization of a conjecture by Kitaev, on the basis of the operator-algebraic formulation of infinite quantum spin systems. Our main results are threefold. First, we construct an $\Omega$-spectrum $\mathit{IP}_*$ whose homotopy groups are isomorphic to the smooth homotopy group of invertible gapped quantum systems on Euclidean spaces. Second, we develop a model for the homology theory associated with the $\Omega$-spectrum $\mathit{IP}_*$, describing it in terms of the space of quantum systems placed on an arbitrary subspace of a Euclidean space. This involves introducing the concept of localization flow, a semi-infinite path of quantum systems with decaying interaction range, inspired by Yu's localization C*-algebra in coarse index theory. Third, we incorporate spatial symmetries given by a crystallographic group $\Gamma $ and define the $\Omega$-spectrum $\mathit{IP}_*^\Gamma$ of $\Gamma$-invariant invertible phases. We propose a strategy for computing the homotopy group $\pi_n(\mathit{IP}_d^\Gamma )$ that uses the Davis--Lück assembly map and its description by invertible gapped localization flow. In particular, we show that the assembly map is split injective, and hence $\pi_n(\mathit{IP}_d^\Gamma)$ contains a computable direct summand.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mátyás Szücs, Péter Ván</p>
            <p>A thermodynamic analysis of weakly nonlocal non-relativistic fluids is presented under the assumption that an additional scalar field also contributes to the dynamics. The most general evolution of this field and the constitutive relations for the pressure tensor and energy current density are determined by the Liu procedure. Classical holography of perfect (\ie non-dissipative) fluids is generally proven, according to which the divergence of the pressure tensor can be given by the gradient of a corresponding scalar potential. A consequence of holographic property is vorticity conservation, which opens the way toward wave-function representation of hydrodynamic equations to obtain the Schrödinger equation. Another special case of the derived fluid model is Newtonian gravity, when the internal variable is the gravitational potential itself. Coupled phenomena, such as the Schrödinger--Newton system, are also discussed. The presented thermodynamic framework can shed light on some connections between formulations of classical and quantum physics.</p>

            <p>Quantum Separation Logic (QSL) has been proposed as an effective tool to improve the scalability of deductive reasoning for quantum programs. In QSL, separation is interpreted as disentanglement, and the frame rule brings a notion of entanglement-local specification (one that only talks about the qubits entangled with those acted upon by the program). In this paper, we identify two notions of locality unique to the quantum domain, and we construct a novel quantum separation logic, RapunSL, which is able to soundly reduce reasoning about superposition states to reasoning about pure states (basis-locality), and reasoning about mixed states arising from measurement to reasoning about pure states (outcome-locality). To do so, we introduce two connectives, linear combination and mixing, which together with separation provide a dramatic improvement in the scalability of reasoning, as we demonstrate on a series of challenging case studies.</p>

            <p>Quantum synchronisation has recently been proposed as a mechanism for electronic excitation energy transfer in light-harvesting complexes, yet its robustness in driven-dissipative settings remains under active investigation. Here, we revisit this mechanism in cryptophyte photosynthetic antennae using an exciton--vibrational dimer model. By comparing the full open quantum dynamics with semi-classical rate equations for electronic density-matrix elements and vibrational observables, we demonstrate that quantum correlations between electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom, beyond the semi-classical factorised limit, underpin the emergence of quantum synchronisation. Furthermore, we introduce an environment-assisted transfer mechanism arising as a nonlinear, non-Condon correction to the dipole--dipole interaction. This mechanism enables long-lived quantum coherence and continuous, synchronisation-enhanced energy transfer in a driven-dissipative regime, thereby suggesting new avenues for investigating photosynthetic energy-transfer dynamics.</p>

The {\it mixed Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (mGOE)} forms a pedagogically accessible family of systems in simulating {\it Many-Body Localization (MBL)} transitions. It can be tuned from chaotic to localized and heavy-tailed localized phases in a continuous fashion, providing an opportunity to explore new phases. We numerically study how the spectral properties of mGOE evolve during these transitions. Characterization of transition to quantum chaos is computed and analyzed via empirical spectral density, nearest-neighbor spacing, and adjacent gap ratios with statistical uncertainty quantifications that strengthens the robustness of evidence of transitions. The transition is identified as {\it Wigner Cat Phases}, because of the shape of empirical spectral densities, which depens on the tuneable parameter. These simulated phases in mGOE appear to be an ideal tool to study {\it Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH)} and its related transitions, representing a family of physical systems under different localisation and disorder strengths.</p>

            <h2>Bell-Inequality Violation for Continuous, Non-Projective Measurements</h2>

            <p>Many solid-state quantum platforms do not permit sharp, projective measurements but instead yield continuous voltage or field traces under weak, non-demolition readout. In such systems, standard Bell tests based on dichotomic projective measurements are not directly applicable, raising the question of how quantum nonlocality can be certified from continuous time-series data. Here we develop a general theoretical framework showing that Bell-CHSH inequality violation can be extracted from continuous, non-projective measurements without assuming any specific collapse model or phase distribution. We show that sufficiently long continuous measurements of a single entangled pair sample its internal phase-probability structure, enabling effective dichotomic observables to be constructed through phase-sensitive projections and coarse-graining. The resulting Bell correlator is governed by two experimentally accessible resources: intrinsic single-qubit phase spread and nonlocal phase locking between qubits. We benchmark the resulting estimator against conventional projective-measurement CHSH tests implemented via quantum-circuit simulations using Qiskit, finding quantitative agreement in the Bell-violating regime without parameter fitting. Classical deterministic correlations cannot violate the CHSH bound, whereas quantum phase-locked systems recover the nonlinear angular dependence characteristic of entanglement. Our results provide a practical route to demonstrating Bell nonlocality in platforms where measurements are inherently continuous and weak.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shalender Singh, Santosh Kumar</p>
            <p>Wavefunction collapse is often regarded as an unavoidable consequence of quantum measurement. Here we show that in driven-dissipative quantum systems, continuous measurement can extract information without disturbing the physical steady-state ensemble. Using the stochastic master equation formalism, we identify measurement-invariant steady states whose unconditional density matrix remains unchanged under continuous monitoring, despite the presence of measurement-induced collapse at the level of individual quantum trajectories. This separation between conditional collapse and ensemble invariance leads to a regime of partial collapse, in which measurement-induced localization is transient and continuously counteracted by dissipation and drive. We establish a necessary and sufficient condition for steady-state invariance under continuous measurement and show-that it holds over a finite range of measurement strengths. Our results clarify how information gain and measurement backaction can be dynamically decoupled in open quantum systems, with implications for continuous quantum sensing and the foundations of nonprojective measurement.</p>

            <p>The transverse-field Ising model is useful for studying interacting qubit arrays. The Lieb--Robinson correlation function can be used to characterize the propagation of quantum information in Ising chains. Considerable work has been done to establish bounds on this correlation function in various circumstances. To actually calculate the value of the correlation function directly typically requires a state space which grows exponentially with system size, and so is intractable for all but relatively small systems. We employ a recently-developed method that enables direct calculation of the value of the Lieb--Robinson correlation function and which scales linearly with system size. This enables the computation for systems with many hundreds of qubits, revealing the propagation of quantum information down the chain. We extend this technique to the problem of Ising chains with randomly disordered coupling strengths. Increasing disorder causes localization of the quantum correlations and halts propagation of quantum information.</p>

Experimentally measuring the OTOC, however, is notoriously challenging due to the need for time-reversed evolution. Here, we present an experimental evaluation of the OTOC on a quantum computer, using three distinct protocols to address this challenge: the rewinding time method (RTM), the weak-measurement method (WMM), and the irreversibility-susceptibility method (ISM). Our experiments investigate the quantum dynamics of an XXZ spin-1/2 chain prepared in a thermal Gibbs state. As a key contribution, we provide the first experimental demonstration of the ISM, using the numerical emulator of the trapped-ion quantum computer, reimei. We also conduct a detailed comparative analysis of all three methods, revealing method-dependent behaviors in the measured OTOC. This work not only validates these protocols as practical tools for exploring quantum chaos on near-term hardware but also offers crucial insights into their respective advantages and limitations, providing a practical framework for future experimental investigations.</p>

            <h2>An asymmetric and fast Rydberg gate protocol for long range entanglement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel C. Cole, Vikas Buchemmavari, Mark Saffman</p>
            <p>We analyze a new Rydberg gate design based on the original $\pi-2\pi-\pi$ protocol [Jaksch, et. al. Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 85}, 2208 (2000)] that is modified to enable high fidelity operation without requiring a strong Rydberg interaction. The gate retains the $\pi-2\pi-\pi$ structure with an additional detuning added to the $2\pi$ pulse on the target qubit. The protocol reaches within a factor of 2.39 (1.68) of the fundamental fidelity limit set by Rydberg lifetime for equal (asymmetric) Rabi frequencies on the control and target qubits. We generalize the gate protocol to arbitrary controlled phases. We design optimal target-qubit phase waveforms to generalize the gate across a range of interaction strengths and we find that, within this family of gates, the constant-phase protocol is time-optimal for a fixed laser Rabi frequency and tunable interaction strength. Robust control methods are used to design gates that are robust against variations in Rydberg Rabi frequency or interaction strength.</p>

            <h2>Symmetry-Preserving Variational Quantum Simulation of the Heisenberg Spin Chain on Noisy Quantum Hardware</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rudraksh Sharma</p>
            <p>Variational quantum algorithms are among the most promising approaches for simulating interacting quantum many-body systems on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. However, the practical success of variational quantum eigensolvers (VQE) critically depends on the structure of the chosen variational ansatz. In this work, we investigate the ground-state properties of the one-dimensional antiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin-1/2 chain using both generic hardware-efficient ansatz and physics-informed, symmetry-preserving variational circuits. We benchmark variational results against exact diagonalization and noiseless simulations, and subsequently validate the approach on real IQM Garnet quantum hardware. Our results demonstrate that incorporating physical symmetries into the circuit design leads to significantly improved energy estimates, enhanced robustness against hardware noise, and clearer convergence behavior when compared to hardware-efficient ansatz under identical resource constraints. These findings highlight the importance of problem specific ansatz construction for reliable quantum simulations in the NISQ era.</p>

            <h2>Emergence of nonclassical radiation in strongly laser-driven quantum systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ivan Gonoskov, Christian Hünecke, Stefanie Gräfe</p>
            <p>Nonclassical light sources are central to emerging quantum technologies, yet current platforms offer limited tunability and typically operate at low photon numbers. In parallel, strong-field physics provides widely tunable, bright coherent radiation through high-order harmonic generation (HHG), but its quantum optical character has remained largely unexplained. While recent experiments have revealed signatures of entanglement, squeezing, and quantum-state modification in both the driving and generated fields, a unified theoretical framework capable of identifying the origin and controllability of these effects has been missing. Here we introduce a fully quantum, analytically tractable theory of intense light-matter interaction that rigorously captures the emergence of nonclassicality in HHG. Our approach employs a parametric factorization of the coupled electron-field system into a driven electronic state and a dynamically perturbed quantum optical field, derived directly from the time-dependent Schrödinger equation without requiring conditioning, homodyne detection, or mode-selection techniques. We show how quantum correlations, squeezing, and Wigner-function negativity arise intrinsically from the interaction dynamics, and we identify the precise conditions under which specific nonclassical features are amplified or suppressed. The theory enables predictive design of bright, high-photon-number quantum states at tunable frequencies, and we demonstrate its utility by outlining realistic conditions for generating bright nonclassical ultraviolet light. Our results establish a comprehensive foundation for strong-field quantum optics and open new avenues toward tabletop quantum light sources for sensing, communication, and photonic quantum information processing.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Metrology via Adiabatic Control of Topological Edge States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xingjian He, Aoqian Shi, Jianjun Liu, Jiangbin Gong</p>
            <p>Criticality-based quantum sensing exploits hypersensitive response to system parameters near phase transition points. This work uncovers two metrological advantages offered by topological phase transitions when the probe is prepared as topological edge states. Firstly, the order of topological band touching is found to determine how the metrology sensitivity scales with the system size. Engineering a topological phase transition with higher-order band touching is hence advocated, with the associated quantum Fisher information scaling as $ \mathcal{F}_Q \sim L^{2p}$, with $L$ the lattice size in one dimension, and $p$ the order of band touching. Secondly, with a topological lattice accommodating degenerate edge modes (such as multiple zero modes), preparing an $N$-particle entangled state at the edge and then adiabatically tuning the system to the phase transition point grows quantum entanglement to macroscopic sizes, yielding $\mathcal{F}_Q \sim N^2 L^{2p}$. This work hence paves a possible topological phase transition-based route to harness entanglement, large lattice size, and high-order band touching for quantum metrology.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ido Fridman, Shemuel Sternklar, Eliran Talker</p>
            <p>We investigated experimentally and theoretically a cavity-free microwave field that couples the two ground states of a {\Lambda}-type atomic system, thereby forming a closed {\Delta} configuration. In this regime, the absence of cavity-imposed phase matching leads to a strong sensitivity of the ground-state coherence to the microwave field parameters. We observe that the coherent population trapping (CPT) resonance exhibits a pronounced dependence on the microwave power and detuning, resulting in measurable changes in resonance contrast, linewidth, and center frequency. To explain these effects, we develop a numerical density-matrix model in which the ground-state coherence explicitly incorporates the microwave coupling strength, capturing the essential physics of this no-phase-matching {\Delta} system. The excellent agreement between theory and experiment establishes a simple and robust framework for microwave control of cavity-free {\Delta}-type atomic systems, with direct implications for compact atomic clocks and quantum-enhanced quantum sensing platforms.</p>

            <p>The van der Waals interaction between neutral atoms is typically studied using stationary perturbation theory for the short-distance (London) limit, while long-distance (Casimir-Polder) results are usually derived via semiclassical, time-dependent approaches. In this pedagogical article, we demonstrate that reformulating stationary perturbation theory calculations in terms of time-ordered correlation functions significantly simplifies the mathematical treatment. This reformulation is particularly advantageous for higher-order calculations required in the long-distance regime, where retardation effects become important. Our approach provides a unified framework that connects both limiting cases while offering a clear conceptual picture suitable for advanced quantum mechanics courses.</p>

            <p>Linearly polarized projections are the tacit means for performing Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) Bell-inequality tests using polarization-entangled photon pairs. The inequality is valid for all states on the Poincaré-Bloch sphere, but few laboratory studies have investigated violations with the full sphere. In this article, we explore the experimental verifications of the predicted violations of the CHSH inequality with Bell and non-Bell states with same and different linear and elliptically polarized basis states for each photon. We find that Bell states violate CHSH when using the same basis for both photons, regardless of their ellipticity, whereas they show no violations for photon projections in different bases. We found non-Bell maximally-entangled states for which the converse is true.</p>

            <p>The study of quantum correlations within relativistic spacetimes, and the consequences of relativistic causality on information processing using such correlations, has gained much attention in recent years. In this paper, we establish a unified framework in the form of operational no-signalling constraints to study both nonlocal and temporal correlations within general relativistic spacetimes. We explore several intriguing consequences arising from our framework. Firstly, we show that the violation of the operational no-signalling constraints in Minkowski spacetime implies either a logical paradox or an operational infringement of Poincaré symmetry. We thereby examine and subvert recent claims in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 110401 (2022)] on the possibility of witnessing operationally detectable causal loops in Minkowski spacetime. Secondly, we explore the possibility of jamming of nonlocal correlations, controverting a recent claim in [Nat. Comm. 16, 269 (2025)] that a physical mechanism for jamming would necessarily lead to superluminal signalling. Finally, we show that in black hole spacetimes certain nonlocal correlations under and across the event horizon can be jammed by any agent without spoiling the operational no-signalling constraints.</p>

            <p>Divalent atoms have emerged as powerful alternatives to alkalis in ultracold atom platforms, offering unique advantages arising from their two-electron structure. Among these species, ytterbium (Yb) is especially promising, yet its anionic properties and its Rydberg spectrum remain comparatively unexplored. In this work, we perform a first and comprehensive experimental and theoretical investigation of ultralong-range Rydberg molecules (ULRMs) of $^{174}$Yb in $6sns\,^1S_0$ Rydberg states across nearly two decades in principal quantum number $n$ and three orders of magnitude in molecular binding energy. Using the Coulomb Green's function formalism, we compute Born-Oppenheimer molecular potentials describing the Rydberg atom in the presence of a ground-state perturber and achieve quantitative agreement with high-resolution molecular spectra. This enables the extraction of low-energy electron-Yb scattering phase shifts, including the zero-energy $s$-wave scattering length and the positions of two spin-orbit split $p$-wave shape resonances. Our results provide strong evidence that the Yb$^{-}$ anion exists only as a metastable resonance. We additionally show the sensitivity of ULRM spectra to the atomic quantum defects, using this to refine the value for the $6s23f\, ^1F_3$ quantum defect. Together, these findings establish Yb ULRMs as a powerful probe of electron-Yb interactions and lay essential groundwork for future Rydberg experiments with divalent atoms.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate a three-dimensional magneto-optical trap (MOT) of a metal hydride molecule, CaH. We are able to scatter $\sim$$10^{4}$ photons with vibrational loss covered up to vibrational quantum number $\nu=2$. This allows us to laser slow the molecular beam near zero velocity with a "white-light" technique and subsequently load it into a radio-frequency MOT. The MOT contains 230(40) molecules, limited by beam source characteristics and predissociative loss of CaH. The temperature of the MOT is below one millikelvin. The predissociative loss mechanism could, in turn, facilitate controlled dissociation of the molecule, offering a possible route to optical trapping of hydrogen atoms for precision spectroscopy.</p>

            <h2>Determinism and Indeterminism as Model Artefacts: Toward a Model-Invariant Ontology of Physics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Nolland</p>
            <p>This paper argues that the traditional opposition between determinism and indeterminism in physics is representational rather than ontological. Deterministic--stochastic dualities are available in principle, and arise in a non-contrived way in many scientifically important models. When dynamical systems admit mathematically equivalent deterministic and stochastic formulations, their observable predictions depend only on the induced structure of correlations between preparations and measurement outcomes. I use this model-equivalence to motivate a model-invariance criterion for ontological commitment, according to which only structural features that remain stable across empirically equivalent representations, and whose physical effects are invariant under such reformulations, are candidates for realism. This yields a fallibilist form of structural realism grounded in modal robustness rather than in the specifics of any given mathematical representation. Features such as conservation laws, symmetries, and causal or metric structure satisfy this criterion and can be encoded in observable relations in mathematically intelligible ways. By contrast, the localisation of modal selection -- whether in initial conditions, stochastic outcomes, or informational collapse mechanisms -- is not invariant under empirically equivalent reformulations and is therefore best understood as a gauge choice rather than an ontological feature. The resulting framework explains how certain long-standing problems in the foundations of physics, including the measurement problem and the perceived conflict between physical determinism and free agency, arise from the reification of representational artefacts. By distinguishing model-invariant structure from modelling conventions, I offer a realist ontology for modern physics that combines empirical openness with resistance to metaphysical overreach.</p>

            <p>A massless scalar field in two spacetime dimensions splits into two independent sectors of left and right-moving modes on the light cone. At the quantum level, these two sectors carry a representation of the group of affine transformations of the real line, with translations corresponding to transformations generated by light-cone momenta and dilations given by light-cone Rindler momenta formed by a linear combination of generators of boosts and dilations. One-particle states for inertial observers are eigenvectors of translation generators belonging to irreducible representations of the affine group. Rindler one-particle states are related to eigenfunctions of the generator of dilations. We show that simple manipulations connecting these two representations involving the Mellin transform can be used to derive the thermal spectrum of Rindler particles observed by an accelerated observer. Beyond providing a representation-theoretic basis for vacuum thermal effects, our results suggest that analogous phenomena may arise in any quantum system admitting realizations of translation and dilation eigenstates.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we introduce "the Schrödinger plate." This is an infinite two-dimensional linear micro-polar elastic medium, with out-of-plane degrees of freedom, lying on a linear elastic foundation of a special kind. Any free motion of the plate can be corresponded to a solution of the two-dimensional Schrödinger equation for a single particle in the external potential field $V$. The specific dependence of the potential $V$ on the position is taken into account in the properties of the plate elastic foundation. The governing equations of the plate are derived as equations of the two-dimensional constraint Cosserat continuum using the direct approach. The plate dynamics can be described by the classical Germain-Lagrange equation for a plate, but the strain energy is different from the one used in the classical Kirchhoff-Love plate theory. Namely, the Schrödinger plate cannot be imagined as a thin elastic body composed of an isotropic linear material. The main property of the Schrödinger plate is as follows: the mechanical energy propagates in the plate exactly in the same way as the probability density propagates according to the corresponding Schrödinger equation.</p>

            <p>We introduce generalisations of von Neumann entanglement entropy that are invariant with respect to certain scale transformations. These constructions are based on Unit-Invariant Singular Value Decomposition (UISVD) with its right-, left-, and bi-invariant incarnations, which itself are variations of the standard Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) that remain invariant under (appropriate set of) diagonal transformations. These measures are naturally defined for non-Hermitian or rectangular operators and remain useful when the input and output spaces possess different dimensions or metric weights. We apply the UISVD entropy and discuss its advantages in the physically interesting framework of Biorthogonal Quantum Mechanics, whose important aspect is indeed the behavior under scale transformations. Further, we illustrate features of UISVD-based entropies in other representative settings, from simple quantum mechanical bipartite states to random matrices relevant to quantum chaos and holography, and in the context of Chern-Simons theory. In all cases, the UISVD yields stable, physically meaningful entropic spectra that are invariant under rescalings and normalisations.</p>

            <p>In the present study, we apply shortcut to adiabaticity pulses (time-dependent Rabi frequency and detuning) for the efficient population transfer from the ground to the exciton state in a GaAs/InGaAs quantum dot with phonon-induced dephasing. We use the time-evolving matrix product operator (TEMPO) method to propagate system in time and find that, for temperatures below $ 20 \ \text{K} $ and pulse duration up to $ 10 \ \text{ps} $, a very good transfer efficiency is obtained in general. We explain these results using a Bloch-like equation derived from a generalized Lindblad equation, which adequately describes system dynamics at lower temperatures. For higher temperatures, the transfer efficiency is significantly reduced except for subpicosecond pulses, where the shortcut Rabi frequency reduces to a delta pulse attaining a fast population inversion. The present work is expected to find application in quantum technologies which exploit quantum dots for single-photon generation on demand.</p>

            <p>We introduce a conceptual reformulation of the Mott-Berezinskiĭ (MB) theory of low-frequency AC conductivity in disordered systems based on localization landscape theory. Instead of assuming uniform localization and fixed hopping distances, transport is described through an effective potential whose geometry encodes the spatial organization and energy-dependent localization of quantum states. Using the associated Agmon metric, we define a generalized Mott scale that replaces the classical hopping length with a geometric criterion set by the disorder landscape. This framework naturally incorporates strong spatial inhomogeneity and yields the AC conductivity directly from the effective potential. The standard MB result is recovered as a limiting case. Our approach extends the conceptual foundation of MB theory to arbitrary disordered media and energies approaching the mobility edge, providing a unified description of AC transport in complex quantum materials.</p>

A defining feature is their gate-tunable Josephson coupling, enabling superconducting qubit architectures with full electric-field control and offering a path toward scalable, low-crosstalk quantum processors. This approach seeks to merge benefits of superconducting and semiconductor qubits, for instance by encoding quantum information in the spin of a quasiparticle occupying an Andreev bound state, thus combining long coherence times with fast, flexible control. Progress has accelerated through bottom-up engineering of Andreev states in coupled quantum dot arrays, leading to architectures such as minimal Kitaev chains hosting Majorana zero modes. In parallel, Hamiltonian-protected designs aim to enhance resilience against local noise and decoherence by exploiting superconducting phase dynamics and discrete charge or flux degrees of freedom. This article reviews recent theoretical and experimental advances in hybrid qubits, providing an overview of physical mechanisms, device implementations, and emerging architectures, with emphasis on their potential for (topologically) protected quantum information processing.

            <p>Adiabatic topological pumping promises robust transport of energy and information, but its speed is fundamentally limited by the instantaneous adiabatic condition, which demands prohibitively slow parameter variations. Here we develop a paradigm shift from instantaneous to global adiabaticity. We derive a global adiabatic criterion (GAC), which sets an absolute fidelity bound by controlling the root-mean-square value of nonadiabaticity factor. We further introduce a fluctuation-suppression acceleration criterion, which minimizes spatial inhomogeneity and allows us to safely increase the mean nonadiabaticity. Experimentally, we implement this principle in femtosecond-laser-written photonic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger waveguide arrays via scalable power-law coupling modulation. Our accelerated topological pumping achieves >0.95 fidelity over a fivefold reduced device length compared to the conventional scheme, exhibits the predicted linear scaling with the system size, and maintains robust performance across a >400 nm bandwidth. This principle of GAC provides a universal design rule for fast, compact, and robust adiabatic devices across quantum and classical topological platforms.</p>

The periodic strain dynamically modulates the $g$-tensor matrix and causes fast spin rotation under a small acoustic amplitude. Moreover, we show a strong anisotropy and confinement dependence of the Rabi frequency coming from the phase-shifted longitudinal and shear strain components.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saranesh Prembabu, Shu-Heng Shao, Ruben Verresen</p>
            <p>Gapless quantum phases can become distinct when internal symmetries are enforced, in analogy with gapped symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. However, this distinction does not always lead to protected edge modes, raising the question of how the bulk-boundary correspondence is generalized to gapless cases. We propose that the spatial interface between gapless phases -- rather than their boundaries -- provides a more robust fingerprint. We show that whenever two 1+1d conformal field theories (CFTs) differ in symmetry charge assignments of local operators or twisted sectors, any symmetry-preserving spatial interface between the theories must flow to a non-invertible defect. We illustrate this general result for different versions of the Ising CFT with $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2^T$ symmetry, obtaining a complete classification of allowed conformal interfaces. When the Ising CFTs differ by nonlocal operator charges, the interface hosts 0+1d symmetry-breaking phases with finite-size splittings scaling as $1/L^3$, as well as continuous phase transitions between them. For general gapless phases differing by an SPT entangler, the interfaces between them can be mapped to conformal defects with a certain defect 't Hooft anomaly. This classification also gives implications for higher-dimensional examples, including symmetry-enriched variants of the 2+1d Ising CFT. Our results establish a physical indicator for symmetry-enriched criticality through symmetry-protected interfaces, giving a new handle on the interplay between topology and gapless phases.</p>

            <p>Fermi's golden rule (FGR) serves as the basis for many expressions of spectroscopic observables and quantum transition rates. The utility of FGR has been demonstrated through decades of experimental confirmation. However, there still remain important cases where the evaluation of a FGR rate is ambiguous or ill-defined. Examples are cases where the rate has divergent terms due to the sparsity in the density of final states or time dependent fluctuations of system Hamiltonians. Strictly speaking, assumptions of FGR are no longer valid for such cases. However, it is still possible to define modified FGR rate expressions that are useful as effective rates. The resulting modified FGR rate expressions resolve a long standing ambiguity often encountered in using FGR and offer more reliable ways to model general rate processes. Simple model calculations illustrate the utility and implications of new rate expressions.</p>

            <h2>Error and Disturbance as Irreversibility with Applications: Unified Definition, Wigner--Araki--Yanase Theorem and Out-of-Time-Order Correlator</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haruki Emori, Hiroyasu Tajima</p>
            <p>Defining an error of measurement has long been a foundational problem in science: even in classical experiments, data are statistical and admit no single universally optimal definition of error. In quantum mechanics, the challenge deepens: observed entities often lack preexisting definite values, and the act of measurement unavoidably disturbs the system of interest. Consequently, both error and disturbance must be quantified, and various definitions have been proposed to date. However, a unified perspective for understanding the differences and similarities among these diverse definitions of error and disturbance, and an operational framework for distinguishing between them, remain elusive. In this Letter, we propose a novel framework for defining error and disturbance using irreversibility. Our framework converts the error and disturbance of a quantum measurement of a system under consideration into the irreversibility of an ancillary qubit system, using a quantum comb composed of loss and recovery processes. The mechanism enables us to make the operational distinction that error uses the classical outputs, while disturbance uses the quantum outputs of the measurement in the recovery process. Furthermore, our framework yields several key consequences: (i) it encompasses existing definitions, (ii) it establishes a universal constraint on error and disturbance defined by any measure of an arbitrary quantum process under a conservation law, and (iii) it reveals an operational connection between irreversibility and the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC), a metric of quantum chaos. It also provides a constraint on the OTOC under a conservation law and a method for its experimental evaluation, which is demonstrated on a quantum processor.</p>

            <h2>Floquet control of interactions and edge states in a programmable quantum simulator</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Or Katz, Lei Feng, Diego Porras, Christopher Monroe</p>
            <p>Quantum simulators based on trapped ions enable the study of spin systems and models with rich dynamical phenomena. The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model for fermions in one dimension is a canonical example that can support a topological insulator phase when couplings between sites are dimerized, featuring long-lived edge states. Here, we experimentally implement a spin-based variant of the SSH model using one-dimensional trapped-ion chains with tunable interaction range, realized in crystals containing up to 22 interacting spins. Using an array of individually focused laser beams, we apply site-specific, time-dependent Floquet fields to induce controlled bond dimerization. Under conditions that preserve inversion symmetry, we observe edge-state dynamics consistent with SSH-like behavior. We study the propagation and localization of spin excitations, as well as the evolution of highly excited configurations across different interaction regimes. These results demonstrate how precision Floquet engineering enables the exploration of complex spin models and dynamics, laying the groundwork for future preparation and characterization of topological and exotic phases of matter.</p>

            <h2>A simple fourth order propagator based on the Magnus expansion in the Liouville space: Application to a $Λ$-system and assessment of the rotating wave approximation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Taner M. Ture, Changbong Hyeon, Seogjoo J. Jang</p>
            <p>A simple 4th order propagator [Ture and Jang, {\it J. Phys. Chem. A.} {\bf 128}, 2871 (2024)] based on the Magnus expansion (ME) is extended to the Liouville space for both closed-system and Lindbladian open-system quantum dynamics. For both dynamics, commutator free versions of 4th order propagators are provided as well. These propagators are then applied to the dynamics of a driven $\Lambda$-system, where Lindblad terms represent the effect of a photonic bath. For both dynamics, the accuracy of the rotating wave approximation (RWA) for the matter-radiation interaction is assessed. We confirmed reasonable performance of RWA for weak and resonant fields. However, small errors appear for moderate fields and substantial errors can be found for strong fields where coherent population trapping can still be expected. We also found that the presence of bath for open system quantum dynamics consistently reduces the errors of the RWA. These results provide a quantitative information on how the RWA breaks down beyond weak field or for non-resonant cases. Major results are benchmarked against results of our 6th order ME-based propagator. We also provide numerical comparison of our algorithms with other 4th order algorithms for the $\Lambda$-system. These confirm reasonable performance of our simple propagators and the improvement gained through commutator-free expressions.</p>

            <h2>Quantum-Classical Hybrid Algorithm for Solving the Learning-With-Errors Problem on NISQ Devices</h2>

            <p>The Learning-With-Errors (LWE) problem is a fundamental computational challenge with implications for post-quantum cryptography and computational learning theory. Here we propose a quantum-classical hybrid algorithm with Ising model to address LWE, transforming it into the Shortest Vector Problem and using variable qubits to encode lattice vectors into an Ising Hamiltonian. By identifying low-energy Hamiltonian levels, the solution is extracted, making the method suitable for noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. The required number of qubits is less than $m(m+1)$, where $m$ is the number of samples. Our heuristic algorithm's time complexity depends on the specific quantum eigensolver used to find low-energy levels, and the performance when using the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm is investigated. We validate the algorithm by solving a $2$-dimensional LWE problem on a $5$-qubit quantum device, demonstrating its potential for solving meaningful LWE instances on near-term quantum devices.</p>

            <h2>Motion-driven quantum dissipation in an open electronic system with nonlocal interaction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Feiyi Liu, Min Guo, Mingyang Liu, Ruanjing Zhang, Yang Wang</p>
            <p>In this paper, we study excitations and dissipation in two infinite parallel metallic plates undergoing relative motion. The degrees of freedom of the electrons in both plates are modeled using the 1+2 dimensional Dirac field, and a nonlocal potential is selected to describe the interaction between the two plates. The internal relative motion is introduced via a Galilean boost, with one plate assumed to slide relative to the other. We then calculate the effective action of the system and derive the vacuum occupation number in momentum space using a perturbative method. Numerical plots reveal that the vacuum occupation number, as a function of momentum, is isotropic for a motion speed $v = 0$ and anisotropic for nonzero $v$. The relative motion induces energy transfer between the plates, leading to on-shell excitations in a manner analogous to the dissipative process of the Schwinger effect. Consequently, we study the motion-induced dissipation effects and the dissipative forces through the quantum action. Numerical results demonstrate that both the imaginary part of the quantum action due to the motion boost and the dissipative force exhibit a threshold as functions of $v$, and both are positively correlated with $v$.</p>

            <h2>Nearly query-optimal classical shadow estimation of unitary channels</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zihao Li, Changhao Yi, You Zhou, Huangjun Zhu</p>
            <p>Classical shadow estimation (CSE) is a powerful tool for learning the properties of quantum states and quantum processes. Here we consider the CSE task for quantum unitary channels. By querying an unknown unitary channel $\mathcal{U}$ multiple times in quantum experiments, the goal is to learn a classical description from which one can accurately predict many different linear properties of the channel, i.e., the expectation values of arbitrary observables measured on the output of $\mathcal{U}$ upon arbitrary input states. Based on collective measurements on multiple systems, we propose a query efficient protocol for this task, whose query complexity has a quadratic advantage over the previous best approach for this problem, and almost saturates the information-theoretic lower bound. To further enhance practicality, we also present a variant protocol using only single-copy measurements, which still offers much better query performance than previous protocols that do not use quantum memory, and can serve as a key subroutine for learning an arbitrary unknown Hamiltonian from dynamics. In addition to linear properties of unitary channels, our protocol can also be applied to simultaneously predict many non-linear properties, such as out-of-time-ordered correlators.</p>

            <p>We systematically investigate the interplay of disorder and time-homogeneous collisional noise in shaping the transport dynamics of an anisotropic XXZ spin chain. Using stochastic collision models to simulate interaction with the environment, we explore the localization-delocalization transitions across regimes with single and multiple excitations. We find that space-homogeneous and low-rate collisions can shape regions where localization sets in the form of subsequent plateaus. The localization process has universal features for the plateaus duration and the delocalization time. Interactions among the excitations favor this process even for tiniest disorder levels. Our findings can be applied to design stroboscopic protocols where sequences of transport and localization can be tailored. We establish relevant connections to noise-engineering of quantum devices in noisy intermediate-scale quantum simulators platforms, and to realistic biological systems where noise and disorder coexist.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Simone Ausilio, Fausto Borgonovi, Giuseppe Luca Celardo, Jorge Yago Malo, Maria Luisa Chiofalo</p>
            <p>Complex quantum networks are powerful tools in the modeling of transport phenomena, particularly for biological systems, and enable the study of emergent phenomena in many-body quantum systems. High connectivity and long-range interactions induce strong constraints on the system dynamics. Here, we study the transport properties of a quantum network described by the paradigmatic XXZ Hamiltonian, with non-trivial graph connectivity and topology, and long-range interactions. We show how long-range interactions induce memory preserving effects and strongly affect the spreading of the excitations due to cooperative shielding. We describe the memory-preserving effect in all-to-all connected regular networks with distance-independent couplings. Indeed, the memory of the number of initially injected excitations is preserved over long times, encoded in the number of frequencies present in the dynamics. Interestingly, we find that memory-preserving effects occur also in less regular graphs, such as quantum networks with either power-law node connectivity or complex, small-world type, architectures. We discuss the implications of these properties in biology-related problems, such as an application to Weber's law in neuroscience, and their implementation in specific quantum technologies via biomimicry. We also show how the presence of long-range interaction strongly affects the dynamics of the excitations in small-world networks and power law all-to-all coupled networks. Indeed, because of cooperative shielding blue, as the connectivity or the range of interaction increases, the initial excitation spreads more slowly among the network and becomes strongly dependent on the initial conditions.</p>

            <p>Preparing Gibbs states, which describe systems in equilibrium at finite temperature, is of great importance, particularly at low temperatures. In this work, we propose a new method-- TEPID-ADAPT-- that prepares the thermal Gibbs state of a given Hamiltonian at low temperatures using a variational method that is partially adaptive and uses a purification with a minimal number of ancillary qubits. We also present an alternative implementation without ancillary qubits. A key technical innovation here is to use a mixed-state ansatz where the entropy can be efficiently calculated, with no computational overhead. Our algorithm uses a truncated, parametrized eigenspectrum of the Hamiltonian. Beyond preparing Gibbs states, this approach also straightforwardly gives us access to the truncated low-energy eigenspectrum of the Hamiltonian, making it also a method that prepares excited states simultaneously. As a result of this, we are also able to prepare thermal states at any lower temperature of the same Hamiltonian without further optimization.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuichi Otsuka, Kazuhiro Seki, Seiji Yunoki</p>
            <p>We propose that the quantum conditional mutual information (QCMI), computed with a suitably chosen partition of the system, serves as a powerful probe for detecting measurement-induced entanglement phase transitions in monitored quantum circuits. To demonstrate this, we investigate monitored variable-range Clifford circuits and identify the phase boundary between volume-law and area-law entanglement phases by performing finite-size scaling analyses of the QCMI. Assuming that the entanglement entropy exhibits a logarithmic dependence on system size at criticality in short-range interacting cases, we further show that the QCMI allows for the simultaneous determination of both the critical point and the universal coefficient of the logarithmic term in the entanglement entropy via a crossing-point analysis. For the shortest-range interacting case studied, we obtain the thermodynamic-limit value of the coefficient as $\tilde{c}=1.519(3)$, which is significantly smaller than values reported in previous studies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haimeng Zhao, Yuzhen Zhang, John Preskill</p>
            <p>The energy cost of erasing quantum states depends on our knowledge of the states. We show that learning algorithms can acquire such knowledge to erase many copies of an unknown state at the optimal energy cost. This is proved by showing that learning can be made fully reversible and has no fundamental energy cost itself. With simple counting arguments, we relate the energy cost of erasing quantum states to their complexity, entanglement, and magic. We further show that the constructed erasure protocol is computationally efficient when learning is efficient. Conversely, under standard cryptographic assumptions, we prove that the optimal energy cost cannot be achieved efficiently in general. These results also enable efficient work extraction based on learning. Together, our results establish a concrete connection between quantum learning theory and thermodynamics, highlighting the physical significance of learning processes and enabling provably-efficient learning-based protocols for thermodynamic tasks.</p>

            <p>The $n$-time correlation function is pivotal for establishing connections between theoretical predictions and experimental observations of a quantum system. Conventional methods for computing $n$-time correlation functions on quantum computers, such as the Hadamard test, generally require an ancilla qubit that controls the entire system -- an approach that poses challenges for digital quantum devices with limited qubit connectivity, as well as for analog quantum platforms lacking controlled operations. Here, we introduce a method to compute $n$-time correlation functions using only unitary evolutions on the system of interest, thereby eliminating the need for ancillas and the control operations. This approach substantially relaxes hardware connectivity requirements for digital processors and enables more practical measurements of $n$-time correlation functions on analog platforms. We demonstrate our protocol on IBM quantum hardware up to 12 qubits to measure the single-particle spectrum of the Schwinger model and the out-of-time-order correlator in the transverse-field Ising model. In the demonstration, we further introduce an error mitigation procedure based on signal processing that integrates signal filtering and correlation analysis, and successfully reproduces the noiseless simulation results from the noisy hardware. Our work highlights a route to exploring complex quantum many-body correlation functions in practice, even in the presence of realistic hardware limitations and noise.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xie-Hang Yu, Wen Wei Ho, Pavel Kos</p>
            <p>We introduce the notion of the mixed state projected ensemble (MSPE), a collection of mixed states describing a local region of a quantum many-body system, conditioned upon measurements of the complementary region which are incomplete. This constitutes a generalization of the pure state projected ensemble in which measurements are assumed ideal and complete, and which has been shown to tend towards limiting pure state distributions depending only on symmetries of the system, thus representing a new kind of universality in quantum equilibration dubbed deep thermalization. We study the MSPE generated by solvable (1+1)d dual-unitary quantum circuit evolution, and identify the limiting mixed state distributions which emerge at late times depending on the size of the incomplete measurement, which we assume to be lossy, finding that they correspond to certain random density matrix ensembles known in the literature. We also derive the rate of the emergence of such universality. Furthermore, we investigate the quantum information properties of the states composing the ensemble, specifically their capacity to teleport quantum information between the ends of the system. The teleportation fidelity is upper bounded by the quantum conditional entropy, which we find exhibits a sharp transition from zero to maximal when the number of measurements lost matches of that the number of degrees of freedom to be teleported. Our results initiate the first investigation of deep thermalization for mixed state ensembles, which are relevant for present-day quantum simulation experiments wherein measurements are typically not perfect, and also amount to a physical and natural way of sampling from hitherto abstract random density matrix ensembles.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Malte Pütz, Romain Vasseur, Andreas W.W. Ludwig, Simon Trebst, Guo-Yi Zhu</p>
            <p>In circuit-based quantum state preparation, qubit loss and coherent errors are circuit imperfections that imperil the formation of long-range entanglement beyond a certain threshold. The critical theory at the threshold is a continuous entanglement transition known to be described by a (2+0)-dimensional non-unitary conformal field theory which, for the two types of imperfections of certain circuits, is described by either percolation or Nishimori criticality, respectively. Here we study the threshold behavior when the two types of errors simultaneously occur and show that, when moving away from the Clifford-regime of projective stabilizer measurements, the percolation critical point becomes unstable and the critical theory flows to Nishimori universality. We track this critical renormalization group (RG) crossover flow by mapping out the entanglement phase diagrams, parametrized by the probability and strength of random weak measurements, of two dual protocols preparing surface code or GHZ-class cat states from a parent cluster state via constant-depth circuits. Extensive numerical simulations, using hybrid Gaussian fermion and tensor network / Monte Carlo sampling techniques on systems with more than a million qubits, demonstrate that an infinitesimal deviation from the Clifford regime leads to a sudden, strongly non-monotonic entanglement growth at the incipient non-unitary RG flow. We argue that spectra of scaling dimensions of both the percolation and Nishimori fixed points exhibit multifractality. For percolation, we provide the exact (non-quadratic) multifractal spectrum of exponents, while for the Nishimori fixed point we show high-precision numerical results for five leading exponents characterizing multifractality.</p>

            <p>Telecom wavelength quantum dots (QDs) are emerging as a promising solution for generating deterministic single photons compatible with existing fiber optic infrastructure. Emission in the low loss C band minimizes transmission losses, making them ideal for long distance quantum communication. In this work, we present a demonstration of both Stark tuning and charge state control of individual InAs/InP QDs operating within the telecom C-band. These QDs are grown by droplet epitaxy and embedded in an InP based n++-i-n+ heterostructure fabricated using MOVPE. The gated architecture enables the tuning of emission energy via the quantum confined Stark effect, with a tuning range exceeding 2.4 nm. It also allows for control over the QD charge occupancy, enabling access to multiple discrete excitonic states. Electrical tuning of the fine structure splitting is further demonstrated, opening a route to entangled photon pair generation at telecom wavelengths. The single photon character is confirmed via second order correlation measurements. These advances enable QDs to be tuned into resonance with other systems, such as cavity modes and emitters, marking a critical step toward scalable, fiber compatible quantum photonic devices.</p>

The charging dynamics of these systems are examined using Hamiltonians that include contributions from the battery, spin spin interactions, and a transverse magnetic field. Incorporating the Dzyaloshinskii Moriya interaction into the charging Hamiltonian is found to enhance the ergotropy in the XXZ model, particularly for the supercube configuration, thereby improving quantum battery performance. To explore the role of structural variations, we extend our study to c regular graphs with system sizes ranging from 3 to 12 qubits, including highly symmetric geometries such as the tetrahedron, octahedron, and icosahedron. These analyzes reveal that such symmetric structures retain ideal sinusoidal charging discharging behavior when DMI is tuned appropriately, establishing symmetry and coordination as key principles for scalable quantum battery architectures.</p>

            <p>Quantifying the complexity of quantum states that possess intrinsic structure, such as symmetry or encoding, in a fair manner constitutes a core challenge in the benchmarking of quantum technologies. This paper introduces the Reference-Contingent Complexity (RCC), an information-theoretic measure calibrated by the available quantum operations. The core idea is to leverage the quantum relative entropy to quantify the deviation of a quantum state from its "structured vacuum"-namely, the maximum entropy state within its constrained subspace-thereby only pricing the process of creating non-trivial information. Our central result is a key theorem that rigorously proves the RCC serves as a lower bound for the complexity of any universal quantum circuit. This lower bound is comprised of a linear dominant term, a universal logarithmic correction, and a precise physical correction term that accounts for non-uniformity in the spectral distribution. Crucially, we establish a set of operational protocols, grounded in tasks like quantum hypothesis testing, which make this theoretical lower bound experimentally "auditable." This work provides a "ruler" for quantum technology that is structure-fair and enables cross-platform comparison, thereby establishing a strictly verifiable constraint between the computational cost of the process and the structured information of the final state.</p>

            <p>Measurement-only (quantum) circuit (MoC) gives possibility to realize the states with rich entanglements, topological orders and quantum memories. This work studies the MoC, in which the projective-measurement operators consist of stabilizers of the toric code and competitive local Pauli operators. The former correspond to terms of the toric code on a triangular lattice and the later to external magnetic and electric fields. We employ efficient numerical stabilizer algorithm to trace evolving states undergoing phase transitions. We elucidate the phase diagram of the MoC system with the observables such as, topological entanglement entropy (TEE), disorder parameters of 1-form symmetries and emergent logical operators. We clarify the locations of the phase transitions through the observation of the above quantities and obtain precise critical exponents to examine if the observables exhibit the critical behavior simultaneously under the MoC and transitions belong to the same universality class. In contrast to the TC Hamiltonian system and toric code MoC on a square lattice, the system on the triangular lattice is not self-dual nor bipartite, and then, coincidence by symmetries, such as critical behaviors across the TC and Higgs/confined phase, does not takes place. Then, the toric code MoC on the triangular lattice provides us a suitable playground to clarify the mutual relationship between the TEE, spontaneous symmetry breaking of the 1-form symmetries, and emergence of logical operators. Obtained results indicate that toric code MoC on the triangular lattice exhibits a few distinct phase transitions with different location and critical exponents, and some of them are closely related with the two-dimensional percolation transition.</p>

            <p>We introduce a method called resolution refinement that allows one to bootstrap eigenstate preparation on a quantum computer. We first prepare an eigenstate of a low-resolution Hamiltonian using any method of choice. The eigenstate is then lifted to higher resolution and adiabatically evolved to produce the corresponding eigenstate of a higher-fidelity Hamiltonian. We give examples of resolution refinement applied to both single-particle basis states as well as a spatial lattice grid. For basis refinement, we compute few-body ground states of the Busch model for interacting particles in a harmonic trap in one dimension. For lattice refinement, we compute Hartree-Fock nuclear states for a central Woods-Saxon potential in three dimensions, and we compute bound states and continuum states in a multi-species Hubbard model of fermions in one dimension. In all cases, the method is efficient and requires an adiabatic evolution time that scales with the inverse of the energy gap times the square root of the system size. We show that this very favorable scaling arises from the fact that resolution refinement does not make large changes to the structure or energies of the low-energy eigenstates.</p>

            <h2>Beyond Single-Device Constraints: A System-Level Theoretical Framework for High-Performance Single-Photon Detection at Room Temperature</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hao Shu</p>
            <p>Photon detection, a fundamental quantum technology, is traditionally treated as a fixed device-level operation governed by intrinsic properties of single-photon detectors (SPDs). High-performance detection has therefore largely relied on superconducting technologies whose requirement for cryogenic operation imposes substantial infrastructure constraints, limiting scalable deployments. Here, the enhanced single-photon detection (ESPD) framework is presented as a system-level theoretical paradigm that shifts photon detection from device-centric optimization to an integrated quantum-information-processing task, by reformulating it as an iteratively enhanced process integrating state-preparation, controlled operations, projective measurements, and multi-copy analysis. ESPD enables systematic performance enhancement through architectural design rather than material modification, thereby circumventing superconducting components, allowing high-performance detection using exclusively room-temperature hardware. Numerical simulations grounded in physically motivated parameters indicate that the ESPD framework can upgrade a conventional room-temperature SPD to effective DE exceeding 93\% and DCR below $10^{-9}$, which are comparable to state-of-the-art superconducting SPDs and can significantly relax the minimal tolerable channel transmission rate in quantum communications. While physical realization would require further component integration, this work establishes a rigorous theoretical framework for enhancing detection performance through architectural quantum-information principles, providing a general blueprint for transcending device-level constraints and guiding the development of next-generation room-temperature quantum technologies.</p>

This network can be used as a generator solely or with a Generative Adversarial Network; however, KAN has a slower speed of learning than neural networks for the number of parameters. Hence,it has not been researched as a generator. Therefore, we propose a novel Generative Adversarial Network called Generative Adversarial Variational Quantum KAN that uses Variational Quantum KAN as a generator. This method enables efficient learning with significantly fewer parameters by leveraging the computational advantages of quantum circuits and their output distributions. We performed the training and generation task on MNIST and CIFAR10, and revealed that our method can achieve higher accuracy than neural networks and Quantum Generative Adversarial Network with less data.</p>

            <h2>Universal Quantum Random Access Memory: A Data-Independent Unitary Construction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Leonardo Bohac</p>
            <p>We present a construction for Quantum Random Access Memory (QRAM) that achieves a single, data-independent unitary operator. Unlike routing-based approaches or circuit methods that yield data-dependent unitaries, our Universal QRAM encodes data in memory qubits that act as quantum control signals within a block-diagonal permutation structure. The key insight is that memory qubits serve as control signals, enabling coherent lookup when addresses are in superposition. For N addresses with K-bit data words, the construction requires $\log_2 N + K + NK$ qubits and decomposes into exactly $NK$ multi-controlled gates. We verify the construction for $N \in \{2, 4, 8, 16\}$ and $K \in \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$, confirming that the resulting unitary is a pure permutation matrix with zero error across all data configurations. This approach simplifies QRAM implementation by separating fixed circuit structure from variable data encoding.</p>

            <h2>The energy-speed relationship of quantum particles challenges Bohmian mechanics?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S. Di Matteo, C. Mazzoli</p>
            <p>Recently, Sharoglazova et al. claimed to have proven a violation of the basic tenet of Bohmian mechanics, namely the phase-speed relation $\vec{v}(\vec{r},t)=\frac{\hbar}{m}\vec{\nabla}S(\vec{r},t)$. Here, $S(\vec{r},t)$ is the (real) phase of the wave function $\psi(\vec{r},t)=\rho^{\frac{1}{2}}(\vec{r},t)e^{iS(\vec{r},t)}$. In a nutshell, they have measured the speed of a claimed evanescent wave, which is real and therefore must have $\vec{\nabla}S=\vec{0}$. However, Fig. 2 clearly shows a density motion from one waveguide to the other, implying a nonzero density current, $\vec{j}(\vec{r},t)=\frac{\hbar}{m}\Im(\psi^*\vec{\nabla}\psi)$. If we combine this evidence with the mathematical identity $\vec{\nabla}S=\frac{m}{\rho}\vec{j}$, we should instead conclude that $\vec{\nabla}S\neq\vec{0}$. So, where does this apparent inconsistency come from?</p>

            <h2>Quantifying Decoherence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohd Shoaib Qureshi, Tabish Qureshi</p>
            <p>Quantum decoherence refers to the phenomenon when the interaction of a quantum system with its environment results in the degradation of quantum coherence. Decoherence is considered to be the most popular mechanism responsible for the emergence of classicality from quantum mechanics. The issue of formulating a measure of decoherence is addressed here. The approach taken here is that decoherence results from the entanglement of a quantum system with certain environment degrees of freedom, and quantifying this entanglement should yield the most natural measure of decoherence. A simple measure of decoherence is presented based on this notion, and it is examined for various example systems. The measure proves to be effective and is relatively straightforward to compute. In addition, a method has been proposed to measure decoherence in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer.</p>

At low energies, eigenstates exhibit strong Anderson localization, while at higher energies a subset of states forms variational scars with anisotropic intensity patterns that violate random wave expectations. Scaling theory predicts that all states localize in two dimensions, yet energy-dependent localization lengths and finite system size allow these regimes to coexist. We demonstrate that this coexistence produces distinct, robust signatures in both spatial intensity patterns and spectral statistics that are directly observable in mesoscopic electronic, photonic, and cold atom systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sounak Bandyopadhyay, Arnab Ghosh</p>
            <p>This article traces the development of fluctuation theory and its deep connection to irreversibility, from equilibrium to near-equilibrium, and finally to far-from-equilibrium systems. Classical fluctuation theorems, which capture the statistical behaviour of thermodynamic systems far from equilibrium, are now well established. Their quantum counterparts, however, remain an active area of research. In this review, we highlight recent advances by linking quantum fluctuation theorems with linear response theory, offering new insights into the nature of quantum fluctuations and irreversibility in the near-equilibrium regime. Particular emphasis is placed on dissipated work in quantum systems as a pathway to observing non-classical effects in quantum thermodynamics. Understanding quantum fluctuations is not only essential for clarifying the foundations of irreversibility but also crucial for the development of novel quantum technologies, including quantum computers, sensors, and metrological devices.</p>

            <h2>Contraction 2.0 Natural Metrics in Contraction Analysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Winfried Lohmiller, Jean-Jacques Slotine</p>
            <p>Contraction analysis establishes exponential incremental convergence of a nonlinear system by solving a linear matrix inequality for a contraction metric, and has become a standard resource for solving problems in nonlinear control and estimation. This paper shows that, for a general nonlinear time-varying system, a contraction metric can be systematically derived by rewriting the system dynamics as a complex natural gradient dynamics. In this form, the variational dynamics can be modally decomposed with geodesic coordinates, and exact exponential convergence rates can be computed. The results are extended to systems with nonlinear inequality constraints. All derivations are tensor-based, and the computed eigenvalues themselves are coordinate-invariant, i.e., the contraction rates are independent of the chosen coordinate system. Simple examples including a gravity pendulum, gradient descent with non-convex cost, Schuler dynamics, and a two-link manipulator, illustrate that the computation of the decomposed convergence rates is straightforward. The role of inequality constraints is illustrated for a controller confined to an operational envelope.</p>

            <h2>Sequential learning on a Tensor Network Born machine with Trainable Token Embedding</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wanda Hou, Miao Li, Yi-Zhuang You</p>
            <p>Generative models aim to learn the probability distributions underlying data, enabling the generation of new, realistic samples. Quantum inspired generative models, such as Born machines based on the matrix product state framework, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in unsupervised learning tasks. This study advances the Born machine paradigm by introducing trainable token embeddings through positive operator valued measurements, replacing the traditional approach of static tensor indices. Key technical innovations include encoding tokens as quantum measurement operators with trainable parameters and leveraging QR decomposition to adjust the physical dimensions of the MPS. This approach maximizes the utilization of operator space and enhances the model's expressiveness. Empirical results on RNA data demonstrate that the proposed method significantly reduces negative log likelihood compared to one hot embeddings, with higher physical dimensions further enhancing single site probabilities and multi site correlations. The model also outperforms GPT2 in single site estimation and achieves competitive correlation modeling, showcasing the potential of trainable POVM embeddings for complex data correlations in quantum inspired sequence modeling.</p>

            <h2>Tensor network approximation of Koopman operators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dimitrios Giannakis, Mohammad Javad Latifi Jebelli, Michael Montgomery, Philipp Pfeffer, Jörg Schumacher, Joanna Slawinska</p>
            <p>We propose a tensor network framework for approximating the evolution of observables of measure-preserving ergodic systems. Our approach is based on a spectrally-convergent approximation of the skew-adjoint Koopman generator by a diagonalizable, skew-adjoint operator $W_\tau$ that acts on a reproducing kernel Hilbert space $\mathcal H_\tau$ with coalgebra structure and Banach algebra structure under the pointwise product of functions. Leveraging this structure, we lift the unitary evolution operators $e^{t W_\tau}$ (which can be thought of as regularized Koopman operators) to a unitary evolution group on the Fock space $F(\mathcal H_\tau)$ generated by $\mathcal H_\tau$ that acts multiplicatively with respect to the tensor product. Our scheme also employs a representation of classical observables ($L^\infty$ functions of the state) by quantum observables (self-adjoint operators) acting on the Fock space, and a representation of probability densities in $L^1$ by quantum states. Combining these constructions leads to an approximation of the Koopman evolution of observables that is representable as evaluation of a tree tensor network built on a tensor product subspace $\mathcal H_\tau^{\otimes n} \subset F(\mathcal H_\tau)$ of arbitrarily high grading $n \in \mathbb N$. A key feature of this quantum-inspired approximation is that it captures information from a tensor product space of dimension $(2d+1)^n$, generated from a collection of $2d + 1$ eigenfunctions of $W_\tau$. Furthermore, the approximation is positivity preserving. The paper contains a theoretical convergence analysis of the method and numerical applications to two dynamical systems on the 2-torus: an ergodic torus rotation as an example with pure point Koopman spectrum and a Stepanoff flow as an example with topological weak mixing.</p>

            <h2>Introduction of Additive Particle Theory for Path Integral Approaches</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ken-ichi Amano</p>
            <p>Path integral approaches have been used for boson and fermion systems. The path integral approach has been successful in the many-boson system. However, in the many-fermion system, the path integral approach is not feasible due to the sign problem. In this letter, I introduce additive particle (AP) theory in order to generate an approximation method that avoids the sign problem. The AP theory considers one electron as a string polymer, and virtual particles are added into the system. The AP theory is an approximation, but it is constructed to be able to generate the pair distribution function between free electrons and the density of states of the free electrons at an arbitrary temperature. Hence, when the electrostatic interactions are decreased, the AP theory converges to the free electron system. On the other hand, it deviates from the actual system when the electrostatic interactions are increased.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vladimir Al. Osipov, Boris Fainberg</p>
            <p>A system of several Wannier-Mott excitons interacting with phonons in a bulk material is considered. We show that strong exciton-phonon coupling causes the formation of a coherent two-exciton state -- the exciton pair. Unlike the biexcitons, where the photons play the role of force carrier, the exciton pair is formed via entanglement with the long-living phonon mode: (i) The essentially multi-particle theory requires excitons (cobosons composed of an electron and a hole) to satisfy the mixed Bose-Fermi statistics; (ii) This allows us to formulate a system of non-linear dynamic equations, using the multiconfiguration Hartree method applied to the Frohlich Hamiltonian. The system of equations possesses a stationary solution, which, for the case of a single exciton, describes the excitonic polaron and corresponds to the exciton pair in the two-exciton case. We also compare the fluorescent spectra of exciton polarons and exciton pairs estimated from our theory with those observed in experiments on room-temperature superfluorescence (collective emission of fluorescent light) in hybrid perovskites to give an additional insight into the superfluorescence phenomenon.</p>

            <h2>Generalized $η$-pairing theory and anomalous localization in non-Hermitian systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kai Lieta</p>
            <p>By generalizing the eta-pairing theory to non-Hermitian Hubbard models on arbitrary lattices, we obtain the sufficient and necessary condition for the eta-pairing operator to be an eigenoperator of the Hamiltonian $H$, and find unique eta-pairing phenomena without Hermitian analogs. For instance, the Hermitian conjugate of an eta-pairing eigenoperator may not be an eigenoperator, eta-pairing eigenoperators can be spatially modulated, and the $SU(2)$ pseudospin symmetry may not be possible even if $H$ commutes with the eta-pairing operators. Remarkably, these novel non-Hermitian phenomena are closely related to each other by several theorems we establish and can lead to, for example, new types of eta-pairing operators (e.g., the notion of non-Hermitian angular-momentum operators) and the anomalous localization (e.g., the skin effect) of eta-pairing eigenstates. Some issues on the $SO(4)$ and particle-hole symmetries are clarified. Our general eta-pairing theory also reveals a previously unnoticed unification of these symmetries of the Hubbard model. To exemplify these findings, we first propose the Hatano-Nelson-Hubbard model. In this interacting non-Hermitian system without even the bulk translation invariance, the right and left two-particle eta-pairing eigenstates are exponentially localized at opposite boundaries of the chain. Then, we generalize this model to two dimensions and find that the eta-pairing eigenstates can exhibit the first- or second-order skin effect. Finally, a general two-sublattice model is constructed to realize all of the non-Hermitian eta-pairing phenomena. This work provides a new and rigorous theoretical framework for studying novel physical phenomena (e.g., the skin effect) in interacting non-Hermitian systems, even in arbitrary spatial dimensions and without the bulk translation symmetry.</p>

            <p>We provide a mathematical realization of a conjecture by Kitaev, on the basis of the operator-algebraic formulation of infinite quantum spin systems. Our main results are threefold. First, we construct an $\Omega$-spectrum $\mathit{IP}_*$ whose homotopy groups are isomorphic to the smooth homotopy group of invertible gapped quantum systems on Euclidean spaces. Second, we develop a model for the homology theory associated with the $\Omega$-spectrum $\mathit{IP}_*$, describing it in terms of the space of quantum systems placed on an arbitrary subspace of a Euclidean space. This involves introducing the concept of localization flow, a semi-infinite path of quantum systems with decaying interaction range, inspired by Yu's localization C*-algebra in coarse index theory. Third, we incorporate spatial symmetries given by a crystallographic group $\Gamma $ and define the $\Omega$-spectrum $\mathit{IP}_*^\Gamma$ of $\Gamma$-invariant invertible phases. We propose a strategy for computing the homotopy group $\pi_n(\mathit{IP}_d^\Gamma )$ that uses the Davis--Lück assembly map and its description by invertible gapped localization flow. In particular, we show that the assembly map is split injective, and hence $\pi_n(\mathit{IP}_d^\Gamma)$ contains a computable direct summand.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mátyás Szücs, Péter Ván</p>
            <p>A thermodynamic analysis of weakly nonlocal non-relativistic fluids is presented under the assumption that an additional scalar field also contributes to the dynamics. The most general evolution of this field and the constitutive relations for the pressure tensor and energy current density are determined by the Liu procedure. Classical holography of perfect (\ie non-dissipative) fluids is generally proven, according to which the divergence of the pressure tensor can be given by the gradient of a corresponding scalar potential. A consequence of holographic property is vorticity conservation, which opens the way toward wave-function representation of hydrodynamic equations to obtain the Schrödinger equation. Another special case of the derived fluid model is Newtonian gravity, when the internal variable is the gravitational potential itself. Coupled phenomena, such as the Schrödinger--Newton system, are also discussed. The presented thermodynamic framework can shed light on some connections between formulations of classical and quantum physics.</p>

            <p>We consider how the Born rule, a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics, can be tested for particles created on the shortest timescales ($\sim10^{-25}\,\mathrm{s}$) currently accessible at high-energy colliders. We focus on targeted tests of the Born rule for spin or polarisation probabilities, which offer a particularly clean experimental signal, and which can be described by a simple hidden-variables model of two-state systems proposed by Bell. These probabilities test a remarkable feature of the quantum formalism, whereby expectation values for incompatible experiments are linearly related. Born-rule violations can be parameterised by nonlinear expectation values for quantum measurements of spin or polarisation, together with anomalies in ensemble averages, which may then be constrained by experiment. Notable experiments considered here include the recent detection of single photons from top-quark decay, and the indirect measurement of tau-lepton polarisation. Repurposing these experiments as tests of the Born rule, however, presents several challenges, which are discussed in this paper.</p>

            <p>Predicting phenomena that mix few-photon quantum optics with strong field nonlinear optics is hindered by the use of separate theoretical formalisms for each regime. We close this gap with a unified effective field theory valid for frequencies lower than the material-dependent cutoff set by the band gap, plasma frequency, or similar scale. The action couples the electromagnetic gauge field to vector polarisation modes. An isotropic potential generates the optical susceptibilities, while a higher-dimension axion-like term captures magnetoelectric effects; quantisation on the Schwinger-Keldysh contour with doubled BRST ghosts preserves gauge symmetry in dissipative media. One-loop renormalisation-group equations reproduce the measured dispersion of the third-order susceptibility from terahertz to near-visible frequencies after matching a single datum per material. Real-time dynamics solved with a matrix-product-operator engine yield good agreement with published results for GaAs polariton cavities, epsilon-near-zero indium-tin-oxide films and superconducting quarton circuits. The current formulation is limited to these 1-D geometries and sub-cut-off frequencies; higher-dimensional or above-cut-off phenomena will require additional degrees of freedom or numerical methods.</p>

In QSL, separation is interpreted as disentanglement, and the frame rule brings a notion of entanglement-local specification (one that only talks about the qubits entangled with those acted upon by the program). In this paper, we identify two notions of locality unique to the quantum domain, and we construct a novel quantum separation logic, RapunSL, which is able to soundly reduce reasoning about superposition states to reasoning about pure states (basis-locality), and reasoning about mixed states arising from measurement to reasoning about pure states (outcome-locality). To do so, we introduce two connectives, linear combination and mixing, which together with separation provide a dramatic improvement in the scalability of reasoning, as we demonstrate on a series of challenging case studies.</p>

            <p>Recent investigations into High-Energy QCD have identified entanglement entropy as a crucial observable, linking parton distributions to the structure of the quantum vacuum. While momentum-space entanglement has been extensively studied in Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS), the spatial realization of this entanglement in confined systems remains an open question. In this Letter, we demonstrate that the confining boundary of the MIT Bag Model acts as an ``Entropic Skin,'' generating maximal Spin-Position entanglement. We calculate the local reduced density matrix for the confined quark and show that the linear boundary condition, $i \gamma^\mu n_\mu \psi = \psi$, acts as an entangling gate. The surface entropy density reaches a geometric invariant of $\approx 0.918$ bits ($92\%$ of the qubit limit), independent of the bag radius. We discuss the implications of this result for Chiral Symmetry breaking and propose that this boundary entropy is the precursor to the pion cloud in effective field theories.</p>

            <p>Quantum synchronisation has recently been proposed as a mechanism for electronic excitation energy transfer in light-harvesting complexes, yet its robustness in driven-dissipative settings remains under active investigation. Here, we revisit this mechanism in cryptophyte photosynthetic antennae using an exciton--vibrational dimer model. By comparing the full open quantum dynamics with semi-classical rate equations for electronic density-matrix elements and vibrational observables, we demonstrate that quantum correlations between electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom, beyond the semi-classical factorised limit, underpin the emergence of quantum synchronisation. Furthermore, we introduce an environment-assisted transfer mechanism arising as a nonlinear, non-Condon correction to the dipole--dipole interaction. This mechanism enables long-lived quantum coherence and continuous, synchronisation-enhanced energy transfer in a driven-dissipative regime, thereby suggesting new avenues for investigating photosynthetic energy-transfer dynamics.</p>

            <p>While quantum simulators promise to explore quantum many-body physics beyond classical computation, their capabilities are limited by the available native interactions in the hardware. On many platforms, accessible Hamiltonians are largely restricted to one- and two-body interactions, limiting access to multi-body Hamiltonians and to systems governed by simultaneous, non-commuting interaction terms that are central to condensed matter, quantum chemistry, and high-energy physics. We introduce and experimentally demonstrate a hybrid digital-analog protocol that overcomes these limitations by embedding analog evolution between shallow entangling-gate layers. This method produces effective Hamiltonians with simultaneous non-commuting three- and four-body interactions that are generated non-perturbatively and without Trotter error -- capabilities not practically attainable on near-term hardware using purely digital or purely analog schemes. We implement our scheme on a trapped-ion quantum processor and use it to realize a topological spin chain exhibiting prethermal strong zero modes persisting at high temperature, as well as models featuring three- and four-body interactions.

Using the Fubini-Study formalism, we derive the metric tensor of the associated quantum state manifold and compute the corresponding Riemann curvature. Our analysis reveals that the system evolves over a smooth, compact, two-dimensional manifold with spherical topology and a dumbbell-like structure shaped by collective spin interactions. We further investigate the influence of the geometry and topology of the resulting state space on the behavior of geometric and topological phases acquired by the system. We explore how this curvature constrains the system's dynamical behavior, including its evolution speed and Fubini-Study distance between the quantum states. Within this geometric framework, we address the quantum brachistochrone problem and derive the minimal time required for optimal evolution, a result useful for time-efficient quantum circuit design. Subsequently, we explore the role of entanglement in shaping the state space geometry, modulating geometric phase, and controlling evolution speed and brachistochrone time. Our results reveal that entanglement enhances dynamics up to a critical threshold, beyond which geometric constraints begin to hinder evolution. Moreover, entanglement induces critical shifts in the geometric phase, making it a sensitive indicator of entanglement levels and a practical tool for steering quantum evolution. This approach offers valuable guidance for developing quantum technologies that require time-efficient control strategies rooted in the geometry of quantum state space.</p>

            <p>Electrons bound to shallow donors in ZnSe quantum wells are promising candidates for optically addressable spin qubits and single-photon sources. However, their optical coherence and indistinguishability are often limited by spectral broadening arising from charge fluctuations in the local environment. Here, we report electrical control of single donor qubits in ZnSe quantum wells. The applied field induces a DC Stark shift that tunes the emission energy over a range exceeding 30 times the inhomogeneous linewidth, effectively compensating for emitter-to-emitter variations. Concurrently, the field stabilizes trap occupancy, yielding a twofold reduction in optical linewidth and the suppression of spectral wandering. A statistical model based on trap dynamics qualitatively reproduces these observations and elucidates the mechanism of field-assisted charge noise suppression. Our results identify electrical control as a versatile pathway to significantly improve optical and spin addressability.</p>

            <h2>Hybrid Quantum Repeater Chains with Atom-based Quantum Processing Units and Quantum Memory Multiplexers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shin Sun, Daniel Bhatti, Shaobo Gao, David Elkouss, Hiroki Takahashi</p>
            <p>Quantum repeaters enable the generation of reliable entanglement across long distances despite the underlying channel noise. Nevertheless, realizing quantum repeaters poses a difficult engineering challenge due to various device constraints and design tradeoffs. Herein, we propose and analyze an efficient hybrid quantum repeater design that integrates atom-based quantum processing units, spontaneous parametric down-conversion photon sources, and atomic frequency comb quantum memories. Our design leverages the strong spectro-temporal multiplexing capability of the quantum memory to enable high-rate elementary-link entanglement generation between repeater nodes. Transferring the photonic entanglement into matter-qubit entanglement, together with deterministic quantum operations, further enables reliable long-distance entanglement distribution. We analyze photon-loss channels in the hybrid architecture and propose suitable error-suppression strategies that are natively incorporated into our repeater protocol. Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate the advantages of our hybrid design for end-to-end secret key rates in a linear repeater-chain model. With continued advances in relevant hardware technologies, we envision that the proposed hybrid design is well-suited for large-scale quantum networks.</p>

            <h2>Asymmetric polaron picture for the quantum Rabi model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Feng Qiao, Qiu-Yi Chen, Zu-Jian Ying</p>
            <p>The experimental access to ultra-strong couplings in light-matter interactions has made the quantum phase transition (QPT) in the quantum Rabi model practically relevant, while the physics of the QPT has not yet been fully explored. The polaron picture is a method capable of analyzing in the entire coupling regime and extracting the essential physics behind the QPT. However, the asymmetric deformation of polarons is missing in the current polaron picture. In the present work we propose an improved variational method in asymmetric polaron picture (APP). Our APP not only increases the method accuracy but also reveals more underlying physics concerning the QPT. We find that in the ground state both the polarons and antipolarons are asymmetrically deformed to a large extent, which leads to a richer phase diagram. We also analyze the first excited state in which we unveil an asymmetry direction reversal for the polarons and an attraction/replusion transition differently from the ground state. Finally, we apply the APP in quantum Fisher information analysis and critical coupling extraction, the improvements indicate that the polaron asymmetry makes a considerable contribution to the quantum resource in quantum metrology and plays an unnegligible role in the QPT. Our results and mechanism clarifications expose more subtle energy competitions and abundant physics, and the method potentially might have broader applications in light-matter interactions.</p>

            <h2>Properties of a Three-Level $Λ$-Type Atom Driven by Coherent and Stochastic Fields</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sajad Ahmadi, Mohsen Akbari, Shahpoor Saeidian, Ali Motazedifard</p>
            <p>We present a theoretical investigation of a three-level $\Lambda$-type atom driven by a strong coherent laser and a weak stochastic field exhibiting amplitude and phase fluctuations. The stochastic field is modeled as a complex Gaussian-Markovian random process with finite bandwidth to describe realistic laser noise. Using the Born-Markov and rotating-wave approximations, we derive a Lindblad-form master equation that incorporates spontaneous emission and noise-induced terms, and we solve for the steady-state regime. We examine level populations in both the bare and dressed bases and compute the incoherent resonance-fluorescence spectrum. Our analysis shows that the stochastic drive is not merely a source of decoherence but a versatile control parameter. By detuning the stochastic-field central frequency relative to the coherent drive (especially for narrow bandwidths), we observe pronounced changes in emission characteristics, including selective enhancement or suppression, and reshaping of the multi-peaked fluorescence spectrum when the detuning matches the generalized Rabi frequency. Numerical results reveal nontrivial steady-state modifications distinct from purely coherent driving, enabling precise control of populations and suggesting applications in quantum control, quantum technologies, spectroscopy, and noise-assisted manipulation of atomic systems.</p>

            <p>Interactions between charged particles and light occur in real space and time, yet quantum field theory usually describes them in momentum space. Whereas this approach is well suited for calculating emission probabilities and cross sections, it is insensitive to spatial and temporal phenomena such as, for instance, radiation formation, quantum coherence, and wave packet spreading. These effects are becoming increasingly important for experiments involving electrons, photons, atoms, and ions, particularly with the advent of attosecond spectroscopy and metrology. Here, we propose a general method for describing the emission of photons in phase space via a Wigner function. Several effects for Cherenkov radiation are predicted, absent in classical realm or in quantum theory in momentum space, such as a finite spreading time of the photon, finite duration of the flash and a quantum shift of the photon arrival time. The photon spreading time turns out to be negative near the Cherenkov angle, the flash duration is defined by the electron packet size, and the temporal shift can be both positive and negative. The characteristic time scales of these effects lie in the atto- and femtosecond ranges, thereby illustrating atomic origins of these macroscopic phenomena. The near-field distribution of the photon field resembles the electron packet shape, thus making ``snapshots'' of the emitter wave function. Our approach can easily be generalized to the other types of radiation and extended to scattering, decay, and annihilation processes, bringing tomographic methods of quantum optics to particle physics.</p>

            <h2>Delayed Choice Lorentz Transformations on a Qubit</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lucas Burns, Sacha Greenfield, Justin Dressel</p>
            <p>A continuously monitored quantum bit (qubit) exhibits competition between unitary Hamiltonian dynamics and non-unitary measurement-collapse dynamics, which for diffusive measurements form an enlarged transformation group equivalent to the Lorentz group of spacetime. We leverage this equivalence to develop a four-dimensional generalization of the three-dimensional Bloch ball to visualize the state of a monitored qubit as the four-momentum of an effective classical charge affected by a stochastic electromagnetic force field. Unitary qubit dynamics generated by Hermitian Hamiltonians correspond to elliptic spatial rotations of this effective charge while non-unitary qubit dynamics generated by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians or stochastic measurement collapse correspond to hyperbolic Lorentz boosts. Notably, to faithfully emulate the stochastic qubit dynamics arising from continuous qubit measurement, the stochastic electromagnetic fields must depend on the velocity of the charge they are acting on. Moreover, continuous qubit measurements admit a dynamical delayed choice effect where a future experimental choice can appear to retroactively determine the type of past measurement backaction, so the corresponding point charge dynamics can also exhibit delayed choice Lorentz transformations in which a future experimental choice determines whether stochastic force fields are electric or magnetic in character long after they interact with the particle.</p>

            <h2>A Fundamental Theorem on Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen Steering</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Xuan Zhang, Jing-Ling Chen</p>
            <p>Quantum nonlocality is an essential nonlocality resource in quantum information. It has been classified into three distinct types: quantum entanglement, Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering, and Bell's nonlocality. In 1991, Gisin presented a fundamental theorem on Bell's nonlocality, pointing out all pure entangled states possess Bell's nonloclaity. Many of the core protocols of quantum information science (such as quantum teleportation, quantum key distribution, and certain algorithms in quantum computing) rely on entanglement. Gisin's theorem tells us that as long as we successfully prepare a pure entangled state, we then have a Bell-nonlocality resource that can show the non-classical correlations. Such a resource is not ``virtual'' and can be tested and used through Bell-experiments. Similarly, in this work, we present a Gisin-like fundamental theorem on EPR steering, which indicates all rank-2 (and rank-1) entangled states possess EPR steerability. Thus all rank-2 entangled states can be applicable as EPR-steering resources in quantum information.</p>

            <p>We commence our study with review of dispersion interactions in electrolytes. We then reflect on how background media change atom-atom excited-state systems. To highlight the impact of nonlocal media, such as salt solutions, we predict that a new contribution to the resonance interaction energy emerges in a form $\propto e^{-\kappa_{\rm D} \rho}/\rho$. Here $\kappa_{\rm D}$ is the Debye length and $\rho$ is the distance between the atoms. This contribution vanishes at zero temperature, where a new term proportional to $1/\rho^4$ (similar to free space) occurs. This new term is dampened by the electrolyte at large distances, causing it to decrease much faster, proportional to $1/\rho^7$. The long-range electrolyte-induced resonance interaction at finite temperature may, in addition to the dominating van der Waals attraction (which goes as $1/\rho^6$), take part in the molecular formation of biological fluids.</p>

            <p>One explanation of the thermalization of an isolated quantum system is the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, which posits that all energy eigenstates are thermal. Based on this idea, we use dynamical typicality to predict the thermal state of ultracold Rb atoms exchanging energy via long-range dipole-dipole interactions. In a magneto-optical trap, we excite the atoms to the center of a manifold of nearly harmonically spaced clusters of Stark energy levels and then allow them to equilibrate. Comparing the equilibrium state to our thermal prediction across a range of densities, we find that the atoms generally fail to thermalize, though they approach the thermal state at the highest tested density.</p>

            <p>We investigate the statistical physics of quantum error correction in ${\rm U}(1)$ symmetry-enriched topological quantum memories. Starting from a phenomenological error model of charge-conserving noise, we study the optimal decoder assuming the local charges of each anyon can be measured. The error threshold of the optimal decoder corresponds to a continuous phase transition in a disordered two-dimensional integer loop model on the Nishimori line. Using an effective replica field theory analysis and Monte Carlo numerics, we show that the optimal decoding transition exhibits Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless universality with a modified universal jump in winding number variance. We further generalize the model beyond the Nishimori line, which defines a large class of suboptimal decoders. At low nonzero temperatures and strong disorder, we find numerical evidence of a disorder-dominated loop-glass phase which corresponds to a "confidently incorrect" decoder. The zero-temperature limit defines the minimum-cost flow decoder, which serves as the ${\rm U}(1)$ analog of minimum-weight perfect matching in $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological codes. Both the optimal and minimum-cost flow decoders are shown to dramatically outperform the charge-agnostic optimal decoder in symmetry-enriched topological codes.</p>

            <h2>Information Critical Phases under Decoherence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akash Vijay, Jong Yeon Lee</p>
            <p>Quantum critical phases are extended regions of phase space characterized by a diverging correlation length. By analogy, we define an information critical phase as an extended region of a mixed state phase diagram where the Markov length, the characteristic length scale governing the decay of the conditional mutual information (CMI), diverges. We demonstrate that such a phase arises in decohered $\mathbb{Z}_{N}$ Toric codes by assessing both the CMI and the coherent information, the latter quantifying the robustness of the encoded logical qudits. For $N>4$, we find that the system hosts an information critical phase intervening between the decodable and non-decodable phases where the coherent information saturates to a fractional value in the thermodynamic limit, indicating that a finite fraction of logical information is still preserved. We show that the density matrix in this phase can be decomposed into a convex sum of Coulombic pure states, where gapped anyons reorganize into gapless photons. We further consider the ungauged $\mathbb{Z}_{N}$ Toric code and interpret its mixed state phase diagram in the language of strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking. We argue that in the dual model, the information critical phase arises because the spontaneously broken off-diagonal $\mathbb{Z}_{N}$ symmetry gets enhanced to a U(1) symmetry, resulting in a novel superfluid phase whose gapless modes involve coherent excitations of both the system and the environment. Finally, we propose an optimal decoding protocol for the corrupted $\mathbb{Z}_{N}$ Toric code and evaluate its effectiveness in recovering the fractional logical information preserved in the information critical phase. Our findings identify a gapless analog for mixed-state phases that still acts as a fractional topological quantum memory, thereby extending the conventional paradigm of quantum memory phases.</p>

The dissipative couplings between dynamical gauge fields on the lattice links and the surrounding environment generate chiral motions of particles residing on lattice sites. Despite the complexity arising from many-body interactions, the local gauge symmetry enables the exact construction of a steady state that displays the many-body non-Hermitian skin effect. Furthermore, our approach can be generalized to realize a new type of many-body non-Hermitian skin effect, dubbed the hierarchical skin effect, where different subsystem degrees of freedom exhibit boundary accumulation of multiple moments at different orders. Our findings can be readily observed by engineering dissipation in state-of-the-art lattice gauge simulators.</p>

By examining the long-time damping dynamics, we uncover a dynamical duality phenomenon between the weak and strong dissipation region, which exists only in the topologically non-trivial phase, linked to the structure of the Liouvillian spectra,particularly the stripe closest to the steady state. When dissipation is confined to a single boundary, the dynamical duality phenomenon still exists. Under this condition, the Liouvillian gap fulfills an exponential size scaling relation in the topologically non-trivial phase and a power-law size scaling relation in the topologically trivial phase. Within the topologically non-trivial region, we identify the existence of boundary-localized dark states in the thermodynamical limit, which is responsible for the exponential size decay of Liouvillian gap.</p>

It is demonstrated that the adsorption rate can be either enhanced or suppressed relative to the Fermi golden rule rate, in analogy to cavity effects in the spontaneous emission rate in QED. A mesoscopic-sized adsorbent behaves as an acoustic cavity that enhances the adsorption rate when tuned to the adsorption transition frequency and suppresses the rate when detuned.

            <p>What physical mechanism enables quantum catalysis to boost quantum battery (QB) performance in open systems? We investigate an external-field-driven qubit QB coupled to a harmonic oscillator catalyst, revealing a key thermodynamic mechanism: the catalyst induces transient negative heat flow ($J(t)<0$, or energy backflow) into the battery. This backflow actively counters dephasing losses, rapidly pushing the qubit into non-passive states, and results in a drastic enhancement of extractable work (Ergotropy). Leveraging the quantum first law, we precisely quantify this causal link between negative heat flux and QB performance enhancement. Our work uncovers the fundamental role of transient thermodynamic backflow in quantum catalysis, offering a crucial blueprint for high-performance quantum energy storage devices.</p>

Supported by the clear edge offered by our approach, we focus our attention on the noisy scenario; we employ the experimentally-accessible Meyer-Wallach global entanglement as a scalable surrogate optimization cost and certify entanglement using bipartite negativity. For mixed states up to ten qubits, the optimized circuits generate substantial entanglement across both symmetric and asymmetric bipartitions. These results established an experimentally motivated and scalable framework for engineering multipartite entanglement on near-term quantum devices, highlighting the combined role of nonlinearity and circuit topology that can achieve up to 20 qubits for very low noisy levels.</p>

            <p>Nondemolition protocols use ancilla qubits to identify the fragile quantum state of a qubit without destroying its encoded information, thus playing a crucial role in nondestructive quantum measurements particularly relevant for quantum error correction. However, the multitude of ancilla preparations, information transfers, and ancilla measurements in these protocols create an intrinsic overhead for information processing. Here we consider an Andreev qubit defined in a quantum-dot Josephson junction and show that the macroscopic time-dependent oscillatory supercurrent arising from the quantum interference of the many-body eigenstates, can be used to probe the qubit itself-arbitrarily close to the nondestructive limit-under currently available experimental capabilities. This readout of arbitrary superposition states of Andreev qubits avoids ancillae altogether and significantly reduces experimental overhead as no repetitive qubit reinitialization is needed. Our prediction of an AC-like Josephson effect without an applied external voltage, which enables the nondestructive qubit readout, is a unique macroscopic manifestation of the microscopic dynamics of the Andreev quantum state. Our findings should have an unprecedented impact on advancing research and applications involving Andreev dots, thus positioning them as promising qubit contenders for quantum processing and technologies.</p>

            <p>Time-dependent electromagnetic drives are fundamental for controlling complex quantum systems, including superconducting Josephson circuits. In these devices, accurate time-dependent Hamiltonian models are imperative for predicting their dynamics and designing high-fidelity quantum operations. Existing numerical methods, such as black-box quantization (BBQ) and energy-participation ratio (EPR), excel at modeling the static Hamiltonians of Josephson circuits. However, these techniques do not fully capture the behavior of driven circuits stimulated by external microwave drives, nor do they include a generalized approach to account for the inevitable noise and dissipation that enter through microwave ports. Here, we introduce novel numerical techniques that leverage classical microwave simulations that can be efficiently executed in finite element solvers, to obtain the time-dependent Hamiltonian of a microwave-driven superconducting circuit with arbitrary geometries. Importantly, our techniques do not rely on a lumped-element description of the superconducting circuit, in contrast to previous approaches to tackling this problem. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach by characterizing the driven properties of realistic circuit devices in complex electromagnetic environments, including coherent dynamics due to charge and flux modulation, as well as drive-induced relaxation and dephasing.

            <h2>Quantum Universality in Composite Systems: A Trichotomy of Clifford Resources</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alejandro Borda, Julian Rincon, César Galindo</p>
            <p>The efficient classical simulation of Clifford circuits constitutes a fundamental barrier to quantum advantage, typically overcome by injecting explicit non-Clifford "magic" resources. We demonstrate that for high-dimensional quantum systems (qudits), the resources required to break this barrier are strictly governed by the number-theoretic structure of the Hilbert space dimension $d$. By analyzing the adjoint action of the Clifford group, we establish a classification of single-qudit universality as a trichotomy. (I) For prime dimensions, the Clifford group is a maximal finite subgroup, and universality is robustly achieved by any non-Clifford gate. (II) For prime-power dimensions, the group structure fragments, requiring tailored diagonal non-Clifford gates to restore irreducibility. (III) Most notably, for composite dimensions with coprime factors, we demonstrate that standard entangling operations alone -- specifically, generalized intra-qudit CNOT gates -- generate the necessary non-Clifford resources to guarantee a dense subgroup of $\mathrm{SU}(d)$ without explicit diagonal magic injection. Our proofs rely on a new geometric criterion establishing that a subgroup with irreducible adjoint action is infinite if it contains a non-scalar element with projective distance strictly less than $1/2$ from the identity. These results establish that "coprime architectures" -- hybrid registers combining subsystems with coprime dimensions -- can sustain universal computation using only classical entangling operations, rendering the explicit injection of magic resources algebraically unnecessary.</p>

            <p>Simulating chemical dynamics is computationally challenging, especially for nonadiabatic dynamics, where numerically exact classical simulations scale exponentially with system size, becoming intractable for even small molecules. On quantum computers, chemical dynamics can be simulated efficiently using either universal, qubit-only devices or specialized mixed-qudit-boson (MQB) simulators, which natively host electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom. Here, we compare the quantum resources required for a qubit-only approach to achieve the same accuracy as an MQB device at simulating nonadiabatic molecular dynamics. We find that MQB simulations require orders-of-magnitude fewer quantum operations than qubit-only simulations, with a one-gate MQB circuit requiring a qubit-equivalent circuit volume of over 400,000 when simulating an isolated molecule, which increases to over ten million when environmental effects are included. These estimates assume perfect qubits and gates, and would increase by additional orders of magnitude if error correction were used for fault tolerance. When errors are small, the advantage of MQB simulators becomes even larger as system size increases. Our results highlight the enormous resource advantages of representing non-qubit chemical degrees of freedom natively, rather than encoding them into qubits.</p>

            <p>A central challenge for scalable quantum networks is the realization of coherent interfaces between stationary qubits and telecom-band photonic qubits for long-distance entanglement distribution. Semiconductor quantum dots emitting at telecom wavelengths present a promising spin-photon platform, and a precise understanding of the properties of the confined spin is crucial for optimizing its interplay with the photonic qubit. Here, we simultaneously benchmark the electron and hole g-factors and coherence properties of a droplet epitaxy QD, solely from time and polarization resolved photon correlations. These measurements identify the hole as the preferable qubit for spin-photon entanglement in quantum network nodes. We then perform full state tomography of the confined hole ground state to reveal subtle anisotropies in the spin precession, providing essential diagnostics for minimizing phase errors critical for deterministic multiphoton entanglement generation.</p>

            <h2>Heralded Linear Optical Generation of Dicke States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Minhyeok Kang, Jaehee Kim, William J. Munro, Seungbeom Chin, Joonsuk Huh</p>
            <p>Entanglement is a fundamental feature of quantum mechanics and a key resource for quantum information processing. Among multipartite entangled states, Dicke states $|D_n^k\rangle$ are distinguished by their permutation symmetry, which provides robustness against particle loss and enables applications for quantum communication and computation. Although Dicke states have been realized in various platforms, most optical implementations rely on postselection, which destroys the state upon detection and prevents its further use. A heralded optical scheme is therefore highly desirable. Here, we present a linear-optical heralded scheme for generating arbitrary Dicke states $|D_n^k\rangle$ with $3n+k$ photons through the framework of the linear quantum graph (LQG) picture. By mapping the scheme design into the graph-finding problem, and exploiting the permutation symmetry of Dicke states, we overcome the structural complexity that has hindered previous approaches. Our results provide a resource-efficient pathway toward practical heralded preparation of Dicke states for quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Quantum-classical algorithm for Ewald summation based computation of long-range electrostatics</h2>

            <p>Numerical exploration of large-size real biological systems requires computational power far exceeding that of modern classical computers. In computational molecular science, calculation of long-range electrostatic interactions between charged atoms - the strongest interactions in condensed phases, is a major bottleneck. Here, we propose a quantum algorithm for fast yet accurate computation of Coulomb electrostatic energy for a system of point charges. The algorithm employs the Ewald method based decomposition of electrostatic energy E into several energy terms, of which "the Fourier component" of E is computed in the algorithm proposed on a quantum device, utilizing the power of Quantum Fourier Transform. We demonstrate the algorithm's quantum advantage for a range of systems of point charges in the three-dimensional space when the number of charges (system size) N exceeds the number of grid points M, and show that the numerical error is rather small <0.1%. The algorithm can be implemented in running the all-atom Molecular Dynamics simulations on a quantum computer, thereby expanding the scope of applications of QFT methods in computational physics, chemistry, and biology.</p>

            <p>As superconducting circuits emerge as a leading platform for scalable quantum information processing, building comprehensive bridges from the foundational principles of macroscopic quantum phenomena to the architecture of modern quantum devices is increasingly essential for introducing new researchers to the field. This tutorial provides a self-contained, pedagogical introduction to superconducting quantum circuits at the undergraduate level. Beginning with an overview of superconductivity and the Josephson effect, the tutorial systematically develops the quantization of microwave circuits into the framework of circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED). The transmon qubit is then introduced as a state-of-the-art application, with a detailed derivation of its Hamiltonian and its interaction with control and readout circuitry. The theoretical formalism is consolidated through a numerical simulation of vacuum Rabi oscillations in a driven transmon-resonator system, a canonical experiment that demonstrates the coherent energy exchange characteristic of the strong coupling regime. This work serves as a foundational guide and first point of contact, equipping students and researchers with the conceptual and mathematical tools necessary to understand and engineer superconducting quantum hardware.</p>

            <p>The capability to control molecular rotation for field-free orientation, which arranges molecules in specific spatial directions without external fields, is crucial in physics, chemistry, and quantum information science. However, conventional methods typically lead to transient orientations characterized by periodic directional reversals and necessitate the generation of coherent superpositions across a broad spectrum of rotational states of ultracold molecules. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework for achieving unidirectional field-free orientation by selectively manipulating two specific rotational states of symmetric top molecules. By leveraging the interplay between coherent superpositions and the precise selection of initial states, we demonstrate that both the maximum achievable orientation and its direction can be effectively controlled. To attain the desired two-state orientation, we present a quantum control strategy that utilizes a single control pulse, significantly simplifying the complexities of conventional multistate or multipulse schemes. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness and feasibility of this approach for methyl iodide (CH$_3$I) molecules, even when accounting for molecular centrifugal this http URL results highlight the critical roles of initial-state selection and quantum coherence in achieving long-lasting, high unidirectional molecular orientation, opening new directions in stereochemistry, precision spectroscopy, and quantum computing.</p>

            <p>Quantum algorithms to integrate nonlinear PDEs governing flow problems are challenging to discover but critical to enhancing the practical usefulness of quantum computing. We present here a near-optimal, robust, and end-to-end quantum algorithm to solve time-dependent, dissipative, and nonlinear PDEs. We embed the PDEs in a truncated, high dimensional linear space on the basis of quantum homotopy analysis. The linearized system is discretized and integrated using finite-difference methods that use a compact quantum algorithm. The present approach can adapt its input to the nature of nonlinearity and underlying physics. The complexity estimates improve existing approaches in terms of scaling of matrix operator norms, condition number, simulation time, and accuracy. We provide a general embedding strategy, bounds on stability criteria, accuracy, gate counts and query complexity. A physically motivated measure of nonlinearity is connected to a parameter that is similar to the flow Reynolds number $Re_{\textrm{H}}$, whose inverse marks the allowed integration window, for given accuracy and complexity. We illustrate the embedding scheme with numerical simulations of a one-dimensional Burgers problem. This work shows the potential of the hybrid quantum algorithm for simulating practical and nonlinear phenomena on near-term and fault-tolerant quantum devices.</p>

            <p>Quantum sensing promises measurement precision beyond classical limits, but its practical realization is often hindered by decoherence and the challenges of generating and stabilizing entanglement in large-scale systems. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a scalable, scrambling-enhanced quantum sensing protocol, referred to as butterfly metrology, implemented on a cross-shaped superconducting quantum processor. By harnessing quantum information scrambling, the protocol converts local interactions into delocalized metrologically useful correlations, enabling robust signal amplification through interference of the scrambled and polarized quantum states. We validate the time-reversal ability via Loschmidt echo measurements and quantify the information scrambling through out-of-time-ordered correlators, establishing the essential quantum resources of our protocol. Our measurements reveal that the sensing sensitivity surpasses the standard quantum limit (SQL) with increasing qubit number, reaching 3.78 in a 9-qubit configuration, compared to the SQL of 3.0. The scheme further exhibits inherent robustness to coherent control errors and probed signal noise. This work demonstrates a readily scalable path toward practical quantum sensing advantages with prevalent experimental platforms.</p>

            <p>Fluxonium qubits demonstrate exceptional potential for quantum processing; yet, realizing scalable architectures using them remains challenging. We propose a fluxonium-based square-grid design with fast $\sim63$~ns controlled-Z (CZ) gates, achieving coherent errors below $10^{-4}$, activated via microwave-driven transmon couplers. A central difficulty in such large-scale systems with all-microwave gates and, therefore, strong static couplings, is suppressing parasitic interactions that extend beyond nearest neighbors to include next-nearest elements. We address this issue by introducing several design strategies: the frequency allocation of both qubits and couplers, the localization of coupler wavefunctions, and a differential oscillator that suppresses residual long-range interactions. In addition, the architecture natively supports fast $\sim70$~ns CZZ gates -- three-qubit operations composed of two CZ gates sharing a common qubit -- which reduce the incoherent error by $\sim 35\%$ compared to performing the corresponding CZs sequentially. Together, these advances establish an interaction-resilient platform for large-scale fluxonium processors and can be adapted to a variety of fluxonium layouts.</p>

            <p>We construct a series of graphene-based superconducting quantum circuits and integrate them into 3D cavities. For a single-qubit device, we demonstrate flux-tunable qubit transition, with a measured $T_1$ $\approx$ 48 ns and a lower bound estimate of $T_2^\ast$ $\approx$ 17.63 ns. By coupling the device to cavities with different resonant frequencies, we access multiple qubit-cavity coupling regimes, enabling the observation of vacuum Rabi splitting and flux-dependent spectral linewidths. In a two-qubit device consisting of a SQUID and a single junction, power-dependent measurements reveal a two-stage dispersive shift. By flux-tuning the cavity frequency at different readout powers, we attribute the first shift to the fixed-qubit and the second to the SQUID-qubit, indicating successful coupling between the two circuits and a single cavity mode. Our study demonstrates the flexible coupling achievable between 2D-material-based superconducting circuits and 3D cavities, and paves the way toward constructing multi-qubit 3D transmon devices from 2D materials.</p>

            <p>We define and study the properties of ``squeezed quantum multiplets''. Ordinary multiplets are sets of $D$-orthonormal quantum states formed by superpositions of states squeezed along $D$ equally spaced directions in quadrature space. More generally, we also discuss superpositions of ``higher-order squeezed states'', including tri-squeezed and quad-squeezed states. All these states involve superpositions of multiples of $p$ photons. We compare states in ordinary ($p=2$) multiplets and higher-order ones ($p>2$) in the most relevant cases, showing that ordinary squeezed multiplets and higher-order ones share some important similarities, as well as some differences. Finally, we present analytical expressions for phase-space distributions (Wigner and characteristic functions) representing ordinary squeezed multiplets. We use this to show that some squeezed multiplets are highly sensitive to perturbations in all phase-space directions, making them interesting for metrological applications.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Origin of Classical Background Fields from Coherent States: A First-Principles Formulation in QED</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Keita Seto</p>
            <p>Classical background electromagnetic fields are routinely employed in quantum electrodynamics to describe a wide range of physical situations, from laser-matter interactions to strong-field phenomena. In this work, we present a first-principles formulation that clarifies the quantum origin of such classical background fields in QED by systematically deriving them from coherent states of the electromagnetic field. Abstract Starting from the operator formulation of QED, we show how scattering amplitudes between coherent states naturally lead to an effective description in terms of background fields, while maintaining a clear separation between the coherent laser mode and other quantized photon degrees of freedom. This framework allows one to consistently incorporate effects beyond the fixed background approximation, such as depletion and backreaction, without assuming any particular field strength or intensity regime. Abstract We further demonstrate how the conventional generating functional with a prescribed background field emerges as a limiting case, corresponding to fixed coherent state boundary conditions. The path integral representation is then obtained as a reformulation of the same underlying Heisenberg picture amplitudes, providing a unified view of operator-based and functional approaches. Abstract Our results establish a general and intensity-independent foundation for QED with coherent background fields, within which the standard formulations of strong-field QED arise as well-defined special cases.</p>

            <h2>$\bf A^2$-robust superradiant phase transition in hybrid qubit-cavity optomechanics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gang Liu, Wei Xiong</p>
            <p>The $\mathbf{A}^2$ term presents a fundamental challenge to realizing the superradiant phase transition (SPT) in cavity quantum electrodynamics. Here, we propose a hybrid quantum system enabling SPT regardless of the presence of the $\mathbf{A}^2$ term. The system consist of a qubit, a mechanical mode, and an optical cavity, where the qubit and mechanical mode constitute a quantum Rabi model, while the mechanical mode and cavity form an optomechanical system. Crucially, the auxiliary cavity introduces a switchable $\mathbf{A}^2$ term that effectively counteracts or even fully eliminates the original $\mathbf{A}^2$ effect. This allows controllable observation of SPT, diagnosed via the second-order equal-time correlation function $g^{(2)}(0)$ of phonons. Furthermore, the auxiliary cavity exponentially reduces the critical coupling strength, significantly relaxing experimental requirements. In addition, we show that phonons in the normal phase display bunching, but coherent in the superradiant phase. Interestingly, higher-order squeezing is found in both phases, with near-perfect higher-order squeezing achieved at the SPT point, establishing it as a probe for SPT behavior. Our work demonstrates that hybridizing optomechanics and cavity quantum electrodynamics provides a promising route to accessing SPT physics in the presence of the $\mathbf{A}^2$ term.</p>

            <h2>Exponentially Enhanced Tripartite Coupling in Quantum Nonlinear Magnonics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xue-Chun Chen, Zi-Jie Wang, Sheng-Bo Zheng, Jiaojiao Chen, Wei Xiong</p>
            <p>Strong and controllable tripartite interactions play a pivotal role in quantum information and nonlinear quantum optics, yet challenging to realize. In this work, we propose a hybrid system consisting of a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center coupled to Kerr magnons (magnons with Kerr nonlinearity) in two yttrium-iron-garnet spheres. By adiabatically eliminating the ground state of the NV qutrit in the dispersive regime, an effective tripartite interaction among magnons and an NV qubit encoded in its excited states is obtained. In the strong driving limit, Kerr magnons can be linearized and give rise to degenerate parametric amplification for squeezing magnons. As a result, both the tripartite interaction and cooperativity are exponentially enhanced twice, which is about $\exp(\xi)$ times than schemes only involving single-squeezing. Hence, our proposal is more experimentally feasible because modest squeezing parameter is sufficient. With this amplified tripartite coupling strength, the system dynamics are greatly accelerated, leading to fast generation of tripartite entanglement. In addition, noise-resilient perfect magnon blockade can be achieved, well predicted by both the analytical approach and numerical simulation with quantum master equation. Our results suggest that the NV center represents a promising interface for engineering many-body interactions in quantum magnonics, offering a versatile platform for exploring fundamental quantum phenomena such as entanglement and correlations.</p>

            <h2>Ergotropic advantage in a measurement-fueled quantum heat engine</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sidhant Jakhar, Ramandeep S. Johal</p>
            <p>This paper investigates a coupled two-qubits heat engine fueled by generalized measurements of the spin components and using a single heat reservoir as sink. Our model extends the proposal of Yi and coworkers [Phys. Rev. E {\bf 96}, 022108 (2017)] where the role of a hot reservoir in a four-stroke cycle was replaced by a quantum measurement apparatus, the other steps being two quantum adiabatic strokes and thermalization with a cold reservoir. We propose a five-stroke cycle, where an ergotropy extracting stroke is introduced following the measurement stroke, and study the effect of measurements of different spin components on the performance of the machine. For measurements along z-z directions, we find two possible occupation distributions that yield an active state and the ergotropic stroke improves the performance of the engine over the four-stroke cycle. Further, the three-stroke engine ( {without the adiabatic strokes}) yields the same performance as the five-stroke engine. For arbitrary working medium and non-selective measurements, we prove that the total work output of a five-stroke engine is equal to the sum of the work outputs of the corresponding four-stroke and three-stroke engines. For measurement directions other than z-z, there may be many possible orderings of the post-measurement probabilities that yield an active state. However, as we illustrate, for specific cases (e.g. x-x), a definite ordering may be obtained with the projective measurements. Thus, we find that the five-stroke engine exploiting ergotropy outperforms both its four-stroke as well as three-stroke counterparts.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruochen Ma, Vedika Khemani, Shengqi Sang</p>
            <p>Quantum phases at zero temperature can be characterized as equivalence classes under local unitary transformations: two ground states within a gapped phase can be transformed into each other via a local unitary circuit. We generalize this circuit-based characterization of phases to systems at finite-temperature thermal equilibrium described by Gibbs states. We construct a channel circuit that approximately transforms one Gibbs state into another provided the two are connected by a path in parameter space along which a certain correlation-decay condition holds. For finite-dimensional systems of linear size $L$ and approximation error $\epsilon$, the locality of the circuit is ${\rm polylog}({\rm poly}(L)/\epsilon)$. The correlation-decay condition, which we specify, is expected to be satisfied in the interior of many noncritical thermal phases, including those displaying discrete symmetry breaking and topological order. As an application, we show that any system in the same thermal phase as a zero-temperature topological code coherently preserves quantum information for a macroscopically long time, establishing self-correction as a universal property of thermal phases. As part of the proof, we provide explicit encoding and decoding channel circuits to encode information into, and decode it from, a system in thermal equilibrium.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saheli Mukherjee, Bivas Mallick, Pratik Ghosal</p>
            <p>High-dimensional entanglement offers significant advantages over low-dimensional ones in various information-processing tasks. However, to harness these advantages, it is crucial that the quantum channels used to store or transmit the subsystems of an entangled system not only preserve entanglement but also maintain its dimensionality above a certain threshold. The maximum entanglement dimension that a channel can preserve is referred to as its effective dimensionality, since the channel cannot be used to transmit information of dimension greater than that in a single use. In this work, we present a method to certify whether a quantum channel can preserve entanglement dimension above a given threshold. Unlike existing approaches, our method is faithful, i.e., it can be applied to any channel, and avoids common assumptions such as reliable preparation of entangled states, auxiliary side channels, or perfect measurement devices. Moreover, the method can be extended to faithfully certify other classes of non-resource-breaking channels, such as non-NPT-breaking channels. Finally, we discuss possible experimental realizations of our certification scheme through explicit examples.</p>

            <p>The rapid expansion of quantum cloud services has led to long job queues due to single-tenant execution models that underutilize hardware resources. Quantum multi-programming (QMP) mitigates this by executing multiple circuits in parallel on a single device, but existing methods target superconducting systems with limited connectivity, high crosstalk, and lower gate fidelity. Trapped-ion architectures, with all-to-all connectivity, long coherence times, and high-fidelity mid-circuit measurement properties, presents itself as a more suitable platform for scalable QMP. We present CircPack, a hardware-aware circuit packing framework designed for modular trapped-ion devices based on the Quantum Charge-Coupled Device (QCCD) architecture. CircPack formulates static circuit scheduling as a two-dimensional packing problem with hardware-specific shuttling constraints. Compared to superconducting-based QMP approaches, CircPack achieves up to 70.72% better fidelity, 62.67% higher utilization, and 32.80% improved layer reduction. This framework is also capable of scalable, balanced scheduling across a cluster of independent QCCD modules, highlighting trapped-ion systems' potential in improving the throughput of quantum cloud computing in the near future.</p>

Our results reveal the existence and characteristics of these solitons across a range of lattice depths and spacings. We identify stable regions of the solitons based on interaction strength and lattice properties, and compare these findings with theoretical predictions. The experimental results qualitatively agree with a Gaussian variational model and match quantitatively with numerical simulations of the three-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation extended with a quintic term to account for the loss of atoms.

            <p>While the Marcus theory of electron transfer defines the reorganization energy as a classical quantity, recent work has shown for the first time that the reorganization energy is actually a quantum mechanical object that depends on the electronic coupling. We extend this picture and show that in the adiabatic limit of condensed-phase electron transfer, the onset of barrierless transition occurs at a lower driving force than predicted by the non-adiabatic Marcus formulation. Furthermore, in the adiabatic limit of the Marcus-inverted region, the standard mechanism of electron transfer becomes topologically forbidden. This behavior arises from a topological change in the mapping between the adiabatic and diabatic electronic surfaces, emerging precisely at the onset of the Marcus-inverted region. In this case, alternative mechanisms such as tunneling and non-radiative decay may dominate the rate, typically orders of magnitude slower than the rate calculated from Marcus theory.</p>
