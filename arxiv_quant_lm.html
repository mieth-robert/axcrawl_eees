            <h2>Dissipative Yao-Lee Spin-Orbital Model: Exact Solvability and $\mathcal{PT}$ Symmetry Breaking</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zihao Qi, Yuan Xue</p>
            <p>Exactly solvable dissipative models provide an analytical tool for studying the relaxation dynamics in open quantum systems. In this work, we study an exactly solvable model based on an anisotropic variant of the Yao-Lee spin-orbital model, with dissipation acting in the spin sector. We map Liouvillian dynamics to fermions hopping in a doubled Hilbert space under a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and demonstrate the model's exact solvability. We analyze the model's strong and weak symmetries, which protect an exponentially large manifold of non-equilibrium steady states, establishing the system as a physically feasible dissipative spin liquid. Furthermore, we analyze the transient dynamics in a translationally invariant sector and discover that the single-particle Liouvillian spectrum hosts an exceptional ring in momentum space. We map out a characteristic $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry breaking transition driven by the dissipation strength, which governs the crossover from oscillatory to decaying relaxation of physical observables. Our work provides a physically motivated, solvable setting for exploring the coexistence of dissipative spin liquid physics and Liouvillian spectral singularities.</p>

            <h2>Exploiting Movable Logical Qubits for Lattice Surgery Compilation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Laura S. Herzog, Lucas Berent, Aleksander Kubica, Robert Wille</p>
            <p>Lattice surgery with two-dimensional quantum error correcting codes is among the leading schemes for fault-tolerant quantum computation, motivated by superconducting hardware architectures. In conventional lattice surgery compilation schemes, logical circuits are compiled following a place-and-route paradigm, where logical qubits remain statically fixed in space throughout the computation. In this work, we introduce a paradigm shift by exploiting movable logical qubits via teleportation during the logical lattice surgery CNOT gate. Focusing on lattice surgery with the color code, we propose a proof-of-concept compilation scheme that leverages this capability. Numerical simulations show that the proposed approach can substantially reduce the routed circuit depth compared to standard place-and-route compilation techniques. Our results demonstrate that optimizations based on movable logical qubits are not limited to architectures with physically movable qubits, such as neutral atoms or trapped ions - they are also readily applicable to superconducting quantum hardware. An open-source implementation of our method is available on GitHub this https URL.</p>

            <h2>A Quantum Gate Architecture via Teleportation and Entanglement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samuel J. Sheldon, Pieter Kok, Callum W. Duncan</p>
            <p>We present a universal quantum computing architecture which combines the measurement-driven aspect of MBQC with the circuit model's algorithm dependent generation of qubit entanglement. Our architecture, which we call QGATE, is tailored for discrete-variable photonic quantum computers with deterministic photon sources capable of generating 1D entangled photonic states. QGATE achieves universal quantum computing on a logical data qubit register via the implementation of Clifford operations, QGATE ancilla, and arbitrary angle single-qubit measurements. We realise unitary evolutions defined by multi-qubit Pauli strings via the generation of entanglement between a sub-set of logical qubits and a mutual QGATE ancilla qubit. Measurement of the QGATE ancilla in the appropriate basis then implements a given term of the desired unitary operation. This enables QGATE to both directly perform Hamiltonian evolutions in terms of a series of multi-qubit Pauli operators, in terms of projectors for an arbitrary sparse Hamiltonian, or realise multi-controlled gates enabling direct translation of circuit models to QGATE. We consider examples inspired by quantum chemistry and computational fluid dynamics. We propose an example photonic implementation of QGATE and calculate thresholds of $10.36\pm0.02\%$ or $25.98\pm0.28\%$ on the photonic loss for logical qubits constructed from foliated rotated surface codes, dependent on the deployment of intra-layer or inter-layer fusion respectively.</p>

            <h2>Limits of Perturbation Theory for Multimode Light Propagation in Dispersive Optical Cavities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> K.S. Tikhonov, D.M. Malyshev, V.A. Averchenko</p>
            <p>Temporal modes of quantum light pulses is a promising resource for modern quantum technologies, driving advancements in quantum computing, communication, and metrology. Precise control and manipulation of these modes remain critical challenges, particularly in systems where nonlinear multimode dynamics interact with dispersion effects. In this work, we focus on the role of group velocity dispersion (GVD) within optical cavities - a phenomenon traditionally viewed as detrimental but increasingly recognized as a versatile tool for quantum light manipulation. We present a perturbation-theory-based approach to analyze GVD effects in a synchronously pumped dispersive cavity. By comparing perturbative solutions to rigorous steady-state results, we establish the validity region of the perturbative approach and assess its limitations in multimode systems. Our study identifies key parameters governing the breakdown of perturbation theory, such as mode order, dispersion strength, and cavity decay rates.</p>

            <h2>Experimental Sensitivity Enhancement of a Quantum Rydberg Atom-Based RF Receiver with a Metamaterial GRIN Lens</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anton Tishchenko, Demos Serghiou, Ashwin Thelappilly Joy, Paul Marsh, Paul Martin, Tim Brown, Gabriele Gradoni, Mohsen Khalily, Rahim Tafazolli</p>
            <p>We experimentally demonstrate enhanced sensitivity of an atom-based Rydberg radio frequency (RF) receiver integrated with a gradient refractive index (GRIN) Luneburg-type metamaterial lens. By analyzing the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) effect in Cesium vapor, we compare receiver performance with and without the GRIN lens under a 2.2~GHz and a 3.6~GHz far-field excitation. Our measurements reveal a significant amplification of the EIT transparency window when the lens is introduced, consistent with the theoretical prediction that the local E-field enhancement at the vapor cell reduces the minimum detectable electric field and increases the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the Rydberg RF receiver. This experimental validation highlights the potential of metamaterial-assisted quantum sensing to overcome the inherent bandwidth and sensitivity limitations of bare Rydberg receivers for a variety of applications, such as electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) testing, quantum radar, and wireless communications.</p>

            <h2>Universal quantum control over non-Hermitian continuous-variable systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhu-yao Jin, Jun Jing</p>
            <p>Although the control of non-Hermitian quantum systems has a growing interest for their nonunitary feature in the time evolution, the existing discussions are not more than two or three dimensions and heavily influenced by the singularity of the energy spectrum. We here develop a general theory to control an arbitrary number of bosonic modes governed by the time-dependent non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. It takes advantage of the gauge potential in the instantaneous frame rather than the energy spectrum of Hamiltonian. In particular, the dynamics of a general non-Hermitian continuous-variable system is analyzed in the instantaneous frame associated with time-dependent ancillary operators that are superpositions of the laboratory-frame operators and irrelevant to the original Hamiltonian. The gauge potential is determined by the unitary transformation between the time-dependent and stationary ancillary frames. The upper triangularization condition for the Hamiltonian's coefficient matrix in the stationary ancillary frame enables two of the time-dependent ancillary operators to be nonadiabatic Heisenberg passages of the non-Hermitian system. The probability conservation of the system wavefunction can be restored at the end of these passages without artificial normalization. Our theory is exemplified with the perfect and nonreciprocal state transfers in a cavity magnonic system. The former holds for arbitrary initial states and is irrelevant to the parity-time symmetry of the Hamiltonian and the exceptional point of the spectra; and the latter is consistent with the unidirectional perfect absorbtion. Our work essentially extends the universal quantum control (UQC) theory to the non-Hermitian continuous-variable systems, providing a promising approach for their coherent control.</p>

            <h2>Supramolecular approach-based intermolecular interaction energy calculations using quantum phase estimation algorithm</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuhei Tachi, Akihiko Arakawa, Taisei Osawa, Masayoshi Terabe, Kenji Sugisaki</p>
            <p>Accurate computation of non-covalent, intermolecular interaction energies is important to understand various chemical phenomena, and quantum computers are anticipated to accelerate it. Although the state-of-the-art quantum computers are still noisy and intermediate-scale ones, development of theoretical frameworks those are expected to work on a fault-tolerant quantum computer is an urgent issue. In this work, we explore resource-efficient implementation of the quantum phase estimation-based complete active space configuration interaction (QPE-CASCI) calculations, with the aid of the second-order Møller--Plesset perturbation theory (MP2)-based active space selection with Boys localized orbitals. We performed numerical simulations of QPE for the supramolecular approach-based intermolecular interaction energy calculations of the hydrogen-bonded water dimer, using 6 system and 6 ancilla qubits. With the aid of algorithmic error mitigation, the QPE-CASCI simulations achieved interaction energy predictions with an error of 0.02 kcal mol$^{-1}$ relative to the CASCI result, demonstrating the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed methodology. Preliminary results on quantum circuit compression for QPE are also presented to reduce the number of two-qubit gates and depth.</p>

            <h2>Probing false vacuum decay and bubble nucleation in a Rydberg atom array</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Xin Chao, Peiyun Ge, Zhen-Xing Hua, Chen Jia, Xiao Wang, Xinhui Liang, Zongpei Yue, Rong Lu, Meng Khoon Tey, Xiao Wang, Li You</p>
            <p>In quantum field theory (QFT), the "vacuum" is not just empty space but the lowest-energy state of a quantum field. If the energy landscape has multiple local minima, the local ground states are the false vacuum (FV) which can tunnel towards the global ground state (true vacuum, TV). This process exhibits signature akin to classical supercooled gas transitions and many-body tunneling in discrete quantum systems. Here, we study the FV decay and bubble nucleation in a Rydberg atom ring. The long-range van-der-Waals interactions and individual-site addressability allow us to explore physics beyond the standard Ising model. We observe that the FV decay rate decreases exponentially with the inverse of the symmetry-breaking field, directly mirroring QFT predictions. Moreover, we demonstrate that even minor deviations from the ideal metastable state can cause a stark departure from this universal scaling law. Extending beyond short-time decay dynamics, we also examine resonant bubble nucleation, a feature distinctive to systems with discrete energy spectra. Our findings and methods open avenues for future studies of many-body tunneling in higher dimensions or more complex geometries.</p>

            <h2>Watt-level coherent microwave emission from dissipation engineered solid-state quantum batteries</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuanjin Wang, Hao Wu, Mark Oxborrow, Qing Zhao</p>
            <p>Recently proposed metastability-induced quantum batteries have shown particular promise for coherent microwave generation. However, achieving high-power coherent microwave generation in quantum batteries remains fundamentally challenging due to quantum correlations, aging, and self-discharging processes. For the cavity-quantum-electrodynamics (CQED)-based quantum batteries, a further trade-off arises between strong spin-photon coupling for energy storage and sufficient output coupling for power delivery. To overcome these constraints, we introduce dissipation engineering as a dynamic control strategy that temporally separates energy storage and release. By suppressing emission during charging and rapidly enhancing the output coupling during discharging, we realize nanosecond microwave bursts with watt-level peak power. By optimizing three dissipation schemes, we improve work extraction efficiency of the quantum battery by over two orders of magnitude and achieve high power compression factors outperforming the state-of-the-art techniques, establishing dissipation engineering as a pathway toward room-temperature, high-power coherent microwave sources.</p>

            <h2>Expanding the Neutral Atom Gate Set: Native iSWAP and Exchange Gates from Dipolar Rydberg Interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pedro Ildefonso, Andrew Byun, Aleksei Konovalov, Javad Kazemi, Michael Schuler, Wolfgang Lechner</p>
            <p>We present a native realization of iSWAP and parameterized exchange gates for neutral atom quantum processing units. Our approach leverages strong dipole-dipole interactions between two dipole-coupled Rydberg states, and employs optimal control techniques to design time-efficient, high-fidelity gate protocols. To minimize experimental complexity, we utilize global driving terms acting identically on all atoms. We implement a noise-aware pulse selection strategy to identify candidate protocols with reduced susceptibility to certain noise sources, then analyze their performance under realistic noise sources -- including atomic motion, Rydberg decay, and experimentally motivated laser phase and intensity noise. For a $^{88}$Sr-based architecture, we demonstrate fast iSWAP gate protocols which exceed fidelities of $99.9\%$ under realistic experimental conditions. These results pave the way for expanding the neutral atom gate set beyond typical Rydberg blockade-based entangling gates.</p>

            <h2>Universal Quantum Interconnects via Phase-Coherent Four-Wave Mixing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hao Zhang, Yang Xu, Linshan Sun, Wei Cui, Robert W. Boyd, Sergio Carbajo</p>
            <p>Quantum transduction, which enables the coherent conversion of quantum information between disparate physical platforms, is a cornerstone for realizing scalable and interoperable quantum networks. Among various approaches, parametric frequency mixing processes such as four-wave mixing (FWM) offer a promising pathway toward efficient and low-noise transduction. In this work, we demonstrate the feasibility of coherent quantum state transfer by indirectly verifying high-fidelity wavefunction's phase mapping (>99%) from the input field to the generated output field wave. Using a gas-filled hollow-core capillary fiber, we systematically investigate spectral phase evolution across a broad range, including infrared (IR) to ultraviolet (UV) transitions, as well as conversions from telecom-band (1550 nm) to visible (516 nm) and deep-UV (308 nm) wavelengths. Our results reveal that strong phase coherence can be maintained throughout these diverse conversion regimes. Because quantum properties such as coherence and entanglement are intrinsically encoded in both the amplitude and phase of a photonic wavefunction, preserving spectral phase is essential for faithful quantum information transfer. We further show that efficient and phase-preserving transduction can be achieved by tuning system parameters, offering valuable insights into nonlinear coupling dynamics. These findings establish a promising foundation for advancing FWM-based quantum transduction schemes and open new avenues for integrating heterogeneous quantum systems across wide spectral domains within future quantum communication networks.</p>

            <h2>Continuously tunable single-photon level nonlinearity with Rydberg state wave-function engineering</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Biao Xu, Gen-Sheng Ye, Yue Chang, Tao Shi, Lin Li</p>
            <p>Extending optical nonlinearity into the extremely weak light regime is at the heart of quantum optics, since it enables the efficient generation of photonic entanglement and implementation of photonic quantum logic gate. Here, we demonstrate the capability for continuously tunable single-photon level nonlinearity, enabled by precise control of Rydberg interaction over two orders of magnitude, through the use of microwave-assisted wave-function engineering. To characterize this nonlinearity, light storage and retrieval protocol utilizing Rydberg electromagnetically induced transparency is employed, and the quantum statistics of the retrieved photons are analyzed. As a first application, we demonstrate our protocol can speed up the preparation of single photons in low-lying Rydberg states by a factor of up to ~ 40. Our work holds the potential to accelerate quantum operations and to improve the circuit depth and connectivity in Rydberg systems, representing a crucial step towards scalable quantum information processing with Rydberg atoms.</p>

            <h2>Nonreciprocal transmission in a cavity-magnon system by rotational Sagnac effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhe-Qi Yang, Si-Qi Lin, Zhi-Rong Zhong</p>
            <p>Ultrahigh nonreciprocal transmission has been achieved in a cavity-magnon system, which consists of two whispering gallery modes (WGMs) and a single magnon mode within a magnetic insulator yttrium iron garnet sphere. The nonreciprocal frequency shift induced by the Sagnac effect enables unidirectional transmission of an input field, while suppressing propagation in the opposite direction, thereby facilitating nonreciprocal optical transmission. Within experimentally accessible parameter regimes, the optical isolation ratio can exceed 40 dB, representing the highest isolation ratio reported to date. Furthermore, applying squeezing to the magnon mode further enhances this isolation performance. Additionally, the directionality of light isolation can be reversed simply by modifying the rotation of the WGM cavity. These findings offer promising prospects for developing high-performance, tunable, and compact optical nonreciprocal devices.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement and squeezing of gravitational waves</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thiago Guerreiro</p>
            <p>We show that the self-interactions present in the effective field theory formulation of general relativity can couple gravitational wave modes and generate nonclassical states. The output of gravitational nonlinear processes can also be sensitive to quantum features of the input states, indicating that nonlinearities can act both as sources and detectors of quantum features of gravitational waves. Due to gauge and quantization issues in strongly curved spacetimes, we work in the geometric optics limit of gravitational radiation, but we expect the key ideas extend to situations of astrophysical interest. This offers a new direction for probing the quantum nature of gravity, analogous to how the quantumness of electrodynamics was established through quantum optics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomás Villalba-Ferreiro, Eduardo Mosqueira-Rey, Diego Alvarez-Estevez</p>
            <p>This study explores the performance of Quantum Support Vector Classifiers (QSVCs) and Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) in comparison to classical models for machine learning tasks. By evaluating these models on the Iris and MNIST-PCA datasets, we find that quantum models tend to outperform classical approaches as the problem complexity increases. While QSVCs generally provide more consistent results, QNNs exhibit superior performance in higher-complexity tasks due to their increased quantum load. Additionally, we analyze the impact of hyperparameter tuning, showing that feature maps and ansatz configurations significantly influence model accuracy. We also compare the PennyLane and Qiskit frameworks, concluding that Qiskit provides better optimization and efficiency for our implementation. These findings highlight the potential of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) for complex classification problems and provide insights into model selection and optimization strategies</p>

            <h2>Generating redundantly encoded resource states for photonic quantum computing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samuel J. Sheldon, Pieter Kok</p>
            <p>Measurement-based quantum computing relies on the generation of large entangled cluster states that act as a universal resource on which logical circuits can be imprinted and executed through local measurements. A number of strategies for constructing sufficiently large photonic cluster states propose fusing many smaller resource states generated by a series of quantum emitters. However, the fusion process is inherently probabilistic with a 50% success probability in standard guise. A recent proposal has shown that, in the limit of low loss, the probability of achieving successful fusion may be boosted to near unity by redundantly encoding the vertices of linear graph states using Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states [Quantum 7, 992 (2023)]. Here we present a protocol for deterministically generating redundantly encoded photonic resource states using single quantum emitters, and study the impact of protocol errors and photonic losses on the generated resource states and type-II photonic fusion. Our work provides a route for efficiently constructing complex entangled photonic qubit states for photonic quantum computing and quantum repeaters.</p>

            <h2>Many-body symmetry-protected zero boundary modes of synthetic photo-magnonic crystals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alan Gardin, Emilio Cobanera, Giuseppe C. Tettamanzi</p>
            <p>The topological classification of insulators and superconductors, the "ten-fold way", is grounded on fermionic many-body symmetries and has had a dramatic impact on many fields of physics. Therefore, it seems equally important to investigate a similar approach for bosons as tightly analogous to the fermionic prototype as possible. There are, however, several obstacles coming from the fundamental physical differences between fermions and bosons. Here, we propose a potentially optimal way forward: a theory of free boson topology (topological classification and bulk-boundary correspondence) protected by bosonic many-body symmetry operations, namely, squeezing transformations, particle number, and bosonic time reversal. We identify two symmetry classes that are topologically non-trivial in one dimension. They include key models like the bosonic Kitaev chain, protected by a squeezing symmetry within our framework, and the celebrated bosonic SSH model, protected by a squeezing symmetry and particle number. To provide a robust experimental platform for testing our theory, we introduce a new quantum meta-material: photo-magnonic crystals. They consist of arrays of interconnected photo-magnonic cavities. They are remarkable for their experimental flexibility and natural affinity for displaying band topological physics at microwave frequencies. We engineer a many-body symmetry-protected topological photo-magnonic chain with boundary modes mandated by a Pfaffian invariant. Using an electromagnetic finite-element modelling, we simulate its reflection and transmission and identify experimental signatures of its boundary modes. The experimental tuning of the crystal to its symmetry-protected topological phase is also addressed. Our modelling of the photo-magnonic chain provides a thorough blueprint for its experimental realisation and the unambiguous observation of its exotic physics.</p>

            <p>Scaling quantum computers to large sizes requires the implementation of many parallel qubit readouts. Here we present an ultrastable superconducting-qubit readout method using the multi-tone self-phase-referenced Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) technique, originally developed for use with optical cavities. In this work, we benchmark PDH readout of a single transmon qubit, using room-temperature heterodyne detection of all tones to reconstruct the PDH signal. We demonstrate that PDH qubit readout is insensitive to microwave phase drift, displaying $0.73^\circ$ phase stability over 2 hours, and capable of single-shot readout in the presence of phase errors exceeding the phase shift induced by the qubit state. We show that the PDH sideband tones do not cause unwanted measurement-induced state transitions for a transmon qubit, leading to a potential signal enhancement of at least $14$~dB over traditional heterodyne readout.</p>

            <h2>Excess work in counterdiabatic driving</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lucas P. Kamizaki, Marcus V. S. Bonança</p>
            <p>Many years have passed since the conception of the quintessential method of shortcut to adiabaticity known as counterdiabatic driving (or transitionless quantum driving). Yet, this method appears to be energetically cost-free and thus continually challenges the task of quantifying the amount of energy it demands to be accomplished. This paper proposes that the energy cost of controlling a closed quantum system using the counterdiabatic method can also be assessed using the instantaneous excess work during the process and related quantities, as the time-averaged excess work. Starting from the Mandelstam-Tamm bound for driven dynamics, we have shown that the speed-up of counterdiabatic driving is linked with the spreading of energy between the eigenstates of the total Hamiltonian, which is necessarily accompanied by transitions between these eigenstates. Nonetheless, although excess work can be used to quantify energetically these transitions, it is well known that the excess work is zero throughout the entire process under counterdiabatic driving. To recover the excess work as an energetic cost quantifier for counterdiabatic driving, we will propose a different interpretation of the parameters of the counterdiabatic Hamiltonian, leading to an excess work different from zero. We have illustrated our findings with the Landau-Zener model.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xun Tang, Haoxuan Chen, Yuehaw Khoo, Lexing Ying</p>
            <p>We introduce Sketch Tomography, an efficient procedure for quantum state tomography based on the classical shadow protocol used for quantum observable estimations. The procedure applies to the case where the ground truth quantum state is a matrix product state (MPS). The density matrix of the ground truth state admits a tensor train ansatz as a result of the MPS assumption, and we estimate the tensor components of the ansatz through a series of observable estimations, thus outputting an approximation of the density matrix. The procedure is provably convergent with a sample complexity that scales quadratically in the system size. We conduct extensive numerical experiments to show that the procedure outputs an accurate approximation to the quantum state. For observable estimation tasks involving moderately large subsystems, we show that our procedure gives rise to a more accurate estimation than the classical shadow protocol. We also show that sketch tomography is more accurate in observable estimation than quantum states trained from the maximum likelihood estimation formulation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ching-Tai Huang, Yu-Cheng Lin, Ferenc Igloi</p>
            <p>We investigate quench dynamics in the quantum $S=1/2$ XXZ antiferromagnetic chain with staggered and anisotropic interactions in the flat-band limit. Our quench protocol interchanges the odd- and even-bond strengths of a fully dimerized chain, enabling us to derive exact time-dependent states for arbitrary even system sizes by working in the Bell basis. We obtain closed-form, size-independent expressions for the von Neumann and second-order Rényi entanglement entropies. We further calculate exact Loschmidt echoes and the corresponding return rate functions across various anisotropies and system sizes, and identify Loschmidt zeros in finite chains. Our analysis reveals the precise conditions on the anisotropy parameter that govern the periodicity of the dynamical observables. In addition to the analytic study, we perform two types of numerical experiments on IBM-Q quantum devices. First, we use the Hadamard test to estimate the Bell-basis expansion coefficients and reconstruct the dynamical states, achieving accurate entanglement entropies and the Loschmidt echo for small systems. Second, we implement Trotter-error-free time-evolution circuits combined with randomized Pauli measurements. Post-processing via statistical correlations and classical shadows yields reliable estimates of the second-order Rényi entanglement entropy and the Loschmidt echo, showing satisfactory agreement with exact results.</p>

While Josephson-junction-based amplifiers have become standard in superconducting quantum circuits, their magnetic sensitivity, limited saturation power, and sub-kelvin operating requirements motivate the development of alternative nonlinear platforms. Here we demonstrate a two-mode kinetic-inductance parametric amplifier based on a pair of capacitively coupled Kerr-nonlinear resonators fabricated from NbTiN and NbN thin films. The distributed Kerr nonlinearity of these materials enables nondegenerate four-wave-mixing amplification with gains approaching 40 dB, gain-bandwidth products up to 6.9 MHz, and 1-dB compression powers two to three orders of magnitude higher than those of state-of-the-art Josephson amplifiers. A coupled-mode theoretical model accurately captures the pump-induced modification of the hybridized modes and quantitatively reproduces the observed signal and idler responses. The NbN device exhibits a significantly larger Kerr coefficient and superior gain-bandwidth performance, highlighting the advantages of high-kinetic-inductance materials. Our results establish coupled kinetic-inductance resonators as a robust platform for broadband, high-power, and magnetically resilient quantum-limited amplification, offering a scalable route for advanced readout in superconducting qubits, spin ensembles, quantum dots, and other microwave-quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Engineering photonic dispersion relation and atomic dynamics in waveguide QED setup via long-range hoppings</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weijun Cheng, Da-Wei Wang, Yang Xue, Zhihai Wang, Liantuan Xiao</p>
            <p>Non-trivial dispersion relations engineered in photonic waveguide for the precise control of atomic dynamics has recently attracted considerable attention. Here, we study a system in which atoms are coupled to one-dimensional coupled-resonator waveguides with long-range hoppings. By carefully engineering the jth-order nearest neighbor (JNN) hoppings between resonators, we construct linear dispersion relations with the chiral characteristic. To quantify the degree of linearity, we analyze the propagation fidelities of Gaussian wave packets in these waveguides. Furthermore, we demonstrate that such coupled-resonator waveguides can serve as versatile platforms for enabling directional atomic radiation and absorption. Beyond linear dispersion relations, more general forms, including quadratic and cubic relations, can also be achieved through tailored JNN-hoppings. Our study thus provides a unified framework for simulating atom-environment couplings with arbitrary dispersion relations.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Encrypted Control of Networked Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zihao Ren, Daniel Quevedo, Salah Sukkarieh, Guodong Shi</p>
            <p>Encrypted control has been extensively studied to ensure the confidentiality of system states and control inputs for networked control systems. This paper presents a computationally efficient encrypted control framework for networked systems enabled by quantum communication. A quantum channel between sensors and actuators is used to generate identical secret keys, whose security is further enhanced through quantum key distribution. These keys enable lightweight encryption and decryption while preserving confidentiality and control accuracy. We develop a novel encryption-decryption architecture for state-feedback control of linear systems based on quantum keys, and characterize the impact of quantum state errors on closed-loop stability. In particular, we establish the existence of a critical threshold on intrinsic quantum noise below which stability is guaranteed. In contrast to classical encrypted control schemes, which may collapse under a single key-bit error, the proposed quantum encrypted control exhibits strong robustness to key imperfections. We further adopt quantization techniques to address the scenarios with limited communication bits in practical situations, and implement privacy protection for quantum keys based on a stochastic quantizer. These results demonstrate that integrating quantum technologies into control systems in a nontrivial and principled manner, even at their current level of maturity, can yield substantial performance gains in reducing computational complexity and improving resilience to key errors while ensuring security against multiple eavesdropping sources.</p>

            <h2>Edge bits in average symmetry protected topological mixed state</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yoshihito Kuno</p>
            <p>Edge bit in an average symmetry protected topological (ASPT) mixed state is studied. The state is protected by one strong $Z_2$ and one weak (average) $Z_2$ symmetries. As analogous objects of pure symmetry protected topological (SPT) states, the ASPT possesses edge bits. In particular, the analogous operator response exists, that is, symmetry fractionalization. The fractionalization preserves the presence of the ASPT in the bulk, and the fractionalized edge operators acting on the edge bits of the ASPT. %analogous to the ones in the pure SPTs. In this work, based on the cluster model and by employing Choi mapping, we discuss generic features of the edge bits and numerically clarify the behavior of the edge bits and their robustness for varying decoherence and perturbative interactions. By using an operator-space mutual information (OSMI), we track the flow of quantum correlations between the two edges. Remarkably, even in the ASPT regime, a finite portion of the initial edge-to-edge correlation survives.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jialin Li, Guangyu Zhang, Zhang-qi Yin</p>
            <p>Optomechanical cooling of levitated nanoparticles has become an essential topic in modern quantum physics, providing a platform for exploring macroscopic quantum phenomena and high-precision sensing. However, conventional cavity-assisted cooling is fundamentally constrained by cavity dissipation and environmental noise, limiting the attainable minimum temperature. In this work, we propose a non-Hermitian optomechanical cooling scheme through nonreciprocal coupling between two levitated nanoparticles, where one particle is directly cooled by an optical cavity and the other is cooled indirectly through a non-Hermitian interaction. Both analytical solutions and numerical simulations reveal that increasing nonreciprocity enhances directional energy transfer, enabling the target particle to reach a lower phonon occupation than is achievable in conventional cavity cooling. This study demonstrates a new cooling mechanism driven by non-Hermitian interactions, offering theoretical guidance for realizing controllable energy flow and deep cooling in levitated optomechanical systems, and paving the way for future developments in quantum control and sensing technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alex E. Bernardini</p>
            <p>Quantifiers of stationarity, classicality, purity and vorticity are derived from phase-space differential geometrical structures within the Weyl-Wigner framework, after which they are related to the hyperbolic stability of classical and quantum-modified Hamiltonian (non-linear) equations of motion. By examining the equilibrium regime produced by such an autonomous system of ordinary differential equations, a correspondence between Wigner flow properties and hyperbolic stability boundaries in the phase-space is identified. Explicit analytical expressions for equilibrium-stability parameters are obtained for quantum Gaussian ensembles, wherein information quantifiers driven by Wigner currents are identified. Illustrated by an application to a Harper-like system, the results provide a self-contained analysis for identifying the influence of quantum fluctuations associated to the emergence of phase-space vorticity in order to quantify equilibrium and stability properties of Hamiltonian non-linear dynamics.</p>

            <p>Cubic phase states provide the essential non-Gaussian resource for continuous-variable quantum computing. We show that they also offer significant potential for quantum metrology, surpassing the phase-sensing sensitivity of all Gaussian states at equal average photon number. Optimal sensitivity requires only moderate initial squeezing, and the non-Gaussian advantage remains robust against loss and detection noise. We identify optimal measurement strategies and show that several experimentally relevant preparation schemes surpass Gaussian limits, in some cases reaching the sensitivity of cubic phase states. Our results establish cubic phase states as a promising resource for quantum-enhanced precision measurements beyond Gaussian limits.</p>

            <p>In the paper, we consider the problem of searching for the Largest empty rectangle in a 2D map, and the one-dimensional version of the problem is the problem of searching for the largest empty segment. We present a quantum algorithm for the Largest Empty Square problem and the Largest Empty Rectangle of a fixed width $d$ for $n\times n$-rectangular map. Query complexity of the algorithm is $\tilde{O}(n^{1.5})$ for the square case, and $\tilde{O}(n\sqrt{d})$ for the rectangle with a fixed width $d$ case, respectively. At the same time, the lower bounds for the classical case are $\Omega(n^2)$, and $\Omega(nd)$, respectively. The Quantum algorithm for the one-dimensional version of the problem has $O(\sqrt{n}\log n\log\log n)$ query complexity. The quantum lower bound for the problem is $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ which is almost equal to the upper bound up to a log factor. The classical lower bound is $\Omega(n)$.

            <h2>Solution of the Electric Field Integral Equation Using a Hybrid Quantum-Classical Scheme: Investigation of Accuracy and Efficiency</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rui Chen, Teng-Yang Ma, Meng-Han Dou, Chao-Fu Wang</p>
            <p>Conventional classical solvers are commonly used for solving matrix equation systems resulting from the discretization of SIEs in computational electromagnetics (CEM). However, the memory requirement would become a bottleneck for classical computing as the electromagentic problems become much larger. As an alternative, quantum computing has a natural "parallelization" advantage with much lower storage complexity due to the superposition and entanglement in quantum mechanics. Even though several quantum algorithms have been applied for the SIEs-based methods in the literature, the size of the matrix equation systems solvable using them is still limited. In this work, we use a hybrid quantum-classical scheme to solve the EFIE for analyzing electromagentic scattering from three-dimensional (3D) perfect electrically conducting objects with arbitrary shapes in CEM for the first time. Instead of directly solving the original EFIE matrix equation system using the quantum algorithms, the hybrid scheme first designs the preconditioned linear system and then uses a double-layer iterative strategy for its solution, where the external iteration layer builds subspace matrix equation systems with smaller dimension and the internal iteration layer solves the smaller systems using the quantum algorithms. Two representative quantum algorithms, HHL and VQLS, are considered in this work, which are executed on the quantum simulator and quantum computer platforms. We present the theoretical time complexity analysis of the hybrid quantum-classical scheme and perform numerical experiments to investigate the accuracy and efficiency of the hybrid scheme. The results show that the computational complexity of the hybrid VQLS-classical scheme is lower than the conventional fast solvers in classical computing, which indicates the hybrid scheme is more promising for analyzing large-scale electromagnetic problems.</p>

            <p>Quantum high-harmonic generation (HHG) is a growing field of research with capabilities of providing high photon-number entangled states of light. However, there is an open debate regarding the theory level required for correctly describing the quantum aspects of HHG emission, such as squeezing or entanglement. Previous approaches have employed non-interacting classical ensembles of trajectories, or perturbation theory utilizing the classical trajectories as a starting point, missing out key entanglement features. In this Letter, we develop a full quantum theory for entanglement measures in HHG solving exactly the light-matter interaction Hamiltonian and employ it for evaluating the entanglement between emitted photons of different harmonics. For the first time, we reach qualitative agreement of theory with recent experiments showing that the R entanglement parameter decreases with increasing laser power for below-threshold harmonics. Our results indicate that fine-tuning the laser power could enhance HHG entanglement features, which are observed to oscillate with the driving power and exhibit local non-classical maxima structures. Similarly, our theory predicts that the oscillatory behavior of entanglement observed for below-threshold harmonics also appears for entanglement involving above-threshold harmonics. We also show that the long-range behavior of driven electronic trajectories can qualitatively change the resulting entanglement. Lastly, we show that focal averaging over classical degrees of freedom, which has thus far been ignored in quantum HHG theories, plays a key role in entanglement measures and can change the qualitative behavior of observables. Our work establishes the state-of-the art in exploring entanglement features in HHG, and paves way for analysis and engineering of 'truly-quantum' multi-photon states in the XUV and ultrafast regime for more complex matter systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Davut Emre Tasar, Ceren Ocal Tasar</p>
            <p>Quantum key distribution (QKD) security fundamentally relies on the ability to distinguish genuine quantum correlations from classical eavesdropper simulations, yet existing certification methods lack rigorous statistical guarantees under finite-sample conditions and adversarial scenarios. We introduce TARA (Test by Adaptive Ranks), a novel framework combining conformal prediction with sequential martingale testing for quantum anomaly detection that provides distribution-free validity guarantees. TARA offers two complementary approaches. TARA k, based on Kolmogorov Smirnov calibration against local hidden variable (LHV) null distributions, achieving ROC AUC = 0.96 for quantum-classical discrimination. And TARA-m, employing betting martingales for streaming detection with anytime valid type I error control that enables real time monitoring of quantum channels. We establish theoretical guarantees proving that under (context conditional) exchangeability, conformal p-values remain uniformly distributed even for strongly contextual quantum data, confirming that quantum contextuality does not break conformal prediction validity a result with implications beyond quantum certification to any application of distribution-free methods to nonclassical data. Extensive validation on both IBM Torino (superconducting, CHSH = 2.725) and IonQ Forte Enterprise (trapped ion, CHSH = 2.716) quantum processors demonstrates cross-platform robustness, achieving 36% security margins above the classical CHSH bound of 2. Critically, our framework reveals a methodological concern affecting quantum certification more broadly: same-distribution calibration can inflate detection performance by up to 44 percentage points compared to proper cross-distribution calibration, suggesting that prior quantum certification studies using standard train test splits may have systematically overestimated adversarial robustness.</p>

Bell's result was originally proven in a simple bipartite causal structure, but analogous results have also been shown in further causal structures. Here we study the only causal structure with six or fewer nodes in which the question of whether or not there exist quantum correlations that cannot be achieved classically was open. In this causal structure we show that such quantum correlations exist using a method that involves imposing additional restrictions on the correlations. This hence completes the picture of which causal structures of up to six nodes support non-classical quantum correlations. We also provide further illustrations of our method using other causal structures.</p>

            <p>Federated learning (FL) deployed over quantum enabled and heterogeneous classical networks faces significant performance degradation due to uneven client quality, stochastic teleportation fidelity, device instability, and geometric mismatch between local and global models. Classical aggregation rules assume euclidean topology and uniform communication reliability, limiting their suitability for emerging quantum federated systems. This paper introduces A2G (Adaptive Aggregation with Two Gains), a dual gain framework that jointly regulates geometric blending through a geometry gain and modulates client importance using a QoS gain derived from teleportation fidelity, latency, and instability. We develop the A2G update rule, establish convergence guarantees under smoothness and bounded variance assumptions, and show that A2G recovers FedAvg, QoS aware averaging, and manifold based aggregation as special cases.

            <p>We develop a phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau (GL) framework for high-$T_c$ cuprates in which a short-range modulation of the electronic charge density couples to a $d$-wave superconducting condensate. The resulting modulated electron lattice (MEL) state is distinct from long-range static charge density wave order: it is short range, partially phase coherent, and linked to superconducting coherence. A preferred wave vector $q^{\ast} \approx 0.3$ reciprocal lattice units along the Cu-O bond direction emerges from the interplay between a momentum-dependent susceptibility and bond-stretching phonons, consistent with neutron and x-ray data on YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ and related cuprates. The GL free energy contains coupled $d$-wave superconducting and charge sectors with parameters constrained by optimally doped YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$. We identify an MEL enhancement window in doping, temperature, MEL correlation length, and disorder where a coherence linked modulation enhances the superfluid stiffness. Classical Monte Carlo simulations yield an in-plane stiffness enhancement of order ten percent, which we treat as a qualitative prediction to be tested by self-consistent Bogoliubov de Gennes calculations. The MEL framework yields falsifiable experimental signatures. For scanning tunneling spectroscopy in Bi-based cuprates we highlight two predictions: the Fourier-transformed local density of states should exhibit a $q^{\ast} \approx 0.3$ peak whose spectral weight sharpens as superconducting phase coherence develops below $T_c$, in contrast to static charge scenarios, and the local gap magnitude $\Delta(r)$ should correlate positively with the local MEL amplitude. The framework implies correlations between MEL correlation length, superfluid stiffness, disorder, and vortex pinning, and organizes cuprate observations into testable STM/STS predictions.</p>

            <p>The success of a quantum annealing algorithm requires a polynomial scaling of the energy gap. Recently it was shown that a two-dimensional transverse-field Ising model on a square lattice with nearest-neighbor $\pm J$ random coupling has a polynomial energy gap in the symmetric subspace of the parity operator [Nature 631, 749-754 (2024)], indicating the efficient preparation of its ground states by quantum annealing. However, it is not clear if this result can be generalized to other spin glass models with continuous or biased randomness. Here we prove that under general independent and identical distributions (i.i.d.) of the exchange energies, the energy gap of a one-dimensional random transverse-field Ising model follows a stretched exponential scaling even in the parity-restricted subspace. We discuss the implication of this result to quantum annealing problems.</p>

We optimize collision gates for fermionic Lithium atoms confined in a double-well potential, controlling the laser amplitude and keeping its relative phase constant.

Our approach extends beyond earlier Fermi-Hubbard simulations by capturing a momentum dependence in the interaction energy. This leads to a higher interaction strength when atoms begin in separate subwells compared to the same subwell. This momentum dependence might limit the gate fidelity under realistic experimental conditions, but also enables tailored applications in quantum chemistry and quantum simulation by optimizing gates for each of these cases separately.</p>

            <p>Cold-atom experiments based on alkali-like atoms provide us with a tool to experimentally realize Hubbard models with a large number $N$ of components. The value of $N$ can be seen as a new handle to tune the properties of the system, leading to new physics both in the case of fully SU($N$) symmetric systems, or in the presence of controlled symmetry breaking. We focus on the Mott transition at global half filling and we characterize local correlations between particles complementing conventional estimates with the inter-flavor mutual information. We prove that these correlations have classical nature and, using Dynamical Mean-Field Theory, we show that the SU(4) system has significantly smaller correlations than the SU(2) counterpart. In the atomic limit we prove that increasing $N$ further decreases the strength of the correlations. This suggests that a controlled reduction of the symmetry, reducing the number of effective components, can be used to enhance the degree of correlation. We confirm this scenario solving the model for $N=4$ and gradually breaking the symmetry via a Raman field, revealing an evolution from the SU(4) to the SU(2) Mott transition as the symmetry-breaking term increases, with a sudden recovery of the large correlations of the SU(2) model at weak Raman coupling in the Mott state. By further exploring the interplay between energy repulsion and the Raman field, we obtain a rich phase diagram with three different phases -- a metal, a band insulator, and a Mott insulator -- all coexisting at a single tricritical point.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rachid El Aitouni, Miloud Mekkaoui, Pablo Díaz, David Laroze, Ahmed Jellal</p>
            <p>We study how electrons move across a graphene sheet when it encounters two magnetic barriers with a region in between that is continuously driven by laser light. Rather than acting as a static obstacle, this illuminated middle section becomes a Floquet cavity that opens new transport channels through controlled photon absorption and emission. By combining Floquet theory with the transfer matrix method, we track electron transmission through both the main energy band and the emerging photon-assisted sidebands. We find that the laser does more than modify the potential--it reshapes how electrons interact between the magnetic barriers, enabling a switch from ordinary transmission to transport dominated by photon exchange. Because the magnetic field and the optical drive are applied to separate sections of the device, the system supports interference between cyclotron-filtered motion and discrete photon-pumping channels, producing Fano resonances and angle-dependent transmission zeros that cannot appear in double magnetic or double laser barrier systems alone. Under well-defined conditions, the distance between the magnetic barriers controls the coupling between Floquet channels, allowing highly tunable resonances and even perfect transmission, despite strong magnetic confinement. We also observe that low-energy carriers are efficiently blocked by the magnetic regions, while conductance steadily rises with energy until it reaches a clear saturation plateau. This hybrid design provides a versatile way to steer graphene electrons by balancing optical pumping and magnetic momentum filtering.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pak Shen Choong, Nurisya Mohd Shah, Yung Szen Yap</p>
            <p>Amid the International Year of Quantum Science and Technology 2025 (IYQ 2025), a significant portion of global funding has been dedicated to various quantum initiatives, with over 30 countries announcing their respective quantum strategies. Within the Southeast Asia context, Singapore, Thailand, and the Philippines have launched their respective quantum strategies and roadmaps. Meanwhile, six out of eleven Southeast Asia countries have expressed interest in formulating a regional quantum ecosystem to pursue a set of common goals. Quantum technologies, though still in their infancy within the second quantum revolution, have advanced rapidly in recent years. Due to their dual-use nature, quantum technologies are considered emerging and disruptive, often raising concerns from the cybersecurity perspective. While several discussions regarding Malaysia's quantum initiative and strategy are ongoing, it is vital to broaden the conversation and position Malaysia within the regional ecosystem. This paper provides an overview of Malaysia's quantum landscape and a summary of the regional initiatives since the establishment of Southeast Asia Quantum Network. We then analyse Malaysia's strengths in quantum research and provide four recommendations to strengthen the regional ecosystem.</p>

            <h2>Contrary Inferences for Classical Histories within the Consistent Histories Formulation of Quantum Theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adamantia Zampeli, Georgios E. Pavlou, Petros Wallden</p>
            <p>In the histories formulation of quantum theory, sets of coarse-grained histories that are consistent obey the classical probability rules. It has been argued that these sets can describe the quasi-classical behaviour of closed quantum systems, e.g. Omnes (Rev. Mod. Phys. 64(2), 339, 1992) and Hartle (Les Houches1992). Most physical scenarios admit multiple different consistent sets and one can view each of these as a separate context. Using propositions from different consistent sets to make inferences leads to paradoxes such as contrary inferences, first noted by Kent (Phys. Rev. Lett. 78(15), 2874, 1997). In this contribution, we use the consistent histories to describe a quasi-classical and macroscopic system to show that paradoxes involving contextuality persist even in the quasi-classical limit. This is distinctively different from the contextuality of standard quantum theory, where the contextuality paradoxes do not persist in the quasi-classical limit. Specifically, we consider different consistent sets for the arrival time problem of a (quasi-classical) ball in an infinite square well. For this setting, we construct two different consistent sets. We find the probabilities that each consistent set assigns to the simple question of whether the ball ever crossed the middle of the interval. We show that one consistent set concludes with certainty that the ball crossed it while the other consistent set concludes with certainty that it did not. Our results point to the need for constraints on the histories sets, additional to the consistency condition, to recover the correct quasi-classical limit in this formalism and lead to the motto "all consistent sets are equal", but "some consistent sets are more equal than others".</p>

            <h2>Reduced dynamics in quasi-Hermitian systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Himanshu Badhani, C. M. Chandrashekar</p>
            <p>Evolutions under non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with unbroken $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry can be considered unitary under appropriate choices of inner products, facilitated by the so-called metric operator. While it is understood that the choice of the metric operator has no bearing on the description of the system, in this work, we show that this choice does dictate the entanglement structure of the system. We show that the partial trace of the Hermitized density matrix gives the correct representation of the reduced subsystem, and based on such operations, we elucidate the metric dependency of the reduced dynamics and consequently the observable dependence of the subsystem decomposition. We use a non-Hermitian $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric quantum walk as a toy model to study this metric dependency, where we use the internal (coin state) as the subsystem of interest and study the coin-position entanglement and non-Markovianity of the coin dynamics.</p>

            <h2>A refinement of the argument of local realism versus quantum mechanics by algorithmic randomness</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kohtaro Tadaki</p>
            <p>The notion of probability plays a crucial role in quantum mechanics. It appears in quantum mechanics as the Born rule. In modern mathematics which describes quantum mechanics, however, probability theory means nothing other than measure theory, and therefore any operational characterization of the notion of probability is still missing in quantum mechanics. In our former works [K. Tadaki, arXiv:1804.10174], based on the toolkit of algorithmic randomness, we presented a refinement of the Born rule, called the principle of typicality, for specifying the property of results of measurements in an operational way. In this paper, we make an application of our framework to the argument of local realism versus quantum mechanics for refining it, in order to demonstrate how properly our framework works in practical problems in quantum mechanics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Devashish Tupkary, Shlok Nahar, Pulkit Sinha, Norbert Lütkenhaus</p>
            <p>We present a finite-size security proof of the decoy-state BB84 QKD protocol against coherent attacks, using entropic uncertainty relations, for imperfect detectors. We apply this result to the case of detectors with imperfectly characterized basis-efficiency mismatch. Our proof works by obtaining a suitable bound on the phase error rate, without requiring any new modifications to the protocol steps or hardware. It is applicable to imperfectly characterized detectors, and only requires the maximum relative difference in detection efficiencies and dark count rates of the detectors to be characterized. Moreover, our proof allows Eve to choose detector efficiencies and dark count rates in their allowed ranges in each round, thereby addressing an important problem of detector side channels. We prove security in the variable-length framework, where users are allowed to adaptively determine the length of key to be produced, and number of bits to be used for error-correction, based on observations made during the protocol. We quantitatively demonstrate the effect of basis-efficiency mismatch by applying our results to the decoy-state BB84 protocol.</p>

            <h2>Emergent Liouvillian exceptional points from exact principles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shishir Khandelwal, Gianmichele Blasi</p>
            <p>Recent years have seen a surge of interest in exceptional points in open quantum systems. The natural approach in this area has been the use of Markovian master equations. While the resulting Liouvillian EPs have been seen in a variety of systems and have been associated to numerous exotic effects, it is an open question whether such degeneracies and their peculiarities can persist beyond the validity of master equations. In this work, taking the example of a dissipative double-quantum-dot system, we show that exact Heisenberg equations governing system and bath dynamics exhibit the same EPs as the corresponding master equations. To highlight the importance of this finding, we prove that the paradigmatic property associated to EPs - critical damping, persists well beyond the validity of master equations. Our results demonstrate that Liouvillian EPs can arise from underlying fundamental exact principles, rather than merely as a consequence of approximations involved in deriving master equations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> K. Singh, A. Cidrim, A. Kovalenko, T. Pham, O. Číp, L. Slodička, R. Bachelard</p>
            <p>While the spontaneous emission from independent emitters provides spatially uncorrelated photons - a typical manifestation of quantum randomness, the interference of the coherent scattering leads to a well-defined intensity pattern - a feature described by linear optics. We here demonstrate experimentally how the interplay between the two mechanisms in large systems of quantum emitters leads to spatial variations of photon correlations. The implementation with trapped ion crystals in free space allows us to observe the anti-correlation between photon rates and variance of the photon number distributions in chains of up to 18 ions. For smaller crystals of four ions, the transition from a sub-Poissonian to a super-Poissonian variance of the photon number in the scattered light is reported. For higher numbers of scatterers, the photon statistics still display a strong deviation from the fully incoherent scattering case. Our results illustrate how the interference of coherent scattering, combined with spontaneous emission, provides a control mechanism for the light statistics.</p>

            <h2>Oracle Separations for the Quantum-Classical Polynomial Hierarchy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Avantika Agarwal, Shalev Ben-David</p>
            <p>We study the quantum-classical polynomial hierarchy, QCPH, which is the class of languages solvable by a constant number of alternating classical quantifiers followed by a quantum verifier. Our main result is that QCPH is infinite relative to a random oracle (previously, this was not even known relative to any oracle). We further prove that higher levels of PH are not contained in lower levels of QCPH relative to a random oracle; this is a strengthening of the somewhat recent result that PH is infinite relative to a random oracle (Rossman, Servedio, and Tan 2016). The oracle separation requires lower bounding a certain type of low-depth alternating circuit with some quantum gates. To establish this, we give a new switching lemma for quantum algorithms which may be of independent interest. Our lemma says that for any $d$, if we apply a random restriction to a function $f$ with quantum query complexity $\mathrm{Q}(f)\le n^{1/3}$, the restricted function becomes exponentially close (in terms of $d$) to a depth-$d$ decision tree. Our switching lemma works even in a "worst-case" sense, in that only the indices to be restricted are random; the values they are restricted to are chosen adversarially. Moreover, the switching lemma also works for polynomial degree in place of quantum query complexity.</p>

            <p>We propose a Bell test experiment using momentum-entangled atom pairs of different masses, specifically metastable helium isotopes 3He* and 4He*, though the method extends to other atom species. Entanglement is generated via collisions, after which the quantum states are manipulated using two independent atom interferometers, enabling precise phase control over each species. Numerical simulations predict a significant violation of Bell's inequality under realistic conditions.

Its significance also extends to technical challenges within science and engineering, including the nascent field of quantum computing (QC). The counterintuitive nature and high-dimensional mathematics of QC make it a prime candidate for AI's data-driven learning capabilities, and in fact, many of QC's biggest scaling challenges may ultimately rest on developments in AI. However, bringing leading techniques from AI to QC requires drawing on disparate expertise from arguably two of the most advanced and esoteric areas of computer science. Here we aim to encourage this cross-pollination by reviewing how state-of-the-art AI techniques are already advancing challenges across the hardware and software stack needed to develop useful QC - from device design to applications.

            <p>The comb-like spectrum added to laser light by an electro-optic modulator (EOM) finds use in a wide range of applications, including coherent optical communication, atomic spectroscopy, and laser frequency and phase stabilization. In some cases a sideband-free optical frequency shift is preferred, such as in laser offset locking using an optical cavity, single-photon frequency shifting, and laser range finding. Approaches to obtaining an optical frequency offset (OFO) involve trade-offs between shift range, conversion gain, and suppression of spurious sidebands. Here we demonstrate an OFO of continuous-wave 871 nm laser light by serrodyne modulation using a fiber EOM and radio-frequency (RF) tones from a commercial RF system on a chip (RFSoC) to achieve shifts of 40 to 800 MHz with > 15 dB suppression of spurious sidebands and < 1.5 dB conversion loss. We also observe a smoothly varying conversion gain. The utility of this tool is demonstrated by continuously shifting the offset of a cavity-locked laser from 50 to 1600 MHz, a capability useful in spectroscopy of unknown optical transitions.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement and Optimal Timing in Discriminating Quantum Dynamical Processes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Massimiliano F. Sacchi</p>
            <p>I investigate the problem of optimally discriminating between two open quantum dynamical processes in a single-shot scenario, with the goal of minimizing the error probability of identification. This task involves optimising both the input state -- potentially entangled with an ancillary system that remains isolated from the dynamics -- and the time at which the resulting time-dependent quantum channels, induced by the two distinct dynamical maps, becomes most distinguishable. To illustrate the complexity and richness of this problem, I focus on Pauli dynamical maps and their associated families of time-dependent Pauli channels. I identify a regime in which separable strategies require waiting indefinitely for the dynamics to reach the stationary state, whereas entangled input states enable optimal discrimination at a finite time, with a strict reduction in error probability. These results highlight the crucial interplay between entanglement and timing in enhancing the distinguishability of quantum dynamical processes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aingeru Ramos, Jose A. Pascual, Javier Navaridas, Ivan Coluzza</p>
            <p>Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are algorithms for sampling probability distributions, commonly applied to the Boltzmann distribution in physical and chemical models such as protein folding and the Ising model. These methods enable exploration of such systems by sampling their most probable states. However, sampling multidimensional and multimodal distributions with MCMC requires substantial computational resources, leading to the development of techniques aimed at improving sampling efficiency. In this context, quantum computing, with its potential to accelerate classical methods, emerges as a promising solution to the sampling problem. In this work, we present the design of a new circuit based on the Discrete Quantum Walk (DQW) algorithm to perform MCMC sampling over a desired distributions. Simulation results show convergence behavior in the superposition of the quantum register that encodes the target distribution. This design is further refined to increase convergence speed and, consequently, the scalability of the algorithm.</p>

            <h2>Stabilizer-Accelerated Quantum Many-Body Ground-State Estimation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Caroline E. P. Robin</p>
            <p>We investigate how the stabilizer formalism, in particular highly-entangled stabilizer states, can be used to describe the emergence of many-body shape collectivity from individual constituents, in a symmetry-preserving and classically efficient way. The method that we adopt is based on determining an optimal separation of the Hamiltonian into a stabilizer component and a residual part inducing non-stabilizerness. The corresponding stabilizer ground state is efficiently prepared using techniques of graph states and stabilizer tableaux. We demonstrate this technique in context of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, a fully-connected spin system presenting a second order phase transition from spherical to deformed state. The resulting stabilizer ground state is found to capture to a large extent both bi-partite and collective multi-partite entanglement features of the exact solution in the region of large deformation. We also explore several methods for injecting non-stabilizerness into the system, including ADAPT-VQE, and imaginary-time evolution (ITE) techniques. Stabilizer ground states are found to accelerate ITE convergence due to a larger overlap with the exact ground state. While further investigations are required, the present work suggests that collective features may be associated with high but simple large-scale entanglement which can be captured by stabilizer states, while the interplay with single-particle motion may be responsible for inducing non-stabilizerness. This study motivates applications of the proposed approach to more realistic quantum many-body systems, whose stabilizer ground states can be used in combinations with powerful classical many-body techniques and/or quantum methods.</p>

            <p>Quantum spin models are ubiquitous in solid-state physics, but classical simulation of them remains extremely challenging. Experimental testbed systems with a variety of spin-spin interactions and measurement channels are therefore needed. One promising potential route to such testbeds is provided by microwave-photon-mediated interactions between superconducting qubits, where native strong light-matter coupling enables significant interactions even for virtual-photon-mediated processes. In this approach, the spin-model connectivity is set by the photonic mode structure, rather than the spatial structure of the qubit. Lattices of coplanar-waveguide (CPW) resonators have been demonstrated to allow extremely flexible connectivities and can therefore host a huge variety of photon-mediated spin models. However, large-scale CPW lattices with non-trivial band structures have never before been successfully combined with superconducting qubits. Here we present the first such device featuring a quasi-1D CPW lattice with multiple transmon qubits. We demonstrate that superconducting-qubit readout and diagnostic techniques can be generalized to this highly multimode environment and observe the effective qubit-qubit interaction mediated by the bands of the resonator lattice. This device completes the toolkit needed to realize CPW lattices with qubits in one or two Euclidean dimensions, or negatively-curved hyperbolic space, and paves the way to driven-dissipative spin models with a large variety of connectivities.</p>

            <p>We investigate the information-theoretic power of spatial superposition by analyzing tasks in which information is locally encoded at multiple distant sites and must be acquired by a single information carrier, such as a particle. Within an operational framework, we systematically compare the statistical correlations that can be generated in such tasks using classical particles, quantum particles in spatial superposition, and more general "second-order interference" resources. We bound classical strategies via convex polytopes and present a study of their symmetry, demonstrating that the vertices are inherently connected to K-juntas as defined in the classical theory of Boolean functions, while their facet inequalities are in one-to-one correspondence with oracle games. We then analyze the violation of the "fingerprinting inequality" achievable by the use of one quantum particle, and we study the dependence of this violation on the dimension d of the particle's internal degree of freedom. In particular, we show that the case of d = 2 can achieve a higher violation of the inequality than the previously investigated case of d = 1. We also provide analytic and numerical evidence that this violation cannot be further increased for larger d > 2. Finally, we find that both quantum and any other (generalized) second-order interference models exhibit the same asymptotic scaling in violating the fingerprinting inequality. Our results thereby further articulate quantum interference and spatial superposition as a resource for information processing.</p>

            <p>The detection and quantification of non-Markovianity, a.k.a. memory, in quantum systems is a central problem in the theory of open quantum systems. There memory is as a result of the interaction between the system and its environment. Little is known, however, about memory effects induced by imperfect measurements on closed systems, where an entanglement with the environment is not possible. We investigate the emergence and characteristics of memory in closed systems observed via imperfect stroboscopic quantum measurements yielding coarse-grained outcomes. We consider ideal and two kinds of imperfect measurements: von Neumann measurements--the analogue of classical lumping--which destroy any coherence in the system, and genuinely quantum-lumping Lüders measurements preserving certain quantum correlations. Whereas the conditions for Markov dynamics under von Neumann lumping are the same as for classical dynamics, quantum-lumping requires stronger conditions, i.e. the absence of any detectable coherence. We introduce the concept of purely quantum memory having no classical counterpart. We illustrate our results with a quantum walk on a lattice and discuss their implications for dissipative dynamics and decoherence effects induced by more realistic measurements.</p>

            <p>In quantum communication, quantum state transfer from one location to another in a quantum network plays a prominent role, where the impact of noise could be crucial. The idea of state transfer can be fruitfully associated with quantum walk on graphs. We investigate the consequences of non-Markovian quantum noises on periodicity and state transfer induced by a discrete-time quantum walk on graphs, governed by the Grover coin operator. Different bipartite graphs, such as the path graph, cycle graph, star graph, and complete bipartite graph, present periodicity and state transfer in a discrete-time quantum walk depending on the topology of the graph. We investigate the effect of quantum non-Markovian dephasing noises, particularly quantum non-Markovian Random Telegraph Noise (RTN) and modified non-Markovian Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Noise (OUN) on state transfer and periodicity. We demonstrate how the RTN and OUN noises allow state transfer and periodicity for a finite number of steps in a quantum walk.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicolás Quesada</p>
            <p>Quadratic bosonic Hamiltonians and their associated unitary transformations form a fundamental class of operations in quantum optics, modelling key processes such as squeezing, displacement, and beam-splitting. Their Heisenberg-picture dynamics simplifies to linear (or possibly affine) transformations on quadrature operators, enabling efficient analysis and decomposition into optical gate sets using matrix operations. However, this formalism discards a phase, which, while often neglected, is essential for a complete unitary characterization. We present efficient methods to recover this phase directly from the vacuum-to-vacuum amplitude of the unitary, using calculations that scale polynomially with the number of modes and avoid Fock space manipulations. We reduce the general problem for time-dependent Hamiltonians to integration, and provide analytical results for key cases including time-independent Hamiltonians which are positive definite, passive, active, or single-mode. Finally, we show that our results can be easily used to obtain the phase associated with any Gaussian state, be it mixed or pure.</p>

            <p>In the typical implementation of a quantum error-correcting code, each stabilizer is measured by entangling one or more ancilla qubits with the data qubits and measuring the ancilla qubits to deduce the value of the stabilizer. Recently, the dynamic circuit approach has been introduced, in which stabilizers are measured without ancilla qubits. Here, we demonstrate that dynamic circuits are particularly useful for the Floquet code. Our dynamic circuit increases the timelike distance of the code, automatically removes leakage, and both significantly increases the threshold and lowers the logical error rate compared to the standard ancilla-based circuit. At a physical error rate of $10^{-3}$, we estimate a nearly $3\times$ reduction in the number of qubits required to reach a $10^{-12}$ logical error rate.</p>

            <p>We present a general theory to treat periodic solids with quantum-chemistry methods. It relies on two main developments: 1) the modeling of a solid as a Clifford torus which is a torus that is both periodic and flat and 2) the introduction of a periodic gaussian basis set that is compatible with the topology of the Clifford torus. We illustrate our approach by calculating the ground-state energy of a periodic chain of hydrogen atoms within both Hartree-Fock and coupled cluster theory. We demonstrate that our approach yields the correct ground-state energy in the thermodynamic limit by comparing it to the ground-state energy of a ring of hydrogen atoms in the same limit. Since equivalent ring-like calculations for three-dimensional solids are impossible, our approach is an excellent alternative to perform quantum-chemistry calculations of solids. Our Clifford formalism can be seamlessly combined with current implementations of quantum-chemistry methods designed for atoms and molecules to make them applicable to solids.</p>

            <h2>Barnett Effect-Induced Nonreciprocal Entanglement and Gaussian interferometric power in Magnomechanics with Optical Parametric Amplifier</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Noura Chabar, M. Amghar, Shakir Ullah, Mohamed Amazioug</p>
            <p>Nonreciprocity is a powerful tool in quantum technologies. It allows signals to be sent in one direction but not the other. In this article, we propose a method for achieving non-reciprocal entanglement and Gaussian interferometric power (GIP) via the Barnett effect. The YIG is coupled to a microwave cavity that interacts with an optical parametric amplifier (OPA). Due to the Barnett effect, giant nonreciprocal entanglement can emerge. By fine-tuning the cavity detuning, the GIP can exhibits nonreciprocal behavior. All entanglements with ideal nonreciprocity can be achieved by tuning the photon frequency detuning, appropriately choosing the cavity-magnon coupling regime, the nonlinear gain, and the phase shift of the OPA. Interestingly, the amount of entanglement nonreciprocity and its resilience to thermal occupation are remarkably enhanced by increasing the gain of the OPA. This nonreciprocity can be significantly enhanced even at relatively high temperatures. Our research offers a pathway for the realization of nonreciprocal single-phonon devices, with potential applications in quantum information processing and quantum communication. This proposed scheme could pave the way for the development of novel nonreciprocal devices that remain robust under thermal fluctuations.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Chip Co-Design for Fidelity and Entanglement Preservation: Architecture, Modeling, and QGHNN Optimization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ahmad Salmanogli, Hesam Zandi</p>
            <p>This study introduces a superconducting quantum chip architecture designed to simultaneously preserve entanglement and readout fidelity, addressing one of the key trade-offs in the development of scalable quantum hardware. In conventional quantum circuits, strong qubit qubit coupling enhances entanglement but often leads to undesired crosstalk, dephasing, and reduced measurement fidelity. To mitigate these effects, we propose a hybrid multiqubit configuration consisting of nine transmon qubits organized into interior and exterior groups, interconnected via a flux tunable qubit and a network of distributed resonators. The interior qubits along with tunable qubit form an entanglement core, while the exterior qubits operate in the dispersive regime under large detuning to enable readout. The degree of entanglement can be dynamically tuned by adjusting the coupling between the central tunable qubit and the interior qubits. The total Hamiltonian includes all significant coupling contributions, encompassing effective exchange interactions among interior and exterior qubits, as well as their mediated couplings through interface resonators. By numerically solving the complete Hamiltonian alongside the Lindblad master equation, the system dynamics are characterized, allowing evaluation of both spectroscopic features and separation fidelity. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed design maintains strong entanglement by creating the avoided-crossing region while sustaining measurement fidelity around 0.995 under realistic noise conditions. These findings confirm that entanglement strength and readout fidelity can be co-optimized within a single, reconfigurable architecture, establishing a viable route toward high-performance and scalable superconducting quantum processors.</p>

            <h2>Tractable Infinite-Horizon Stochastic Model Predictive Control for Quantum Filtering via Eigenstate Reduction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yunyan Lee, Ian R. Petersen, Daoyi Dong</p>
            <p>Model predictive control has shown potential to enhance the robustness of quantum control systems. In this work, we propose a tractable Stochastic Model Predictive Control (SMPC) framework for finite-dimensional quantum systems under continuous-time measurement and quantum filtering. Using the almost-sure eigenstate reduction of quantum trajectories, we prove that the infinite-horizon stochastic objective collapses to a fidelity term that is computable in closed form from the one-step averaged state. Consequently, the online SMPC step requires only deterministic propagation of the filter and a terminal fidelity evaluation. An advantage of this method is that it eliminates per-horizon Monte Carlo scenario sampling and significantly reduces computational load while retaining the essential stochastic dynamics. We establish equivalence and mean-square stability guarantees, and validate the approach on multi-level and Ising-type systems, demonstrating favorable scalability compared to sampling-based SMPC.</p>

            <h2>Superconducting Parametric Amplifiers: Resonator Design and Role in Qubit Readout</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Babak Mohammadian</p>
            <p>Superconducting parametric amplifiers (SPAs) are critical components for ultralow-noise qubit readout in quantum computing, addressing the critical challenge of amplifying weak quantum signals without introducing noise that degrades coherence and computational fidelity. Unlike classical amplifiers, SPAs can achieve or closely approach quantum-limited performance, specifically the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL) of half a photon of added noise for phase-preserving amplification. The core principle of SPAs relies on parametric amplification, where energy is transferred from a strong pump tone to a weak input signal through non-dissipative nonlinear mixing processes. This is enabled by intrinsic nonlinearities in superconducting materials, primarily kinetic inductance in thin films (e.g., NbTiN, Al) and, more significantly, the Josephson effect in Josephson junctions. These nonlinear elements facilitate frequency mixing (three-wave or four-wave mixing) and can operate in phase-preserving or phase-sensitive amplification modes, with the latter allowing for noise squeezing below the SQL. This chapter emphasizes the significant role of resonator design in determining critical SPA performance metrics such as gain, bandwidth, and noise characteristics. It details both lumped-element (LC) and distributed-element (coplanar waveguide, CPW) resonators, discussing their unique properties, suitability for different frequency ranges, and the importance of achieving high-quality factors (Q) for efficient energy storage and minimal loss. A practical design and simulation of a meandered quarterwavelength CPW resonator coupled to a feed line is presented, illustrating how precise control over geometric parameters optimizes resonant frequency, coupling strength, and quality factor for high-fidelity qubit state discrimination.</p>

            <h2>Foundations of Quantum Granular Computing with Effect-Based Granules, Algebraic Properties and Reference Architectures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oscar Montiel Ross</p>
            <p>This paper develops the foundations of Quantum Granular Computing (QGC), extending classical granular computing including fuzzy, rough, and shadowed granules to the quantum regime. Quantum granules are modeled as effects on a finite dimensional Hilbert space, so granular memberships are given by Born probabilities. This operator theoretic viewpoint provides a common language for sharp (projective) and soft (nonprojective) granules and embeds granulation directly into the standard formalism of quantum information theory. We establish foundational results for effect based quantum granules, including normalization and monotonicity properties, the emergence of Boolean islands from commuting families, granular refinement under Luders updates, and the evolution of granules under quantum channels via the adjoint channel in the Heisenberg picture. We connect QGC with quantum detection and estimation theory by interpreting the effect operators realizing Helstrom minimum error measurement for binary state discrimination as Helstrom type decision granules, i.e., soft quantum counterparts of Bayes optimal decision regions. Building on these results, we introduce Quantum Granular Decision Systems (QGDS) with three reference architectures that specify how quantum granules can be defined, learned, and integrated with classical components while remaining compatible with near term quantum hardware. Case studies on qubit granulation, two qubit parity effects, and Helstrom style soft decisions illustrate how QGC reproduces fuzzy like graded memberships and smooth decision boundaries while exploiting noncommutativity, contextuality, and entanglement. The framework thus provides a unified and mathematically grounded basis for operator valued granules in quantum information processing, granular reasoning, and intelligent systems.</p>

            <p>Hyperentanglement, which refers to entanglement encoded in two or more independent degrees of freedom (DOFs), is a valuable resource for the future high-capacity quantum network. Certifying hyperentanglement sources work as intended is critical for the hyperentanglement-based quantum information tasks. Self testing is the strongest certification method for quantum state and measurement under minimal assumptions, even without any knowledge of the devices' inner workings. However, the existing self testing protocols all focus on one-DOF entanglement, which cannot self test the multi-DOF entanglement. In the paper, we propose a hyperentanglement self testing framework. We take the self testing for the polarization-spatial-mode hyperentangled Bell states as an example. The self testing is based on the violation of two-dimension CHSH test in each DOF independently. The two-step swap isometry circuits are proposed for self testing the entanglement in spatial-mode and polarization DOFs, respectively. All the sixteen polarization-spatial-mode hyperentangled Bell states can be self tested. Our hyperentanglement self testing framework has three advantages. First, it is a general hyperentanglement self testing framework, and can be extended to self test multi-DOF hyperentanglement and multipartite hyperentanglement. Second, it can provide the robust hyperentanglement self testing and establish the relation between the lower bound of fidelity and the imperfect violation of Bell-like inequality in each DOF. Third, it is feasible with current experimental technology. Our hyperentanglement self testing framework provides a promising way to certify complex hyperentanglement sources, and has potential application in future high-capacity quantum network.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Soma Takemori, Kazuki Yamamoto, Akihisa Koga</p>
            <p>We investigate the non-Hermitian (NH) attractive Hubbard model with spin depairing, which is a spin-resolved asymmetric hopping that nonreciprocally operates spins in the opposite direction. We find that spin depairing stabilizes a superfluid state unique to the NH system. This phase is characterized not only by a finite order parameter, but also by the emergence of exceptional points (EPs) in the momentum space - a feature that starkly contrasts with previously discussed NH fermionic superfluidity, where EPs are absent within the superfluid state and emerge only at the onset of the superfluid breakdown. We uncover the rich mechanism underlying this ``exceptional fermionic superfluidity'' by analyzing the interplay between EPs and the effective density of states of the complex energy dispersion. Furthermore, we reveal that the exceptional superfluid state breaks down induced by strong spin depairing on the cubic lattice, while it remains robust on the square lattice.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Antony Valentini, Mira Varma</p>
            <p>We consider how the Born rule, a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics, can be tested for particles created on the shortest timescales ($\sim10^{-25}\,\mathrm{s}$) currently accessible at high-energy colliders. We focus on targeted tests of the Born rule for spin or polarisation probabilities, which offer a particularly clean experimental signal, and which can be described by a simple hidden-variables model of two-state systems proposed by Bell. These probabilities test a remarkable feature of the quantum formalism, whereby expectation values for incompatible experiments are linearly related. Born-rule violations can be parameterised by nonlinear expectation values for quantum measurements of spin or polarisation, along with anomalies in ensemble averages, which may then be constrained by experiment. Notable experiments considered here include the recent detection of single photons from top-quark decay, and the indirect measurement of tau-lepton polarisation. Repurposing these experiments as tests of the Born rule, however, presents several challenges, which are discussed in this paper.</p>

Our analysis demonstrates that, under optimized light parameters, the rectification efficiency can exceed 90\%. Moreover, the direction of rectification-whether positive or negative-can be precisely controlled by varying the polarization of the light, highlighting the potential for external optical control of electronic behavior. The effect of light irradiation is incorporated using the Floquet-Bloch ansatz combined with the minimal coupling scheme, while charge transport is computed through the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism within the Landauer-Büttiker framework.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nada Eissa, Carlos R. Ordóñez, Gustavo Valdivia-Mera</p>
            <p>Inspired by the novel idea proposed by T.~Padmanabhan in \textit{Phys.\ Rev.\ D 100, 045024 (2019)}, we develop a method to uncover the hidden thermal properties of the inertial Feynman propagator in Minkowski spacetime in a causally consistent manner. This, in turn, enables a coherent interpretation based on future-directed propagation. In our approach, the Fourier transform is implemented following the convention used in the analysis of vacuum fluctuations. As a result, future-directed propagation across causal horizons can be consistently interpreted, from the perspective of an observer confined to a causally disconnected region, as the emission of scalar quanta at the past horizon and their absorption at the future horizon. Moreover, we find that the ratio between emission and absorption processes reproduces the characteristic Boltzmann factor of a thermal ensemble. We first apply this analysis to a causal diamond of length $2\alpha$, performing a detailed study of the near-horizon geometry and thereby obtaining the temperature associated with the thermal behavior of the Minkowski vacuum as perceived by an observer with finite lifetime $2\alpha$. For completeness, we also apply the method to the right Rindler wedge, recovering the well-known Unruh temperature, $T = a/(2\pi)$. Our results demonstrate that thermality can emerge directly from causal structure, independently of acceleration or gravity, with causal diamonds encoding intrinsic thermodynamic behavior in quantum field theory.</p>

The construction can be seen as providing a natural way to isometrically embed any given finite metric space into the space of pure quantum states 'spanned' upon it. In order to show that the maps $d_p$ are indeed distance functions -- in particular, that they satisfy the triangle inequality -- we employ methods of analysis, multilinear algebra and convex geometry, obtaining a nontrivial auxiliary convexity result in the process. The paper significantly extends earlier work, resolving an important question about the geometry of quantum state space imposed by the quantum Wasserstein distances and solidifying the foundation for applications of distances $d_p$ in quantum information science.</p>

            <p>Tensor networks prepare states that share many features of states in quantum gravity. However, standard constructions are not diffeomorphism invariant and do not support an algebra of non-commuting area operators. Recently, analogues of both problems were addressed in a tensor network discretization of topological field theories (TFT) with finite or compact gauge groups. Here, we extend this work towards gravity by generalizing to gauge groups that are discrete or continuous, compact or non-compact. Applied to $\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{R}) \times \text{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ Chern-Simons theory, our construction can be interpreted as building states of three dimensional gravity with a negative cosmological constant. Our tensor networks prepare states that satisfy the constraints of Chern-Simons theory. In metric variables, this implies that the states we construct satisfy the Wheeler-DeWitt equation and momentum constraints, and so are diffeomorphism invariant.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vincent Flynn, Benedetta Flebus</p>
            <p>The identification of platforms with independently tunable nonlinearity and non-Hermiticity promises a quantitative route to far-from-equilibrium universality across many-body systems. Here we show that a conventional ferromagnetic multilayer realizes this paradigm: balancing a dc drive against Gilbert damping stabilizes a chiral spin-superfluid limit cycle that spontaneously breaks spacetime-translation symmetry. The resulting superflow is intrinsically nonreciprocal: long-wavelength magnons of opposite chirality acquire asymmetric dispersions and propagate direction-selectively, realizing a spin-superfluid diode. This asymmetry is flow-borne - it reflects broken Galilean invariance and requires neither structural asymmetry nor finely tuned gain-loss balance. Linearized dynamics in the comoving superfluid frame are intrinsically pseudo-Hermitian and, in the long-wavelength sector, can be mapped to a (1+1)D wave equation on curved spacetime. Spatial modulation of the drive enables the generation of sonic horizons that parametrically squeeze magnons and produce Hawking-like particle-hole emission. Our results establish a tabletop route from nonlinear dissipative-driven magnetization dynamics to nonreciprocal transport, nonequilibrium phase transitions, and analogue-gravity kinematics.</p>

            <p>We present a technique based on an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond capable of imaging magnetic fields with high spatio-temporal resolution. A focused laser beam is raster-scanned using an acousto-optic deflector (AOD) and NV center fluorescence is read out with a single photodetector, enabling low-noise detection with high dynamic range. The method operates in a previously unexplored regime, quasi-continuous wave optically detected magnetic resonance (qCW-ODMR). In this regime, NV centers experience short optical pump pulses for spin readout and repolarization, analogous to pulsed ODMR technique, while the microwave field remains continuously on resonance with the spin transitions. We systematically characterize this regime and show that the spin response is governed by a tunable interplay between coherent evolution and relaxation, determined by the temporal spacing between pump laser pulses. Notably, the technique does not require precise microwave pulse control, thus simplifying experimental implementation. To demonstrate its capabilities, we image time-varying magnetic fields from a microelectrode in a conductive medium with sub-millisecond temporal resolution. This approach enables flexible spatial sampling and with our diamond achieves nT$\cdot$Hz$^{-1/2}$ per pixel sensitivity, making it well suited for detecting weak, dynamic magnetic fields in biological and other complex systems.</p>

            <p>This work presents a comprehensive theoretical comparison between absorption-based and electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT)-based atomic gradient sensing in a four-level tripod system. Both methods were evaluated under identical and optimized physical conditions to ensure a fair and unbiased comparison. The analysis demonstrates that EIT, driven by its steep dispersion response, consistently outperforms conventional absorption detection across a wide range of super-Gaussian beam profiles. Under optimal detuning, EIT achieved up to an order-of-magnitude enhancement in gradient sensitivity and maintained a twofold advantage even under identical detuning. Both approaches reached sub-diffraction spatial resolution in the range of 0.29lambda-0.40lambda, with EIT exhibiting sharper edge contrast and higher localization accuracy. These results confirm EIT as a fundamentally superior approach for precision atomic gradient sensing and sub-wavelength localization, offering clear guidance for the design of next-generation optical and quantum metrology systems.</p>

Particular emphasis is placed on the challenges posed by decoherence, which constrain the practical advantages that can be realized in large-scale devices. The discussion then turns to frequency estimation in atomic clocks, highlighting how experimental constraints shape the translation of abstract quantum limits into real performance gains.

            <p>The detection of few-photon signals in a broadband background is an extreme challenge for photon counting, requiring filtering that accepts a narrow range of optical frequencies while strongly rejecting all others. Recent work [Zarraoa et. al, Phys. Rev. Res. 6, 033338 (2024)] demonstrated that trapped single atoms can act as low dark-count narrow-band photodetectors. Here we show that this ``quantum jump photodetector'' (QJPD) approach can also detect photon-level signals embedded in strong sunlight. Using a single rubidium atom as a QJPD, we count arrivals of individual narrow-band laser photons embedded in sunlight powers of order $10^{10}$ photons/s. We derive a rate-equation model for the atom's internal-state dynamics in sunlight, and find quantitative agreement with experiment. Using this model, we calculate the channel capacity over a noisy communication channel when sending weak coherent states and detecting them in the presence of sunlight, achieving a representative rate of 0.5 bits per symbol when sending 150 probe photons per 10 ms time-bin, embedded in 1 nW of sunlight (of order $10^{10}$ photons/s in the visible and near-infrared bands). The demonstration may benefit background-limited applications such as daytime light detection and ranging (LIDAR), remote magnetometry, and free-space classical and quantum optical communications.</p>

            <p>Quantum technologies, encompassing communication, computation, and metrology, rely on the generation and control of non-Gaussian states of light. These states enable secure quantum communication, fault-tolerant quantum computation, and precision sensing beyond classical limits, yet their practical realisation remains a major challenge due to reliance on high-photon-number Fock states or strong non-linearities. Here we introduce a unified optical framework that removes this constraint, using only Gaussian inputs, optical parametric amplification, and heralded photon detection. Within a single architecture, we demonstrate the generation of photon-added squeezed states with near unit fidelity, cubic-phase-like states with strong non-linearities and fidelities above 98.5%, and squeezed-cat states exceeding 99% fidelity that can be iteratively bred into GKP grid states surpassing the 9.75 dB fault-tolerance threshold. Operating entirely below 3 dB of input squeezing, the approach provides a scalable, experimentally accessible platform that unites the state resources required for quantum communication, metrology, and computation within one coherent optical framework.</p>

While PT-symmetry breaking has been studied in various physical systems, its observation on a quantum many-body level remains elusive. Here, we experimentally realize a non-Hermitian XY model in a strongly-interacting Rydberg-atom array. By measuring the Loschmidt Echo of a fully polarized state, we observe distinct dynamical signatures of a PT-symmetry-breaking phase transition. Dipole interactions are found to play a crucial role, not only determining the transition point but also triggering a non-Hermitian many-body blockade effect that protects the Loschmidt Echo from decay with a non-monotonic dependence on the system size. Our results reveal intricate interaction-induced effects on PT-symmetry breaking and open the door for exploring non-Hermitian many-body dynamics beyond single-particle and mean-field paradigms.</p>

            <h2>Fault-tolerant quantum computation with constant overhead for general noise</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthias Christandl, Omar Fawzi, Ashutosh Goswami</p>
            <p>Fault-tolerant quantum computation traditionally incurs substantial resource overhead, with both qubit and time overheads scaling polylogarithmically with the size of the computation. While prior work by Gottesman showed that constant qubit overhead is achievable under stochastic noise using quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes, it has remained an open question whether similar guarantees hold under more general, non-stochastic noise models. In this work, we address this question by considering a general circuit-level noise model defined via the diamond norm, which captures both stochastic and non-stochastic noise, including coherent and amplitude damping noise. We prove that constant qubit overhead fault-tolerant quantum computation is achievable in this general setting, using QLDPC codes with constant rate and linear minimum distance. To establish our result, we develop a fault-tolerant error correction scheme and a method for implementing logic gates under general circuit noise. These results extend the theoretical foundations of fault-tolerant quantum computation and offer new directions for fault-tolerant architectures under realistic noise models.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Coulomb drag signatures of Majorana bound states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zi-Wei Li, Jiaojiao Chen, Wei Xiong, Xiao Xue, Zeng-Zhao Li</p>
            <p>Majorana bound states (MBSs), with their non-Abelian statistics and topological protection, are key candidates for fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, their unambiguous identification in solid-state systems remains a fundamental challenge. Here, we present a theoretical study demonstrating that drag transport in a capacitively coupled double quantum dot system offers a robust and nonlocal probe of weakly coupled MBSs. Using the master equation approach, we investigate both steady-state and transient dynamics and uncover a distinctive signature of MBSs, i.e., the emergence of pronounced split peaks in the drag transconductance, directly linked to inter-MBS coupling. We further show that the dynamics of quantum coherence exhibit an inverse correlation with the emergence and enhancement of MBS-induced split peaks in the drag transconductance as the inter-MBS coupling increases. A comparative analysis with Andreev bound states (ABSs) reveals key differences, that is, MBS-induced transconductance peaks are symmetric and robust, while ABS features are asymmetric and sensitive to perturbations. These findings establish clear experimental criteria for distinguishing MBSs and provide a practical framework for probing Majorana physics through nonlocal transport.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Charles Creffield, Fernando Sols, Marco Schirò, Nathan Goldman</p>
            <p>The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model has attracted widespread attention due to its relevance to diverse areas of physics, such as high temperature superconductivity, black holes, and quantum chaos. The model is, however, extremely challenging to realize experimentally. In this work, we show how a particular form of Floquet engineering, termed ``kinetic driving'', effectively eliminates single-particle processes and creates quasi-random all-to-all interactions when applied to models of Hubbard type. For the specific case of the Bose-Hubbard model, we explicitly verify that the driven system indeed reproduces SYK physics by direct comparison of the spectral form factor and out-of-time ordered correlation functions (OTOCs). Our findings indicate that a cold-atom realization of kinetic driving -- achieved through modulation of hopping amplitudes in an optical lattice -- offers a practical and accurate platform for quantum simulation of the SYK model.</p>

Generalizing the idea behind Pauli tableaux, we introduce a type system and lambda calculus for projective Cliffords called LambdaPC, which captures well-formed Clifford operations via a Curry-Howard correspondence with a particular encoding of the Clifford and Pauli groups. Importantly, the language captures not just qubit operations, but qudit operations for any dimension $d$. Throughout the paper we explore what it means to program with projective Cliffords through a number of examples and a case study focusing on stabilizer error correcting codes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ke-Xiong Yan, Yuan Qiu, Yang Xiao, Jie Song, Ye-Hong Chen, Yan Xia</p>
            <p>The dynamical Casimir effect (DCE) describes the energy conversion from a mechanical motion to the electromagnetic fields. When the mechanical oscillator is in a mechanically excited state, the free evolution due to the DCE produces radiation in the vacuum, in analogy with the spontaneous emission from an excited atom. In this manuscript, we investigate such a spontaneous radiation process by employing the quantum trajectory approach. When the dissipation rate of the system is very low, there can be a reversible energy exchange between the mirror in the excited state and the vacuum field, and this reversible exchange is called vacuum Casimir-Rabi oscillations. Multiple quantum trajectory simulations of this process show that the number of trajectories responsible for the generation of radiation can reach a significant value when the mechanical dissipation rate is less than the photon dissipation rate. We also find that two-photon (two/three-phonon) bundle emission occurs in photon (phonon) emission. In comparison to pure two-photon and three-phonon free dissipation, the probability of two-photon bundle emission and two-phonon bundle emission are observed to be marginally elevated as a consequence of the presence of the DCE. This pattern may assist in developing a deeper comprehension of the physical characteristics of photon and phonon emission in the DCE.</p>

            <h2>Error-mitigated quantum metrology via enhanced virtual purification</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaodie Lin, Haidong Yuan</p>
            <p>Quantum metrology stands as a leading application of quantum science and technology, yet noise often constrains its precision and sensitivity. In near-term quantum metrology, existing protocols largely depend on virtual state purification, but significant noise accumulation and additional noise from the implementations of these protocols can impede their effectiveness. We propose enhanced virtual channel purification to address these problems, yielding enhanced virtual state purification as a by-product. Within sequential quantum metrology schemes, our error analysis reveals substantial bias reduction and quantum advantages in sampling cost when the number of encoding channels is ${\mathcal{O}}(p^{-1})$, where $p$ represents the error rate of encoding channels. In this range, our methods demonstrate significant improvements in parameter estimation precision and robustness against practical noise, as evidenced by numerical simulations for both single- and multi-parameter tasks. Particularly, these methods can naturally extend beyond quantum metrology, indicating their broad applicability in quantum information and quantum computation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chenan Wei, Liu Yang, Qing-Dong Jiang</p>
            <p>Topological phases in frustrated quantum magnetic systems have captivated researchers for decades, with the chiral spin liquid (CSL) standing out as one of the most compelling examples. Featured by long-range entanglement, topological order, and exotic fractional excitations, the CSL has inspired extensive exploration for practical realizations. In this work, we demonstrate that CSLs can emerge in a kagome lattice driven by vacuum quantum fluctuations over the non-interacting vacuum within a single-mode gyrotropic cavity. The gyrotropic cavity imprints quantum fluctuations with time-reversal symmetry breaking and stabilizes a robust CSL phase without external laser excitation. Moreover, we identify experimentally accessible observables -- such as average photon number and transport properties -- that reveal connections between photon dynamics and the emergent chiral order. Our findings establish a novel pathway for creating, controlling, and probing topological and symmetry-breaking quantum phases in strongly correlated systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eloïc Vallée, Owidiusz Makuta, Patrick Emonts, Rhine Samajdar, Jordi Tura</p>
            <p>Bell nonlocality provides a robust scalable route to the efficient certification of quantum states. Here, we introduce a general framework for constructing Bell inequalities tailored to the $\mathbb{Z}_d$ toric code for odd prime local dimensions. Selecting a suitable subset of stabilizer operators and mapping them to generalized measurement observables, we compute multipartite Bell expressions whose quantum maxima admit a sum-of-squares decomposition. We show that these inequalities are maximally violated by all states in the ground-state manifold of the $\mathbb{Z}_d$ toric code, and determine their classical (local) bounds through a combination of combinatorial tiling arguments and explicit optimization. As a concrete application, we analyze the case of $d=3$ and demonstrate that the maximal violation self-tests the full qutrit toric-code subspace, up to local isometries and complex conjugation. This constitutes, to our knowledge, the first-ever example of self-testing a qutrit subspace. Extending these constructions, we further present schemes to enhance the ratio of classical--quantum bounds and thus improve robustness to experimental imperfections. Our results establish a pathway toward device-independent certification of highly entangled topological quantum matter and provide new tools for validating qudit states in error-correcting codes and quantum simulation platforms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Connor Casey, Albert Williams, Catherine McCaffrey, Eugene Rotherham, Nathan Darby</p>
            <p>Quantum networking seeks to enable global entanglement distribution through terrestrial and free space channels; however, the exponential loss in these channels necessitates quantum repeaters with efficient, long lived quantum memories (QMs). Space based architectures, particularly satellite assisted links, offer a path to truly global connectivity, yet they demand QMs that are compatible with orbital factors such as infrared radiation and the unique challenges of operating aboard a satellite. In this work, we propose a multimode quantum memory (MMQM) for low Earth orbit (LEO) repeaters based on the atomic frequency comb (AFC) protocol. Our design integrates a hybrid alkali noble gas ensemble in an optical cavity, using alkali atoms for strong photon matter coupling and noble gas nuclear spins for minutes to hours coherence, all without the need for cryogenics. The architecture natively supports temporal and spectral multiplexing, enabling the storage of 100 modes to parallelize probabilistic operations and overcome light limited round trip times. Representative link budgets at $h = 500$ km with realistic apertures, $\eta_{\text{mem}}\gtrsim 70%$, and $t_{\text{buffer}}$ of several minutes predict improvements of up to two orders of magnitude in per pass success probability and instantaneous SKR relative to a memoryless dual downlink, with clear scaling in $N$. Our contributions are (i) a non cryogenic, space ready multimode memory, (ii) a systems analysis coupling mode count, storage time, and orbital geometry to achievable rate, and (iii) a near term implementation roadmap. Together, these results indicate feasibility with current to near term technology and provide a practical path toward a high rate, space enabled quantum internet.</p>

            <p>We theoretically present new unit circuits of Kerr parametric oscillators (KPOs) with four-body interactions, which enable the scalable embedding of all-to-all connected logical Ising spins using the Lechner-Hauke-Zoller (LHZ) scheme. These unit circuits enable four-body interactions using linear couplers, making the circuit fabrication and characterization much simpler than those of conventional unit circuits with nonlinear couplers. Numerical calculations indicate that the magnitudes of the coupling constants can be comparable to those in conventional circuits. On the basis of this theory, we designed a four-KPO circuit and experimentally confirmed the four-body correlation by measuring the pump-phase dependence of the parity of the four-KPO states. We show that the choice of the pump frequencies are important not only to enable the four-body interaction, but to cancel the effects of other unwanted interactions. Using the circuit, we demonstrated the quantum annealing based on the LHZ scheme, where the strength of the interaction between the logical Ising spins is mapped to the local field and controlled by a coherent drive applied to each KPO.</p>

            <p>We propose a pulse and continuous wave (CW) hybrid architecture of continuous-variable measurement-based optical quantum computation utilizing the strengths of both pulsed and CW light. In this architecture, input and ancillary non-Gaussian quantum states necessary for fault-tolerance and universality of quantum computing are generated with pulsed light, whereas quantum processors including continuous-variable cluster states and homodyne measurement systems are operated with CW light. This architecture is expected to enable both generation of quantum states with shorter optical wavepackets and low-loss manipulation and measurement of these states, thus is compatible with ultrafast and low-loss quantum information processing. In this study, as a proof-of-principle, an ultrafast homodyne measurement using CW local oscillator was performed on single-photon states generated with pulsed light. The measured single-photon state's temporal width was around 70 ps and the value of the Wigner function at the origin was W(0,0) = -0.153 +/- 0.003, which is highly non-classical. This will be a core technology for realizing high-speed optical quantum information processing.</p>

            <h2>Optimized Many-Hypercube Codes toward Lower Logical Error Rates and Earlier Realization</h2>

            <p>Many-hypercube codes [H. Goto, Sci. Adv. 10, eadp6388 (2024)], concatenated ${[[n,n-2,2]]}$ quantum error-detecting codes ($n$ is even), have recently been proposed as high-rate quantum codes suitable for fault-tolerant quantum computing. However, the original many-hypercube codes with ${n=6}$ have large code block sizes at high concatenation levels (216 and 1296 physical qubits per block at levels 3 and 4, respectively), making not only experimental realization difficult but also logical error rates high. Toward earlier experimental realization and lower logical error rates, here we investigate smaller many-hypercube codes obtained by concatenating $[[6,4,2]]$ and/or $[[4,2,2]]$ codes, where, e.g., $D_{6,4,4}$ denotes the many-hypercube code using $[[6,4,2]]$ at level 1 and $[[4,2,2]]$ at levels 2 and 3. As a result, we found a surprising fact: $D_{6,4,4}$ ($D_{6,6,4,4}$) can achieve lower block error rates than $D_{4,4,4}$ ($D_{4,4,4,4}$), despite its higher encoding rate. Focusing on level 3, we also developed efficient fault-tolerant encoders realizing about 60% overhead reduction while maintaining or even improving the performance, compared to the original design. Using them, we numerically confirmed that $D_{6,4,4}$ also achieves the best performance for logical controlled-NOT gates in a circuit-level noise model. These results will be useful for early experimental realization of fault-tolerant quantum computing with high-rate quantum codes.</p>

            <p>Multiqubit gates that involve three or more qubits are usually thought to be of little significance for fault-tolerant quantum error correction because single gate faults can lead to high-weight correlated errors. However, recent works have shown that multiqubit gates can be beneficial for measurement-free fault-tolerant quantum error correction and for fault-tolerant stabilizer readout in unrotated surface codes. In this work, we investigate multiqubit Rydberg gates that are useful for fault-tolerant quantum error correction in single-species neutral-atom platforms and can be implemented with a single, non-addressed laser pulse. We develop an open-source Python package to generate analytical, few-parameter pulses that implement the desired gates while minimizing gate errors due to Rydberg-state decay. The tool also allows us to identify parameter-optimal pulses, characterized by a minimal parameter count for the pulse ansatz. Measurement-free quantum error correction protocols require CCZ gates, which we analyze for atoms arranged in symmetric and asymmetric configurations. We investigate the performance of these schemes for various single-, two-, and three-qubit gate error rates, showing that break-even performance of measurement-free QEC is within reach of current hardware. Moreover, we study Floquet quantum error correction protocols that comprise two-body stabilizer measurements. Those can be realized using global three-qubit gates, and we show that this can lead to a significant reduction in shuttling operations. Simulations with realistic circuit-level noise indicate that applying three-qubit gates for stabilizer measurements in Floquet codes can yield competitive logical qubit performance in experimentally relevant error regimes.</p>

            <p>Emission and absorption spectra of molecular films are impacted by low-frequency molecular vibrations. These vibrations define the linewidths of the absorption and emission spectral peaks, as well as the Stokes shift. In cavities that use a molecular film as an active medium, low-frequency molecular vibrations facilitate the thermalization of light, enabling the formation of Bose-Einstein condensation. In this work, I employ perturbation theory for Lindblad superoperators and derive the contribution of the low-frequency molecular vibrations to the thermalization rate of light in a weak coupling regime between light and matter. The derived thermalization rate applies for any cavity design but depends on the local microscopic properties of low-frequency molecular vibrations. I provide an estimation for the thermalization rate, which requires only knowledge of the macroscopic parameters of the system: light-matter interaction strength, resonant frequencies of the cavity and excitons, number of molecules in the illuminated area, and the linewidth temperature dependence of the 0-0 peak in the emission spectra of standalone molecular film.</p>

We demonstrate this approach for monitoring relaxation processes in 6000 mA h lithium-ion cells following pulsed discharges across a range of pulse durations and currents as well as states of charge. The measurement results are benchmarked against superconducting-quantum-interference-device (SQUID) magnetometry and validated with three-dimensional finite element simulations. Equivalent circuit models are employed to interpret the relaxation profiles, revealing spatially resolved features and transient magnetic-field signatures that are inaccessible with complementary non-invasive techniques such as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).

            <p>Quantum entanglement is a key resource in quantum information science, playing an essential role in quantum key distribution (QKD), quantum networks, and distributed quantum computing. However, practical applications require techniques capable of reliably distributing entanglement under lossy and noisy conditions. In this work, we demonstrate that a simple configuration using two polarization-maintaining fibers (PMFs) arranged in a cross-axis alignment enables stable distribution of entangled photon pairs without the need for real-time polarization compensation. To support this, we performed quantum information modeling and fidelity simulations for the cross-aligned PMF pair, and experimentally compared the entanglement preservation and interference fringe stability in setups based on standard single-mode fibers (SMFs) and PMFs. The experimental results show that the PMF-based configuration achieves an average visibility of 0.867 and an error propagation of 0.023 under unstable conditions, whereas the SMF setup exhibits a significantly lower stability with an average visibility of 0.444 and an error propagation of 0.167 under the same conditions. These results indicate that the cross-aligned PMF pair allows robust entanglement transmission without complex active compensation devices, suggesting its suitability for reliable quantum state distribution in long-distance quantum communication, drone-based QKD, and multi-user quantum networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eyal Buks</p>
            <p>The response of a ferrimagnetic sphere resonator to an externally applied parametric excitation is experimentally studied. Measurement results are compared with predictions derived from a theoretical model, which is based on the hypothesis that disentanglement spontaneously occurs in quantum systems. According to this hypothesis, time evolution is governed by a modified master equation having an added nonlinear term that deterministically generates disentanglement. It is found that the disentanglement--based model is compatible with the experimental results. In particular, the model can qualitatively account for an experimentally observed instability in the system under study, which cannot be derived from any theoretical model that is based on a linear master equation.</p>

            <h2>Folded optimal transport and its application to separable quantum optimal transport</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas Borsoni</p>
            <p>We introduce folded optimal transport, as a way of extending a cost or distance defined on the extreme boundary of a convex to the whole set, broadening the framework of standard optimal transport, found to be the particular case where the convex is a simplex. Relying on Choquet's theory and standard optimal transport, we introduce the so-called folded Kantorovitch cost and folded Wasserstein distance, and study the metric properties it provides to the convex. We then apply the construction to the quantum setting, and obtain an actual separable quantum Wasserstein distance on the set of density matrices from a distance on the set of pure states, closely related to the semi-distance of Beatty and Stilck-França [3], and of which we obtain a variety of properties. Folded optimal transport provides a unified setting for both classical and separable quantum optimal transport, and we also find that the semiclassical Golse-Paul [12] cost writes as a folded Kantorovitch cost.</p>

            <p>Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) has emerged as a promising approach for secure quantum communication, offering advantages such as high key generation rates, compatibility with standard telecommunication infrastructure, and potential for integration on photonic chips. This review provides an accessible introduction to the theory of CV-QKD, aimed at researchers entering this rapidly developing field. We focus on fundamental concepts, key protocols, and security analysis essential for understanding CV-QKD systems, with a special emphasis on prepare-and-measure protocols using coherent states under asymptotic security conditions. We explain their equivalence to entanglement-based protocols and detail the security proof framework against collective attacks, encompassing both Gaussian and discrete modulation schemes. We also briefly address more advanced topics, including measurement-device-independent CV-QKD and finite-size security analysis. This work is motivated by Brazil's growing investment in quantum communication technologies. By presenting a clear learning path from basic concepts to advanced topics, this work aims to equip newcomers with the essential tools to engage with current research in CV-QKD, thereby supporting the training of a new generation of researchers in this strategic field.</p>

            <h2>Hybrid Quantum State Preparation via Data Compression</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emad Rezaei Fard Boosari, Maryam Afsary</p>
            <p>Quantum state preparation (QSP) for a general $n$-qubit state requires $O(2^n)$ CNOT gates and circuit depth, making exact amplitude encoding (EAE) impractical for near-term quantum hardware. We introduce an ancilla-free hybrid classical-quantum strategy that reduces this cost to $O(poly(n))$ for a broad class of compressible data. The method first applies a classical compression step to obtain a $d$-sparse representation of the input, loads this sparse vector using a sparse-state preparation routine, and then reconstructs the target state through a polynomial-depth quantum inverse transform. We evaluate the framework on synthetic benchmark signals and real biomedical time series using Fourier and Haar transforms, demonstrating substantial reductions in CNOT counts and circuit depth compared to EAE, together with competitive performance relative to the Fourier Series Loader (FSL). The quantum simulation results show that combining classical data compression with quantum decompression provides a scalable framework for efficient QSP, reducing quantum overhead without requiring variational training or ancillary registers.</p>

            <p>Scalable quantum computing requires architectural solutions beyond monolithic processors. Distributed quantum computing (DQC) addresses this challenge by interconnecting smaller quantum nodes through quantum communication protocols, enabling collaborative computation. While several experimental and theoretical proposals for DQC exist, emulator platforms are essential tools for exploring their feasibility under realistic conditions. In this work, we introduce a benchmarking framework to evaluate DQC emulators using a distributed implementation of the inverse Quantum Fourier Transform ($\mathrm{QFT}^{\dagger}$) as a representative test case, which enables efficient phase recovery from pre-encoded Fourier states. The QFT is partitioned across nodes using teleportation-based protocols, and performance is analyzed in terms of execution time, memory usage, and fidelity with respect to a monolithic baseline. As part of this work, we review a broad range of emulators, identifying their capabilities and limitations for programming distributed quantum algorithms. Many platforms either lacked support for teleportation protocols or required complex workarounds. Consequently, we select and benchmark four representative emulators: Qiskit Aer, SquidASM, Interlin-q, and SQUANCH. They differ significantly in their support for discrete-event simulation, quantum networking, noise modeling, and parallel execution. Our results highlight the trade-offs between architectural fidelity and simulation scalability, providing a foundation for future emulator development and the validation of distributed quantum protocols. This framework can be extended to support additional algorithms and emulators.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Negin Mashayekhi, Mohammad Reza Reshadinezhad, Antonio Rubio, Shekoofeh Moghimi</p>
            <p>The quantum and reversible paradigm merges the principles of quantum mechanics and reversible computation to enable information-preserving processing. It supports next-generation computing architectures that provide improved scalability and enhanced computational efficiency. Within these architectures, the decimal adder is a key arithmetic component, particularly for Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) operations widely used in financial and commercial systems. However, most reversible BCD adders focus primarily on quantum and reversible metrics, overlooking the critical influence of delay, which makes balanced optimization a significant challenge. This paper presents two reversible BCD adder designs optimized for both delay and quantum cost. One design integrates the decimal carry-skip technique to improve the overall delay. Using reversible logic gates, the proposed architectures efficiently perform BCD addition and implement the required correction logic while maintaining full reversibility. Evaluation results indicate that the proposed designs surpass existing reversible BCD adders, achieving best-case average improvements of 85.12% in delay and 30.75% in quantum cost. These advancements demonstrate the potential of the proposed adders for integration into future quantum-based arithmetic units and scalable reversible computing systems. Moreover, analysis of real banking transaction data underscores the practical importance of BCD addition and its widespread use in accurate and efficient monetary computations.</p>

            <h2>Automated Compilation Including Dropouts: Tolerating Defective Components in Stabiliser Codes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stasiu Wolanski</p>
            <p>Utility-scale solid-state quantum devices will need to fabricate quantum devices at scale using imperfect processes. By introducing tolerance to fabrication defects into the design of the quantum devices, we can improve the yield of usable quantum chips and lower the cost of useful systems. Automated Compilation Including Dropouts (ACID) is a framework that works in the ancilla-free (or `middle-out') paradigm, to generate syndrome extraction circuits for general stabiliser codes in the presence of defective couplers or qubits. In the ancilla-free paradigm, we do not designate particular qubits as measurement ancillas, instead measuring stabilisers using any of the data qubits in their support. This approach leads to a great deal of flexibility in how syndrome extraction circuits can be implemented. ACID works by constructing and solving an optimisation problem within the ancilla-free paradigm to find a short syndrome extraction circuit. Applied to the surface code, ACID produces syndrome-extraction circuits of depth between $1\times$ (no overhead) and $1.5\times$ relative to the depth of defect-free circuits. The LUCI algorithm, the best prior art, yielded a $2 \times$ overhead, so ACID offers a significant time saving. The yield of surface code chips with a logical error rate at most $10\times$ the dropout-free baseline is up to $3\times$ higher using ACID than using LUCI. I demonstrate the broad applicability of ACID by compiling syndrome extraction circuits for bivariate bicycle codes and the colour code. For these circuits, we incur a circuit-depth overhead of between $1\times$ (no overhead) and $2.5\times$ relative to defect-free circuits. I believe this work is the first to simulate both of these families of codes in the presence of fabrication defects.</p>

We investigate on general grounds the properties of such unphysical quantum channels by considering a random matrix ensemble modeling noisy quantum algorithms.

Additional structure imposed by the locality of noise channels of the quantum computer emerges in terms of a hierarchy of timescales.</p>

Since different interpretations of quantum mechanics entail different responses to the heptalemma, we get a novel taxonomy of such interpretations. Beyond the application to quantum mechanics, the heptalemma offers a general diagnostic criterion for determining whether a given scientific domain should count as classical or not, and if not, how it departs from classicality.</p>

            <p>The generation of engineered quantum states of light via nonlinear processes is fundamental for quantum technologies based on photons. Although embedding nonlinear materials within resonant structures allows for the enhancement and tailoring of photon properties, accurately modeling these quantum interactions remains a challenge. In this work, we apply the asymptotic-fields formalism, an approach based on scattering theory, to describe nonlinear optical processes within a Fabry-Pérot cavity. Unlike previous applications of this formalism, we explicitly account for reflections in the system. We derive the interaction Hamiltonian and calculate photon-pair generation rates using perturbation theory. The versatility of this model is illustrated through three examples: (i) spontaneous parametric down-conversion in an idealized cavity with flat-response mirrors; (ii) the generation of counter-propagating photon pairs in a periodically-poled material; and (iii) spontaneous four-wave mixing in a cavity built with Bragg reflectors.</p>

            <p>Quantum Separation Logic (QSL) has been proposed as an effective tool to improve the scalability of deductive reasoning for quantum programs. In QSL, separation is interpreted as disentanglement, and the frame rule brings a notion of entanglement-local specification (one that only talks about the qubits entangled with those acted upon by the program). In this paper, we identify two notions of locality unique to the quantum domain, and we construct a novel quantum separation logic, RapunSL, which is able to soundly reduce reasoning about superposition states to reasoning about pure states (basis-locality), and reasoning about mixed states arising from measurement to reasoning about pure states (outcome-locality). To do so, we introduce two connectives, linear combination and mixing, which together with separation provide a dramatic improvement in the scalability of reasoning, as we demonstrate on a series of challenging case studies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anthony O. Lara, Justin J. Talbot, Zhe Wang, Martin Head-Gordon</p>
            <p>Large atomic-orbital (AO) basis sets of at least triple and preferably quadruple-zeta (QZ) size are required to adequately converge Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) calculations towards the complete basis set limit. However, incrementing the cardinal number by one nearly doubles the AO basis dimension, and the computational cost scales as the cube of the AO dimension, so this is very computationally demanding. In this work, we develop and test a natural atomic orbital (NAO) scheme in which the NAOs are obtained as eigenfunctions of atomic blocks of the density matrix in a one-center orthogonalized representation. The NAO representation enables one-center compression of the AO basis in a manner that is optimal for a given threshold, by discarding NAOs with occupation numbers below that threshold. Extensive tests using the Hartree-Fock functional suggest that a threshold of $10^{-5}$ can yield a compression factor (ratio of AO to compressed NAO dimension) between 2.5 and 4.5 for the QZ pc-3 basis. The errors in relative energies are typically less than 0.1 kcal/mol when the compressed basis is used instead of the uncompressed basis. Between 10 and 100 times smaller errors (i.e., usually less than 0.01 kcal/mol) can be obtained with a threshold $10^{-7}$, while the compression factor is typically between 2 and 2.5.</p>

            <p>Starting from the foundational axiomatization of the perceptual color space initiated by Schrödinger in 1920 and eventually refined by Resnikoff in 1974, Berthier, Provenzi and their collaborators have recently proposed a reformulation of perceptual color attributes within the framework of quantum information. Their work is based on the Jordan algebra formalism of quantum theories and, more specifically, on a quantum system described by a spin factor over the field of real numbers. This theoretical framework is not that of ordinary quantum mechanics, mainly because it requires dealing with rebits, whereas the latter uses qubits. The aim of this paper is to show that this difference in no way hinders the implementation of experimental protocols for testing the validity of the predictions of the color perception model. In particular, we show how to compute the quantum information based perceptual attributes of perceived colors in terms of qubit density matrices.</p>

            <p>We are at the dawn of the second quantum revolution, where our ability to create and control individual quantum systems is poised to drive transformative advancements in basic science, computation, and everyday life. However, quantum theory has long been conceived as notoriously hard to learn, creating a significant barrier to workforce development, informed decision-making by stakeholders and policymakers, and broader public understanding. This paper is concerned with Quantum Picturalism, a novel visual mathematical language for quantum physics. Originally developed over two decades ago to explore the foundational structure of quantum theory, this rigorous diagrammatic framework has since been adopted in both academia and industry as a powerful tool for quantum computing research and software development. Here, we demonstrate its potential as a transformative educational methodology. We report the findings from a pilot study involving 54 UK high school students, randomly selected from a pool of 734 volunteers across the UK. Despite the absence of advanced mathematical prerequisites, these students demonstrated a strong conceptual grasp of key quantum principles and operations. On an assessment comprising university graduate-level exam questions, participants achieved an 82% pass rate, with 48% obtaining a distinction-level grade. These results pave the way for making quantum more inclusive, lowering traditional cognitive and demographic barriers to quantum learning. This approach has the potential to broaden participation in the field and provide a promising new entry point for stakeholders, future experts, and the general public.</p>

            <p>Confinement is one of the hallmarks of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Yet, its first-principle characterization, even in simpler models, remains elusive. Through a combination of group-theoretical arguments and numerical analysis, we show that the physical consequences of confinement in a class of discrete non-Abelian lattice gauge theories (LGTs), the dihedral groups $D_N$, are intimately connected with the presence of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ central subgroup. When the center is trivial (for odd $N$), static charges are screened by a gluon cloud, forming composite objects known in SU$(N)$ gauge theories as gluelumps. This finding implies that string breaking can occur through fluctuations of the electric field only, without the need to nucleate particle--antiparticle pairs from the vacuum. Furthermore, numerical analysis hints at finite-range interactions between the gluelumps in the continuum limit. Our results showcase how the rich and intricate physics typically associated with QCD can emerge in much simpler discrete non-Abelian LGTs, making them ideal settings to test this phenomenology both in numerical calculations and in near-term quantum devices.</p>

            <p>Computing the subleading logarithmic term in the entanglement entropy (EE) of (2+1)d quantum many-body systems remains a significant challenge, despite its critical role in revealing universal information about quantum states and quantum critical points (QCPs). Capitalizing on recent algorithmic advances that enable the stable calculation of EE as an exponential observable, we develop a {\it bubble basis} projector quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm to precisely and efficiently compute the universal corner EE along a parameter trajectory connecting the Ising and Gaussian QCPs; where in the latter case there exists an analytic value to benchmark with. Our approach eliminates the dominant area-law term directly within the QMC sampling, thereby promoting the coveted subleading logarithmic term to the leading contribution. We apply this technique to calculate the EE in a (2+1)d square-lattice transverse-field Ising model augmented with a four-body interaction, tracing a path from the Ising to the Gaussian QCPs and then to the first-order transition. The consistent values obtained for the universal corner EE along the path validate the reliability and precision of our approach for extracting challenging entanglement properties. These results establish the long-sought connection between the universal values of an exactly solvable limit and those of a strongly correlated regime at (2+1)d.</p>

            <p>Bond breaking in the presence of highly energetic carriers is central to many important phenomena in physics and chemistry, including radiation damage, hot-carrier degradation, activation of dopant-hydrogen complexes in semiconductors, and photocatalysis. Describing these processes from first principles has remained an elusive goal. Here we introduce a comprehensive theoretical framework for the dissociation process, emphasizing the need for a non-adiabatic approach. We benchmark the results for the case of silicon-hydrogen bond dissocation, a primary process for hot-carrier degradation. Passivation of Si dangling bonds by hydrogen is vital in all Si devices because it eliminates electrically active mid-gap states; understanding the mechanism for dissociation of these bonds is therefore crucial for device technology. While the need for a non-adiabatic approach has been previously recognized, explicitly obtaining diabatic states for solid-state systems has been an outstanding challenge. We demonstrate how to obtain these states by applying a partitioning scheme to the Hamiltonian obtained from first-principles density functional theory. Our results demonstrate that bond dissociation can occur when electrons temporarily occupy the antibonding states, generating a highly repulsive excited-state potential that causes the hydrogen nuclear wavepacket to shift and propagate rapidly. Based on the Menzel-Gomer-Redhead (MGR) model, we show that after moving on this excited-state potential on femtosecond timescales, a portion of the nuclear wavepacket can continue to propagate even after the system relaxes back to the ground state, allowing us to determine the dissociation probability. Our results provide essential insights into the fundamental processes that drive carrier-induced bond breaking in general, and specifically elucidate hydrogen-related degradation in Si devices.</p>

            <p>We introduce color Heisenberg-Lie (super)algebras graded by the abelian groups $Z_3^2$, $Z_2^p\times Z_3^2$ for $p=1,2,3$, and investigate the properties of their associated multi-particle quantum paraoscillators. In the Rittenberg-Wyler's color Lie (super)algebras framework the above abelian groups are the simplest ones which induce mixed brackets interpolating commutators and anticommutators. These mixed brackets allow to accommodate two types of parastatistics: one based on the permutation group (beyond bosons and fermions in any space dimension) and an anyonic parastatistics based on the braid group. In both such cases the two broad classes of paraparticles are given by parabosons and parafermions. Mixed-bracket parafermions are created by nilpotent operators; they satisfy a generalized Pauli exclusion principle leading to roots-of-unity truncations in their multi-particle energy spectrum (braided Majorana qubits and their Gentile-type parastatistics are recovered in this color Lie superalgebra setting). Mixed-bracket parabosons do not admit truncations of the spectrum; the minimal detectable signature of their parastatistics is encoded in the measurable probability density of two indistinguishable parabosonic oscillators in a given energy eigenstate.</p>

            <h2>Spectral form factor and power spectrum for trapped rotating interacting bosons: An exact diagonalization study</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohd Talib, M. A. H. Ahsan</p>
            <p>We present an exact diagonalization study of the spectral form factor and the power spectrum for externally impressed rotating bosons in a quasi-two-dimensional harmonic trap interacting via repulsive Gaussian potential. Our focus is on the spectral correlations arising from the condensate depletion as a result of the formation of quantized vortices and the strong interaction, which leads to chaos in the system. We consider two distinct interaction regimes: moderate, where the interaction energy is small compared to the trap energy, and strong, where it is comparable. For the non-rotating case, the spectral form factor (SFF) in the moderate interaction regime exhibits a dip-plateau structure characteristic of integrable systems, while in the strong interaction regime it develops a weak ramp, signalling a transition to pseudo-integrable behavior. For the rotating single-vortex state, the SFF in the moderate interaction regime shows the onset of a weak ramp consistent with pseudo-integrability, whereas in the strong interaction regime the ramp becomes significantly more pronounced, indicating strongly chaotic behavior. For the multi-vortex states in the strong interacting regime, the SFF exhibits a clear dip-ramp-plateau structure, indicative of chaotic behavior. The corresponding power spectrum results further corroborate these findings: integrable system exhibits the characteristic $1/f^{\alpha}$ (with $\alpha \approx2$) noise, chaotic system shows the ubiquitous $1/f^{\alpha}$ (with $\alpha \approx 1$) noise, and pseudo-integrable system yields intermediate exponents with $1 < \alpha < 2$.</p>

            <p>We use the Gaussian Phase-Space Representation to solve the real-time dynamic of interacting fermions in 1D, 2D, and 3D systems. The method is exact up to a spiking point, which represents a limit on the practical simulation time. The spiking can be delayed, and the practical simulation time extended, by adjusting the gauges of the representation, resulting in different equivalent stochastic differential equations. Here, we work on the so-called diffusion gauge and propose an algorithm to find efficiently new implementations of the noise terms. Compared with our initial results [F. Rousse \textit{et al.} 2024, J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. \textbf{57}, 015303], the new method achieves a significantly longer practical simulation time and can be applied to significantly larger systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Timur Gubaev, Philipp Pfeffer, Christian Dreßler, Jörg Schumacher</p>
            <p>We present a variational quantum algorithm that solves the one-dimensional diffusion problem with a space-dependent diffusion constant $D(x)$. This problem is relevant for the exchange of hydroxide ions across a multi-layer membrane in an alkaline electrolyzer. We use $16$ to $64$ grid points across the membrane, resulting from $n=4$ to $6$ data qubits for the ideal quantum simulations that are based on the Qiskit software. For these qubit numbers, the depth of the parametric quantum circuit has been chosen to ensure sufficient expressibility. The state preparation requires particular attention since the diffusivity $D$ is piecewise constant in the different layers with discontinuities at the interface. Furthermore, we compare different classical optimization schemes with respect to their convergence in the VQA method. We demonstrate the applicability of the quantum algorithm to a problem with non-trivial boundary conditions and jump conditions of the diffusion constant and outline possible extensions of the proof-of-concept application case of quantum computing.</p>

Using the technique of combinatorial designs, we also determine the quantum chromatic number of the distance-2 Hamming graph, whose edges consist of binary vectors of Hamming distance 2, for infinitely many length.</p>

            <p>We study the van der Waals-London force, which is typically associated with fluctuating dipoles in atoms, in a mesoscopic circuit consisting of two inductively coupled superconducting loops. We investigate the ``inductive" van der Waals-London interaction using both semiclassical and quantum electrodynamic (QED) approaches. The semiclassical model predicts a repulsive interaction due to anticorrelated current fluctuations. In contrast, the QED framework, which incorporates virtual photon exchange, reveals a predominantly attractive force. A key contribution comes from a state-independent two-photon exchange, which is absent in the semiclassical description and undetectable by spectroscopy. Our study introduces a new experimental platform for measuring the van der Waals force between individual artificial atoms via controlled mesoscopic circuits.</p>

            <p>The ability to switch and program molecular transitions via deterministically located plasmonic nanoantennae presents opportunities for wide spectrum of applications from biosensors to quantum computing. Due to its topology, toroidal nanoantenna (TNA) focuses immense amount of three-dimensional (3D) local electric field by toroidal moment while allowing pre and post positioning around quantum emitters (QEs). Here, we report complete switching of molecular transition energies of quantum objects (QOs) with modulation depth of 99.9% over 2840-fold radiative enhancement. At optimized TNA geometries, Fano interference between the broadband plasmonic continuum and narrow quantum transitions of QOs suppresses both radiative and non-radiative decay channels near 850 nm, yielding an observable full switching that traps energy within the hybrid mode instead of re-emitting it. To show the promises of the concept, we further demonstrate systems with multiple QOs where spectral degeneracy enhances the transparency bandwidth, while detuning generates distinct minima, enabling individually addressable spectral responses. These results establish plasmonic TNA as a promising architecture for spectral detection of single or multi-molecule configurations with high sensitivity and empowers the user for the implementation of quantum mode switches to be used in photonic processing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> SVS Sai Ruthvik, Tanay Nag</p>
            <p>We investigate the emergence of nonreciprocal dissipationless supercurrents in one-dimension manifested through the superconducting diode effect (SDE) and the Josephson diode effect (JDE) in the absence of any external magnetic field, where inversion symmetry (IS) and time-reversal symmetry (TRS) can be intrinsically broken by spin-orbit coupling (SOC), and altermagnetism (AM), respectively. We investigate Ising and Rashba SOC separately in two models where two-component AM, assembled with crystallographic angle, can lead to qualitatively similar indirect band-gap closing and non-reciprocal supercurrent in a Fulde-Ferrell (FF) superconductor. Interestingly, in the absence of the above SOCs, SDE persists and the sign of efficiency can be altered by tuning the angle only. Parallel spin components with complementary momentum functions, ensuring the breaking of IS and TRS, can induce SDE in the presence of FF pairing. Continuing the analysis in the context of JDE, we explore the interplay between SOCs and AM with the p-wave and Fulde-Ferrell superconductivity in three different setups. The bulk bands contributes to the non-reciprocity in the case of p-wave superconductivity while JDE is dominated by Andreev bound states for FF superconductivity. Importantly, JDE continues to exist due to finite momentum Cooper pair even without AM and SOC unlike the p-wave superconductivity. The sign of JD efficiency can be tuned with angle for p-wave superconductivity while absence of such sign reversal is a hallmark signature of FF superconductivity. Similar to SDE, parallel spin components in conjunction with p-wave superconductivity can lead to JDE that can also be mediated by only FF pairing in the absence of SOC and AM.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Can Polat, Erchin Serpedin, Mustafa Kurban, Hasan Kurban</p>
            <p>Despite rapid advances in molecular and materials machine learning, most models still lack physical transferability: they fit correlations across whole molecules or crystals rather than learning the quantum interactions between atomic pairs. Yet bonding, charge redistribution, orbital hybridization, and electronic coupling all emerge from these two-body interactions that define local quantum fields in many-body systems. We introduce QuantumCanvas, a large-scale multimodal benchmark that treats two-body quantum systems as foundational units of matter. The dataset spans 2,850 element-element pairs, each annotated with 18 electronic, thermodynamic, and geometric properties and paired with ten-channel image representations derived from l- and m-resolved orbital densities, angular field transforms, co-occupancy maps, and charge-density projections. These physically grounded images encode spatial, angular, and electrostatic symmetries without explicit coordinates, providing an interpretable visual modality for quantum learning. Benchmarking eight architectures across 18 targets, we report mean absolute errors of 0.201 eV on energy gap using GATv2, 0.265 eV on HOMO and 0.274 eV on LUMO using EGNN. For energy-related quantities, DimeNet attains 2.27 eV total-energy MAE and 0.132 eV repulsive-energy MAE, while a multimodal fusion model achieves a 2.15 eV Mermin free-energy MAE. Pretraining on QuantumCanvas further improves convergence stability and generalization when fine-tuned on larger datasets such as QM9, MD17, and CrysMTM. By unifying orbital physics with vision-based representation learning, QuantumCanvas provides a principled and interpretable basis for learning transferable quantum interactions through coupled visual and numerical modalities.

Experimental work has progressed from linear to two-dimensional arrays of quantum dots, enabling qubit interactions that are essential for quantum simulation and computation. Here, we explore architectures beyond planar geometries by constructing quantum dot arrays in three dimensions. We realize an eight-quantum dot system in a silicon-germanium heterostructure comprising two stacked germanium quantum wells, where quantum dots are positioned at the vertices of a cuboid. Using electrostatic gate control, we load a single hole into any of the eight quantum dots. To demonstrate the potential of multilayer quantum dot systems, we show coherent spin control and hopping-induced spin rotations by shuttling between the quantum wells. The ability to extend quantum dot arrays in three dimensions provides opportunities for novel quantum hardware and high-connectivity quantum circuits.</p>

            <h2>Continuity inequalities for sandwiched Rényi and Tsallis conditional entropies with application to the channel entropy continuity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anna Vershynina</p>
            <p>For the sandwiched Rényi entropy the conditional entropy can be defined two ways: $\widetilde{H}^\downarrow_\alpha(A|B)_\rho, \widetilde{H}^\uparrow_\alpha(A|B)_\rho$. In the limiting case, $\alpha=1$, both definitions consolidate into conditional entropy $H(A|B)=S(AB)-S(B)$. The continuity inequality for conditional entropy $H(A|B)$, called the Alicki-Fannes-Winter (AWF) inequality, shows that if the states are close in trace-distance, then the conditional entropies are also close. Having the AWF inequality for conditional entropy, we show that the channel entropy defined through the relative entropy is continuous with respect to the diamond-distance between channels. Inspired by this, similar continuity inequalities for the Rényi conditional entropy $\widetilde{H}^\uparrow_\alpha$ were obtained in the work [A. Marwah and F. Dupuis, J. Math. Phys. 63, 052201 (2022)]. We provide continuity bounds for the sandwiched Rényi and Tsallis conditional entropies $\widetilde{H}^\downarrow_\alpha(A|B)_\rho, \widetilde{T}^\downarrow_\alpha(A|B)_\rho$ for states with the same marginal on the conditioning system. Similar to the previous bounds, our bound depends only on the dimension of the conditioning system. We apply this result to prove continuity of the channel entropy for Rényi and Tsallis channel entropies defined through the sandwiched Rényi and Tsallis relative entropies.</p>

            <p>The problem of a mobile hole doped into an antiferromagnet Mott insulator is believed to underly the rich physics of several paradigmatic strongly correlated electron systems, ranging from heavy fermions to high-Tc superconductivity. Arguably the simplest incarnation of this problem corresponds to a doped Ising antiferromagnet, a problem widely considered essentially solved since almost 60 years by a popular yet approximate mapping to a single-particle problem on the Bethe lattice. Here we show that, despite its deceptive simplicity, the local spectrum of a single hole in a classical Ising-Néel state contains a series of anomalous, long-lived states that go beyond the well-known ladder-like spectrum with excited energies spaced as $J^{2/3} t^{1/3}$. The anomalous states we find through exact diagonalization and within the self-avoiding path approximation have excitation energies scaling approximately linear with $J$ and lead to a series of avoided crossings with the more pronounced ladder spectrum. By also computing different local, rotational spectra we explain the origin of the anomalous states as rooted in an approximate emergent local $C_3$ symmetry of the problem. From their direct spectral signatures we further conclude that these states lead to anomalously slow thermalization behavior -- hence representing a new type of quantum many-body scar state, potentially related to many-body scars predicted in lattice gauge theories.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dmitry Skachkov, Dirk R. Englund, Michael N. Leuenberger</p>
            <p>Spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) and four-wave mixing in $\chi^{(2)}$ and $\chi^{(3)}$ media underpin most entangled-photon sources, but direct generation of higher-order entangled multiphoton states by $n$-th order parametric downconversion remains extremely challenging because conventional materials exhibit tiny high-order nonlinearities. Here we show that single-layer Nb$_3$Cl$_8$, an excitonic Mott insulator on a breathing Kagome lattice, supports exceptionally large nonlinear susceptibilities up to seventh order. Many-body GW--Bethe--Salpeter and time-dependent BSE / Kadanoff--Baym simulations yield resonant $\chi^{(2)}$--$\chi^{(7)}$ for monolayer Nb$_3$Cl$_8$, with $|\chi^{(4)}|$ and $|\chi^{(5)}|$ surpassing values in prototypical transition metal dichalcogenides by 5--9 orders of magnitude. We trace this enhancement to flat bands and strongly bound Frenkel excitons with ferroelectrically aligned out-of-plane dipoles. Building on experimentally demonstrated 1$\times N$ integrated beam splitters with arbitrary power ratios, we propose an on-chip architecture where each output arm hosts an Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ patch, optionally gated by graphene to tune the complex $n$-photon amplitudes. Using the ab-initio $\chi^{(3)}$ and $\chi^{(4)}$ values, we predict that three-photon GHZ$_3$ and four-photon cluster-state sources in this platform can achieve $n$-photon generation rates up to $\sim 10^8$ and $\sim 10^6$ times larger, respectively, than silica-fiber- and MoS$_2$-based implementations with comparable geometry. We derive the quantum Hamiltonian and explicit $n$-photon generation rates for this platform, and show how suitable interferometric networks enable electrically and spectrally tunable GHZ, $W$, and cluster states based on genuine high-order nonlinear processes in a 2D excitonic Mott insulator.</p>

            <p>We present a technique based on an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond capable of imaging magnetic fields with high spatio-temporal resolution. A focused laser beam is raster-scanned using an acousto-optic deflector (AOD) and NV center fluorescence is read out with a single photodetector, enabling low-noise detection with high dynamic range. The method operates in a previously unexplored regime, quasi-continuous wave optically detected magnetic resonance (qCW-ODMR). In this regime, NV centers experience short optical pump pulses for spin readout and repolarization, analogous to pulsed ODMR technique, while the microwave field remains continuously on resonance with the spin transitions. We systematically characterize this regime and show that the spin response is governed by a tunable interplay between coherent evolution and relaxation, determined by the temporal spacing between pump laser pulses. Notably, the technique does not require precise microwave pulse control, thus simplifying experimental implementation. To demonstrate its capabilities, we image time-varying magnetic fields from a microelectrode in a conductive medium with sub-millisecond temporal resolution. This approach enables flexible spatial sampling and with our diamond achieves nT$\cdot$Hz$^{-1/2}$ per pixel sensitivity, making it well suited for detecting weak, dynamic magnetic fields in biological and other complex systems.</p>

            <p>Quantum resource theories provide a mathematically rigorous way of understanding the nature of various quantum resources. An important problem in any quantum resource theory is to determine how quantum states can be converted into each other within the physical constraints of the theory. The standard approach to this problem is to study approximate or probabilistic transformations. Here, we investigate the intermediate regime, providing limits on both, the fidelity and the probability of state transformations. We derive limitations on the transformations, which are valid in all quantum resource theories, by providing bounds on the maximal transformation fidelity for a given transformation probability. As an application, we show that these bounds imply an upper bound on the asymptotic rates for various classes of states under probabilistic transformations. We also show that the deterministic version of the single copy bounds can be applied for drawing limitations on the manipulation of quantum channels, which goes beyond the previously known bounds of channel manipulations. Furthermore, we completely solve the question of stochastic-approximate state conversion via local operations and classical communication in the following two cases: (i) Both initial and target states are pure bipartite entangled states of arbitrary dimensions. (ii) The target state is a two-qubit entangled state and the initial state is a pure bipartite state.</p>

            <p>We observe that the existence of sequential and parallel composition supermaps in higher order theories of transformations can be formalised using enriched category theory. Encouraged by relevant examples such as unitary supermaps and layers within higher order causal categories (HOCCs), we treat the modelling of higher order physical theories with enriched monoidal categories in analogy with the modelling of physical theories with monoidal categories. We use the enriched monoidal setting to construct a suitable definition of structure preserving map between higher order physical theories via the Grothendieck construction. We then show that the convenient feature of currying in higher order physical theories can be seen as a consequence of combining the primitive assumption of the existence of parallel and sequential composition supermaps with an additional feature of linking. We then use our definition of structure preserving map to show that categories containing infinite towers of enriched monoidal categories with full and faithful structure preserving maps between them inevitably lead to closed monoidal structures. The aim of the proposed definitions is to step towards providing a broad framework for the study and comparison of novel causal structures in quantum theory, and, more broadly, a paradigm of physical theory where static and dynamical features are treated in a unified way.</p>

In this direction, we give explicit partial functions on $n$ bits for which reducing the entanglement increases the classical communication complexity exponentially. Our separations are as follows. For every $k\ge 1$: $Q\|^*$ versus $R2^*$: We show that quantum simultaneous protocols with $\tilde{\Theta}(k^5 \log^3 n)$ qubits of entanglement can exponentially outperform two-way randomized protocols with $O(k)$ qubits of entanglement. This resolves an open problem from [Gav08] and improves the state-of-the-art separations between quantum simultaneous protocols with entanglement and two-way randomized protocols without entanglement [Gav19, GRT22]. $R\|^*$ versus $Q\|^*$: We show that classical simultaneous protocols with $\tilde{\Theta}(k \log n)$ qubits of entanglement can exponentially outperform quantum simultaneous protocols with $O(k)$ qubits of entanglement, resolving an open question from [GKRW06, Gav19]. The best result prior to our work was a relational separation against protocols without entanglement [GKRW06]. $R\|^*$ versus $R1^*$: We show that classical simultaneous protocols with $\tilde{\Theta}(k\log n)$ qubits of entanglement can exponentially outperform randomized one-way protocols with $O(k)$ qubits of entanglement. Prior to our work, only a relational separation was known [Gav08]. Our techniques can also be used to show advantages of quantum communication models over hybrid classical-quantum models, i.e., models that have a large amount of both classical communication and quantum simultaneous communication.</p>

            <h2>Expanding bipartite Bell inequalities for maximum multi-partite randomness</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lewis Wooltorton, Peter Brown, Roger Colbeck</p>
            <p>Nonlocal tests on multi-partite quantum correlations form the basis of protocols that certify randomness in a device-independent (DI) way. Such correlations admit a rich structure, making the task of choosing an appropriate test difficult. For example, extremal Bell inequalities are tight witnesses of nonlocality, but achieving their maximum violation places constraints on the underlying quantum system, which can reduce the rate of randomness generation. As a result there is often a trade-off between maximum randomness and the amount of violation of a given Bell inequality. Here, we explore this trade-off for more than two parties. More precisely, we study the maximum amount of randomness that can be certified by correlations with a particular violation of the Mermin-Ardehali-Belinskii-Klyshko (MABK) inequality. For any even number of parties, we find that maximum randomness cannot occur beyond a threshold quantum violation, which increases with the number of parties, and we give a conjectured form of the maximum randomness in terms of the MABK value. We also show that maximum randomness can be obtained for any MABK violation for odd numbers of parties. To obtain our results, we derive new families of Bell inequalities certifying maximum randomness from a technique for randomness certification, which we call "expanding Bell inequalities". Our technique allows a bipartite Bell expression to be used as a seed, and transformed into a multi-partite Bell inequality tailored for randomness certification, showing how intuition learned in the bipartite case can find use in more complex scenarios.</p>

A quantum estimator for $S(\rho)$ with time complexity $\tilde O(N^2)$, improving the prior best time complexity $\tilde O(N^6)$ by Acharya, Issa, Shende, and Wagner (2020) and Bavarian, Mehraba, and Wright (2016). 2. A quantum estimator for $S_\alpha(\rho)$ with time complexity $\tilde O(N^{4/\alpha-2})$ for $0<\alpha<1$ and $\tilde O(N^{4-2/\alpha})$ for $\alpha>1$, improving the prior best time complexity $\tilde O(N^{6/\alpha})$ for $0<\alpha<1$ and $\tilde O(N^6)$ for $\alpha>1$ by Acharya, Issa, Shende, and Wagner (2020), though at a cost of a slightly larger sample complexity. Moreover, these estimators are naturally extensible to the low-rank case. We also provide a sample lower bound for estimating $S_\alpha(\rho)$. Technically, our method is quite different from the previous ones that are based on weak Schur sampling and Young diagrams. At the heart of our construction, is a novel tool called samplizer, which can "samplize" a quantum query algorithm to a quantum algorithm with similar behavior using only samples of quantum states; this suggests a unified framework for estimating quantum entropies. Specifically, when a quantum oracle $U$ block-encodes a mixed quantum state $\rho$, any quantum query algorithm using $Q$ queries to $U$ can be samplized to a $\delta$-close (in the diamond norm) quantum algorithm using $\tilde\Theta(Q^2/\delta)$ samples of $\rho$. Moreover, this samplization is proven to be optimal, up to a polylogarithmic factor.</p>

            <h2>Complexity of geometrically local stoquastic Hamiltonians</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Asad Raza, Jens Eisert, Alex B. Grilo</p>
            <p>The QMA-completeness of the local Hamiltonian problem is a landmark result of the field of Hamiltonian complexity that studies the computational complexity of problems in quantum many-body physics. Since its proposal, substantial effort has been invested in better understanding the problem for physically motivated important families of Hamiltonians. In particular, the QMA-completeness of approximating the ground state energy of local Hamiltonians has been extended to the case where the Hamiltonians are geometrically local in one and two spatial dimensions. Among those physically motivated Hamiltonians, stoquastic Hamiltonians play a particularly crucial role, as they constitute the manifestly sign-free Hamiltonians in Monte Carlo approaches. Interestingly, for such Hamiltonians, the problem at hand becomes more ''classical'', being hard for the class MA (the randomized version of NP) and its complexity has tight connections with derandomization. In this work, we prove that both the two- and one-dimensional geometrically local analogues remain MA-hard with high enough qudit dimension. Moreover, we show that related problems are StoqMA-complete.</p>

            <p>We propose a precise test of two fundamental gravitational constants using a detector concept that exploits the dynamics of quantum phononic excitations in a trapped Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), operable at the scale of tabletop experiments. In this setup, the sensitivity is enhanced by approximately 2 orders of magnitude through the use of a tritter operation, which mixes phononic excitations with the BEC's ground state. The BEC exhibits unique sensitivity to the two key components of the gravitational potential in $\Lambda$-gravity: the Newtonian $GM/r$ term and the cosmological constant $\Lambda r^2$, both entering the most general function following from a Gurzadyan's theorem. Using state-of-the-art experimental design, we predict that the gravitational constant $G$ could be measured with an accuracy up to $10^{-17}$ N m$^2$/kg$^2$, representing an improvement by 2 orders of magnitude over current measurements. Moreover, this experiment aims to establish the best Earth-based upper limit on $\Lambda$ at $<10^{-31}$ m$^{-2}$, marking the first laboratory-based probe of the cosmological constant. Additionally, the setup allows for the measurement of the distance-dependent behavior of each term in the gravitational potential, providing a means to test modified gravity theories.</p>

            <h2>Stabilizing Non-Abelian Topological Order against Heralded Noise via Local Lindbladian Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sanket Chirame, Abhinav Prem, Sarang Gopalakrishnan, Fiona J. Burnell</p>
            <p>An important open question for the current generation of highly controllable quantum devices is understanding which phases can be realized as stable steady-states under local quantum dynamics. In this work, we show how robust steady-state phases with both Abelian and non-Abelian mixed-state topological order can be stabilized, in two spatial dimensions (2d), against generic ``heralded" noise using active dynamics that incorporate measurement and feedback, modeled as a \emph{fully local} Lindblad master equation. These topologically ordered steady states are two-way connected to pure topologically ordered ground states using local quantum channels, and preserve quantum information for a time that is exponentially large in the system size. Specifically, we present explicit constructions of families of local Lindbladians for both Abelian ($\mathbb{Z}_2$) and non-Abelian ($D_4$) topological order whose steady-states host mixed-state topological order when the noise is below a threshold strength. As the noise strength is increased, these models exhibit first-order transitions to intermediate mixed state phases where they encode robust classical memories, followed by (first-order) transitions to a trivial steady state at high noise rates. When the noise is imperfectly heralded, steady-state order disappears but our active dynamics significantly enhances the lifetime of the encoded logical information. To carry out the numerical simulations for the non-Abelian $D_4$ case, we introduce a generalized stabilizer tableau formalism that permits efficient simulation of the non-Abelian Lindbladian dynamics.</p>

            <p>We analyze generalizations of quantum algorithms based on the short path framework first proposed by Hastings~[\textit{Quantum} 2, 78 (2018)], which has been extended and shown by Dalzell~et~al.~[STOC~'23] to achieve super-Grover speedups for certain binary optimization problems. We demonstrate that, under some commonly satisfied technical conditions, an appropriate generalization can achieve super-quadratic speedups not only over unstructured search but also over a classical optimization algorithm that searches for the optimum by drawing samples from the stationary distribution of a Markov chain. We employ this framework to obtain algorithms for problems including variants of Max Bisection, Max Independent Set, and finding the ground states of the Antiferromagnetic Ising Model and the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Model, whose runtimes are asymptotically faster than those obtainable with previous short path techniques. In certain cases, our algorithms achieve super-quadratic speedups compared to the best known classical algorithms with rigorously established runtimes.</p>

            <h2>Overcoming Quantum Metrology Singularity through Sequential Measurements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yaoling Yang, Victor Montenegro, Abolfazl Bayat</p>
            <p>The simultaneous estimation of multiple unknown parameters is the most general scenario in quantum sensing. Quantum multi-parameter estimation theory provides fundamental bounds on the achievable precision of simultaneous estimation. However, these bounds can become singular (no finite bound exists) in multi-parameter sensing due to parameter interdependencies, limited probe accessibility, and insufficient measurement outcomes. Here, we address the singularity issue in quantum sensing through a simple mechanism based on a sequential measurement strategy. This sensing scheme overcomes the singularity constraint and enables the simultaneous estimation of multiple parameters with a local and fixed measurement throughout the sensing protocol. This is because sequential measurements, involving consecutive steps of local measurements followed by probe evolution, inherently produce correlated measurement data that grows exponentially with the number of sequential measurements. Finally, through two different examples, namely a strongly correlated probe and a light-matter system, we demonstrate how such singularities are reflected when inferring the unknown parameters through Bayesian estimation.</p>

            <h2>Almost Optimal Synthesis of Reversible Function in Qudit Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Buji Xu, Junhong Nie, Xiaoming Sun</p>
            <p>Quantum oracles are widely adopted in problems, like query oracle in Grover's algorithm, cipher in quantum cryptanalytic and data encoder in quantum machine learning. Notably, the bit-flip oracle, capable of flipping the state based on a given classical function, emerges as a fundamental component in the design and construction of quantum algorithms. Devising methods to optimally implement the bit-flip oracle essentially translates to the efficient synthesis of reversible functions. Prior research has primarily focused on the qubit model, leaving the higher dimensional systems, i.e. qudit model, largely unexplored. By allowing more than two computational bases, qudit model can fully utilize the multi-level nature of the underlying physical mechanism. We propose a method to synthesize even permutations in $A_{d^{n}}$ using $\Theta(d)$ $(n - 1)$-qudit sub-circuits, which achieve asymptotic optimality in the count of sub-circuits. Moreover, we introduce a technique for synthesizing reversible functions employing $O\left( n d^{n} \right)$ gates and only a single ancilla. This is asymptotically tight in terms of $d$ and asymptotically almost tight in terms of $n$.</p>

            <p>Exceptional points (EPs) are remarkable spectral degeneracies in a non-Hermitian system's parameter space, where both eigenvalues and eigenstates coalesce. Here, we show that in non-Hermitian molecular chiral systems the position of EPs in the parameter space is enantiomer-specific. First, we show that encircling the EP of one enantiomer drives robust topological population transfer in the chiral molecule while its mirror twin remains unaffected, offering a new route for selective chiral control. Second, we reveal how resonant excitation of EPs in chiral molecules can amplify weak chiral effects, offering an alternative approach to the enhancement of chiral interactions. Third, we demonstrate that a twisted chiral fiber immersed in a liquid solution of chiral molecules exhibits topologically different behavior depending on the solution's enantiomeric excess, offering a new approach to the detection of molecular chirality. Our results combine high enantiosensitivity with topological robustness in chiral discrimination and control, paving the way for new approaches in the exploration of non-Hermitian and chiral phenomena.</p>

            <p>A unitary evolution in time may be treated as a curve in the manifold of the special unitary group. The length of such a curve can be related to the energetic cost of the associated computation, meaning a geodesic curve identifies an energetically optimal path. In this work, we employ sub-Riemannian geometry on the manifold of the unitary group to obtain optimally designed Hamiltonians for generating single-qubit gates in an environment with the presence of dephasing noise as well as a two-qubit gate under a time-constant crosstalk interaction. The resulting geodesic equation involves knowing the initial conditions of the parameters that cannot be obtained analytically. We then introduce a random sampling method combined with a minimization function and a cost function to find initial conditions that lead to optimal control fields. We also compare the optimized control fields obtained from the solutions of the geodesic equation with those extracted from the well-known Krotov method. Both approaches provide high fidelity values for the desired quantum gate implementation, but the geodesic method has the advantage of minimizing the required energy to execute the same task. These findings bring new insights for the design of more efficient fields in the arsenal of optimal control theory.</p>

            <p>Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) is a cardinal algorithm in quantum computing that plays a crucial role in various applications, including cryptography, molecular simulation, and solving systems of linear equations. However, the standard implementation of QPE faces challenges related to time complexity and circuit depth, which limit its practicality for large-scale computations. We introduce LuGo, a novel framework designed to enhance the performance of QPE by reducing circuit duplication, as well as using parallelization techniques to achieve faster generation of the QPE circuit and gate reduction. We validate the effectiveness of our framework by generating quantum linear solver circuits, which require both QPE and inverse QPE, to solve linear systems of equations. LuGo achieves significant improvements in both computational efficiency and hardware requirements without compromising on accuracy. Compared to a standard QPE implementation, LuGo reduces time consumption to generate a circuit that solves a $2^6\times 2^6$ system matrix by a factor of $50.68$ and over $31\times$ reduction of quantum gates and circuit depth, with no fidelity loss on an ideal quantum simulator. We demonstrated the versatility and scalability of LuGo enabled HHL algorithm by simulating a canonical Hele-Shaw fluid problem using a quantum simulator. With these advantages, LuGo paves the way for more efficient implementations of QPE, enabling broader applications across several quantum computing domains.</p>

We learn the joint distribution of momentum fraction $z$ and energy scale $Q$, and infer their correlations from the entanglement structure.

            <p>Quantum groups have been widely explored as a tool to encode possible nontrivial generalisations of reference frame transformations, relevant in quantum gravity. In quantum information, it was found that the reference frames can be associated to quantum particles, leading to quantum reference frames transformations. The connection between these two frameworks is still unexplored, but if clarified it will lead to a more profound understanding of symmetries in quantum mechanics and quantum gravity. Here, we establish a correspondence between quantum reference frame transformations and transformations generated by a quantum deformation of the Galilei group with commutative time, taken at first order in the quantum deformation parameter. This is found once the quantum group noncommutative transformation parameters are represented on the phase space of a quantum particle, and upon setting the quantum deformation parameter to be proportional to the inverse of the mass of the particle serving as the quantum reference frame. These results allow us to show that quantum reference frame transformations are physically relevant when the state of the quantum reference frame is in a quantum superposition of semiclassical states. We conjecture that the all-order quantum Galilei group describes quantum reference frame transformations between more general quantum states of the quantum reference frame.</p>

            <p>Magic, or nonstabilizerness, is a crucial quantum resource, yet its dynamics in open quantum systems remain largely unexplored. We investigate magic in the open XXZ spin chain under either boundary gain and loss, or bulk dephasing using the stabilizer Rényi entropy $M_2$. To enable scalable simulations of large systems, we develop a novel, highly efficient algorithm for computing $M_2$ within the matrix product states formalism while maintaining constant bond dimension--an advancement over existing methods. For boundary driving, we uncover universal scaling laws, $M_2(t) \sim t^{1/z}$, linked to the dynamical exponent $z$ for several distinct universality classes. We also disentangle classical and quantum contributions to magic by introducing a mean-field approximation for magic, thus emphasizing the prominent role of quantum critical fluctuations in nonstabilizerness. For bulk dephasing, dissipation can transiently enhance magic before suppressing it, and drive it to a nontrivial steady-state value. These findings position magic as a powerful diagnostic tool for probing universality and dynamics in open quantum systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Teruaki Nagasawa, Eyuri Wakakuwa, Kohtaro Kato, Francesco Buscemi</p>
            <p>To understand the emergence of macroscopic irreversibility from microscopic reversible dynamics, the idea of coarse-graining plays a fundamental role. In this work, we develop a unified inferential framework for macroscopic states, that is, coarse descriptions of microscopic quantum systems that can be inferred from macroscopic measurements. Building on quantum statistical sufficiency and Bayesian retrodiction, we characterize macroscopic states through equivalent abstract (algebraic) and explicit (constructive) formulations. Central to our approach is the notion of observational deficit, which quantifies the degree of irretrodictability of a state relative to a prior and a measurement. This leads to a general definition of macroscopic entropy as an inferentially grounded measure of asymmetry under Bayesian inversion. We formalize this structure in terms of inferential reference frames, defined by the pair consisting of a prior and a measurement, which encapsulate the observer's informational perspective. We then formulate a resource theory of microscopicity, treating macroscopic states as free states and introducing a hierarchy of microscopicity-non-generating operations. This theory unifies and extends existing resource theories of coherence, athermality, and asymmetry. Finally, we apply the framework to study quantum correlations under observational constraints, introducing the notion of observational discord and deriving necessary and sufficient conditions for their vanishing in terms of information recoverability. This work is dedicated to Professor Ryszard Horodecki on the occasion of his 80th birthday, in deep admiration and gratitude for his pioneering contributions to quantum information theory.</p>

The dynamics of such quantum systems are typically governed by an equation of motion with a time-convolution integral of the memory kernel.

In this paper, we analytically and nonperturbatively solve such integro-differential equations with a nonstationary memory kernel by employing a train of Dirac-delta switchings. We then apply this method to the damped Jaynes-Cummings model and the damped harmonic oscillator model to demonstrate that (i) our solution asymptotes to the well-known exact solution in the continuum limit, and that (ii) our method also enables us to visualize the memory effect in the environment.</p>

            <p>Training of neural networks (NNs) has emerged as a major consumer of both computational and energy resources. Quantum computers were coined as a root to facilitate training, but no experimental evidence has been presented so far. Here we demonstrate that quantum annealing platforms, such as D-Wave, can enable fast and efficient training of classical NNs, which are then deployable on conventional hardware. From a physics perspective, NN training can be viewed as a dynamical phase transition: the system evolves from an initial spin glass state to a highly ordered, trained state. This process involves eliminating numerous undesired minima in its energy landscape. The advantage of annealing devices is their ability to rapidly find multiple deep states. We found that this quantum training achieves superior performance scaling compared to classical backpropagation methods, with a clearly higher scaling exponent (1.01 vs. 0.78). It may be further increased up to a factor of 2 with a fully coherent quantum platform using a variant of the Grover algorithm. Furthermore, we argue that even a modestly sized annealer can be beneficial to train a deep NN by being applied sequentially to a few layers at a time.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elie Bermot, Lucia Valor, Wesley Coelho, Louis-Paul Henry, Natalie Pearson</p>
            <p>Rydberg atom arrays are a powerful platform for solving combinatorial optimization problems, owing to the Rydberg blockade mechanism, which imposes effective constraints on simultaneous atomic excitations. These constraints have enabled the encoding of the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem on unit disk graphs, where atoms interact within a fixed, globally defined blockade radius. However, this restriction limits the class of addressable problems. A natural extension is to consider disk graphs, which generalize unit disk graphs by allowing arbitrary disk radii and correspond to the intersection graphs of disks in the plane. Embedding such graphs in Rydberg systems requires moving beyond the standard, globally uniform blockade model. In this work, we introduce a local Rydberg blockade regime, which emerges when local drives are applied to different pairs of atoms involved in a potential interaction. We develop a general theoretical framework for this regime and propose two novel metrics, the correlation matrix and the maximum independence violation, to quantify the quality of the embedding. Using these metrics, we demonstrate that disk graphs can be meaningfully embedded into Rydberg atom arrays under local drive schemes, thereby expanding the landscape of quantum-addressable optimization problems. Finally, when evaluating approximate solutions of the MIS problem, characterized by near-optimal independent sets, local drive approaches exhibit significantly improved performance over global ones. These results highlight the practical advantage of local blockade engineering for approximate combinatorial optimization and open a path toward leveraging the analog capabilities of Rydberg platforms beyond conventional geometric constraints.</p>

While various experimental approaches have been proposed to probe quantum systems in curved spacetime, most focus on the Newtonian regime, leaving post-Newtonian effects such as frame dragging largely unexplored. In this study, we propose and theoretically analyze an experimental scheme to investigate how post-Newtonian gravity affects quantum systems. We consider two setups: (i) a quantum clock interferometry setup designed to detect the gravitational field of a rotating mass, and (ii) a scheme exploring whether such effects could be used to generate gravity-induced entanglement. Due to the symmetry of the configuration, the proposed setup is insensitive to Newtonian gravitational contributions but remains sensitive to the frame-dragging effect. Furthermore, our scheme allows for testing whether the observed gravity-induced entanglement is consistent with the quantum equivalence principle. While the predicted effects appear too small to detect with current technology, our scheme offers a starting point for future experiments probing post-Newtonian quantum gravitational effects.</p>

            <p>Here we investigate analogy between quantum signal processing (QSP) and the adiabatic-impulse model (AIM) in order to implement the QSP algorithm with fast quantum logic gates. QSP is an algorithm that uses single-qubit dynamics to perform a polynomial function transformation. AIM effectively describes the evolution of a two-level quantum system under strong external driving field. We can map parameters from QSP to AIM to implement QSP-like evolution with nonadiabatic, high-amplitude external drives. By choosing AIM parameters that control non-adiabatic transition parameters (such as driving amplitude $A$, frequency $\omega$, and signal timing), one can achieve polynomial approximations and increase robustness in quantum circuits. The analogy presented here between QSP and AIM can be useful as a way to directly implement the QSP algorithm on quantum systems and obtain all the benefits from the fast Landau-Zener-Stuckelberg-Majotana (LZSM) quantum logic gates.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bora Baran, Timothy Heightman</p>
            <p>We show how one can asymptotically reach the Heisenberg limit in quantum Hamiltonian learning without entanglement, globally coherent measurements, or dynamical control, using only local quantum operations. Our protocol uses ensemble-averaging over the outcomes of experiments initialized in Haar-random local product states, accompanied by random Pauli measurements, leading to the effective cancellation of interference terms so that a Heisenberg-limited regime emerges for short-time experiments. Furthermore, we show that the act of ensemble averaging makes unbiased estimation data, meaning all Hamiltonian parameters can be simultaneously estimated from the same data-set, removing the need for parameter isolation. We supplement the theoretical results by showing empirically that, even away from the asymptotic limit, one can surpass the SQL using randomly spread product-state ensembles. We do so numerically by learning a selection of different disordered multi-qubit Hamiltonians in a black-box learning scenario.</p>

            <h2>Nonclassical microwave radiation from the parametric dynamical Casimir effect in the reversed-dissipation regime of circuit optomechanics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> H. Solki, Ali Motazedifard, M. H. Naderi, A. Youssefi, R. Roknizadeh</p>
            <p>We propose an experimentally feasible optomechanical system (OMS) that is dispersively driven and operates in the reversed dissipation regime (RDR), where the mechanical damping rate far exceeds the cavity decay rate. We demonstrate that coherent, fast-time modulation of the driving laser frequency on time scales longer than the mechanical decoherence time allows for adiabatic elimination of the mechanical mode, resulting in strong parametric amplification of quantum vacuum fluctuations of the intracavity field. This mechanism, known as the parametric dynamical Casimir effect (parametric-DCE), leads to the generation of Casimir photons. In the dispersive RDR, we find that the total system Hamiltonian-including the DCE term-is intrinsically modified by a generalized optomechanical Kerr-type nonlinearity. This nonlinearity not only saturates the mean number of radiated Casimir photons on short time scales, even without dissipation, but also induces oscillatory behavior in their dynamics and quantum characteristics. Remarkably, the presence of the Kerr nonlinearity causes the generated DCE photons to exhibit nonclassical features, including simultaneous sub-Poissonian statistics and negative Wigner function, as well as quadrature squeezing, which can be controlled by adjusting the system parameters. Surprisingly, the controllable simultaneous nonclassical dynamics in the same physical parameter regime, which is induced by the optomechanical Kerr nonlinearity to the parametric DCE cannot occur in the standard DCE or Kerr-type systems. The proposed nonclassical microwave radiation source possesses the potential to be applied in quantum information processing, quantum computing as well as microwave quantum sensing.</p>

            <p>We present an operational reconstruction of the well-known two-to-one homomorphism between the groups $SU(2)$ and $SO(3)$, grounded in the physical description of quantum state preparation and evolution. Starting from the connection between vectors in three-dimensional physical space and quantum states of two-level systems, we investigate how reversible transformations-modeled as completely positive and trace-preserving maps-give rise to a correspondence between spatial rotations and unitary operations. Our approach reveals how this group-theoretic structure naturally emerges from physical constraints, particularly the preservation of purity and reversibility in quantum processes. Beyond its theoretical relevance, the construction offers a pedagogically accessible framework for introducing core ideas in quantum mechanics and symmetry groups, making the abstract correspondence between $SU(2)$ and $SO(3)$ tangible through experimentally meaningful procedures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alejandro Frank</p>
            <p>Microscopic quantum laws are time-symmetric: nothing in the Schrödinger equation or its relativistic extensions distinguishes future from past. Yet measurements produce irreversible records, an apparently one-way causal flow, and the familiar notion that causes precede effects. Within the Quantum Time-Symmetric Interpretation (QTSI), this asymmetry is not fundamental but emergent. Isolated quantum systems are described by a two-component temporal state containing forward- and backward-propagating amplitudes. Their mixing, governed by a parameter $\Delta(\phi)$, defines a retrocausal coherence time $\tau_{RC}(\phi)$ beyond which advanced components are suppressed. As the system couples to amplifying environments characterized by a macroscopic parameter $\phi$, $\Delta(\phi)$ decreases and the backward component is dynamically eliminated, giving rise to classical causality and effective collapse. QTSI aligns naturally with time-symmetric approaches from Wheeler--Feynman, Aharonov, and Price, agrees with all weak-measurement and quantum eraser results in their operational regimes, and predicts specific signatures in temporal echoes and chaotic cavities. Detailed formal and experimental developments appear in the Supplementary Addenda.</p>

            <h2>Classical algorithms for measurement-adaptive Gaussian circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Changhun Oh, Youngrong Lim</p>
            <p>Gaussian building blocks are essential for photonic quantum information processing, and universality can be practically achieved by equipping Gaussian circuits with adaptive measurement and feedforward. The number of adaptive steps then provides a natural parameter for computational power. Rather than assessing power only through sampling problems -- the usual benchmark -- we follow the ongoing shift toward tasks of practical relevance and study the quantum mean-value problem, i.e., estimating observable expectation values that underpin simulation and variational algorithms. More specifically, we analyze bosonic circuits with adaptivity and prove that when the number of adaptive measurements is small, the mean-value problem admits efficient classical algorithms even if a large amount of non-Gaussian resources are present in the input state, whereas less constrained regimes are computationally hard. This yields a task-level contrast with sampling, where non-Gaussian ingredients alone often induce hardness, and provides a clean complexity boundary parameterized by the number of adaptive measurement-and-feedforward steps between classical simulability and quantum advantage. Beyond the main result, we introduce classical techniques -- including a generalization of Gurvits' second algorithm to arbitrary product inputs and Gaussian circuits -- for computing the marginal quantities needed by our estimators, which may be of independent interest.</p>

            <h2>Geometric Discord of any arbitrary dimensional bipartite system and its application in quantum key distribution</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rashi Jain, Satyabrata Adhikari</p>
            <p>Entangled quantum states are regarded as a key resource in quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols. However, quantum correlations, other than entanglement can also play a significant role the QKD protocols. In this work, we will focus on one such measure of quantum correlation, known as geometric quantum discord (GQD). Firstly, we derive an analytical expression of GQD for two-qutrit quantum systems and further generalize it for $d_1\otimes d_2$ dimensional systems. Next, we apply the concept of GQD in studying QKD. In particular, we derive the lower bound for a distillable secret key rate $K_D$ in terms of GQD when two communicating parties uses private states for generating a secret key in the presence of an eavesdropper. The lower bound of $K_D$ depends upon the GQD of $\frac{\sigma_0+\sigma_1}{2}$ and $\frac{\sigma_2+\sigma_3}{2}$, where $\sigma_i$'s, $i=0,1,2,3$ are the density matrices. We find that for a certain range of GQD, the successful generation of the secret key is not guaranteed. We further study the behavior of distillable key rate when the geometric discord of $\frac{\sigma_0+\sigma_1}{2}$ and $\frac{\sigma_2+\sigma_3}{2}$ increases, decreases or remains constant, with the help of a few examples. Moreover, we find that even when $\sigma_i$'s are separable or positive partial transpose entangled states, the distillable key can still be generated.</p>

            <h2>Formalizing contextuality in sequential scenarios</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kim Vallée, Damian Markham</p>
            <p>This paper provides a framework for characterizing sequential scenarios, allowing for the identification of contextuality given empirical data, and then provides precise operational interpretations in terms of the possible hidden variable model explanations. Sequential scenarios are different in essence from non-local scenarios as each instrument is allowed to change the state as it enters subsequent instruments. Thus, it is necessary to formulate the possible state update in any hidden variable model description. Here we develop such hidden variable models for sequential scenarios, and we develop on the notion of no-disturbance: an instrument $A$ does not disturb another instrument $B$ if the statistics of $B$ are independent of whether $A$ was measured or not. We define non-contextuality inequalities for the sequential scenario, and show that violation implies that the data cannot be explained by a hidden variable model that is both deterministic and not disturbing in this sense. We further provide a translation from standard contextuality frameworks to ours, providing sequential versions which carry over the same inequalities and measures of contextuality, but now with the sequential interpretations stated.</p>

            <p>Classification of medical images plays a vital role in medical image analysis; however, it remains challenging due to the limited availability of labeled data, class imbalances, and the complexity of medical patterns. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel Hybrid Quantum-Classical Neural Network (HQCNN) for both binary and multi-class classification. The architecture of HQCNN integrates a five-layer classical convolutional backbone with a 4-qubit variational quantum circuit that incorporates quantum state encoding, superpositional entanglement, and a Fourier-inspired quantum attention mechanism. We evaluate the model on six MedMNIST v2 benchmark datasets. The HQCNN consistently outperforms classical and quantum baselines, achieving up to 99.91% accuracy and 100.00% AUC on PathMNIST (binary) and 99.95% accuracy on OrganAMNIST (multi-class) with strong robustness on noisy datasets like BreastMNIST (87.18% accuracy). The model demonstrates superior generalization capability and computational efficiency, accomplished with significantly fewer trainable parameters, making it suitable for data-scarce scenarios. Our findings provide strong empirical evidence that hybrid quantum-classical models can advance medical imaging tasks.</p>

            <h2>Advantage of utilizing nonlocal magic resource in Haar-random circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiao Huang, Guanhua Chen, Yao Yao</p>
            <p>Magic resources and entanglement are fundamental components for achieving the universal quantum computation, so is the interplay between them. Herein, we uncover an intrinsic scaling law of the magic resource and bond dimension of matrix product states in Haar-random quantum circuits, that is, the magic resource is converged on a bond dimension in logarithmic scale with the system size. From a practical perspective, this finding substantially enhances the classical simulability of nonstabilizerness. It also allows us to utilize the bond dimension as a bridge to link the entanglement and the nonlocal magic resource, which extends the capacity perspective that the entanglement plays the role of container for the nonlocal magic resource. Furthermore, the intrinsic scaling enables an information separation between the nonlocal magic resource and the extra entanglement. This, in turn, leads to the conclusion that, any dynamical relation between magic and entanglement resources is ruled out. In other words, it is inappropriate to regard the entanglement as the driving force of the growth and spreading of nonlocal magic resource.</p>

            <p>We study the problems of state preparation, ground state preparation and quantum state preparation. We propose an analytic approach to a stochastic quantum algorithm which prepares the ground state for $n$-qubit Hamiltonian that is represented by $\text{poly}(n)$ Pauli operators and has an inverse-polynomial gap, requiring only $\text{poly}(n)$ Pauli rotations, measurements, and classical time complexity when $n$ exceeds a threshold, to inverse-polynomial precision given the initial overlap being lower bounded by $\frac{1}{2^n}$. Extending this result, we prove that any $n$-qubit quantum state can be prepared in two regimes: (1) with a constant number of Pauli rotations to constant precision, or (2) with a polynomial number of rotations to inverse-polynomial precision. Our results improve over previous approaches to quantum state preparation in terms of gate complexity, thereby yielding quantum space advantage. As an application, we identify a practical condition under which quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems can be solved with exponential quantum speedups.</p>

            <h2>Completeness for Fault Equivalence of Clifford ZX Diagrams</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maximilian Rüsch, Benjamin Rodatz, Aleks Kissinger</p>
            <p>Two circuits are considered to be equivalent under noise if the effect of faults on one circuit is no worse than the effect of faults on the other circuit. We call this relationship fault equivalence. Fault equivalence offers a way to transform circuits while provably preserving their fault-tolerant properties, enabling a framework for fault-tolerant circuit synthesis and optimisation that is correct by construction. The ZX calculus, a set of graphical rewrite rules for quantum computations, provides a useful tool for manipulating circuits while preserving fault equivalence. For this, the usual set of ZX rewrites has to be restricted to not only preserve the underlying linear map represented by the diagram but also fault equivalence. In this work, we provide a set of ZX rewrites that are sound and complete for fault equivalence of Clifford ZX diagrams. This means that any equivalence that can be derived using the proposed rules is certain to be correct, and any correct equivalence can be derived using only these rules. For this, we utilise diagrammatic constructions called fault gadgets to reason about arbitrary, possibly correlated Pauli faults in ZX diagrams. Fault gadgets allow us to separate the diagram into a fault-free part, which captures the noise-free behaviour of a diagram, and a noisy part that enumerates the effects of all possible faults. Using this, we provide a unique normal form for ZX diagrams under noise and show that any diagram can be brought into this normal form using our proposed rule set.</p>

            <p>We propose and analyze a hybrid quantum repeater architecture that combines two leading hardware platforms: quantum dots (QDs) as bright, deterministic sources of entangled photon pairs and group-IV-vacancy centers in diamond as efficient, heralded quantum memories. This combination leverages high-rate entanglement generation together with long-lived storage, enabling scalable entanglement distribution over long distances. A key challenge is the large bandwidth mismatch between QD photons and the narrow optical transitions of the memories. We combine a comprehensive model of the spin-photon interface, including full spin-photon coupling dynamics, and explore mitigation strategies such as frequency filtering and optimized magnetic-field orientation. Our results show that with optimized designs, photon-to-memory transfer can be achieved with high efficiency and fidelity, supporting the feasibility of such hybrid systems. Finally, we analyze a full repeater chain using experimentally achievable parameters and find that a network with thousands of memories across several repeater nodes could achieve a secret-key rate of 500 bit/s over 1,000 km, demonstrating the strong potential of this approach for next-generation quantum networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alan Sherry, Saptarshi Mandal, Sthitadhi Roy</p>
            <p>The projected ensemble -- an ensemble of pure states on a subsystem conditioned on projective measurement outcomes on its complement -- provides a finer probe of ergodicity and information structure than the reduced density matrix of the subsystem in bipartite quantum states. This framework can be generalised to partial projected ensembles in tripartite settings, where outcomes from part of the measured subsystem are discarded, leading to ensembles of mixed states. We show that information measures defined for such ensembles, in particular the Holevo information, yield a more detailed characterisation of how quantum information is distributed between subsystems compared to conventional entanglement measures. Using exact analytical results supported by numerical results, we uncover a qualitative change in the scaling of the Holevo information with system size in partial projected ensembles generated by Haar-random states, as the relative sizes of the subsystem are varied. In one phase, the Holevo information decays exponentially with system size, while in the other it grows linearly, thereby defining distinct information phases separated by sharp transitions signalled by non-analyticities in the Holevo information. The exponentially decaying phase rigorously establishes the existence of a measurement-invisible quantum-correlated phase -- a manifestation of many-body information scrambling with no bipartite analogue. We contrast this information-phase diagram with the entanglement-phase structure of tripartite Haar-random states obtained from logarithmic negativity, and show that the Holevo information reveals additional fine structure beyond conventional entanglement measures. Finally, we show that these information phases, as characterised by the Holevo information, emerge in the dynamics of chaotic quantum circuits and discuss the associated timescales.</p>

            <p>Long-lived storage of single photons is a fundamental requirement for enabling quantum communication and foundational tests of quantum physics over extended distances. While the implementation of a global-scale quantum network requires quantum storage times on the order of seconds to minutes, existing photonic quantum memories have so far been limited to subsecond lifetimes. Although $^{151}$Eu$^{3+}$:Y$_2$SiO$_5$ crystals exhibit substantially extended spin coherence times at the `magic' magnetic field, the concomitant weak optical absorption has until now prevented single-photon storage. Here, we overcome this challenge by integrating a noiseless photon echo protocol--which makes full use of the crystal's natural absorption for photonic storage--with a universally robust dynamical decoupling sequence incorporating adiabatic pulses to efficiently protect delocalized spin-wave excitation, enabling long-lived quantum storage at the `magic' magnetic field. At a storage time of 5.6 s, we achieve a time-bin qubit storage fidelity of 88.0 $\pm$ 2.1%, surpassing the maximum fidelity attainable via classical strategies. Our device reaches a $1/e$ storage lifetime of 27.6 $\pm$ 0.5 s, enabling single-photon-level storage for 42 s with a signal-to-noise ratio greater than unity. This work establishes photonic quantum memory in the minute-scale regime, laying a solid foundation for global-scale quantum network and deep-space quantum experiments.</p>

            <p>The present study systematically investigates the modulation mechanism of post-selected weak measurement (WM) on the non-classical properties of entangled coherent states (ECSs). The primary goal is achieving controllable enhancement of quantum resources such as entanglement and squeezing, while minimising disturbance to the quantum state. We theoretically analyze the post-selected weak measurement process, and its effectiveness in amplifying the non-classical features of ECSs. The von Neumann measurement model is employed to analytically describe the weak-value amplification of the pointer state. It is demonstrated that a significant enhancement of squeezing can be achieved by tuning the measurement coupling strength. The joint Wigner function analysis in phase space further reveals that, as the coupling strength increases, the coherent structure of the state evolves from symmetric double peaks to multi-branch quantum interference fringes. The entanglement, quantified by the Hillery-Zubairy criterion, exhibits a pronounced increase with stronger coupling, while the quantum Fisher information indicates a systematic improvement in phase estimation precision. The results obtained establish a tunable weak measurement framework for precise manipulation of continuous-variable entangled states. This provides a feasible theoretical pathway for enhancing quantum metrology and measurement-based state engineering.</p>

            <p>Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI) promises superpolynomial speedups for structured optimization; however, its practical realization is often hindered by significant sensitivity to hardware noise and spectral dispersion. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{Kernelized Decoded Quantum Interferometry (k-DQI)}, a unified framework that integrates spectral engineering directly into the quantum circuit architecture. By inserting a unitary kernel prior to the interference step, k-DQI actively reshapes the problem's energy landscape, concentrating the solution mass into a ``decoder-friendly'' low-frequency head. We formalize this advantage through a novel robustness metric, the noise-weighted head mass $\Sigma_K$, and prove a \textbf{Monotonic Improvement Theorem}, which establishes that maximizing $\Sigma_K$ guarantees higher decoding success rates under local depolarizing noise. We substantiate these theoretical gains in Optimal Polynomial Interpolation (OPI) and LDPC-like problems, demonstrating that kernel tuning functions as a ``spectral lens'' to recover signal otherwise lost to isotropic noise. Crucially, we provide explicit, efficient circuit realizations using Chirp and Linear Canonical Transform (LCT) kernels that achieve significant boosts in effective signal-to-noise ratio with negligible depth overhead ($\tilde{O}(n)$ to $\tilde{O}(n^2)$). Collectively, these results reframe DQI from a static algorithm into a tunable, noise-aware protocol suited for near-term error-corrected environments.</p>

            <p>Lie Algebras are powerful mathematical structures used in physics to describe sets of operators and associated combinations. A central task is to identify a minimal set of generators from which the algebra can be constructed. The classical search for such generators has so far relied on greedy construction steps applied to an exponentially growing number of candidate operators, making it rapidly computationally intractable. We propose a general, polynomial-scaling and optimal strategy, based on Lie-Algebraic basic properties, to overcome this bottleneck. It allows for the efficient construction of these generators, also known as Minimal Complete Pools (MCPs), for a target Lie Algebra. As an immediate application, efficiently constructing user-defined MCPs that respect fermionic algebra is crucial in the context of adaptive Variational Quantum Eigensolver for quantum chemistry. Thus, we introduce MB-ADAPT-VQE, which incorporates optimally constructed MCPs into batched ADAPT-VQE to reduce quantum resources and improve convergence under strong correlation. These MCPs also unlock fixed-ansatz methods based on a Lie-algebraic structure such as the gradient-free NI-DUCC-VQE, enabling simulations surpassing prior MCP limits. The presented mathematical framework is general and applicable well beyond chemistry in fields including quantum error correction, quantum control, quantum machine learning, and more universally wherever compact Pauli basis are required.</p>

            <p>Accurate identification of Hamiltonian parameters is essential for modeling and controlling open quantum systems. In this work, we demonstrate that the multichannel Hankel alternative view of Koopman (mHAVOK) algorithm is a robust and reliable spectral data-driven method for retrieving Hamiltonian parameters from the evolution of first-moment observables in open quantum systems. The method relies on the discrete spectrum of the Koopman operator to obtain these parameters, which are computed using the mHAVOK algorithm; a theoretical connection to this affirmation is presented. The method is tested on noiseless quadratures of an open two-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator and shown to retrieve oscillation frequencies, damping rates, nonlinear Kerr shifts, the qubit-photon coupling strength of a Jaynes-Cummings interaction, and the modulated frequency of a time-dependent Hamiltonian. The majority of the recovered parameters remained within 5\% of their actual values. Compared with Fourier and matrix-pencil estimators, our approach yields lower errors for dynamics with strong dissipation. Overall, these findings suggest that Koopman operator theory provides a practical framework for studying quantum dynamical systems.</p>

            <h2>Structural Conditions for Quadratic Degradability in Symmetric Quantum Channels</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yun-Feng Lo, Yen-Chi Lee, Min-Hsiu Hsieh</p>
            <p>This paper studies the role of symmetry in determining the low-noise behavior of high-dimensional quantum channels, with a focus on the modified Landau--Streater (MLS) family derived from spin-$j$ representations of $SU(2)$. We show that these channels exhibit a quadratic scaling of the approximate degradability parameter, $\eta = O(p^2)$, for every dimension $d=2j+1$, using an explicit degrading map whose structure is dictated by the $SU(2)$ Casimir operator. We further identify two algebraic features underlying this behavior: the tracelessness of the noise operators, which enforces a geometric orthogonality between signal and noise components, and an eigen-invariance property that preserves this structure under the channel action. These observations lead to a general sufficient condition under which a channel displays quadratic suppression of non-degradability, placing the MLS and generalized Pauli channels within a common analytical framework. Overall, the results clarify why certain symmetric noise models admit tighter low-noise capacity estimates and suggest a structural perspective for analyzing approximate degradability in higher dimensions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Laura Shou, Alireza Parhizkar, Victor Galitski</p>
            <p>We demonstrate the existence of transient two-dimensional surfaces where a random-walking particle escapes to infinity in contrast to localization in standard flat 2D space. We first prove that any rotationally symmetric 2D membrane embedded in flat 3D space cannot be transient. Then we formulate a criterion for the transience of a general asymmetric 2D membrane. We use it to explicitly construct a class of transient 2D manifolds with a non-trivial metric and height function but ``zero average curvature,'' which we dub tablecloth manifolds. The absence of the logarithmic infrared divergence of the Laplace-Beltrami operator in turn implies the absence of weak localization, non-existence of bound states in shallow potentials, and breakdown of the Mermin-Wagner theorem and Kosterlitz-Thouless transition on the tablecloth manifolds, which may be realizable in both quantum simulators and corrugated two-dimensional materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> G. Gimeno, M. Xipell, Enric Pérez</p>
            <p>This work analyses the extent to which the "blurred orbits" of the current model for the atom, drafted by Heisenberg in 1926, fits the image of a bunch of wandering electrons around a nucleus. We will deal with early appearances of the concept of indistinguishable particles within the frame of quantum mechanics. There are few studies on the use of this concept in Heisenberg's 1926 papers on helium, in contrast with the large number of them on its use in Bose--Einstein's 1924 papers. We will discuss to what extent Heisenberg's approach leads to a purely statistical interpretation of this concept. We will also study the viewpoint of Dirac, who dealt with the same topic few months later. Although the indistinguishability of the electrons and indeterminacy are common explanations for the blurring of electron orbits, we argue that such an image is an oversimplification which masks interesting aspects of: a) the dynamics of bound electrons and b) the deeper implications of indistinguishability in quantum mechanics.</p>

            <h2>Tricritical Kibble-Zurek scaling in Rydberg atom ladders</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hanteng Wang, Xingyu Li, Chengshu Li</p>
            <p>The Kibble-Zurek (KZ) mechanism has been extensively studied in various second-order phase transitions, yet the case of tricriticality-the point where second-order phase transition lines terminate-remains experimentally elusive. Here, we theoretically propose probing KZ scaling at tricritical points using Rydberg atom arrays arranged as two- and three-leg ladders, which realize the tricritical Ising and tricritical Potts universality classes. By slowly ramping the Rabi frequency and detuning, we extract two relevant tricritical exponents, $\nu$ and $\nu'$, both via conventional paths from the disordered to the ordered phase and via "tangential" paths confined entirely within the disordered phase. At faster speeds, ramping dynamics go beyond the standard KZ paradigm: data collapse analysis using the parent critical exponents (rather than the tricritical ones) reveals renormalization group flows toward the adjacent second-order critical line, and we identify it as a dynamical analog of Zamolodchikov's $c$-theorem. Our protocol is readily implementable on existing Rydberg quantum simulators. This provides a direct route to measuring distinct tricritical exponents which can reveal an emergent spacetime supersymmetry constraint $1/\nu - 1/\nu' = 1$. Moreover, this work deepens our theoretical understanding and opens new avenues for exploring beyond-KZ quantum dynamics with rich renormalization group structure.</p>

            <h2>Translation symmetry restoration in integrable systems: the noninteracting case</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Molly Gibbins, Adam Gammon-Smith, Bruno Bertini</p>
            <p>The study of symmetry restoration has recently emerged as a fruitful means to extract high-level information on the relaxation of quantum many-body systems. However, while the restoration of internal symmetries has been investigated intensively, that of spatial symmetries has hitherto only been considered in the context of random unitary circuits. Here we present a complementary study of translation symmetry restoration in integrable systems. In particular, we consider a one-dimensional chain of spinless, non-interacting fermions quenched from a $\nu>1$ shift invariant state, and follow the local restoration of one-site shift invariance using the Frobenius distance $\Delta F_A$ between the state on a subsystem and its symmetrised counterpart. Distinct from the case of random unitary circuits, where symmetry restoration occurs abruptly for times proportional to the subsystem size, we find that symmetry here is restored smoothly and over timescales of the order of the subsystem size squared. We also find that the so-called `quantum Mpemba effect' is readily observed. Most importantly, we show that - in contrast to the case of continuous internal symmetries - this discrete symmetry restoration is not qualitatively described by a quasiparticle picture for $\Delta F_A$, and therefore goes beyond the hydrodynamic description. Our results can be directly extended to higher dimensions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dorival Gonçalves, Ajay Kaladharan, Alberto Navarro</p>
            <p>The Higgs boson decay $h \to WW^* \to \ell^+ \nu_\ell \ell'^- \bar{\nu}_{\ell'}$ provides a unique window into the structure of the Higgs couplings to electroweak gauge bosons and has recently gained attention for its potential to unveil quantum properties such as quantum entanglement between the intermediate gauge bosons. In this work, we present a systematic study of next-to-leading order electroweak corrections to the angular coefficients characterizing this decay. While these coefficients are highly constrained at leading order, radiative corrections induce shifts of up to 5% to the existing terms and generate novel structures that vanish at leading order, breaking previous relations among coefficients. While higher-order effects influence the results, the two-qutrit quantum structure in the $h\to WW^*$ channel exhibits greater stability under such corrections than in the previously studied $h \to ZZ^*$ decay.</p>

            <p>Coherent quantum state transfer over macroscopic distances between non-neighboring elements in quantum circuits is a crucial component to increase connectivity and simplify quantum information processing. To facilitate such transfers, an efficient and easily controllable quantum pump would be highly beneficial. In this work, we demonstrate such a quantum pump based on a one-dimensional quasicrystal Fibonacci chain~(FC). In particular, we utilize the unique properties of quasicrystals to pump the edge-localized winding states between the two distant ends of the chain by only minimal manipulation of the FC at its end points. We establish the necessary conditions for successful state transfer within a fully time-dependent picture and also demonstrate robustness of the transfer protocol against disorder. We then couple external qubits to each end of the FC and establish highly adaptable functionality as a quantum bus with both on-demand switching of the qubit states and generation of maximally entangled Bell states between the qubits. Thanks to the minimal control parameters, the setup is well-suited for implementation across diverse experimental platforms, thus establishing quasicrystals as an efficient platform for versatile quantum information processing.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Circuits Are Just a Phase</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chris Heunen, Louis Lemonnier, Christopher McNally, Alex Rice</p>
            <p>Quantum programs today are written at a low level of abstraction - quantum circuits akin to assembly languages - and the unitary parts of even advanced quantum programming languages essentially function as circuit description languages. This state of affairs impedes scalability, clarity, and support for higher-level reasoning. More abstract and expressive quantum programming constructs are needed. To this end, we introduce a simple syntax for generating unitaries from "just a phase"; we combine a (global) phase operation that captures phase shifts with a quantum analogue of the "if let" construct that captures subspace selection via pattern matching. This minimal language lifts the focus from gates to eigendecomposition, conjugation, and controlled unitaries; common building blocks in quantum algorithm design. We demonstrate several aspects of the expressive power of our language in several ways. Firstly, we establish that our representation is universal by deriving a universal quantum gate set. Secondly, we show that important quantum algorithms can be expressed naturally and concisely, including Grover's search algorithm, Hamiltonian simulation, Quantum Fourier Transform, Quantum Signal Processing, and the Quantum Eigenvalue Transformation. Furthermore, we give clean denotational semantics grounded in categorical quantum mechanics. Finally, we implement a prototype compiler that efficiently translates terms of our language to quantum circuits, and prove that it is sound with respect to these semantics. Collectively, these contributions show that this construct offers a principled and practical step toward more abstract and structured quantum programming.</p>

            <h2>Projective Representations, Bogomolov Multiplier, and Their Applications in Physics</h2>

            <p>We present a pedagogical review of projective representations of finite groups and their physical applications in quantum many-body systems. Some of our physical results are new. We begin with a self-contained introduction to projective representations, highlighting the role of group cohomology, representation theory, and classification of irreducible projective representations. We then focus on a special subset of cohomology classes, known as the Bogomolov multiplier, which consists of cocycles that are symmetric on commuting pairs but remain nontrivial in group cohomology. Such cocycles have important physical implications: they characterize (1+1)D SPT phases that cannot be detected by string order parameters and give rise, upon gauging, to distinct gapped phases with completely broken non-invertible $\mathrm{Rep}(G)$ symmetry. We construct explicit lattice models for these phases and demonstrate how they are distinguished by the fusion rules of local order parameters. We show that a pair of completely broken $\mathrm{Rep}(G)$ SSB phases host nontrivial interface modes at their domain walls. As an example, we construct a lattice model where the ground state degeneracy on a ring increases from 32 without interfaces to 56 with interfaces.</p>

            <p>Kramers-Wannier duality, a hallmark of the Ising model, has recently gained renewed interest through its reinterpretation as a non-invertible symmetry with a state-level action. Using sequential quantum circuits (SQC), we argue that this duality governs the stability of quantum many-body scar (QMBS) states in a nonintegrable model, depending on whether the dual preserves the embedding conditions for scarring. This is supported by good agreement between first-order perturbation theory and numerics, which capture scar dynamics despite chaotic spectra. Our results establish non-invertible dualities as both a generative mechanism and a diagnostic tool for quantum many- body scarring, offering a generalized symmetry-based route to weak ergodicity breaking.</p>

Besides being a preparatory stage for quantization of the complete supersymmetric multiple D$0$-brane (mD$0$) model, which is presently known only in the frame of spinor moving frame formalism, this is interesting as its own: despite the covariant quantization of D=10 D$0$-brane was discussed before, its quantum state spectrum was not analyzed and its field theory, describing that, was not studied. We show that the quantum state vector of the D$0$-brane is described by an on-shell superfield that collects the fields of the massive counterpart of the linearized type IIA supergravity supermultiplet which can be obtained as massive Kaluza-Klein mode of the dimensional reduction of the eleven dimensional supergravity down to ten dimensions. In conclusion, we briefly discuss a spinor helicity formalism for D$0$-brane which can be used as one of the basic elements for developing type IIA string theory amplitude calculus based on multiparticle generalizations of the on-shell superfields.</p>

We demonstrate the advantages of superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) for high time resolution ($\sim$72 ps) and large-area NIR avalanche photodiodes (APDs) for high emission count rates ($\sim$2000 cps). Second-order photon-correlation analysis reveals exciton lifetimes and fine-structure energy splittings.

The QPC is arranged to maximize the readout contrast between two neighboring, coupled electron and hole QDs. We apply the readout scheme to a single-particle electron-hole double QD and demonstrate time-resolved detection of charge states as well as magnetic field dependent tunneling rates.

            <p>We develop a unified framework connecting quantum Tsallis statistics to electronic transport in strongly interacting systems. Starting from Rényi and Tsallis entropies, we construct a quantum Tsallis distribution that reduces to the conventional Fermi--Dirac distribution when $q=1$. For $q$ slightly deviating from unity, the correction term in the occupation function can be mapped to a $q$-deformed Schwarzian action, corresponding to soft reparametrization modes. Coupling these soft modes to electrons via the Fermi Golden Rule yields a modified scattering rate, which reproduces conventional Fermi-liquid behavior at low temperatures and linear-in-temperature resistivity at high temperatures. Using the memory matrix formalism, we analyze magnetotransport, finding a linear-in-field magnetoresistance and a Hall angle consistent with Anderson's two-lifetime scenario. At sufficiently low temperatures, both magnetoresistance and Hall response smoothly recover Fermi-liquid quadratic behaviors. This approach provides a controlled interpolation between Fermi-liquid and non-Fermi-liquid regimes, quantitatively linking $q$-deformation, soft-mode dynamics, and experimentally measurable transport coefficients in strange metals.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eugene V. Sukhorukov, Adrien Tomà</p>
            <p>We develop a unified perturbative framework for energy transport along a chiral quantum Hall edge coupled to a disordered, compressible strip. Treating the strip as a generic linear response environment characterized by its retarded susceptibility, we obtain leading corrections to both the heat flux carried by the edge plasmon and to its spectrum. Two generic regimes emerge: (i) a gapped, local dielectric response with finite-range coupling, producing a negative correction to the quantized heat flux that scales as T^4 at low temperatures together with a convex cubic shift of the plasmon dispersion; and (ii) a hydrodynamic (diffusive) response with relaxation, yielding a crossover from T^4 to T^{3/2} scaling and a change of sign in the correction. We further introduce a microscopic dipolar model in which the edge couples electrostatically to localized dipole moments inside a wide compressible strip. This long-range interaction amplifies the nonlocal dielectric back-action and generates new suppression laws, T^3 or even T^2 for smooth disorder profiles, together with a universal ratio connecting spectral curvature to thermal response. Across all regimes, the total heat flux remains quantized: the apparent deficit of the plasmon contribution reflects reversible heat drag into the compressible strip rather than a breakdown of quantization. The framework thus provides a coherent and quantitatively plausible explanation of the "missing heat flux" anomaly and unifies the thermal and spectral signatures of quantum Hall edge dynamics.</p>

These objects are formed by means of quantum entanglement from the circular-shaped mesoscale and microscale vortices, and can be interpreted as a vortex filaments with any shape and size. The method is based on a quantization scheme for classical closed vortex filaments that was proposed by the author early \cite{Tal18,Tal22_1,Tal_Chaos25J}. The model we consider examines the instantaneous picture of the locations in space $\mathbb R_3$ of such filaments with a small, but non-zero, core diameter. Both energy and circulation of the studied filaments are calculated using the proposed approach. We demonstrate that the adopted concept leads to the emergence of secondary vortices around these investigated filament-like objects. We also study the specific mechanisms by which large vortex loops can disconnect and create the filament fragments . From our point of view, the proposed approach to describing vortex filaments within a vortex tangle can be seen as an important step toward understanding the appearance of quantum turbulence.</p>

            <p>Replica symmetry breaking (RSB) underlies the complex organization of disordered systems, yet quantitative validation beyond $N \sim 100$ spins has remained computationally challenging. We use quantum annealing to access ground states of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model up to $N = 4000$ spins, enabling the most extensive test of Parisi's Nobel Prize-winning RSB solution to date. Five independent observables confirm RSB predictions: ground-state energies converge to Parisi's value with characteristic $N^{-2/3}$ corrections, energy fluctuations scale as $N^{-3/4}$ ($\gamma = 0.739 \pm 0.036$), the chaos exponent $\theta = 0.51 \pm 0.02$ ($R^2 = 0.989$) confirms mean-field universality, the overlap distribution exhibits hierarchical structure ($\sigma_q = 0.19$), and the complexity remains invariant under 36\% network dilution. Beyond a critical threshold $0.8 < D_c < 0.9$, the hierarchy collapses discontinuously through a cooperative avalanche that converts the entire system to vacancies within a narrow parameter window $\Delta D = 0.1$. These findings establish quantum computation as a tool for probing emergent many-body phenomena and uncover the topological foundations of complexity in disordered systems, with implications for neural networks, optimization, and materials science.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Himadri Halder</p>
            <p>Quantum many-body scars are special eigenstates that violate the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis while residing at finite energy density along with thermalizing eigenstates. The spin-1 XY model is known to host a family of such exceptional states originating from long-lived quasiparticle excitations that exhibit anomalously low entanglement entropy and long-time periodic revivals, resulting in weak ergodicity breaking. We study the stability of these scarred states against typical U(1) symmetry preserving perturbation in the XY chain. While perturbation theory can describe the deformed scar states at small system sizes, finite-size scaling of the perturbation matrix elements indicate that the scars ultimately thermalize in larger chains. Nonetheless, we demonstrate that the long-range order associated with the scars decays under the perturbation, and we estimate the relaxation timescale of oscillatory dynamics in certain local observables to be of order $\lambda^{-2}$, where $\lambda$ is the perturbation strength.</p>

            <p>We introduce a unified framework that relates orbital and heat magnetizations to experimentally accessible excitation spectra, through thermoelectric probes and generalized sum rules. By analyzing zero-temperature transport coefficients and applying Kramers-Kronig relations, we derive spectral representations of magnetization densities from thermoelectric correlation functions. Excitation rates under chiral thermoelectric drives then naturally emerge as direct probes of these Kubo-type correlators, placing orbital and heat magnetizations on equal footing with the topological Chern number. As a direct consequence of our formalism, we introduce a hierarchical construction that organizes orbital and heat magnetizations into distinct physical contributions accessible through sum rules, and also derive real-space markers of these magnetizations. From an experimental standpoint, we propose concrete implementations of thermoelectric dichroic measurements in quantum-engineered platforms based on modulated strain fields. These results establish thermoelectric dichroic measurements as a versatile route to access and disentangle fundamental ground-state properties.</p>

            <h2>Testing Single Photon Entanglement using Self-Referential Measurements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Kun, Teodor Strömberg, Borivoje Dakić, Philip Walther, Lee A. Rozema</p>
            <p>Entanglement does not always require one particle per party. It was predicted some thirty years ago that a single photon traversing a beam splitter could violate a Bell inequality. Although initially debated, single-photon nonlocality was eventually demonstrated via homodyne measurements. Here, we present an alternate realisation that avoids the complexity of homodyne measurements and potential loopholes in their implementation. We violate a Bell inequality by performing joint measurements on two copies of the same single-photon entangled state, where one photon acts as a phase reference for the other, making it self-referential. We observe CHSH parameters of $2.71\pm 0.09$ and $2.23\pm 0.07$, depending on the joint measurements implemented. This offers a new perspective on single-photon nonlocality and a more accessible experimental route, potentially applicable to general mode-entangled states in diverse platforms.</p>

            <p>Photons are promising candidates for quantum information technology due to their high robustness and long coherence time at room temperature. Inspired by the prosperous development of photonic computing techniques, recent research has turned attention to performing quantum machine learning on photonic platforms. Although photons possess a high-dimensional quantum feature space suitable for computation, a general understanding of how to harness it for learning tasks remains blank. Here, we establish both theoretically and experimentally a scalable advantage in quantum machine learning with multi-photon states. Firstly, we prove that the learning capacity of linear optical circuits scales polynomially with the photon number, enabling generalization from smaller training datasets and yielding lower test loss values. Moreover, we experimentally corroborate these findings through unitary learning and metric learning tasks, by performing online training on a fully programmable photonic integrated platform. Our work highlights the potential of photonic quantum machine learning and paves the way for achieving quantum enhancement in practical machine learning applications.</p>

            <h2>Experimental signatures of a $σ_zσ_x$ beam-splitter interaction between a Kerr-cat and transmon qubit</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Josiah Cochran, Haley M. Cole, Hebah Goderya, Zhuoqun Hao, Yao-Chun Chang, Theo Shaw, Aikaterini Kargioti, Shyam Shankar</p>
            <p>Quantum error correction (QEC) requires ancilla qubits to extract error syndromes from data qubits which store quantum information. However, ancilla errors can propagate back to the data qubits, introducing additional errors and limiting fault-tolerance. In superconducting quantum circuits, Kerr-cat qubits (KCQs), which exhibit strongly biased noise, have been proposed as ancillas to suppress this back-action and enhance QEC performance. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a beamsplitter interaction between a KCQ and a transmon, realizing an effective $\sigma_z\sigma_x$ coupling that can be employed for parity measurements in QEC protocols. We characterize the interaction across a range of cat sizes and drive amplitudes, confirming the expected scaling of the interaction rate. These results establish a step towards hybrid architectures that combine transmons as data qubits with noise-biased bosonic ancillas, enabling hardware-efficient syndrome extraction and advancing the development of fault-tolerant quantum processors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nishchay Suri, Zhihui Wang, Tanay Roy, Davide Venturelli, Wibe Albert de Jong</p>
            <p>We present a quantum sensing protocol for coupled qubit-oscillator systems that surpasses the standard quantum limit (SQL) by exploiting a geometrical phase. The signal is encoded in the geometrical phase that is proportional to the area enclosed in oscillator phase space. This area is amplified through squeezing, enabling sensitivities beyond the SQL. Our method is independent of oscillator's initial state, amenable to sensing with high-temperature or logical error-corrected states. The protocol shows robustness to qubit Markovian noise and preserves its state-independence, underscoring its practicality for next-generation quantum metrology. We demonstrate application to force sensing beyond the SQL in longitudinally coupled systems, and to high-precision measurements of couplings and pulse calibration surpassing SQL in dispersively coupled circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) architectures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shuyue Feng, Zijian Gan, Camryn J. Gloor, Wei You, Andrew M. Moran</p>
            <p>Two-dimensional organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite (2D-OIHP) quantum wells are emerging as promising light sources for quantum communication technologies, owing to their ability to generate polarization-encoded optical signals. In this work, we explore how nonlinear optical phenomena can be exploited for quantum information applications, demonstrating the versatility that arises from resonant coupling among excited states. By tracking changes in the ellipticities of signal photons on femtosecond timescales in four-wave-mixing experiments, we first establish a method for information encoding based on exciton spin dynamics and biexciton correlations. Using single-photon detection, we then implement the BB84 quantum key distribution protocol by mapping these polarization states onto binary sequences. While the polarizations of weak coherent pulses are typically manipulated with optical elements in traditional quantum key distribution approaches, the intrinsic electronic structure and spin relaxation processes within the 2D-OIHP system determine the characteristics of the signal photons in our method. As a demonstration, an ASCII message consisting of 56 bits is transmitted through the polarization states of photons emitted by 2D-OIHP quantum wells. These results show that the information transmission efficiency depends strongly on contributions from biexciton states, highlighting the potential of spin-dependent nonlinear optical processes for quantum communication.</p>

            <h2>Switchable Dissipative Ising coupling Based on Three-Body Coupling in magnon systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xi-Wen Dou, Zheng-Yang Zhou, Ai-Xi Chen</p>
            <p>Magnonic systems present a compelling platform for quantum technology, owing to their strong capacity to form hybrid quantum systems via diverse couplings. To unlock the full potential of these systems, the engineering of flexible coupling between multiple magnon modes is essential. Here, we propose a method to realize switchable dissipative Ising coupling in magnon systems, leveraging the three-body coupling among photon, phonon, and magnon. This type of dissipative coupling is a critical component for constructing Ising machines designed to solve complex combinatorial optimization problems. By dynamically tuning the phase of a nonlinear mechanical pump, we demonstrate the realization of both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic dissipative interactions. The validity of the scheme is confirmed by numerical simulations, which also demonstrate its robustness against a strong uncontrollable part of dissipation. Our work provides a versatile tool that can facilitate the implementation of magnon-based quantum computing and the exploration of many-body magnon physics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ashish Kumar Patra, Anurag K. S. V., Sai Shankar P., Ruchika Bhat, Raghavendra V., Rahul Maitra, Jaiganesh G</p>
            <p>The accurate treatment of electron correlation in extended molecular systems remains computationally challenging using classical electronic structure methods. Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms offer a potential route to overcome these limitations; however, their practical deployment on existing quantum computers requires strategies that both reduce problem size and mitigate hardware noise. In this work, we combine Density Matrix Embedding Theory (DMET) with Sample-based Quantum Diagonalization (SQD) to compute ground-state energies of a set of natural ligand-like molecules in the minimal Slater Type Orbital (STO-3G) basis set. DMET provides a systematic fragmentation of a molecule into embedded impurity subproblems, while SQD enables construction and classical diagonalization of reduced configuration spaces through quantum sampling enhanced by iterative configuration recovery. The resulting embedded Hamiltonians are solved on IBM's Eagle R3 superconducting quantum hardware (IBM Sherbrooke). The DMET-SQD energies obtained for all systems considered exhibit strong agreement with DMET-FCI benchmark values within chemical accuracy (1 kcal/mol). These results demonstrate that sample-based quantum methods, when integrated with a robust embedding framework, can reliably extend quantum computation towards simulation of chemically relevant molecular systems, showcasing potential applications in the field of drug discovery.</p>

            <p>Quantum computing algorithms can be decomposed into a universal set of elementary one- and two-qubit gates. Different physical implementations of quantum computing, however, employ interactions that permit direct conditional dynamics on multiple qubits in a single step. In this work, we leverage quantum optimal control techniques to design single continuous laser pulses that implement multi-qubit controlled-phase, -NOT and -swap (Fredkin) gates on Rydberg atom quantum processors. The identification of robust multi-qubit operations leads to reduced operation time and less decoherence, and the control field provides continuous protection of the atoms from environmental noise. Notably, we find that the controlled-swap (Fredkin) gate, implemented using this approach achieves 99.74\% fidelity while accounting for imperfections such as spontaneous emission, laser fluctuations, and Doppler dephasing.</p>

            <p>Continuous monitoring of open quantum-optical systems offers a promising route towards quantum-enhanced estimation precision. In such continuous-measurement-based sensing protocols, the ultimate precision limit is dictated, through the quantum Cramér-Rao bound, by the global quantum Fisher information associated with the joint system-environment state. Reaching this limit with established continuous measurement techniques in quantum optics remains an outstanding challenge. Here we present a sensing protocol tailored for open quantum-optical sensors that exhibit dissipative criticality, enabling them to significantly narrow the gap to the ultimate precision limit. Our protocol leverages a previously unexplored interplay between the quantum criticality and the quantum measurement backaction inherent in continuous general-dyne detection. We identify a performance sweet spot, near which the ultimate precision limit can be efficiently approached. Our protocol establishes a new pathway towards quantum-enhanced precision in open quantum-optical setups and can be extended to other sensor designs featuring similar dissipative criticality.</p>

            <p>An array of initially excited emitters coupled to a one-dimensional waveguide exhibits superradiant decay under the Born-Markov approximation, manifested as a coherent burst of photons in the output field. In this work, we employ tensor-network methods to investigate its non-Markovian dynamics induced by finite time delays in photon exchange among the emitters. We find that the superradiant burst breaks into a structured train of correlated photons, each intensity peak corresponding to a specific photon number. We quantify the emitter-photon and emitter-emitter entanglement generated during this process and show that the latter emerges in the long-time limit, as part of the excitation becomes trapped within the emitters' singlet subspace. We finally consider the decay of the system's most radiant state, the symmetric Dicke state, and show that time delay can lead to decay rates exceeding those predicted by the Markovian approximation.</p>

            <h2>Unifying Collective Effects in Emission, Absorption, and Transfer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adesh Kushwaha, Erik M. Gauger, Ivan Kassal</p>
            <p>Collective effects, such as superradiance and subradiance are central to emerging quantum technologies -- from sensing to energy storage -- and play an important role in light-harvesting. These effects enhance or suppress rates of dynamic processes (absorption, emission, and transfer) due to the formation of symmetric or antisymmetric collective states. However, collective effects in different contexts -- absorption, emission, and transfer -- have often been defined disparately, especially across different communities, leading to results that are not immediately transferable between different contexts. Here, we describe all three types of collective effects using a common Dicke framework that resolves the apparent discrepancies between different approaches. It allows us to generalise previously known collective effects involving spins into new ones involving aggregates of harmonic oscillators or other degrees of freedom. It also explains how collective effects can be engineered to be robust against both disorder and noise, paving the way for more resilient quantum devices.</p>

            <p>The basic element of circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) is a cavity resonator strongly coupled to a superconducting qubit. Since the inception of the field, the choice of the cavity frequency was, with a few exceptions, been limited to a narrow range around 7 GHz due to a variety of fundamental and practical considerations. Here we report the first cQED implementation, where the qubit remains a regular transmon at about 5 GHz frequency, but the cavity's fundamental mode raises to 21 GHz. We demonstrate that (i) the dispersive shift remains in the conventional MHz range despite the large qubit-cavity detuning, (ii) the quantum efficiency of the qubit readout reaches 8%, (iii) the qubit's energy relaxation quality factor exceeds $10^7$, (iv) the qubit coherence time reproducibly exceeds $100~\mu\rm{s}$ and can reach above $300~\mu\rm{s}$ with a single echoing $\pi$-pulse correction. The readout error is currently limited by an accidental resonant excitation of a non-computational state, the elimination of which requires minor adjustments to the device parameters. Nevertheless, we were able to initialize the qubit in a repeated measurement by post-selection with $2\times 10^{-3}$ error and achieve $4\times 10^{-3}$ state assignment error. These results encourage in-depth explorations of potentially transformative advantages of high-frequency cavities without compromising existing qubit functionality.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhe-Qi Yang, Si-Qi Lin, Zhi-Rong Zhong</p>
            <p>Ultrahigh nonreciprocal transmission has been achieved in a cavity-magnon system, which consists of two whispering gallery modes (WGMs) and a single magnon mode within a magnetic insulator yttrium iron garnet sphere. The nonreciprocal frequency shift induced by the Sagnac effect enables unidirectional transmission of an input field, while suppressing propagation in the opposite direction, thereby facilitating nonreciprocal optical transmission. Within experimentally accessible parameter regimes, the optical isolation ratio can exceed 40 dB, representing the highest isolation ratio reported to date. Furthermore, applying squeezing to the magnon mode further enhances this isolation performance. Additionally, the directionality of light isolation can be reversed simply by modifying the rotation of the WGM cavity. These findings offer promising prospects for developing high-performance, tunable, and compact optical nonreciprocal devices.</p>

            <p>Precise control of photon transport in waveguide quantum electrodynamics is fundamental to advancing quantum information processing. We investigate the manipulation of single-photon scattering via a driven $\Lambda$-type emitter coupled to a rectangular waveguide, examining both single- and multi-mode regimes. Using the Lippmann-Schwinger formalism, we derive the scattering matrix and identify two distinct control mechanisms: Fano resonances induce complete reflection, and electromagnetically induce transparency (EIT) induce perfect transmission. In the single-mode regime, the external drive parameters-the detuning and Rabi frequency-precisely tune the positions and number of reflection peaks, allowing dynamic spectral engineering. In the multi-mode regime, quantum interference between modes governs the scattering dynamics. When the input photon is prepared in a specific coherent superposition, multi-mode effects restore single-mode-like behavior, enabling Fano-mediated complete reflection. Conversely, a single-mode input prevents complete reflection even at the Fano resonance, while EIT-driven transmission persists. These results demonstrate a versatile toolbox for photonic quantum control in multi-mode waveguides, paving the way for applications such as broadband dual-frequency filters and multi-mode spectrometers.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ratun Rahman, Dinh C. Nguyen</p>
            <p>Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are becoming the primary computational primitive for next-generation quantum computers, particularly those embedded as resource-constrained accelerators in the emerging Quantum Internet of Things (QIoT). However, under such device-constrained execution conditions, the scalability of learning is severely limited by barren plateaus, where gradients collapse to zero and training stalls. This poses a practical challenge to delivering VQA-enabled intelligence on QIoT endpoints, which often have few qubits, constrained shot budgets, and strict latency requirements. In this paper, we present a novel approach for escaping barren plateaus by including negative learning rates into the optimization process in QIoT devices. Our method introduces controlled instability into model training by switching between positive and negative learning phases, allowing recovery of significant gradients and exploring flatter areas in the loss landscape. We theoretically evaluate the effect of negative learning on gradient variance and propose conditions under which it helps escape from barren zones. The experimental findings on typical VQA benchmarks show consistent improvements in both convergence and simulation results over traditional optimizers. By escaping barren plateaus, our approach leads to a novel pathway for robust optimization in quantum-classical hybrid models.</p>

            <p>Microwave drives applied to superconducting qubits (SCQs) are central to high-fidelity control and fast readout. However, recent studies find that even drives far below the superconducting gap frequency may cause drive-induced quasiparticle generation (QPG) across Josephson junctions (JJs), posing a serious concern for fault-tolerant superconducting quantum computing. Here, we find experimental evidence that the actual QPG rates in strongly driven SCQs are remarkably lower than expected. We apply intense drive fields through readout resonators, reaching effective qubit drive amplitudes up to 300 GHz. The nonlinear response of the resonators enables quantification of the energy loss from SCQs into their environments, including the contribution from QPG. Even when conservatively attributing all measured dissipation to QPG, the observed energy dissipation rates are far lower than expected from the ideal QPG model. Meanwhile, calculations incorporating high-frequency cutoffs (HFCs) near 17-20 GHz in the QPG conductance can explain the experiments. These HFCs yield QPG rates a few orders of magnitude smaller than those without HFCs, providing evidence that the QPG rates are lower than predicted by the ideal model. Our findings prevent overestimation of drive-induced QPG and provide crucial guidance for operating superconducting quantum processors. Identifying the microscopic origin of the discrepancy opens new material and device opportunities to further mitigate QPG.</p>

            <p>This work explores connections between the quantum relative entropy of two faithful states $\rho,\sigma$ (i.e. full-rank density matrices) and the Kullback-Leibler divergences of classical measures $\mu,\nu$. Here, $\mu$ and $\nu$ are measures on the space of pure states, realizing $\rho$ and $\sigma$ respectively. The motivation for this result is to establish a notion of quantum relative entropy in the space of pure state distributions, which are the resulting objects of unravelings of the Lindblad equation, such as the stochastic Schrödinger equation. Our results show that the measures that achieve the minimal KL divergence are those supported on a (possibly non-orthogonal) common basis between $\rho$ and $\sigma$. Using the classical and quantum data-processing inequalities, our notion of quantum relative entropy is shown to be equivalent to the Belavkin-Staszewski entropy on states, revealing new insights on this quantity. Furthermore, the common basis is used to provide a novel proof of contraction of the relative entropy under Lindblad flow and offers insights into results from large deviation theory.</p>

            <p>Subwavelength atomic arrays offer a powerful platform for engineering cooperative light-matter interactions and enabling quantum metasurfaces. We demonstrate that a two-dimensional array of three-level atoms operating under electromagnetically induced transparency can function as a tunable dual-band atomic mirror, where two independently controllable reflection bands emerge from the collective optical responses mediated by dipole-dipole interactions. These resonances yield dual reflection bands with asymmetric linewidths, whose spectral positions and bandwidths can be tuned through the control-field parameters, dipole orientation, incident geometry, and lattice constant. We further identify the conditions under which additional diffraction orders emerge, which delineate the operational and tunable range of the atomic mirror via its collective-mode structure. This scheme provides a fully tunable dual-band atomic mirror operating across broad frequency and angular ranges, offering a practical and experimentally accessible pathway toward reconfigurable photonic elements in atomic-array platforms at low energy levels.</p>

            <p>Bosonic modes provide a promising platform for quantum batteries as a result of their unbounded energy spectrum. However, the energy that can be stored during a coherent charging process is limited due to coherent oscillations between the charger and battery. In this Letter, we show that by introducing a slow quench in the interaction between a coherently driven quadratic oscillator battery and a charger system, the maximum battery power ($P_{B,m}$) scales algebraically with the quench duration ($\tau_Q$), i.e., $P_{B,m} \propto \tau_Q^\alpha$, where $0<\alpha\leq2$ is a function of the quench ramp exponent. This finding implies that, counterintuitively, slower quenches lead to faster charging. Such a quench suppresses coherent energy oscillations between the battery and the charger, allowing an unbounded increase in power. Furthermore, we discuss the effect of charger dissipation, which imposes a finite limit on the maximum power. We also show that the temporal extensive scaling occurs in a broader context by mapping the system to a coherently driven Tavis-Cummings battery.</p>

            <h2>Efficient Identification of Permutation Symmetries in Many-Body Hamiltonians via Graph Theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saumya Shah, Patrick Rebentrost</p>
            <p>The computational cost of simulating quantum many-body systems can often be reduced by taking advantage of physical symmetries. While methods exist for specific symmetry classes, a general algorithm to find the full permutation symmetry group of an arbitrary Pauli Hamiltonian is notably lacking. This paper introduces a new method that identifies this symmetry group by establishing an isomorphism between the Hamiltonian's permutation symmetry group and the automorphism group of a coloured bipartite graph constructed from the Hamiltonian. We formally prove this isomorphism and show that for physical Hamiltonians with bounded locality and interaction degree, the resulting graph has a bounded degree, reducing the computational problem of finding the automorphism group to polynomial time. The algorithm's validity is empirically confirmed on various physical models with known symmetries. We further show that the problem of deciding whether two Hamiltonians are permutation-equivalent is polynomial-time reducible to the graph isomorphism problem using our graph representation. This work provides a general, structurally exact tool for algorithmic symmetry finding, enabling the scalable application of these symmetries to Hamiltonian simulation problems.</p>

            <p>A precise physical description and understanding of the classical dual content of quantum theory is necessary in many disciplines today: from concepts and interpretation to quantum technologies and computation. In this paper we investigate Quantum Entanglement with the new approach APL Quantum 2, 016104 (2025) on dual Classicalization. Thus, the results of this paper are twofold: Entanglement and Classicalization and the relationship between them. Classicalization truly occurs only under the action of the Metaplectic group Mp(n) (Minimal Representation group, double covering of the Symplectic group). Some of the results of this paper involves the computation and analysis of the entanglement for different types of coherent (coset and non coset) states and topologies: in the circle and the cylinder. We project the entangled wave functions onto the even (+) and odd (-) irreducible Hilbert Mp(n) subspaces, and compute their square norms: Entanglement Probabilities P++, P--, P+-, (eg in the same or in the different subspaces), and the Total sum of them, and more. These theoretical and conceptual results can be of experimental and practical real-world interest.</p>

            <h2>Quantum spectroscopy of topological dynamics via a supersymmetric Hamiltonian</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hiroshi Yamauchi, Satoshi Kanno, Yuki Sato, Hiroyuki Tezuka, Yoshi-aki Shimada, Eriko Kaminishi, Naoki Yamamoto</p>
            <p>Topological data analysis (TDA) characterizes complex dynamics through global invariants, but classical computation becomes prohibitive for high-dimensional data. We reinterpret time-domain dynamics as the eigenvalue spectrum of a supersymmetric (SUSY) Hamiltonian and thereby estimate topological descriptors through quantum spectroscopy. While zero modes correspond to Betti numbers, we show that low-lying excited states quantify the stability of topological features. Using a Takens embedding of the Lorenz system together with a resource-efficient quantum phase estimation implemented on IBM quantum hardware, we observe that the spectral gap of the SUSY Laplacian tracks the persistence of homological structures. Notably, the minimum of this spectral gap coincides with the onset of chaos, whereas its reopening reflects the geometric maturation of the attractor. Validated on small complexes yet offering an exponential advantage over classical diagonalization (from $O(N^3)$ to $\mathrm{poly}(\log N)$), this framework suggests that quantum hardware can function as a spectrometer for data topologies beyond classical reach.</p>

            <h2>Nonstabilizerness Estimation using Graph Neural Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vincenzo Lipardi, Domenica Dibenedetto, Georgios Stamoulis, Evert van Nieuwenburg, Mark H.M. Winands</p>
            <p>This article proposes a Graph Neural Network (GNN) approach to estimate nonstabilizerness in quantum circuits, measured by the stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE). Nonstabilizerness is a fundamental resource for quantum advantage, and efficient SRE estimations are highly beneficial in practical applications. We address the nonstabilizerness estimation problem through three supervised learning formulations starting from easier classification tasks to the more challenging regression task. Experimental results show that the proposed GNN manages to capture meaningful features from the graph-based circuit representation, resulting in robust generalization performances achieved across diverse scenarios. In classification tasks, the GNN is trained on product states and generalizes on circuits evolved under Clifford operations, entangled states, and circuits with higher number of qubits. In the regression task, the GNN significantly improves the SRE estimation on out-of-distribution circuits with higher number of qubits and gate counts compared to previous work, for both random quantum circuits and structured circuits derived from the transverse-field Ising model. Moreover, the graph representation of quantum circuits naturally integrates hardware-specific information. Simulations on noisy quantum hardware highlight the potential of the proposed GNN to predict the SRE measured on quantum devices.</p>

            <h2>Identifying genuine entanglement of lossy noisy very large scale continuous variable Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiao-yu Chen</p>
            <p>Genuine entanglement identification of large scale systems is crucial for quantum computation, quantum communication and quantum learning advantage. In contrast to experiments, where noisy intermediate-scale programmable photonic quantum processors have been developed, theoretically very limited results have been achieved for detecting genuine entanglement of continuous variable multipartite systems. We propose a quite general and efficient entanglement detection framework for all kinds of multipartite entanglement of continuous variable systems based on uncertainty relations and the sign matrix technique. Matrix criteria are demonstrated and can be applied to various entanglement depth and k-separability problems of multimode systems. We illustrate the genuine entanglement conditions of continuous variable Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states of more than a hundred million modes in a photon loss and noise environment.</p>

            <h2>Unrepeated White Rabbit Time Synchronisation over a 300 km Optical Fibre Link</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ben Amies-King, Marco Lucamarini</p>
            <p>White Rabbit (WR) technology provides a commercially-available off-the-shelf solution for time synchronisation with sub-nanosecond accuracy and picosecond-level precision over optical fibre links typically spanning tens of kilometres. Such high-performance time dissemination can support a variety of applications, including position, navigation and timing (PNT), financial transactions, metrology, as well as entanglement and quantum key distribution (QKD). Demonstrations of WR over significantly longer distances remain few and far between, particularly in scenarios where intermediate amplification is unavailable, such as stretches of long-haul underwater fibre. In this work, we report the longest unrepeated deployment of WR to date, achieving time synchronisation over a 300 km (51.34 dB) single-span optical fibre link, even in highly asymmetrical configurations, with 99.86% uptime, whilst maintaining picosecond-level precision and sub-nanosecond accuracy. This was achieved through careful selection and optimisation of the components deployed at the link's end points. By leveraging standard telecom fibre and off-the-shelf hardware, our results pave the way for a scalable and standardised timing backbone for large-scale quantum networks, offering a practical route toward time distribution in future heterogeneous quantum communication systems.</p>

            <h2>Inhibited radiative decay enhances single-photon emitters</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Florian Burger, Stephan Rinner, Andreas Gritsch, Kilian Sandholzer, Andreas Reiserer</p>
            <p>Quantum networks and the modular scaling of quantum computers require efficient spin-photon interfaces. This can be achieved with optical resonators that increase the local density of states, thereby enhancing the radiative decay of emitters on a specific transition. However, small mode volumes and high quality factors are required in this approach, which restricts the multiplexing capacity and necessitates precise tuning of the resonator frequency. Here, we demonstrate an alternative method that avoids these bottlenecks for up-scaling. Instead of strongly enhancing the emission on a selected transition, we suppress all other radiative decay channels by tailoring the photonic bandgap of a W1 silicon photonic crystal waveguide. In such a device, we can spectrally resolve and individually address tens of erbium dopants. We find that their emission is channeled to the desired transition, ensuring efficient collection. At the same time, their lifetimes are preserved or even extended compared to the bulk in a broad spectral range. Furthermore, the extended mode volume facilitates a low dopant concentration and thus a large spatial separation between the emitters, avoiding unwanted interactions that would limit their coherence. The demonstrated approach of inhibiting unwanted spontaneous emission can be combined with Purcell enhancement and applied to other leading spin-qubit platforms. It thus opens intriguing perspectives for photonic quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Cubature Codes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yaoling Yang, Andrew Tanggara, Tobias Haug, Kishor Bharti</p>
            <p>Bosonic codes utilize the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space of harmonic oscillators to encode quantum information, offering a hardware-efficient approach to quantum error correction. Designing these codes requires precise geometric arrangements of quantum states in the phase space. Here, we introduce Quantum Cubature Codes (QCCs), a powerful and generalized framework for constructing bosonic codes based on superpositions of coherent states. This formalism utilizes cubature formulas from multivariate approximation theory, which connect the continuous geometry of the phase space to discrete, weighted point sets, ensuring the conditions for error correction are met. We demonstrate that this framework provides a unifying perspective, revealing that well-established codes, such as cat codes and the recently proposed quantum spherical codes (QSCs), are specific instances of QCCs corresponding to uniform weights on a single energy shell. The QCC formalism unlocks a vast new design space, encompassing non-uniform superpositions and multi-shell configurations. We leverage this framework to discover several new families of codes derived from Euclidean designs, allowing for greater geometric separation between logical states, which correlates with improved performance under photon loss. Numerical simulations under a pure-loss channel show that our multi-shell QCCs can outperform their single-shell counterparts by maximizing geometric separation with optimal energy at fixed pure-loss rate.</p>

            <p>Analog Quantum Simulators offer a route to exploring strongly correlated many-body dynamics beyond classical computation, but their predictive power remains limited by the absence of quantitative error estimation. Establishing rigorous uncertainty bounds is essential for elevating such devices from qualitative demonstrations to quantitative scientific tools. Here we introduce a general framework for bounded-error quantum simulation, which provides predictions for many-body observables with experimentally quantifiable uncertainties. The approach combines Hamiltonian and Lindbladian Learning--a statistically rigorous inference of the coherent and dissipative generators governing the dynamics--with the propagation of their uncertainties into the simulated observables, yielding confidence bounds directly derived from experimental data. We demonstrate this framework on trapped-ion quantum simulators implementing long-range Ising interactions with up to 51 ions, and validate it where classical comparison is possible. We analyze error bounds on two levels. First, we learn an open-system model from experimental data collected in an initial time window of quench dynamics, simulate the corresponding master equation, and quantitatively verify consistency between theoretical predictions and measured dynamics at long times. Second, we establish error bounds directly from experimental measurements alone, without relying on classical simulation--crucial for entering regimes of quantum advantage. The learned models reproduce the experimental evolution within the predicted bounds, demonstrating quantitative reliability and internal consistency. Bounded-error quantum simulation provides a scalable foundation for trusted analog quantum computation, bridging the gap between experimental platforms and predictive many-body physics. The techniques presented here directly extend to digital quantum simulation.</p>

            <h2>Hilbert space fragmentation in driven-dephasing Rydberg atom array</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tianyi Yan, Chun Hei Leung, Weibin Li</p>
            <p>We investigate the onset and mechanism of Hilbert space fragmentation (HSF) in a chain of strongly interacting Rydberg atoms subject to local dephasing. It is found that the emergence of multiple long-lived metastable states is fundamentally tied to HSF of the driven-dephasing Rydberg atom system. We demonstrate that the manifesting HSF is captured by a dephasing PXP model that supports multiple degenerate zero modes. These modes form disconnected, block-diagonal subspaces of maximally mixed states, which consist of many-body spin states sharing the same symmetry. A key result is the identification of the underlying symmetry in the HSF, where conserved quantities in each subspace are defined by the consecutive double excitation addressing operator. Moreover, we show explicitly that the number of the fragmented Hilbert space grows exponentially with the chain length, following a modified Fibonacci sequence. Our work provides insights into many-body dynamics under dynamical constraints and opens avenues for controlling and manipulating HSF in Rydberg atom systems.</p>

            <p>We examine the complementarity among coherence (visibility), predictability, and entanglement for qubit and qutrit systems subjected to noisy quantum channels. Using the system-path entanglement framework, analytical expressions for all three quantities are derived for two- and three-slit interferometric setups. The study first establishes the validity of the triality relation in ideal conditions and then investigates its behavior under amplitude and phase damping. We find that amplitude damping redistributes coherence and population imbalance without violating complementarity, while phase damping reduces coherence but leaves predictability unchanged. These results demonstrate that the complementarity relation remains preserved even in open quantum systems, highlighting its robustness against decoherence and providing a unified analytical understanding of noisy quantum interferometry in low-dimensional systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Malik Jirasek, Igor Lesanovsky, Albert Cabot</p>
            <p>Modern precision measurements, such as interferometry for detecting gravitational waves, rely on the estimation of optical phases encoded in light fields. Here, we propose to exploit the collectively enhanced output field of a driven-dissipative many-body open quantum system as a light source in order to improve the precision of estimating optical phases. Pronounced temporal correlations of such output fields benefit the sensitivity of measurement protocols, which we show theoretically by employing a boundary time crystal as a light source. The fundamental bound on the precision of such estimation shows scaling with system size that surpasses the Heisenberg limit and obeys the standard quantum limit in the measurement time. This scaling can be partially harnessed by a protocol, in which the phase shifted light field is guided into an auxiliary replica system, which serves as a detector that is sensitive to non-trivial temporal correlations of the light.</p>

            <p>The limited number of qubits per chip remains a critical bottleneck in quantum computing, motivating the use of distributed architectures that interconnect multiple quantum processing units (QPUs). However, executing quantum algorithms across distributed systems requires careful co-design of algorithmic primitives and hardware architectures to manage circuit depth and entanglement overhead. We identify multivariate trace estimation as a key subroutine that is naturally suited for distribution, and broadly useful in tasks such as estimating Rényi entropies, virtual cooling and distillation, and certain applications of quantum signal processing. In this work, we introduce COMPAS, an architecture that realizes multivariate trace estimation across a multi-party network of interconnected modular and distributed QPUs by leveraging pre-shared entangled Bell pairs as resources. COMPAS adds only a constant depth overhead and consumes Bell pairs at a rate linear in circuit width, making it suitable for near-term hardware. Unlike other schemes, which must choose between asymptotic optimality in circuit depth or GHZ width, COMPAS achieves both at once. Additionally, we analyze network-level errors and simulate the effects of circuit-level noise on the architecture.</p>

            <h2>A Heuristic for Matrix Product State Simulation of Out-of-Equilibrium Dynamics of Two-Dimensional Transverse-Field Ising Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Salvatore Mandrà, Nikita Astrakhantsev, Sergei Isakov, Benjamin Villalonga, Brayden Ware, Tom Westerhout, Kostyantyn Kechedzhi</p>
            <p>Out-of-equilibrium dynamics of non-integrable Hamiltonian many-body quantum systems are characterized by highly entangled wave functions. Near-maximal entanglement arises in systems exhibiting thermalization or pre-thermalization, where the system converges to a steady state with a fixed energy density. Classical simulation of the time dependence of such wave functions requires exponential resources. However, typical computations aim to estimate expectation values of local operators and correlation functions to some expected precision. For thermalizing systems at sufficiently high energy densities, such computations do not require storing the full wave function. Nonetheless, constructing classical algorithms for intermediate energy densities has remained a challenge. In this paper, we propose a heuristic approach to accelerate the convergence of Matrix Product State (MPS) simulations of expectation values applicable in a broad range of energy densities. We estimate the desired observables by rescaling the MPS results at low bond dimensions with a factor that depends only on the fidelity of the MPS wave function. Using this technique, we simulated the dynamics of the two-dimensional Transverse-Field Ising Model (TFIM) on a $7\times8$ grid with periodic boundary conditions, using a maximum bond dimension of $\chi = 4096$ on a single A100 GPU. We compared our results to similar TFIM simulations on a digital quantum processor.</p>

Here we give a remarkably simple construction of this channel, making its known properties -- and several new ones -- immediately transparent. In particular, we show that the channel also purifies non-i.i.d. states: it transforms any permutationally symmetric state into a uniform convex combination of permutationally symmetric purifications, each differing only by a tensor-product unitary acting on the purifying system. We then apply the channel to give a one-line proof of (a stronger version of) the recently established Uhlmann's theorem for quantum divergences.</p>

            <p>An accurate identification of Hamiltonian parameters is essential for modeling and control of open quantum systems. In this work, a novel data-driven method for inferring such parameters from first-moment dynamics is presented using an open 2D quantum harmonic oscillator as an example. The method relies on the discrete spectrum of the Koopman operator to obtain such parameters, which is obtained using the multichannel Hankel Alternative View of Koopman (mHAVOK) algorithm; a theoretical connection of such affirmation is presented. The method is tested on the expected value of noiseless quadratures, retrieving oscillation frequencies, damping rates, nonlinear Kerr shifts, qubit-photon coupling strengths of a Jaynes-Cummings interaction, and a modulated frequency of a time-dependent Hamiltonian. The majority of the recovered parameters remained within 5% of their true values. When compared to Fourier and matrix-pencil estimators, our approach yields lower errors for dynamics with strong dissipation. Overall, these findings suggest that Koopman operator theory provides a practical framework for studying quantum dynamical systems.</p>

            <p>We study covert communication and covert secret key generation with positive rates over quantum state-dependent channels. Specifically, we consider fully quantum state-dependent channels when the transmitter shares an entangled state with the channel. We study this problem setting under two security metrics. For the first security metric, the transmitter aims to communicate covertly with the receiver while simultaneously generating a covert secret key, and for the second security metric, the transmitter aims to transmit a secure message covertly and generate a covert secret key with the receiver simultaneously. Our main results include one-shot and asymptotic achievable positive covert-secret key rate pairs for both security metrics. Our results recover as a special case the best-known results for covert communication over state-dependent classical channels. To the best of our knowledge, our results are the first instance of achieving a positive rate for covert secret key generation and the first instance of achieving a positive covert rate over a quantum channel. Additionally, we show that our results are optimal when the channel is classical and the state is available non-causally at both the transmitter and the receiver.</p>

While these sectors cannot be distinguished by symmetry quantum numbers, we identify the emergent integrals of motion which characterize them.

            <p>We study information-theoretic inequalities for holographic correlation measures $J_W$ and $D_W$, establishing rigorous topological frameworks that prove monotonicity, monogamy, and strong superadditivity. While earlier work proposed bulk duals of classical correlation and quantum discord, their information-theoretic properties were unclear. We derive multiple inequalities involving entanglement wedge cross sections (EWCS) and show that monotonicity holds for both measured and unmeasured parties in $J_W$ and for the unmeasured party in $D_W$. Unlike their original counterparts, we find that $J_W$ is monogamous for both parties and obeys one-way strong superadditivity, whereas $D_W$ is polygamous for the unmeasured party in pure tripartite states. These results highlight distinctive features of holographic states and support a conjectured duality between $J_W$ and distillable entanglement. Motivated by the relation between EWCS and reflected entropy, we introduce boundary analogues $J_R$ and $D_R$, which serve as computable proxies for classical and quantum correlations without optimization. We analyze their inequalities, proving several and presenting counterexamples. Overall, we provide a systematic "zoo" of correlation inequalities in and beyond holography, clarifying connections among bulk geometry, discord-type correlations, and distillable entanglement.</p>

            <p>While for non-relativistic short-range interactions, the spread of information is local, remaining confined in an effective light cone, long-range interactions can generate either nonlocal (faster-than-ballistic) or local (ballistic) spread of correlations depending on the initial conditions. This makes long-range interactions a rich platform for controlling the spread of information. Here, we derive an effective Hamiltonian analytically and identify the specific interaction term that drives nonlocality in a wide class of long-range spin chains. This allows us to understand the conditions for the emergence of local behavior in the presence of nonlocal interactions and to identify a regime where the causal space-time landscape can be precisely designed. Indeed, we show that for large long-range interaction strength or large system size, initial conditions can be chosen in a way that allows a local perturbation to generate nonlocal signals at programmable distant positions, which then propagate within effective light cones. The possibility of engineering the emergence of nonlocal Lieb-Robinson-like light cones allows one to shape the causal landscape of long-range interacting systems, with direct applications to quantum information processing devices, quantum memories, error correction, and information transport in programmable quantum simulators.</p>

            <p>We study how to recover timelike worldlines in AdS from CFT data as a toy model for holographically reconstructing realistic observers. We give a bulk extremization procedure that determines composite timelike-spacelike geodesics that connect timelike-separated boundary points. The total geodesic length matches the length extracted from CFT correlators at the timelike-separated points. We show agreement in Poincaré AdS, for generic boundary points in global AdS, and also for the BTZ solution, in which the timelike segment probes behind the horizon. We refine related methods to compute timelike entanglement entropy in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ and recover known results.</p>

            <h2>Quantum phase transitions of the anisotropic Dicke-Ising model in driven Rydberg arrays</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bao-Yun Dong, Ying Liang, Stefano Chesi, Xue-Feng Zhang</p>
            <p>We study the properties of a generalized Dicke-Ising model realized with an array of Rydberg atoms, driven by microwave electric fields and coupled to an optical cavity. As this platform allows for a precisely tunable anisotropy parameter, the model exhibits a rich landscape of phase transitions and critical phenomena, induced by the interplay of rotating-wave, counter-rotating-wave, and Ising interactions. We develop an improved quantum Monte Carlo algorithm based on the stochastic series expansion that explicitly tracks the Fock state of the quantum cavity. In the superradiant (SR) phase, this allows us to determine, through data collapse, the scaling laws of the photon number. We also demonstrate the vanishing of parity symmetry in finite-size simulations and show that the Rydberg blockade leads to a significant suppression of cavity occupation. Notably, stronger quantum fluctuations induced by the counter-rotating wave terms slightly favor the superradiant solid (SRS) phase over the Solid-1/2 state. Finally, we confirm that the SR phase transition and the transition from the Solid-1/2 to the SRS are second-order. In contrast, the transitions from the Solid-1/2 or SRS to the SR phase are both first-order for any value of the normalized anisotropy parameter.</p>

            <h2>Twisted (co)homology of non-orientable Weyl semimetals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thijs Douwes, Marcus Stålhammar</p>
            <p>The quasi-particle excitations in Weyl semimetals, known as Weyl fermions, are usually forced to emerge in charge-conjugate pairs by the Nielsen--Ninomiya theorem. When the Brillouin zone is non-orientable, this constraint is replaced by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ charge cancellation, as a result of the chirality becoming ill-defined on such manifolds; this results in configurations with seemingly non-zero total chirality. Here, we set out to explain this behaviour from a purely topological perspective, and provide a classification of non-orientable Weyl semimetal topology in terms of exact sequences of twisted (co)homology groups. This leads to several discoveries of direct physical importance: in particular, we recover the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ charge cancellation in a coordinate-independent way, allowing meaningful limits to be set on its physical interpretation. A detailed discussion is provided on a specific Klein bottle-like topology induced by a momentum-space glide symmetry, including a full review of the insulating and semimetallic invariants of the system and a classification of the surface states on the non-orientable boundary. Beyond this, we provide a complete survey of all possible non-orientable Brillouin zones and their associated invariants, and extend our formalism into the realm of non-Hermitian topological physics and inversion-symmetric Weyl semimetals. Our work exemplifies the vast potential of fundamental mathematical descriptions to not only aid the corresponding physical intuition, but also predict novel and hitherto overlooked phenomena of great relevance throughout the physics research forefront.</p>

            <h2>A programming language combining quantum and classical control</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kinnari Dave, Louis Lemonnier, Romain Péchoux, Vladimir Zamdzhiev</p>
            <p>The two main notions of control in quantum programming languages are often referred to as "quantum" control and "classical" control. With the latter, the control flow is based on classical information, potentially resulting from a quantum measurement, and this paradigm is well-suited to mixed state quantum computation. Whereas with quantum control, we are primarily focused on pure quantum computation and there the "control" is based on superposition. The two paradigms have not mixed well traditionally and they are almost always treated separately. In this work, we show that the paradigms may be combined within the same system. The key ingredients for achieving this are: (1) syntactically: a modality for incorporating pure quantum types into a mixed state quantum type system; (2) operationally: an adaptation of the notion of "quantum configuration" from quantum lambda-calculi, where the quantum data is replaced with pure quantum primitives; (3) denotationally: suitable (sub)categories of Hilbert spaces, for pure computation and von Neumann algebras, for mixed state computation in the Heisenberg picture of quantum mechanics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fumika Suzuki, Wojciech H. Zurek</p>
            <p>The Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) successfully predicts the density of topological defects deposited by the phase transitions, but it is not clear why. Its key conjecture is that, near the critical point of the second-order phase transition, critical slowing down will result in a period when the system is too sluggish to follow the potential that is changing faster than its reaction time. The correlation length at the freeze-out instant $\hat t$ when the order parameter catches up with the post-transition broken symmetry configuration is then decisive, determining when the mosaic of broken symmetry domains locks in topological defects. To understand why the KZM works so well we analyze Landau-Ginzburg model and show why temporal evolution of the order parameter plays such a key role. The analytical solutions we obtain suggest novel, hitherto unexplored, experimentally accessible observables that can shed light on symmetry breaking dynamics while testing the conjecture on which the KZM is based.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emilio Cortés Estay, Naushad A. Kamar, Philippe Corboz</p>
            <p>Infinite projected entangled-pair states (iPEPS) provide a powerful tensor network ansatz for two-dimensional quantum many-body systems in the thermodynamic limit. In this paper we introduce an approach to accurately compute the energy variance of an iPEPS, enabling systematic extrapolations of the ground-state energy to the exact zero-variance limit. It is based on the contraction of a large cell of tensors using the corner transfer matrix renormalization group (CTRMG) method, to evaluate the correlator between pairs of local Hamiltonian terms. We show that the accuracy of this approach is substantially higher than that of previous methods, and we demonstrate the usefulness of variance extrapolation for the Heisenberg model, for a free fermionic model, and for the Shastry-Sutherland model. Finally, we apply the approach to compute $\langle \langle \mathcal{L}^\dagger \mathcal{L} \rangle \rangle$ for an open quantum system described by the Liouvillian $\mathcal{L}$, in order to assess the quality of the steady-state solution and to locate first-order phase transitions, using the dissipative quantum Ising model as an example.</p>

            <p>Entangled photons are fundamental resources for quantum communication, computing, and networking. Among them, polarization-entangled photon pairs play an important role due to their straightforward state manipulation and direct use in quantum key distribution, teleportation, and network protocols. However, realizing compact, efficient, and scalable polarization-entangled sources that meet the requirements of practical deployment remains a major challenge. Here, we present a simple yet high-performance on-chip polarization-entangled photon-pair source on thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN). Our device employs dual quasi-phase matching (D-QPM) that sequentially supports type-0 and type-I spontaneous parametric down-conversion in a single nanophotonic waveguide, eliminating the need for interferometers, polarization rotators, or other complex circuits. The source directly produces high-fidelity Bell states with broad bandwidth, high brightness, and low noise. Using this integrated platform, we realize wavelength-multiplexed entanglement distribution in a four-user quantum network deployed over metropolitan fiber links up to 50 km. These results establish a robust and scalable pathway toward practical quantum communication systems and multi-user quantum mesh networks based on integrated photonics.</p>

            <p>The stabiliser fragment of quantum theory is a foundational building block for quantum error correction and the fault-tolerant compilation of quantum programs. In this article, we develop a sound, universal and complete denotational semantics for stabiliser operations which include measurement, classically-controlled Pauli operators, and affine classical operations, in which quantum error-correcting codes are first-class objects. The operations are interpreted as certain affine relations over finite fields. This offers a conceptually motivated and computationally-tractable alternative to the standard operator-algebraic semantics of quantum programs (whose time complexity grows exponentially as the state space increases in size). We demonstrate the power of the resulting semantics by describing a small, proof-of-concept assembly language for stabiliser programs with fully-abstract denotational semantics.</p>

            <h2>Algebraic Obstructions and the Collapse of Elementary Structure in the Kronecker Problem</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Soong Kyum Lee</p>
            <p>While Kronecker coefficients $g(\lambda,\mu,\nu)$ with bounded rows are polynomial-time computable via lattice-point methods, no explicit closed-form formulas have been obtained for genuinely three-row cases in the 87 years since Murnaghan's foundational work. This paper provides such formulas for the first time and identifies a universal structural boundary at parameter value 5 where elementary combinatorial patterns collapse. We analyze two independent families of genuinely three-row coefficients and establish that for $k \leq 4$, the formulas exhibit elementary structure: oscillation bounds follow the triangular-Hogben pattern, and polynomial expressions factor completely over $\mathbb{Z}$. At the critical threshold $k=5$, this structure collapses: the triangular pattern fails, and algebraic obstructions -- irreducible quadratic factors with negative discriminant -- emerge. We develop integer forcing, a proof technique exploiting the tension between continuous asymptotics and discrete integrality. As concrete results, we prove that $g((n,n,1)^3) = 2 - (n \mod 2)$ for all $n \geq 3$ -- the first explicit formula for a genuinely three-row Kronecker coefficient -- derive five explicit polynomial formulas for staircase-hook coefficients, and verify Saxl's conjecture for 132 three-row partitions.</p>

            <h2>Generation of concurrence in a generalized central spin model with a three-spin interacting environment</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adithya A. Vasista, Anushka Agrawal, Tanay Nag</p>
            <p>We consider the three-spin Ising model to study the effect of three-spin interacting term on bi-partitie entanglement between adjacent spins. The three-dominated disordered region has tri-partite entanglement causing a vanishingly small concurrence, while it acquires maximum value around the critical points. Considering the above model as an environment, we construct a generalized central spin model where two central spins, initially in an unentangled pure state, are coupled locally to two distinct sites of the environmental spin chain. We study the generation of mixed state entanglement between the central spins when the transverse field of the environment is kept fixed, and suddenly quenched, referring to equilibrium and non-equilibrium dynamics of the central spins, respectively. For the critical environment in the equilibrium, the concurrence shows a dip-revival structure governed by quasi-particle movement. In the non-equilibrium study, we find an initial growth of concurrence followed by a two-stage fall for the inter-phase quench which is governed by dynamic decoherence channels. The central spins are maximally entangled for a quench in the vicinity of a multicritical point, which arises due to three-spin interaction only. The concurrence becomes long-lived for an intra-phase quench, and this sustainability depends on the strength of the three-spin interaction. Therefore, the three-spin interaction indeed helps in generating bi-partite entanglement in the central spins.</p>

            <p>Spin qubits have proven to be a feasible candidate for quantum computation, and some realizations of spin qubits already benefit from advanced device manufacturing in the semiconductor industry. Compared to superconducting platforms, spin qubits can operate at higher temperatures from tens of millikelvin up to a few kelvin. However, recent experiments show a non-trivial and often non-monotonic dependence of the spin qubit frequency on the temperature, featuring a region of decreased sensitivity to temperature fluctuations. In this work, we aim to gain insight into the physics behind such temperature shifts in the low-temperature limit. Investigating the spin qubits' interaction with phonon modes of the host material, we can explain some of the key features of the observed behavior and estimate the temperature sweet spot for the qubit frequency shift.</p>

            <p>The response of a MoRe-based superconducting resonator operating near 5 K to pulsed infrared irradiation is investigated, and the underlying physical mechanisms are analyzed. The device exhibits a pronounced nonlinear response dominated by nonequilibrium quasiparticle dynamics rather than uniform thermal heating. Infrared pulses produce strong distortions of the resonance curve and a transient decrease in the resonance frequency, consistent with increased kinetic inductance caused by quasiparticle generation. The frequency shift scales approximately linearly with absorbed power, whereas the dissipation response saturates at higher powers, indicating the formation of a nonequilibrium steady-state quasiparticle population. These observations demonstrate a transition from a linear pair-breaking regime to a saturated dissipation regime, likely associated with a quasiparticle relaxation bottleneck or partial suppression of the smaller superconducting gap in MoRe. The results highlight the relevance of nonequilibrium processes in MoRe and confirm its potential for microwave kinetic-inductance detector applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elisa Vallini, Laura Foini, Silvia Pappalardi</p>
            <p>The Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) was developed as a framework for understanding how the principles of statistical mechanics emerge in the long-time limit of isolated quantum many-body systems. Since then, ETH has shifted the attention towards the study of matrix elements of physical observables in the energy eigenbasis. In this work, we revisit recent developments leading to the formulation of full ETH, a generalization of the original ETH ansatz that accounts for multi-point correlation functions. Using tools from free probability, we explore the implications of local rotational invariance, a property that emerges from the statistical invariance of observables under random basis transformations induced by small perturbations of the Hamiltonian. This approach allows us to make quantitative predictions and derive an analytical characterization of subleading corrections to matrix-element correlations, thereby refining the ETH ansatz. Moreover, our analysis links the statistical properties of matrix elements under random basis changes to the empirical averages over energy windows that are usually considered when dealing with a single instance of the ensemble. We validate our analytical predictions through comparison with numerical simulations in non-integrable Floquet systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Koustav Roy, Shahroze Shahab, Saurabh Basu</p>
            <p>Engineering dissipative dynamics in open quantum systems is under active focus, especially in topological settings where resilient edge modes are expected to exhibit decay rates distinct from the bulk. In this letter, we propose an efficient dynamical scheme to discern such long-lived excitations. Employing a Floquet-Lindblad framework, we explore how periodic driving reshapes the key features of a paradigmatic topological model, namely a Creutz ladder. Our results bear testimony to a drive-induced unipolar-bipolar transition in the Liouvillian skin effect, which gets dynamically manifested as a chiral-helical damping crossover. Such a transition effectively rescales the bulk localization length, giving rise to a polarization drift that we identify as a new invariant for efficient diagnosis of the nontrivial phases. As the transition becomes more gradual via tuning drive-rescaled parameters, we uncover signatures of a scale-free localization where skin and extended modes co-exist with distinct decay rates. The emergent hierarchy of the decay rates yields two disparate timescales: a chiral wavefront that rapidly empties the bulk followed by a long-lived regime dominated by robust edge modes. Overall, our results provide convincing evidence that periodic driving serves as a powerful handle to manipulate dissipative topological phases and dynamically isolate the boundary modes.</p>

The apparatus comprises four stages, each designed in-house. An oven heated to $\sim 500^\circ$C generates an atomic beam that is collimated by a capillary stack. The beam is sent into a passive, permanent-magnet-based Zeeman slower that reduces the atomic velocity to $30$ m/s. The slow atoms are captured in a magneto-optical trap (MOT) and cooled to $1.0(3)$ mK with a trapping time of $16(2)$ ms. Ground-state atoms in the cold gas are excited to high Rydberg states via resonant excitation through the intermediate $4s4p\, ^1P_1$ and $4s4d\, ^1D_2$ states. The MOT is operated at the center of an electrode stack, which serves to apply continuous and pulsed electric fields and field-ionize the Rydberg atoms for detection. We benchmark our MOT against previous implementations and find its performance consistent with state-of-the-art results in terms of temperature and trapping lifetime. Finally, we demonstrate Rydberg spectroscopy of calcium, confirming the system's suitability for ultracold Rydberg physics experiments.</p>

            <p>Pauli's exclusion principle forces fermions to occupy distinct quantum states, creating a filled region of momentum space at low temperature, the Fermi sea, whose topology governs the system's response to perturbations and the nature of its correlation functions. Recent theory predicts that for non-interacting fermions, the Euler characteristic of a $D$-dimensional Fermi sea -- the topological invariant that describes its shape -- is encoded in its ($D$+1)-point density correlations. Here we experimentally demonstrate this connection in a two-dimensional degenerate gas of neutral $^{6}$Li atoms using single-atom-resolved imaging. By measuring three- and four-point connected density correlations in real space, we directly extract topological invariants of the underlying Fermi sea, including the Euler characteristic. Our results are in remarkable agreement with ideal-gas predictions, despite the presence of sizeable interactions, and establish a new pathway for probing many-body topology through correlation measurements.</p>

            <p>We discuss some entanglement features associated with cubic non-Gaussian perturbations in single-field inflationary scenarios. We adopt standard momentum-space techniques to show how multipartite entanglement arises for inflationary perturbation modes, focusing on the dynamics of the comoving curvature perturbation. In particular, we quantify entanglement generation via the recently proposed Entanglement Distance, which introduces a geometric interpretation of quantum correlations in terms of the Fubini-Study metric. In the continuum limit, we show that the Entanglement Distance arising from displacement transformations is proportional to the total number of excitations in the quantum state for cubic perturbations, thus providing an upper bound on the von Neumann entanglement entropy of any reduced state compatible with such excitations. Within the interaction picture, we further observe that the quantum correlations arising from cubic gravitational interactions are typically much larger than the standard squeezing contribution, in agreement with previous studies focusing on von Neumann entropy generation across the Hubble horizon. We further show how the inflationary parameters affect the total amount of such correlations, highlighting in particular their dependence on the inflationary energy scales and the number of e-foldings during slow-roll.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Private Distributed Matrix Multiplication With Degree Tables</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohamed Nomeir, Alptug Aytekin, Lei Hu, Sennur Ulukus</p>
            <p>In this paper, we explore how quantum resources can be used to increase the rate of private distributed matrix multiplication (PDMM). In PDMM, a user who has two high-dimensional matrices, $A$ and $B$, and lacks the computational capabilities to apply matrix multiplication locally, divides the matrices $A$ and $B$ into $K$ and $L$ sub-blocks, respectively. Then, the user sends them to $N$ servers to apply the required multiplication privately from any $T$ servers. The goal is to reduce the number of servers needed to perform the required matrix multiplication. In the quantum setting, we allow the servers to share an entangled state and respond over quantum channels. Upon receiving the qudits, the user applies measurements to obtain the required multiplication. There are two main regimes in the PDMM literature: The high-privacy regime and the low-privacy regime where $T$ is less than $K$ and $L$. First, in the high-privacy regime, the state-of-the-art classical code is called the gap additive secure polynomial (GASP) code. We define a feasibility requirement in the quantum setting for the GASP code such that the highest performance is achieved when it is satisfied. When it is not satisfied, we address two main concerns. The first is to find a relation between the minimum privacy requirement and the dimensions of the two matrices needed for the feasibility condition to be satisfied. Second, we develop a new family of codes that can work in the quantum setting. Second, since GASP does not work efficiently in the low-privacy regimes compared to cyclic-addition degree tables (CAT) and discretely optimized GASP (DOG), we show that the feasibility condition developed for GASP can be adopted for both CAT and DOG codes as well. In addition, we propose another set of codes that can be used in the low privacy regime in the quantum setting when the feasibility requirement is not satisfied.</p>

            <p>Control of the temporal waveform and Fock state statistics of photons produced during spontaneous emission from single quantum emitters provides a crucial tool in the establishment of hybrid quantum systems, optimal state transfer and interferometric stability of network architectures based on flying qubits. We describe a method to generate photons of any temporal waveform from emitters of any lifetime. Our broadly applicable approach has only two requirements for a candidate qudit: (1) control of the phase-parity and (2) modulation of the amplitude of a field coupling a ground state to an excited manifold which produces a photon during relaxation. We detail how to find optimal excitation pulse shapes, both numerically and experimentally, by employing variational algorithms to feedback on atomic populations. Additionally, we develop Quantum Monte Carlo based tools to determine emission statistics and establish techniques for optimal post-selection to ensure maximum fidelity of photon generation protocols. We situate our work in the context of other prior research on bespoke single photon sources and networking including post-emission pulse shaping, temporal gating and cavity-based methods. In comparison, our free-space process has greater flexibility in producing any waveform, requires less infrastructure and can be readily applied across a wide domain of emitters of any frequency or lifetime.

            <h2>Globally optimal control of quantum dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Denys I. Bondar, Llorenc Balada Gaggioli, Georgios Korpas, Jakub Marecek, Jiri Vala, Kurt Jacobs</p>
            <p>Optimization of constrained quantum control problems powers quantum technologies. This task becomes very difficult when these control problems are nonconvex and plagued with dense local extrema. For such problems current optimization methods must be repeated many times to find good solutions, each time requiring many simulations of the system. Here, we present quantum control via polynomial optimization (QCPOP), a method that eliminates this problem by directly finding globally optimal solutions. The resulting increase in speed, which can be a thousandfold or more, makes it possible to solve problems that were previously intractable. This remarkable advance is due to global optimization methods recently developed for polynomial functions. We demonstrate the power of this method by showing that it obtains an optimal solution in a single run for a problem in which local extrema are so dense that gradient methods require thousands of runs to reach a similar fidelity. Since QCPOP is able to find the global optimum for quantum control, we expect that it will not only enhance the utility of quantum control by making it much easier to find the necessary protocols, but also provide a key tool for understanding the precise limits of quantum technologies. Finally, we note that the ability to cast quantum control as polynomial optimization resolves an open question regarding the computability of exact solutions to quantum control problems.</p>

            <p>We present tools and methods to generalize parity compilation to digital quantum computing devices with arbitrary connectivity graphs and construct circuit implementations for the constraint Hamiltonian of higher-order constrained binary optimization problems. In particular, we show how even non-local constraints can be efficiently implemented without expensive SWAP gates. We show how the presented tools can be used to optimize the total circuit depth and CNOT count of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm in the parity architecture and highlight the advantages of the flexible compilation using various examples. We derive the relation between the developed gate sequences and the traditional approach that uses SWAP gates. The result can be applied to improve the implementation of many other non-local operators.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Roeland ter Hoeven, Benjamin E. Niehoff, Sagar Sudhir Kale, Wolfgang Lechner</p>
            <p>Parity compilation is the challenge of laying out the required constraints for the parity mapping in a local way. We present the first constructive compilation algorithm for the parity architecture using plaquettes for arbitrary higher-order optimization problems. This enables adiabatic protocols, where the plaquette layout can natively be implemented, as well as fully parallelized digital circuits. The algorithm builds a rectangular layout of plaquettes, where in each layer of the rectangle at least one constraint is added. The core idea is that each constraint, consisting of any qubits on the boundary of the rectangle and some new qubits, can be decomposed into plaquettes with a deterministic procedure using ancillas. We show how to pick a valid set of constraints and how this decomposition works. We further give ways to optimize the ancilla count and show how to implement optimization problems with additional constraints.</p>

            <p>We present a fault-tolerant universal quantum computing architecture based on a code concatenation of biased-noise qubits and the parity architecture. The parity architecture can be understood as an LDPC code tailored specifically to obtain any desired logical connectivity from nearest-neighbor physical interactions. The code layout can be dynamically adjusted to algorithmic requirements on-the-fly. This allows for implementations with any desired code distance with a universal set of fault-tolerant gates. In addition to the previously explored tool-sets for concatenated cat codes, our approach features parallelizable interactions between arbitrary sets of qubits by directly addressing the parity qubits in the code. The proposed scheme enables codes with less physical qubit overhead compared to the repetition code with the same code distances, while requiring only weight-3 and weight-4 stabilizers and nearest-neighbor 2D square-lattice connectivity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marit O. E. Steiner, Julen S. Pedernales, Martin B. Plenio</p>
            <p>We explore the potential of levitating solids embedded with non-permanent, optically controllable electron spins, which can be used to hyperpolarize their nuclear spin environment with exceptionally long lifetimes. For example, pentacene-doped naphthalene, which will also serve as our prime example, can achieve bulk polarization exceeding $80\,\%$ at cryogenic temperatures with polarization lifetimes extending over weeks. These materials make a compelling case for applications such as matter-wave interferometry and novel uses of established NMR techniques. In that spirit, we design a multi-spin Stern-Gerlach-type interferometry protocol which, thanks to the homogeneous spin distribution and the absence of a preferential nuclear-spin quantization axis in such materials, avoids many of the limitations associated with solid state crystals hosting electronic spin defects, such as nanodiamonds containing NV centers. We assess the potential of our interferometer to enhance existing bounds on the free parameters of objective collapse models. Beyond matter-wave interferometry, we analyze the prospects for implementing magic angle spinning at frequencies surpassing the current standard in NMR, capitalizing on the exceptional rotational capabilities offered by levitation. Additionally, we outline a novel protocol for measuring spin ensemble polarization via the position of the nanoparticle and conduct an analysis of dominant noise sources, benchmarking the required isolation levels for various applications.</p>

            <h2>Anti-Concentration for the Unitary Haar Measure and Applications to Random Quantum Circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bill Fefferman, Soumik Ghosh, Wei Zhan</p>
            <p>We prove a Carbery-Wright style anti-concentration inequality for the unitary Haar measure, by showing that the probability of a polynomial in the entries of a random unitary falling into an $\varepsilon$ range is at most a polynomial in $\varepsilon$. Using it, we show that the scrambling speed of a random quantum circuit is lower bounded: Namely, every input qubit has an influence that is at least inverse exponential in depth, on any output qubit touched by its lightcone. Our result on scrambling speed works with high probability over the choice of a circuit from an ensemble, as opposed to just working in expectation. As an application, we give the first polynomial-time algorithm for learning log-depth random quantum circuits with Haar random gates up to polynomially small diamond distance, given oracle access to the circuit. Other applications of this new scrambling speed lower bound include: $\bullet$ An optimal $\Omega(\log \varepsilon^{-1})$ depth lower bound for $\varepsilon$-approximate unitary designs on any circuit architecture; $\bullet$ A polynomial-time quantum algorithm that computes the depth of a bounded-depth circuit, given oracle access to the circuit. Our learning and depth-testing algorithms apply to architectures defined over any geometric dimension, and can be generalized to a wide class of architectures with good lightcone properties.</p>

            <p>As quantum processing units (QPUs) scale toward hundreds of qubits, diagnosing noise-induced correlations (crosstalk) becomes critical for reliable quantum computation. In this work, we introduce Zero-Entropy Classical Shadows (ZECS), a diagnostic tool that uses information of a rank-one quantum state tomography (QST) reconstruction from classical shadow (CS) information to make a crosstalk diagnosis. We use ZECS on trapped ion and superconductive QPUs, including ionq_forte (36 qubits), ibm_brisbane (127 qubits), and ibm_fez (156 qubits), using from 1,000 to 6,000 samples. With these samples, we use the ZECS to characterize crosstalk among disjoint qubit subsets across the full hardware. This information is then used to select low-crosstalk qubit subsets on ibm_fez for executing the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) on a 20-qubit problem. Compared to the best qubit selection via Qiskit transpilation, our method improves solution quality by 10% and increases algorithmic coherence by 33%. ZECS offers a scalable and measurement-efficient approach to diagnosing crosstalk in large-scale QPUs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xuanhua Wang, Jie Su, Jin Wang</p>
            <p>Anomalous thermalization, particularly the crossings of temperature trajectories from different initial states termed Mpemba crossings (MPCs), have intrigued scientists for decades. While recent studies in quantum systems suggest that initial conditions play a decisive role in its emergence, they offer limited insight into MPCs in complex, highly nonequilibrium systems. In this study, we investigate temperature dynamics in the strongly coupled, quantum chaotic Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, which is dual to the low-energy dynamics of 2D dilaton gravity. Our findings reveal a dynamically driven nonequilibrium mechanism underlying MPCs during rapid thermalization, with implications for gravitational systems. We explore quench dynamics in SYK systems under three conditions: coupling to a single SYK thermal bath, coupling to two thermal baths at different temperatures, and dissipative SYKs modeled by the Lindblad equation. We find that strong system-bath coupling induces oscillating effective temperatures and trajectory crossings in transient states due to nonequilibrium statistics, phenomena absent in quasi-static thermodynamics and Lindbladian SYKs. These MPCs highlight a unique feature of anomalous thermalization of strongly coupled quantum chaotic systems driven far from equilibrium. Besides, the results also provide qualitative insights into the nonequilibrium thermodynamics of black holes strongly interacting with their environment, such as primordial black holes in the early universe.</p>

            <p>Characterizing the non-classical correlations of a complex many-body system is an important part of quantum technologies. A versatile tool for such a task is one that scales well with the size of the system and which can be both easily computed and measured. In this work we focus on graph states, that are promising platforms for quantum computation, simulation and metrology. We consider four topologies, namely the star graph states with edges, Turán graphs, $r$-ary tree graphs, and square grid cluster states, and provide a method to characterise their quantum content: the many-body Bell correlations, non-separability and entanglement depth for an arbitrary number of qubits. We also relate the strength of these many-body correlations to the usefulness of graph states for quantum sensing. Finally, we characterize many-body entanglement depth in graph states with up to $8$ qubits in $146$ classes non-equivalent under local transformations and graph isomorphisms. The technique presented is simple and does not make any assumptions about the multi-qubit state, so it could find applications wherever precise knowledge of many-body quantum correlations is required.</p>

            <h2>The composition rule for quantum systems is not the only possible one</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marco Erba, Paolo Perinotti</p>
            <p>Quantum theory provides a significant example of two intermingling hallmarks of science: the ability to consistently combine physical systems and study them compositely; and the power to extract predictions in the form of correlations. A striking consequence of this facet is the violation of Bell inequalities, which has been experimentally demonstrated via Bell tests, thus attesting a classical/quantum divide. The prediction of this phenomenon originates as quantum systems are prescribed to combine according to the composition postulate, i.e., the tensor-product rule. This rule has also an operationally salient formulation -- rather than just a purely mathematical one -- given in terms of discriminability of composite states via local measurements. Yet, both the theoretical and the empirical status of such a postulate have been constantly challenged over the decades: is it possible to deduce it from the remaining postulates? Here, this long-standing problem is solved by answering in the negative. A family of operational theories is presented, differing from standard quantum theory solely in their system-composition rule, while, at the same time, being indistinguishable from it via Bell-like or more general correlation experiments. Quantum theory is thus established to embody genuinely more than quantum correlations. As a result, foundational programmes based on single-system principles only, or on mere Bell-like correlations, are operationally incomplete. On the experimental side, ascertaining the independence of postulates is a fundamental step to adjudicate between quantum theory and alternative physical theories: hence, the composition postulate calls for experimental scrutiny independently of the other features of quantum theory.</p>

To implement this framework, we present a prethermal protocol that preserves order-two dynamical symmetry in a spin-ladder model, confirming the predicted relationships between the expectation values of local observables at distinct temporal points in the Floquet cycle, linked by this symmetry.</p>

            <p>Recent advances in quantum computing have brought us closer to realizing the potential of this transformative technology. While significant strides have been made in quantum error correction, many challenges persist, particularly in the realm of noise and scalability. Analogue quantum computing schemes, such as Analogue Hamiltonian Simulation and Quantum Annealing, offer a promising approach to address these limitations. By operating at a higher level of abstraction, these schemes can simplify the development of large-scale quantum algorithms. To fully harness the power of quantum computers, they must be seamlessly integrated with traditional high-performance computing (HPC) systems. While substantial research has focused on the integration of circuit-based quantum computers with HPC, the integration of analogue quantum computers remains relatively unexplored. This paper aims to bridge this gap by contributing in the following way: Comprehensive Survey: We conduct a comprehensive survey of existing quantum software tools with analogue capabilities. Readiness Assessment: We introduce a classification and rating system to assess the readiness of these tools for HPC integration. Gap Identification and Recommendations: We identify critical gaps in the landscape of analogue quantum programming models and propose actionable recommendations for future research and development.</p>

            <h2>Analytical results for laser models producing a beam with sub-Poissonian photon statistics and coherence scaling as the Heisenberg limit</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lucas A. Ostrowski, Travis J. Baker, Dominic W. Berry, Howard M. Wiseman</p>
            <p>Recent advances in laser theory have demonstrated that a quantum enhancement is possible for the production of coherence $\mathfrak{C}$ by a continuous-wave laser device. Curiously, natural families of laser models that achieve Heisenberg-limited scaling for coherence produce the most coherence when the beam exhibits sub-Poissonian photon statistics. In this work, we provide an analytical treatment of those novel families of laser models by specializing to a parameter regime that permits a linearization. We characterize the dynamics of each laser system, and find that some of the intuitions from standard laser theory may be applied here. Specifically, the intracavity number dynamics are well-described as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, while the intracavity phase dynamics are well-described in terms of a physically realizable ensemble of pure states, which evolve according to pure phase diffusion. Unlike a standard laser, however, we find that the pure states comprising the ensemble in the Heisenberg-limited lasers are substantially phase squeezed. From our dynamical analysis, we deduce various quantities of the beam for each laser family, including the first- and second-order Glauber coherence functions, intensity noise spectrum, Mandel-Q parameter and coherence $\mathfrak{C}$. In addition, inspired from these phase diffusion dynamics, we derive an upper bound on laser coherence $\mathfrak{C} \lesssim 1.1156 \mu^4$ -- which is tighter by a factor of $3/8$ when compared to that derived in [Baker et al., Nat. Phys. 17 179 (2021)] -- by making one of the assumptions of that paper slightly stronger.</p>

            <h2>Genuine multipartite entanglement is not necessary for standard device-independent conference key agreement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lewis Wooltorton, Peter Brown, Roger Colbeck</p>
            <p>Conference key agreement aims to establish shared, private randomness among many separated parties in a network. Device-independent conference key agreement (DICKA) is a variant in which the source and the measurement devices used by each party need not be trusted. So far, DICKA protocols largely fall into two categories: those that rely on violating a joint Bell inequality using genuinely multi-partite entangled states, and those that concatenate many bipartite protocols. The question of whether a hybrid protocol exists, where a multi-partite Bell inequality can be violated using only bipartite entanglement, was asked by Grasselli et al. in [Quantum 7, 980, (2023)]. We answer this question affirmatively, by constructing an asymptotically secure DICKA protocol achieving the same rate as the concatenation of bipartite device-independent quantum key distribution, yet relying on a single joint Bell violation. Our results prompt further discussion on the benefits of multi-partite entanglement for DICKA over its bipartite alternative, and we give an overview of different arguments for near-term devices.</p>

Next to this, we measure a spin-transition ensemble line width of 5 kHz and electron-nuclear spin coherence time reaching 0.15~seconds at zero magnetic field between 50~mK and 1~K temperatures.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ze-Min Huang, Sebastian Diehl, Xiao-Qi Sun</p>
            <p>In open quantum systems, the interaction of the system with its environment gives rise to two types of symmetry: a strong one, where the system's symmetry charge is conserved exactly, and a weak one, where the system can exchange symmetry charge with the environment but still preserve symmetry at the ensemble level. While generic open quantum systems feature weak symmetries only, the symmetry protected topological response for bosonic/spin systems has only been considered in the stricter setup with additional strong symmetries. Here, we address the generic case and demonstrate that weak symmetries alone can protect topological responses that distinguish different phases of matter. For bosonic systems, focusing on one-dimensional mixed states described by locally purifiable density operators, we propose a quantized response characterizing qualitatively distinct phases. It is detectable via the decay behavior of different string order parameters. We illustrate our general results through a noisy Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki model. In particular, we show that the coupling to the environment can induce a phase transition to a state protected by weak symmetries, without a pure-state or strong-symmetry analog.</p>

            <p>Quantum Transformers integrate the representational power of classical Transformers with the computational advantages of quantum computing. Since 2022, research in this area has rapidly expanded, giving rise to diverse technical paradigms and early applications. To address the growing need for consolidation, this paper presents the first comprehensive, systematic, and in-depth survey of quantum Transformer models. First, we delineate the research scope, focusing on improving Transformer parts with quantum methods, and introduce foundational concepts in classical Transformers and quantum machine learning. Then we organize existing studies into two main paradigms: PQC-based and QLA-based, with PQC-based paradigm further divided into QKV-only Quantum Mapping, Quantum Pairwise Attention, Quantum Holistic Attention. and Quantum-Assisted Optimization, analyzing their core mechanisms and architectural traits. We also summarize empirical results that demonstrate preliminary quantum advantages, especially on small-scale tasks or resource-constrained settings. Following this, we examine key technical challenges, such as complexity-resource trade-offs, scalability and generalization limitations, and trainability issues including barren plateaus, and provide potential solutions, including quantumizing classical transformer variants with lower complexity, hybrid designs, and improved optimization strategies. Finally, we propose several promising future directions, e.g., scaling quantum modules into large architectures, applying quantum Transformers to domains with inherently quantum data (e.g., physics, chemistry), and developing theory-driven designs grounded in quantum information science. This survey will help researchers and practitioners quickly grasp the overall landscape of current quantum Transformer research and promote future developments in this emerging field.</p>

            <p>Superconducting qubits in today's quantum processing units are typically fabricated with angle-evaporated aluminum--aluminum-oxide--aluminum Josephson junctions. However, there is an urgent need to overcome the limited reproducibility of this approach when scaling up the number of qubits and junctions. Fabrication methods based on subtractive patterning of superconductor--insulator--superconductor trilayers, used for more classical large-scale Josephson junction circuits, could provide the solution but they in turn often suffer from lossy dielectrics incompatible with high qubit coherence. In this work, we utilize native aluminum oxide as a sidewall passivation layer for junctions based on aluminum--aluminum-oxide--niobium trilayers, and use such junctions in qubits. We design the fabrication process such that the few-nanometer-thin native oxide is not exposed to oxide removal steps that could increase its defect density or hinder its ability to prevent shorting between the leads of the junction. With these junctions, we design and fabricate transmon-like qubits and measure time-averaged coherence times up to 30 $\mu$s at a qubit frequency of 5 GHz, corresponding to a qubit quality factor of one million. Our process uses subtractive patterning and optical lithography on wafer scale, enabling high throughput in patterning. This approach provides a scalable path toward fabrication of superconducting qubits on industry-standard platforms.</p>

            <p>The discrepancy between quantum distinguishability in Hilbert space and classical distinguishability in probability space is expressed by the gap between the quantum and classical Fisher information matrices (QFIM and CFIM, respectively). This intrinsic quantum obstruction is generally not saturable and plays a central role in both fundamental insights and practical applications in modern quantum physics. Here, we develop a geometrical framework for this gap by introducing the notion of semi-classical geometric tensor (SCGT). We relate this quantity to the quantum geometric tensor (QGT), whose real part equals the QFIM. We prove the matrix inequality between QGT and SCGT, which sharpens the standard inequality between QFIM and CFIM and provides novel multiparameter information bounds: the real part of the SCGT reproduces the CFIM plus an additional nonnegative contribution capturing quantum obstruction. This further motivates a natural extension of the Berry phase to the semi-classical setting.</p>

            <p>To find practical application as photon sources for entangled optical resource states or as spin-photon interfaces in entangled networks, semiconductor emitters must produce indistinguishable photons with high efficiency and spectral stability. Nanophotonic cavity integration increases efficiency and bandwidth, but it also introduces environmental charge instability and spectral diffusion. Among various candidates, silicon colour centres have emerged as compelling platforms for integrated-emitter quantum technologies. Here we investigate the dynamics of spectral wandering in nanophotonics-coupled, individual silicon T centres using spectral correlation measurements. We observe that spectral fluctuations are driven predominantly by the near-infrared excitation laser, consistent with a power-dependent Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, and show that the spectrum is stable for up to 1.5 ms in the dark. We demonstrate a 35x narrowing of the emitter linewidth to 110 MHz using a resonance-check scheme and discuss the advantage for pairwise entanglement rates and optical resource state generators. Finally, we report laser-induced spin-mixing in the excited state and discuss potential mechanisms common to both phenomena. These effects must be considered in calibrating T centre devices for high-performance entanglement generation.</p>

            <p>Exceptional points (EPs) are non-Hermitian singularities associated with the coalescence of individual eigenvectors accompanied by the degeneracy of their complex energies. Here, we report the discovery of a generalization to the concept of EP called exceptional deficiency (ED), which features the complete coalescence of two eigenspaces with identical but arbitrarily large dimensions and the coincidence of entire spectral continua. The characteristics of the ED are studied using one-way coupled Hermitian and non-Hermitian lattices. The ED can induce an anomalous absence and presence of non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) that transcends the topological bulk-edge correspondence of NHSE, resulting in unexpected synergistic skin-propagative dynamics. The conditions of the ED are also explored for unprecedented control of localization and propagation in non-Hermitian systems. These effects are experimentally observed using active mechanical lattices. The discovery of ED opens multiple new frontiers in non-Hermitian physics and can potentially resolve long-standing challenges in related applications.</p>

            <h2>(Thermo-)dynamics of the spin-boson model in the weak coupling regime: Application as a quantum battery</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mahima Yadav, Devvrat Tiwari, Subhashish Banerjee</p>
            <p>We investigate the spin-boson model's dynamical and thermodynamic features in the weak coupling regime using the weak coupling spin-boson (WCSB) and phase covariant (PC) master equations. Both unital (pure dephasing) and non-unital (dissipative) quantum channels are considered. On the dynamical side, we explore key quantum features including non-Markovianity, quantum speed limit, quantum coherence, and the system's steady-state behavior. Notably, the measures of non-Markovianity exhibit different behavior under WCSB and PC dynamics. From the quantum thermodynamic perspective, we conceptualize the spin-boson system as a quantum battery and analyze its performance through metrics such as energy, ergotropy, anti-ergotropy, and battery capacity. We further examine the roles of pure dephasing and dissipative processes in shaping the battery's performance. Our findings demonstrate the spin-boson model's versatility as a platform for efficient energy storage and transfer in quantum thermodynamic devices.</p>

            <h2>Field emission tunnelling as a window onto fundamental issues in quantum mechanics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Richard G. Forbes</p>
            <p>Field electron emission (FE) and electrostatic field ionization (ESFI) are quantum-mechanical tunnelling processes that provide basic theory for important technologies. However, the basic theories of FE and ESF1 are not yet completely understood. This paper attempts to identify related fundamental quantum mechanical issues, problems and relevances. The following topics have been identified as deserving closer investigation or discussion. (a) The implication that if a "real electron" cannot have negative kinetic energy, then this necessarily implies that a "real electron" is a distributed object rather than a point object. (b) The implication that the language we use to discuss quantum mechanics needs to be changed in order to avoid referring to the "position of a (point) electron". (c) The idea that "quantum mathematics" (i.e., the mathematics of quantum mechanics) has different utilisations, namely the "matter distribution" and "pathway choice" utilisations, with "measurement" being observed pathway choice. (d) Difficulties with the present formulations of the uncertainty principle and wave-particle duality. (e) Fundamental difficulties in the exact calculation of exchange-and-correlation effects in both FE and ESFI theory. (f) Conceptual problems associated with "seeing electrons" in the field electron (emission) microscope. (g) Field emission tunnelling and the arrow of time. (h) The choice between tunnelling-integral and overlap-integral formulations of tunnelling theory, and the apparent incompleteness of both types of formulation.</p>

            <h2>A mathematical justification to apply the secular approximation to the Redfield equation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Niklas J. Jung, Francesco Rosati, Gabriel L. Rath, Frank K. Wilhelm, Peter K. Schuhmacher</p>
            <p>Quantum master equations are widely used to describe the dynamics of open quantum systems. All these different master equations rely on specific approximations that may or may not be justified. Starting from a microscopic model, applying the standard Born and Markov approximations results in the Redfield equation that does not guarantee to preserve positivity. The latter is typically achieved by additionally applying the secular approximation resulting in a quantum master equation in Lindblad form. There are other ways to obtain an equation in Lindblad form, one of which is the recently proposed Universal Lindblad Equation. It has been shown that it is in the same equivalence class of approximations as the Redfield master equation although avoiding the heuristic secular approximation [arXiv:2004.01469]. In this work, we prove that the solutions of the master equation obtained by applying the secular approximation are also obtained by an approximation of the same order as the one performed to obtain the Redfield equation. We hereby provide a mathematical justification for the secular approximation. We show that the result of applying the secular approximation is obtained naturally by applying a self-consistency argument. This shows that the resulting master equation is also in the same equivalence class of approximations as the Redfield master equation and the Universal Lindblad Equation. We furthermore compare it to the Universal Lindblad Equation numerically and show numerical evidence that the master equation obtained through the secular approximation yields more accurate solutions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qi-Hong Cai, Xue-Hao Yu, Ma-Cheng Yang, Ao-Xiang Liu, Cong-Feng Qiao</p>
            <p>This study investigates the emergence of macroscopic classical behavior from quantum foundations via the entropic Leggett--Garg inequality. We introduce a geometric framework for deriving entropic Leggett--Garg inequalities with higher-order temporal correlations and demonstrate their advantages over conventional formulations. Numerical analyses show that entropic Leggett--Garg inequalities offer a robust and complementary criterion to standard approaches, providing a transparent information theoretic interpretation that facilitates the characterization of coherent quantum processes. By applying the WKB approximation, we prove that violations for maximally mixed states remain bounded by a constant in the macroscopic limit, indicating that macrorealism dominates in generic parameter regimes. We further explain previously reported maximal violations at specific parameter regimes as a consequence of the breakdown of the WKB approximation. Our findings indicate that quantum and classical descriptions remain macroscopically incompatible, while violations persist only in fine-tuned regimes, clarifying the conditions for detecting macroscopic quantum phenomena.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bence Bakó, Tenzan Araki, Bálint Koczor</p>
            <p>Estimating observable expectation values in eigenstates of quantum systems has a broad range of applications and is an area where early fault-tolerant quantum computers may provide practical quantum advantage. We develop a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm that enables the estimation of an arbitrary observable expectation value in an eigenstate, given an initial state is supplied that has dominant overlap with the targeted eigenstate -- but may overlap with any other eigenstates. Our approach builds on, and is conceptually similar to purification-based error mitigation techniques; however, it achieves exponential suppression of algorithmic errors using only a single copy of the quantum state. The key innovation is that random time evolution is applied in the quantum computer to create an average mixed quantum state, which is then virtually purified with exponential efficacy. We prove rigorous performance guarantees and conclude that the complexity of our approach depends directly on the energy gap in the problem Hamiltonian and remarkably, can be compared to phase estimation combined with amplitude estimation in terms of its scaling with respect to a target precision. We demonstrate in a broad range of numerical simulations the applicability of our framework in near-term and early fault-tolerant settings. Furthermore, we demonstrate in a 100-qubit example that direct classical simulation of our approach enables the prediction of ground and excited state properties of quantum systems using tensor network techniques, which we recognize as a quantum-inspired classical approach.</p>

            <h2>Scaling of Superradiant Peak Emission in Spatially Extended Emitter Arrays</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raphael Holzinger, Susanne F. Yelin</p>
            <p>In quantum optics, superradiance is a phenomenon in which a system of $N$ fully excited quantum emitters radiate intense flashes of light during collective decay. However, computing its peak intensity exactly for many spatially separated emitters remains challenging due to the exponential growth of the underlying Hilbert space with system size $N$. Based on third-order cumulant expansion methods, we present general scaling laws for the expononent of the peak emission rate as a function of the emitter number in free-space emitter arrays and arrays coupled to one-dimensional waveguide reservoirs. We find, that for 1D chains in free-space the peak emission rate scales linearly with $N$, while for 2D and 3D arrays with finite emitter spacing it scales superlinearly but sub-quadratically. For emitter chains coupled to waveguide reservoirs we find that the peak emission rate scales quadratically with $N$.</p>

            <h2>Purely quantum memory in closed systems observed via imperfect measurements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jorge Tabanera-Bravo, Aljaž Godec</p>
            <p>The detection and quantification of non-Markovianity, a.k.a. memory, in quantum systems is a central problem in the theory of open quantum systems. There memory is as a result of the interaction between the system and its environment. Little is known, however, about memory effects induced by imperfect measurements on closed systems, where an entanglement with the environment is not possible. We investigate the emergence and characteristics of memory in closed systems observed via imperfect stroboscopic quantum measurements yielding coarse-grained outcomes. We consider ideal and two kinds of imperfect measurements: von Neumann measurements--the analogue of classical lumping--which destroy any coherence in the system, and genuinely quantum-lumping Lüders measurements preserving certain quantum correlations. Whereas the conditions for Markov dynamics under von Neumann lumping are the same as for classical dynamics, quantum-lumping requires stronger conditions, i.e. the absence of any detectable coherence. We introduce the concept of purely quantum memory having no classical counterpart. We illustrate our results with a quantum walk on a lattice and discuss their implications for dissipative dynamics and decoherence effects induced by more realistic measurements.</p>

            <h2>Certified randomness from quantum speed limits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Caroline L. Jones, Albert Aloy, Gerard Higgins, Markus P. Mueller</p>
            <p>Quantum speed limits are usually regarded as fundamental restrictions, constraining the amount of computation that can be achieved within some given time and energy. Complementary to this intuition, here we show that these limitations are also of operational value: they enable the secure generation of certified randomness. We consider a prepare-and-measure scenario with some (experimentally determined or promised) upper bound on the energy uncertainty of the average prepared quantum state, but without any further assumptions on the devices, Hilbert space or Hamiltonian. Given that we can freely choose the time at which to apply the untrusted preparation procedure, we show that this scenario admits the generation of randomness that is secure against adversaries with additional classical information. We show how to determine the amount of certified randomness given the observed correlations, discuss how interactions with the environment are taken into account, and sketch a conceivable experimental implementation. In particular, we show that single-mode coherent states admit this kind of certification of non-zero randomness in some parameter regimes, reinforcing existing demonstrations of nonclassicality in the simple harmonic oscillator. Our results extend earlier efforts to devise semi-device-independent protocols grounded in reasonable physical assumptions, and they contribute to the understanding of time-energy uncertainty relations via their operational consequences.</p>

            <h2>Einstein causality of quantum measurements in the Tomonaga-Schwinger picture</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samuel Fedida</p>
            <p>We investigate a generalisation to Lüders' rule à la Aharonov-Albert in those globally hyperbolic spacetimes which allow unitarily equivalent Hilbert spaces to be defined along Cauchy hypersurfaces, thus relying on the existence of an interaction picture à la Tomonaga-Schwinger. We show that under this rule and under the additional assumptions of the integrability and unitarity of the Tomonaga-Schwinger dynamics and the foliation-independence of rays on acausal Cauchy hypersurfaces, selective quantum measurements satisfy a state-independent anyonic commutation relation over spacelike-separated precompact regions. We highlight that this propagates to positive operator-valued measures, where the commutation is necessarily bosonic. In the instantaneous-measurement idealisation, this implies quantum no-signalling for non-selective measurements. We then examine Sorkin's impossible measurements and show that immediate contradictions can be averted as long as collapse-inducing measurements are irreversible. These results reaffirm the consistency of the Tomonaga-Schwinger picture of relativistic quantum theory, for which unitarity, integrability and foliation-independence of the states exclude superluminal signalling despite the ``instantaneity" of a side-cone measurement collapse rule. We finish by discussing the possibility of extending such results beyond the interaction picture.</p>

            <h2>Quantum thermal rectification via state-dependent two-photon dissipation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Tahir Naseem</p>
            <p>Controlling heat flow at the quantum level is essential for the development of next-generation thermal devices. We investigate thermal rectification in a quantum harmonic oscillator coupled to two thermal baths via both single-photon (linear) and two-photon (nonlinear) exchange processes. At low temperatures, rectification arises from a state-dependent suppression of two-photon emission: when the cold bath dominates, it drives the oscillator into low-occupancy states, inhibiting emission and creating a thermal bottleneck. At higher temperatures, rectification is governed by the asymmetric scaling of higher-order moments associated with two-photon absorption and emission. We systematically explore various bath coupling configurations and identify the conditions under which nonlinear dissipation leads to directional heat flow. Furthermore, we propose an implementation scheme based on coupling an auxiliary two-level system to the oscillator, enabling effective two-photon dissipation. These results contribute to the understanding of quantum heat transport in the presence of nonlinear dissipation and may support future efforts in nanoscale thermal rectification design.</p>

            <p>We revisit quantum tomography in an informationally incomplete scenario and propose improved state reconstruction methods using deep neural networks. In the first approach, the trained network predicts an optimal linear or quadratic reconstructor with coefficients depending only on the collection of (already taken) measurement operators. This effectively refines the undercomplete tomographic reconstructor based on pseudoinverse operation. The second, based on an LSTM recurrent network performs state reconstruction sequentially. It can also optimize the measurement sequence, which suggests a no-free-lunch theorem for tomography: by narrowing the state space, we gain the possibility of more efficient tomography by learning the optimal sequence of measurements. Numerical experiments for a 2-qubit system show that both methods outperform standard maximum likelihood estimation and also scale to larger 3- and 4-qubit systems. Our results demonstrate that neural networks can effectively learn the underlying geometry of multi-qubit states using this for their reconstruction.</p>

            <p>We study parametric oscillations of two capacitively coupled Kerr parametric oscillators (KPOs) with frequency-chirped two- and one-photon drives. The two-KPO system adiabatically evolves from the initial vacuum state to an oscillation state corresponding to a solution state in quantum-annealing applications. Frequency chirping dynamically changes the detuning between resonance and oscillation frequencies during parametric modulation and reduces unwanted population transfer to excited states caused by pure dephasing and photon loss. We observe that frequency chirping increases the success probability to obtain the solution state and that simulations taking into account pure dephasing reproduce experiments with and without frequency chirping. This study demonstrates the effectiveness and applicability of frequency chirping to a KPO-based quantum annealer.</p>

            <p>The Bennett-Brassard 1984 protocol (BB84 protocol) is one of the simplest protocols for implementing quantum key distribution (QKD). In the protocol, the sender and the receiver iteratively choose one of two complementary measurement bases. Regarding the basis choice by the receiver, a passive setup has been adopted in a number of its implementations including satellite QKD and time-bin encoding one. However, conventional theoretical techniques to prove the security of BB84 protocol are not applicable if the receiver chooses his measurement basis passively, rather than actively, with a biased probability, followed by the measurement with threshold detectors. Here we present a fully analytical security proof against coherent attacks for such a decoy-state BB84 protocol with receiver's passive basis choice and measurement with threshold detectors. The numerical simulations under practical situations show that the difference in secure key rate between the active and the passive implementations of the protocol is negligible except for long communication distances.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Leonardo Zambrano, Sergi Ramos-Calderer, Richard Kueng</p>
            <p>We present a two-step protocol for quantum measurement tomography that is light on classical co-processing cost and still achieves optimal sample complexity in the system dimension. Given measurement data from a known probe state ensemble, we first apply least-squares estimation to produce an unconstrained approximation of the POVM, and then project this estimate onto the set of valid quantum measurements. For a POVM with $L$ outcomes acting on a $d$-dimensional system, we show that the protocol requires $\mathcal{O}(d^3 L \ln(d)/\epsilon^2)$ samples to achieve error $\epsilon$ in worst-case distance, and $\mathcal{O}(d^2 L^2 \ln(dL)/\epsilon^2)$ samples in average-case distance. We further establish two almost matching sample complexity lower bounds of $\Omega(d^3/\epsilon^2)$ and $\Omega(d^2 L/\epsilon^2)$ for any non-adaptive, single-copy POVM tomography protocol. Hence, our projected least squares POVM tomography is sample-optimal in dimension $d$ up to logarithmic factors. Our method admits an analytic form when using global or local 2-designs as probe ensembles and enables rigorous non-asymptotic error guarantees. Finally, we also complement our findings with empirical performance studies carried out on a noisy superconducting quantum computer with flux-tunable transmon qubits.</p>

            <p>We present a quantum optimal control protocol to generate highly spin-squeezed states in Rydberg atom arrays coupled via Ising-type van der Waals interactions. Using gradient-based optimization techniques, we construct time-dependent pulse sequences that steer an initial product state toward highly entangled, spin-squeezed states with predefined magnetization and squeezing axes. We focus on the Wineland parameter $\xi_W^2$ to measure spin squeezing, and our approach achieves near-optimal spin squeezing in one-dimensional ring arrays of up to $N=8$ spins, significantly outperforming conventional quench dynamics for all system sizes studied. Remarkably, optimized pulse sequences can be directly scaled to larger arrays without additional optimization, achieving a squeezing parameter as low as $\xi_W^2 = 0.227$ in systems containing $N=50$ spins. This work demonstrates the potential of quantum optimal control methods for preparing highly spin-squeezed states, opening pathways to enhanced quantum metrology.</p>

            <p>In purely coherent transport on finite networks, destructive interference can significantly suppress transfer probabilities, which can only reach high values through careful fine-tuning of the evolution time or tailored initial-state preparations. We address this issue by investigating excitation transfer on a ring, modeling it as a locally monitored continuous-time chiral quantum walk. Chirality, introduced through time-reversal symmetry breaking, imparts a directional bias to the coherent dynamics and can lift dark states. Local monitoring, implemented via stroboscopic projective measurements at the target site, provides a practical detection protocol without requiring fine-tuning of the evolution time. By analyzing the interplay between chirality and measurement frequency, we identify optimal conditions for maximizing the asymptotic detection probability. The optimization of this transfer protocol relies on the spectral properties of the Perron-Frobenius operator, which capture the asymptotic non-unitary dynamics, and on the analysis of dark states. Our approach offers a general framework for enhancing quantum transport in monitored systems.</p>

            <p>Reasoning about quantum programs remains a fundamental challenge, regardless of the programming model or computational paradigm. Despite extensive research, existing verification techniques are insufficient -- even for quantum circuits, a deliberately restricted model that lacks classical control, but still underpins many current quantum algorithms. Many existing formal methods require exponential time and space to represent and manipulate (representations of) assertions and judgments, making them impractical for quantum circuits with many qubits. This paper presents a logic for reasoning in such settings, called SAQR-QC. The logic supports {S}calable but {A}pproximate {Q}uantitative {R}easoning about {Q}uantum {C}ircuits, whence the name. SAQR-QC has three characteristics: (i) some (deliberate) loss of precision is built into it; (ii) it has a mechanism to help the accumulated loss of precision during a sequence of reasoning steps remain small; and (iii) most importantly, to make reasoning scalable, every reasoning step is local -- i.e., it involves just a small number of qubits. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SAQR-QC via two case studies: the verification of GHZ circuits involving non-Clifford gates, and the analysis of quantum phase estimation -- a core subroutine in Shor's factoring algorithm.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Techapon Kampu, Salvatore De Vincenzo</p>
            <p>Real solutions of the 1D Klein-Fock-Gordon (KFG) equation automatically cancel out the usual two-vector current density; consequently, the respective continuity equation is trivially satisfied, and a globally conserved quantity cannot be obtained. Additionally, distinguishing between impermeable and permeable boundary conditions (BCs) at a given point is not possible. We address these first-quantized conflicts by using the simplest nontrivial local observables, i.e., an energy density and an energy current density, which allows us to characterize a strictly neutral 1D KFG particle, i.e., a 1D KFG-Majorana (KFGM) particle, when it is confined to an interval and when it is restricted, e.g., in an interval with transparent walls. All the BCs for this system are extracted from the pseudo self-adjointness of the Feshbach-Villars (FV) Hamiltonian plus two Majorana conditions. We show that these energy densities can satisfy a continuity equation; in addition, they lead to a conserved quantity for all available impermeable and permeable BCs. Moreover, the energy current density can characterize all available BCs. Despite this, the two-vector constructed with these two densities is not Lorentz covariant. In contrast, the commonly used energy current density -- a component of the energy-momentum tensor of the system -- cannot characterize all the BCs. Additionally, this quantity and its respective energy density -- another component of the energy-momentum tensor -- may not lead to a conserved quantity. However, we obtain the conditions that must be satisfied by the BCs; thus, the abovementioned densities and those commonly used are equally satisfactory. For example, this occurs only for four impermeable BCs and a one-parameter set of permeable BCs. Our results highlight the important role played by the BCs when they are imposed on a system in which particles occupy a finite region.</p>

            <h2>Numerical implementation of the partial secular approximation and unified master equation in structured open quantum systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Antti Vaaranta, Marco Cattaneo</p>
            <p>The Markovian dynamics of open quantum systems is typically described through Lindblad equations, which are derived from the Redfield equation via the full secular approximation. The latter neglects the rotating terms in the master equation corresponding to pairs of jump operators with different Bohr frequencies. However, for many physical systems this approximation breaks down, and thus a more accurate treatment of the slowly rotating terms is required. Indeed, more precise physical results can be obtained by performing the partial secular approximation, which takes into account the relevant time scale associated with each pair of jump operators and compares it with the time scale arising from the system-environment coupling. In this work, we introduce a general code for performing the partial secular approximation in the Redfield equation for structured open quantum systems. The code can be applied to a generic Hamiltonian of any multipartite system coupled to bosonic baths. Moreover, it can also reproduce the unified master equation, which captures the same physical behavior as the Redfield equation under the partial secular approximation, but is mathematically guaranteed to generate a completely positive dynamical map. Finally, the code can compute both the local and global version of the master equation for the same physical problem. We illustrate the code by studying the steady-state heat flow in a structured open quantum system composed of two superconducting qubits, each coupled to a bosonic mode, which in turn interacts with a thermal bath. The results in this work can be employed for the numerical study of a wide range of complex open quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>Time Symmetry, Retrocausality, and Emergent Collapse: The Tlalpan Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alejandro Frank</p>
            <p>Quantum mechanics has remained conceptually puzzling since its inception. While its mathematical formalism provides predictions of unparalleled accuracy, the interpretative framework underpinning measurement and collapse has never been fully clarified. The Tlalpan Interpretation (QTI) proposes that the wavefunction collapse is not a primitive, axiomatic rule but an emergent phenomenon, a spontaneous breaking of time symmetry triggered by amplification and record creation. The novelty of QTI lies in its embedding of collapse within the conceptual language of critical phenomena in statistical physics. The theory introduces measurable parameters (the amplification fraction, the record asymmetry, and the retrocausal coherence time) that serve as order parameters describing the quantum-classical transition. Collapse is thus characterized not as a mysterious fiat but as a phase transition, with thresholds and scaling laws analogous to magnetization in ferromagnets. This perspective allows the interpretation to retain microscopic time symmetry and spatial locality, while attributing quantum correlations and Bell-type violations to retrocausal boundary constraints rather than instantaneous action at a distance. Collapse corresponds to the granularization of trajectories: the conversion of smooth, time-symmetric quantum evolution into discrete, irreversible records. Most importantly, QTI is testable. It predicts: (1) sharp threshold-like disappearance of interference when amplification exceeds a critical value, (2) anomalously fast decay of reversibility in chaotic optical cavities compared with regular ones, and (3) qualitatively new interference fringes in a time-symmetric generalization of Moshinsky's diffraction in time. If confirmed, these predictions would place collapse squarely in the realm of thermodynamic processes, removing the last "mystical" postulate from quantum theory.</p>

In the case of imperfections without memory effects, it can be combined with proofs addressing source imperfections in a modular manner. We apply our framework to compute key rates for the decoy-state BB84 protocol, when the beam splitting ratio, the detection efficiency, and dark counts of the detectors are only known to be within some ranges. We also compute key rates in the presence of memory effects in the detectors. In this case, our results allow for protocols to be run at higher repetition rates, resulting in a significant improvement in the secure key generation rate.</p>

For strongly-correlated states, where QPE is expected to have advantage over classical methods, preparation of such initial states requires deep quantum circuits and/or expensive hybrid quantum-classical optimization. It is well-known that orbital-optimized paired Coupled Cluster Doubles (oo-pCCD) method can describe the static correlation features of many strongly correlated singlet states. We show that pCCD and its unitary counterpart, UpCCD, become equivalent in the limit of small amplitudes or if the number of large amplitudes is below 5. We demonstrate that substituting leading oo-pCCD amplitudes into the UpCCD Ansatz allows to prepare high-fidelity singlet states for models of multiple-bond dissociation in ethene, ethyne and dinitrogen, as well as for 1D Hubbard models at half-filling, with very shallow circuits. We envisage our method to be of general use for approximate preparation of singlet states for Quantum Phase Estimation and related algorithms.</p>

            <h2>Towards Compact Wavefunctions from Quantum-Selected Configuration Interaction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tim Weaving, Angus Mingare, Alexis Ralli, Peter V. Coveney</p>
            <p>A recent direction in quantum computing for molecular electronic structure sees the use of quantum devices as configuration sampling machines integrated within high-performance computing (HPC) platforms. This appeals to the strengths of both the quantum and classical hardware; where state-sampling is classically hard, the quantum computer can provide computational advantage in the selection of high quality configuration subspaces, while the final molecular energies are evaluated by solving an interaction matrix on HPC and is therefore not corrupted by hardware noise. In this work, we present an algorithm that leverages stochastic Hamiltonian time evolution in Quantum-Selected Configuration Interaction (QSCI), with multireference perturbation theory capturing missed correlations outside the configuration subspace. The approach is validated through a hardware demonstration utilising 42 qubits of an IQM superconducting device to calculate the potential energy curve of the inorganic silane molecule, SiH4 using a 6-31G atomic orbital basis set, under a stretching of the Si-H bond length. We assess the resulting wavefunctions for compactness, a point on which QSCI has previously been criticised. At large separations, where static correlation dominates, we find a configuration space more than 200 times smaller than that obtained from a conventional SCI selection criterion yields comparable energies. We also compare against the best-in-class Heatbath Configuration Interaction algorithm and observe similar wavefunction compactness at convergence. This result is achieved with a configuration sampling scheme that uses the experimental orbital occupancies of a time-evolved quantum state to predict likely single and double excitations away from existing configurations to bias the subspace expansion procedure.</p>

            <h2>Quantization of the electromagnetic fields from single atomic or molecular radiators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Valerica Raicu</p>
            <p>A framework is introduced for expressing electromagnetic (EM) potentials and fields of single atomic or molecular emitters modeled as oscillating dipoles, which follows a recently proposed method for solving inhomogeneous wave equations for arbitrary, time-dependent distributions of charge. This framework is first used to evaluate the physical implications of simplifying assumptions made in the standard approach to quantization of the EM fields and the impact of such assumptions on the results of energy and momentum quantization. Then, the exact expressions for the EM potentials and fields, in relation to the oscillating (transition) dipoles properties, afforded by the present framework are used to quantize electromagnetic fields from single emitters and restore the agreement with the well-known classical dipole radiation pattern, while maintaining the quantum mechanical description of electromagnetic radiation in terms of the probability distribution of quantum modes. Contributions of the present analysis to the understanding of photon emission from excited atoms or molecules stimulated by light or vacuum field fluctuations are highlighted, and possible experimental tests and practical applications are proposed.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kentaro Hino, Damyan S. Frantzov, Yuki Kurashige, Lewis M. Antill</p>
            <p>Radical pairs (also known as spin qubit pairs, electron-hole pairs) are transient reaction intermediates that are found and utilised in all areas of science. Radical pair spin dynamics simulations including all nuclear spins have been a computational barrier due to exponential scaling memory requirements. We address this issue with a tensor network method for accurately simulating the full open quantum dynamics of radical pair systems, explicitly accounting for hyperfine interactions with up to 30 nuclear spins with additional benchmarking including 60 nuclei. By employing the matrix product state (MPS) and matrix product density operator (MPDO) representations, we mitigate the exponential scaling of Hilbert and Liouville spaces typically encountered in full quantum non-Markovian treatments. We demonstrate the power of these methods with biologically relevant flavin-tryptophan radical pair systems, where we investigate electron hopping processes between multiple radical pairs using Lindblad jump operators. These simulations precisely capture anisotropic spin dynamics, clearly identifying orientational dependence of the magnetic field, which enhances or diminishes the spin-selective product yield. These directional sensitivities highlight the critical dependence of the nuclear environment and underscore the necessity of fully quantum treatments in spin biophysics, offering critical insights into avian magnetoreception mechanisms. This work provides a robust computational framework applicable to a broad range of scientific realms, which include spin chemistry, quantum biology, and spintronics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zherui Chen, Joao Basso, Zhiyan Ding, Lin Lin</p>
            <p>The presence of energy barriers in the state space of a physical system can lead to exponentially slow convergence for sampling algorithms like Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). In the classical setting, replica exchange (or parallel tempering) is a powerful heuristic to accelerate mixing in these scenarios. In the quantum realm, preparing Gibbs states of Hamiltonians faces a similar challenge, where bottlenecks can dramatically increase the mixing time of quantum dynamical semigroups. In this work, we introduce a quantum analogue of the replica exchange method. We define a Lindbladian on a joint system of two replicas and prove that it can accelerate mixing for a class of Hamiltonians with local energy barriers. We provide a rigorous lower bound on the spectral gap of the combined system's Lindbladian, which leads to an exponential improvement in spectral gap with respect to the barrier height. We showcase the applicability of our method with several examples, including the defected 1D Ising model at arbitrary constant temperature, and defected non-commuting local Hamiltonians at high temperature.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hung-Hsuan Teh, Takahiro Orito</p>
            <p>We establish a unified framework connecting decoherence and quantum complexity. By vectorizing the density matrix into a pure state in a double Hilbert space, a decoherence process is mapped to an imaginary-time evolution. Expanding this evolution in the Krylov space, we find that the $n$-th Krylov basis corresponds to an $n$-error state generated by the decoherence, providing a natural bridge between error proliferation and complexity growth. Using two dephasing quantum channels as concrete examples, we show that the Krylov complexity remains nonsingular for strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry-breaking (SWSSB) crossovers, while it exhibits a singular area-to-volume-law transition for genuine SWSSB phase transitions, intrinsic to mixed states.</p>

            <p>Temporal entanglement (TE) of an influence matrix (IM) has been proposed as a measure of complexity of simulating dynamics of local observables in a many-body system. Foligno et al. [Phys. Rev. X 13, 041008 (2023)] recently argued that the TE in chaotic 1d quantum circuits obeys linear (volume-law) scaling with evolution time. To reconcile this apparent high complexity of IM with the rapid thermalization of local observables, here we study the relation between TE, non-Markovianity, and local temporal correlations for chaotic quantum baths. By exactly solving a random-unitary bath model, and bounding distillable entanglement between future and past degrees of freedom, we argue that TE is extensive for low enough bath growth rate, and it reflects genuine non-Markovianity. This memory, however, is entirely contained in highly complex temporal correlations, and its effect on few-point temporal correlators is negligible. An IM coarse-graining procedure, reducing the allowed frequency of measurements of the probe system, results in a transition from volume- to area-law TE scaling. We demonstrate the generality of this TE transition in 1d circuits by analyzing the kicked Ising model analytically at dual-unitary points, as well as numerically away from them. This finding indicates that dynamics of local observables are fully captured by an area-law IM. We provide evidence that the compact IM MPS obtained via standard compression algorithms accurately describes local evolution.</p>

            <h2>Relative entropy for locally squeezed states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniela Cadamuro, Markus B. Fröb, Dimitrios Katsinis, Jan Mandrysch</p>
            <p>Relative entropy serves as a fundamental measure of state distinguishability in both quantum information theory and relativistic quantum field theory. Despite its conceptual importance, however, explicit computations of relative entropy remain notoriously difficult. Thus far, results in closed form have only been obtained for ground states, coherent states, and, more recently, single-mode squeezed states. In this work, we extend the analysis to multi-mode squeezed states, imposing that the squeezing generators be local either in space or in spacetime, which results in a continuum of squeezed modes. We provide a detailed and self-contained analysis of such states for a free scalar quantum field on Minkowski spacetime, connecting also with older results on the essential self-adjointness of the Wick square, and showing that they lie in the folium of the Minkowski vacuum representation. Although the local squeezing is natural from a foundational standpoint, we uncover a severe incompatibility between locality and squeezing: the relative entropy between a locally squeezed state and the vacuum generally diverges, however small the squeezing is. This shows that while locally squeezed states are well-defined elements of the state space of a free quantum field, they are infinitely different from the vacuum, in contrast to coherent states whose relative entropy with respect to the vacuum is finite.</p>

            <h2>The impact of multimode sources on DLCZ type quantum repeaters</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emil R. Hellebek, Anders S. Sørensen</p>
            <p>Long distance entanglement generation at a high rate is a major quantum technological goal yet to be fully realized, with the promise of many interesting applications, such as secure quantum computing on remote servers and quantum cryptography. One possible implementation is using a variant of the DLCZ-scheme by combining atomic-ensemble memories and linear optics with spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) sources. As we edge closer to the realization of such a technology, the complete details of the underlying components become crucial. In this paper we consider the impact of the multimode emission from the SPDC source on quantum repeaters based on the DLCZ-scheme. We consider two cases, driving the SPDC using short Gaussian pulses and continuously. For pulsed driving, we find that the use of very narrow laser pulses to drive SPDC source is crucial to obtain high fidelity end-to-end entangled states but this puts demands on the peak intensity. By introducing a maximally allowed laser intensity, we find optimal pulse widths for each swap depth. For continuous driving, we find the temporal acceptance window of clicks relative to the heralding time to be a crucial parameter, and we can similarly optimize the acceptance window for each swap depth. For both cases, we thus identify optimal parameters given experimental limitations and aims. We have thus provided helpful knowledge towards the realization of long distance entanglement generation using the DLCZ-scheme.</p>

            <p>Quantum mechanics and general relativity are the foundational pillars of modern physics, yet experimental tests that combine the two frameworks remain rare. Measuring optical phase shifts of massless photons in a gravitational potential provides a unique quantum platform to probe gravity beyond Newtonian descriptions, but laboratory-based interferometers have not yet reached the sensitivity needed to access this regime. Here, we report the realization of a 50-km table-top Mach-Zehnder fiber interferometer operating at the single-photon level, achieving a phase sensitivity of $4.42\times10^{-6}$ rad root-mean-square (RMS) within the frequency range of 0.01 Hz to 5 Hz. We demonstrate that this sensitivity is sufficient to resolve a phase-shift signal of $(6.18 \pm 0.44)\times10^{-5}$ rad RMS at 0.1 Hz, associated with a modulated gravity-induced signal. Our results establish a milestone for quantum sensing with large-scale optical interferometry, demonstrating the capability to detect gravitational redshifts in a local laboratory, thereby paving the way for testing quantum phenomena within general relativistic frameworks.</p>

            <p>We develop the theory describing the quantum coupled dynamics of the center-of-mass motion of a nanoparticle and an ensemble of ions co-trapped in a dual-frequency linear Paul trap. We first derive analytical expressions for the motional frequencies and classical trajectories of both nanoparticle and ions. We then derive a quantum master equation for the ion-nanoparticle system and quantify the sympathetic cooling of the nanoparticle motion enabled by its Coulomb coupling to a continuously Doppler-cooled ion. We predict that motional cooling down to sub-kelvin temperatures is achievable in state-of-the-art experiments even in the absence of motional feedback and in the presence of micromotion. We then extend our analysis to an ensemble of $N$ ions, predicting a linear increase of the cooling rate as a function of $N$ and motional cooling of the nanoparticle down to tenths of millikelvin in current experimental platforms. Our work establishes the theoretical toolbox needed to explore the ion-assisted preparation of non-Gaussian motional states of levitated nanoparticles.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michele Coppola, Zoubair Daouma, Malte Henkel</p>
            <p>The quantum fluctuation-dissipation theorem is a central ingredient in the construction of quantum dynamics of Brownian motion which necessarily is non-Markovian. Yet, often Markovian approximations to quantum dynamics are studied in the literature. In this work, we investigate the limitations of the Markovian approximation within two paradigmatic models describing a single damped harmonic oscillator. These models are governed by distinct quantum Langevin equations, although both are constructed to satisfy the same set of phenomenological criteria: the canonical commutation relations between position and momentum, the Kubo response relation, the virial theorem, and the equilibrium quantum variance. The limitations of the Markovian approximation are underscored by the classical limit, violations of the Ehrenfest theorem, the breakdown of complete and simple positivity in the reconstructed master equations, and anomalies in thermalisation behaviour. Further phenomenological differences between the two models are illustrated through their quantum relaxation dynamics and phase diagrams, derived from their reinterpretation as mean-field approximations of a many-body interacting magnet. Our analysis explicitly reveals intrinsic inconsistencies introduced by the Markovian approximation, emphasising the need for non-Markovian frameworks for a consistent description of open quantum dynamics.</p>

This review differs from previous ones in that it is based on the most recent understanding of the theory: the dependence of the self-consistent order parameter on the supercurrent is properly taken into account, and the superfluid weight in a flat band becomes proportional to the minimal quantum metric. We provide a recap of basic quantum geometric quantities and the concept of superfluid density. The geometric contribution of superconductivity is introduced via considering the two-body problem. The superfluid weight of a multiband system is derived within mean-field theory, leading to a topological bound of flat band superconductivity. The physical interpretation of the flat band supercurrent in terms of Wannier function overlaps is discussed.</p>

Natural candidates for this research are spin mixtures of atomic species with large magnetic moments. However, the lifetime of such assemblies can be strongly affected by the dipolar relaxation that occurs in spin-flip collisions. Here we present experimental results for a mixture composed of the two lowest Zeeman states of $^{162}$Dy atoms, that act as dark states with respect to a light-induced quadratic Zeeman effect. We show that, due to an interference phenomenon, the rate for such inelastic processes is dramatically reduced with respect to the Wigner threshold law. Additionally, we determine the scattering lengths characterizing the s-wave interaction between these states, providing all necessary data to predict the miscibility range of the mixture, depending on its dimensionality.</p>

We study the Fraunhofer pattern of planar Josephson junctions in presence of different kinds of disorder and imperfections and we find that a junction that is {\it mirror} symmetric at zero-field forbids the diode effect and that the diode effect is typically magnified at the nodal points of the Fraunhofer pattern. The work presents a comprehensive treatment of the role of pure spatial inhomogeneity in the emergence of a diode effect in planar junctions, with an extension to the multi-terminal case and to systems of Josephson junctions connected in parallel.</p>

            <p>An economic modeling approach for cavity quantum electrodynamics is provided by mean-field dynamics, wherein the optical field is described classically while a self-consistent interaction with quantum emitters is incorporated through the Ehrenfest theorem. However, conventional implementations of mean-field dynamics are known to suffer from a catastrophic leakage of zero-point energy, to lose accuracy in the short-cavity limit, and to require large numbers of trajectories to be sampled. Here, we address these three shortcomings within a single integrated approach. This approach builds on our recently-proposed modification of the Ehrenfest theorem, referred to as decoupled mean-field (DC-MF) dynamics, in combination with a focused sampling scheme that enforces zero-point energy at the single-trajectory level. The approach is shown to yield high accuracy in both short and long-cavity limits while reaching convergence within a minimal amount of trajectories.</p>

            <p>Symmetry-protected non-Abelian (SPNA) statistics opens new frontiers in quantum statistics and enriches the schemes for topological quantum computing. In this work, we propose a novel type of SPNA statistics in one-dimensional strongly correlated bosonic symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases and reveal its exotic universal features through a comprehensive investigation. Specifically, we show a universal result for a wide range of bosonic SPT phases described by real Hamiltonians: the SPNA statistics of topological zero modes fall into two distinct classes. The first class exhibits conventional braiding operation of hard-core bosons. Furthermore, we discover a second class of unconventional braiding statistics characterized by an exotic nonlinear transformation, featuring a fractionalization of the first class and reminiscent of the non-Abelian statistics of symmetry-protected Majorana pairs. The two distinct classes of statistics have a topological origin in classifying non-Abelian Berry phases for braiding processes of real-Hamiltonian systems, distinguished by whether the holonomy involves a reflection operation. To illustrate, we focus on a specific bosonic SPT phase with particle-hole symmetry, and demonstrate that both classes of braiding statistics can be feasibly realized in a tri-junction with or without the aid of a controlled defect. The topological zero modes are protected by unitary symmetries and are therefore immune to dynamical symmetry breaking. Numerical results support our theoretical predictions. We demonstrate how to encode logical qubits and implement both single- and two-qubit gates using the two classes of SPNA statistics. Finally, we propose feasible experimental schemes to realize these SPNA statistics and identify the parameter regimes that ensure high-fidelity braiding results.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Takayuki Kubo</p>
            <p>This work investigates amplitude-dependent nonlinear corrections to the dissipative conductivity in superconductors, using the Keldysh--Usadel theory of nonequilibrium superconductivity, which captures the nonequilibrium dynamics of both quasiparticles and the pair potential. Our rigorous formulation naturally incorporates both the direct nonlinear action of the photon field and indirect contributions mediated by nonequilibrium variations in the pair potential, namely the Eliashberg effect and the Higgs mode. The third-harmonic current, often regarded as a hallmark of the Higgs mode in disordered superconductors, arises from both the direct photon action and the Higgs mode. Our numerical results are in excellent agreement with previous studies. In contrast, the first-harmonic current, and consequently the dissipative conductivity, receives contributions from all three mechanisms: the direct photon action, the Higgs mode, and the Eliashberg effect. It is shown that that the nonlinear correction to dissipative conductivity in dirty-limit superconductors can serve as a fingerprint of the Higgs mode, appearing as a resonance peak at a frequency near the superconducting gap \( \Delta \). In addition, our results provide microscopic insight into amplitude-dependent dissipation at frequencies well below \( \Delta \), which is particularly relevant for applied superconducting devices. In particular, the long-standing issue concerning the frequency dependence of the amplitude-dependent quality factor is explained as originating from the direct nonlinear action of the photon field, rather than from contributions by the Higgs mode and the Eliashberg effect. Our practical and explicit expression for the nonlinear conductivity formula makes our results accessible to a broad range of researchers.</p>

We map out kinematical regions where the pairs exhibit entanglement, Bell nonlocality and non-stabilizerness (`magic'). We also predict that massive quarks and antiquarks are transversely polarized, similar to the well-known transverse hyperon polarization in unpolarized collisions.

            <p>Quantum information science has been broadly explored in Einstein gravity and in various modified gravity theories; however, its extension to quantum gravity settings remains largely unexplored. Motivated by this gap, in this paper we investigate the degradation of quantum entanglement of scalar and Dirac fields in the third-type black hole geometry arising from effective quantum gravity, which incorporates generic quantum gravitational corrections beyond classical general relativity. This quantum corrected spacetime is free of a Cauchy horizon and can be cast into a Rindler form in the near-horizon regime, allowing a direct identification of vacuum modes and a clear correspondence with the framework developed for uniformly accelerated observers. Within this framework, we compute the quantum entanglement and mutual information of uniformly entangled detector pairs in terms of the quantum parameter $\tilde{\zeta}$, the mode frequency $\tilde{\omega}$, and Bob's radial position $R_0$. The quantum parameter $\tilde{\zeta}$ consistently weakens the horizon-induced loss of correlations. For scalar fields this effect is pronounced, producing clear departures from the classical behavior, whereas for Dirac fields the familiar correlation pattern remains intact but its degradation is noticeably reduced. Overall, $\tilde{\zeta}$ acts as a universal protective factor against gravitational suppression of quantum correlations. The third-type effective quantum black hole therefore provides a controlled and physically transparent arena for probing how quantum-gravity corrections influence relativistic quantum information.</p>

            <h2>On the resolution of categorical symmetries in (Non-) Unitary Rational CFTs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arpan Bhattacharyya, Saptaswa Ghosh, Sounak Pal, Jagannath Santara</p>
            <p>We explore several aspects of the categorical symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy (SREE) in two-dimensional Rational Conformal Field Theories (RCFTs) and express it directly in terms of the modular data of the theory. Motivated by arXiv:2409.02806, we provide a general formula for SREE that applies to symmetric (weakly/strongly) and cloaking boundary conditions as well as for fusion rings with multiplicities without invoking any SymTFT construction, relying instead on a purely 2d RCFT analysis. We check the formula against several explicit examples. Additionally, we study symmetry resolution for both categorical and invertible symmetries in (non-)diagonal RCFTs and comment on the subtleties that arise in these cases. Finally, we extend our analysis to diagonal non-unitary RCFTs, focusing on theories with generalized Haagerup-Izumi modular data, and find full agreement with the given formula.</p>

Building on this framework, we present a numerical implementation to study the evolution of primordial scalar perturbations under controlled state deformations induced by the simplest environment corrections from the Lindblad equation. Our approach generalizes to an arbitrary number of degrees of freedom and does not rely on the slow-roll approximation. The computational routine is numerically efficient and allows users to configure arbitrary sequences of decoherence events, with full control over their duration, shape, amplitude and effective wavelength range. The resulting outputs are compatible with nonlinear numerical codes, enabling studies of how decoherence effects propagate during reheating.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sijia Wang, Achintya Sajeendran, Dong-han Yeom, Robert B. Mann, Joshua Foo</p>
            <p>In a wide range of quantum gravity theories, quasiclassical geometries, which are solutions to the Einstein field equations approximately, are described by "coherent states." Here we propose a Hamiltonian formalism for gravitational dynamics with respect to this coherent state basis, which generates time evolution of the spacetime with respect to a clock at infinity. Since the coherent states are not orthogonal, an initial quasiclassical geometry is dynamically driven into a superposition of different amplitudes. Our framework provides a dynamical mechanism for tunneling between geometries that is ubiquitous in a number of approaches to quantum gravity, from loop quantum gravity to the Euclidean path integral. We apply our framework to the problem of black hole evaporation, providing a hint at how unitarity may be preserved with the inclusion of quantum corrections to the semiclassical evolution of the black hole.</p>

            <h2>New quasi-exactly solvable systems from SUSYQM and Bethe Ansatz</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Siyu Li, Ian Marquette, Yao-Zhong Zhang</p>
            <p>We give a systematic construction of new quasi-exactly solvable systems via Bethe ansatz and supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SUSYQM). Methods based on the intertwining of supercharges have been extensively used in the literature for exactly solvable systems. We generalize the state-deleting (Krein-Adler) supersymmetric transformations to quasi-exactly exactly solvable (QES) systems building on the Bethe ansatz method and related Bethe roots. This enables us to construct superpartners for a wide class of known QES systems classified previously through a hidden $sl(2)$ algebra. We present our constructions of factorizations and intertwining relations related to 1st-order SUSYQM and the $n=1$ state for 10 nonequivalent types, denoted I,...,X. In order to have a unified treatment we rely on their ODE standard form as this is also the appropriate setting to obtain the Bethe ansatz equations which constrain the polynomial solutions. This setting also allows one to deal with systems with $n$ states in a unified manner, using analysis based on the Bethe ansatz equations to build the supersymmetric transformations in terms of the Bethe ansatz roots. We derive the Schrödinger potentials for the $n=1$ superpartners of the 10 QES cases and give closed-form solutions for the spectra and wavefunctions of the corresponding QES SUSYQM systems. Furthermore, we present numerical results for higher excited states up to the $n=10$ level. The results obtained may have wider applicability as our framework is built on ODEs with polynomial coefficients.</p>

            <p>Timing and phase resolution in satellite QKD, kilometre-scale gravitational-wave detectors, and space-borne clock networks hinge on quantum-speed limits (QSLs), yet benchmarks omit relativistic effects for coherent and squeezed probes. We derive first-order relativistic corrections to the Mandelstam-Tamm and Margolus-Levitin bounds. Starting from the Foldy-Wouthuysen expansion and treating $-p^{4}/(8 m^{3} c^{2})$ as a harmonic-oscillator perturbation, we propagate Gaussian states to obtain closed-form QSLs and the quantum Cramér-Rao bound. Relativistic kinematics slow evolution in an amplitude- and squeezing-dependent way, increase both bounds, and introduce an $\epsilon^{2} t^{2}$ phase drift that weakens timing sensitivity while modestly increasing the squeeze factor. A single electron ($\epsilon \approx 1.5\times 10^{-10}$) in a $5.4\,\mathrm{T}$ Penning trap, read out with $149\,\mathrm{GHz}$ quantum-limited balanced homodyne, should reveal this drift within $\sim 15\,\mathrm{min}$ -- within known hold times.

With a minimal two qubit system, we demonstrate a nonreciprocal half-iSWAP gate with tunable Bell-state generation, thereby showcasing the potential of intrinsic nonreciprocity as a tool in coherent control in quantum technologies.

            <p>We propose a scheme to generate multi-paths entanglement in an optomechanical system by exploiting polarized electromagnetic fields and dark mode control. Our system consists of two mechanically coupled mechanical resonators, which are driven by a common electromagnetic field. An inclusion of a polarizer induces linear polarizations of the electromgnetic field corresponding to the vertical (transverse electric ($\rm{TE}$) and horizontal (transverse magnetic [($\rm{TM}$]) modes, which drive the mechanical resonators. Without the mechanical coupling $J_m=0$, the polarization angle ($\phi$) controls dark mode in the system. The breaking of this dark mode leads to multi-paths engineering of bipartite optomechanical entanglements. By switching on the phonon hopping rate ($J_m\neq0$), both the polarization angle and the modulation phase of the mechanical coupling allow a further control of the dark mode. The simultaneous Dark Mode Breaking (\rm{DMB}) conditions under these two parameters leads to multi-paths bipartite and tripartite entanglements. For a fine tuning of the polarization angle ($\phi=\pi/4$) this scheme enables a generation of twin entangled states, where the bipartite/tripartite generated entangled states are degenerated and might be of great interest for quantum information processing, quantum communication and diverse quantum computational tasks. The generated entanglements are more resilient against thermal fluctuations in the \rm{DMB} regime, i.e., up to two order of magnitude robust than in the Unbreaking regime. Our work sheets light on new possibilities to generate noise-tolerant quantum resources that are useful for plethora of modern quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Quantum electrodynamic description of the neutral hydrogen molecule ionization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hui-hui Miao</p>
            <p>The ionization dynamics of a hydrogen molecule, serving as a fundamental benchmark in quantum chemistry, is investigated within a comprehensive framework combining quantum electrodynamics and the Lindblad master equation. This approach enables a first-principles description of light--matter interactions while accounting for dissipative processes and external particle influx. We systematically explore the system's evolution across three distinct regimes: closed, dissipative open, and influx-driven open quantum systems. Our results reveal a universal tendency towards the formation of the neutral hydrogen molecule ($|\rm{H}_2\rangle$) across all configurations. The dissipation strengths for photons ($\gamma_\Omega$), electrons ($\gamma_e$), and phonons ($\gamma_\omega$) are identified as critical control parameters, with $\gamma_\Omega$ significantly accelerating system stabilization. Furthermore, the introduction of particle influx ($\mu_k$) leads to a complex redistribution of energy, notably populating the atomic state ($|\rm{H},\rm{H}\rangle$). The ionization pathway is exquisitely sensitive to the initial quantum state, dictated by the composition and number of photons, which governs the accessible spin-selective excitation channels. This is conclusively demonstrated in a model with an embedded anode, where the maximum ionization probability is fundamentally constrained to $\frac{3}{4}$ by orbital hybridization. This study provides a unified theoretical foundation for quantum-controlled chemistry, with direct implications for future experiments in cavity QED and quantum information processing.</p>

In this work, a single-photon source based on WS$_2$ micro-domes, created via hydrogen ion irradiation, is realized and integrated into an open, tunable optical microcavity. Single-photon emission from the coupled emitter-cavity system is verified via the second-order correlation measurement, revealing a $g^{(2)}(\tau=0)$ value of 0.3. A detailed analysis of the spectrally selective, cavity enhanced emission features shows the impact of a pronounced acoustic phonon emission sideband, which contributes specifically to the non-resonant emitter-cavity coupling in this system. The achieved level of cavity-emitter control highlights the potential of open-cavity systems to tailor the emission properties of atomically thin quantum emitters, advancing their suitability for real-world quantum technology applications.</p>

            <p>Neutral atoms in optical tweezer arrays possess broad applicability for quantum information science, in computing, simulation, and metrology. Among atomic species, Ytterbium-171 is unique as it hosts multiple qubits, each of which is impactful for these distinct applications. Consequently, this atom is an ideal candidate to bridge multiple disciplines, which, more broadly, has been an increasingly effective strategy within the field of quantum science. Realizing the full potential of this synergy requires high-fidelity generation and transfer of many-particle entanglement between these distinct qubit degrees of freedom, and thus between these distinct applications. Here we demonstrate the creation and coherent mapping of entangled quantum states across multiple qubits in Ytterbium-171 tweezer arrays. We map entangled states onto the optical clock qubit from the nuclear spin qubit or the Rydberg qubit. We coherently transfer up to 20 atoms of a $Z_2$-ordered Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state from the interacting Rydberg manifold to the metastable nuclear spin manifold. The many-body state is generated via a novel disorder-robust pulse in a two-dimensional ladder geometry. We further find that clock-qubit-based spin detection applied to Rydberg and nuclear spin qubits facilitates atom-loss-detectable qubit measurements and $>90\%$ Rydberg decay detection. This enables mid-circuit and delayed erasure detection, yielding an error-detected two-qubit gate fidelity of $99.78(4)\%$ in the metastable qubits. This error detection also enables Rydberg qubit evolution with an effective lifetime of $1.2(2)$ ms, enhancing the fidelity of the observed many-body dynamics. These results establish a versatile architecture that advances multiple fields of quantum information science while also establishing bridges between them.</p>

            <p>Quantum phenomena such as entanglement provide powerful resources for enhancing classical sensing. Here, we theoretically show that collective entanglement of spin qubits, arising from a condensation of particle-hole pairs, can strongly amplify transitions between ground and excited spin states, potentially improving signal contrast in optically detected magnetic resonance. This collective state exhibits an $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$ enhancement of the transition amplitude with respect to an applied microwave field, where $N$ is the number of entangled spin qubits. We computationally realize this amplification using an ensemble of $N$ triplet spins with magnetic dipole interactions, where the largest transition amplitudes occur at geometries for which the condensation of particle-hole pairs is strongest. This effect, robust to noise, originates from the concentration of entanglement into a single collective mode, reflected in a large eigenvalue of the particle-hole reduced density matrix -- an entanglement witness of condensation analogous to off-diagonal long-range order, though realized here in a finite system. These results offer a design principle for quantum sensors that exploit condensation-inspired entanglement to boost sensitivity in spin-based platforms.</p>

            <p>The precise measurement of the leptonic CP-violating phase $\delta_{CP}$ remains one of the major open challenges in neutrino physics, as current experiments achieve only very limited accuracy. We address this issue through the lens of quantum estimation theory. A distinctive feature of neutrino oscillation experiments is that they cannot freely optimize the probe or measurement, since both are constrained by the production and detection of flavor eigenstates. We therefore examine whether the large uncertainty in $\delta_{CP}$ originates from intrinsic reasons, either of the neutrino quantum state or of flavor measurements, or if it instead stems from experimental limitations. By comparing quantum and classical Fisher information, we demonstrate that the limited sensitivity to $\delta_{CP}$ originates primarily from the information content of flavor measurements. Furthermore, we show that targeting the second oscillation maximum, as in the ESS$\nu$SB proposal, substantially enhances $\delta_{CP}$ information compared to experiments centered on the first maximum.</p>

Our system consists of two mechanically coupled mechanical resonators, which are driven by a common electromagnetic field. An inclusion of a polarizer induces linear polarizations of the electromgnetic field corresponding to the vertical (transverse electric ($\rm{TE}$) and horizontal (transverse magnetic [($\rm{TM}$]) modes, which drive the mechanical resonators. Without the mechanical coupling $J_m=0$, the polarization angle ($\phi$) controls dark mode in the system. The breaking of this dark mode leads to multi-paths engineering of bipartite optomechanical entanglements. By switching on the phonon hopping rate ($J_m\neq0$), both the polarization angle and the modulation phase of the mechanical coupling allow a further control of the dark mode. The simultaneous Dark Mode Breaking (\rm{DMB}) conditions under these two parameters leads to multi-paths bipartite and tripartite entanglements. For a fine tuning of the polarization angle ($\phi=\pi/4$) this scheme enables a generation of twin entangled states, where the bipartite/tripartite generated entangled states are degenerated and might be of great interest for quantum information processing, quantum communication and diverse quantum computational tasks. The generated entanglements are more resilient against thermal fluctuations in the \rm{DMB} regime, i.e., up to two order of magnitude robust than in the Unbreaking regime. Our work sheets light on new possibilities to generate noise-tolerant quantum resources that are useful for plethora of modern quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Quantum electrodynamic description of the neutral hydrogen molecule ionization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hui-hui Miao</p>
            <p>The ionization dynamics of a hydrogen molecule, serving as a fundamental benchmark in quantum chemistry, is investigated within a comprehensive framework combining quantum electrodynamics and the Lindblad master equation. This approach enables a first-principles description of light--matter interactions while accounting for dissipative processes and external particle influx. We systematically explore the system's evolution across three distinct regimes: closed, dissipative open, and influx-driven open quantum systems. Our results reveal a universal tendency towards the formation of the neutral hydrogen molecule ($|\rm{H}_2\rangle$) across all configurations. The dissipation strengths for photons ($\gamma_\Omega$), electrons ($\gamma_e$), and phonons ($\gamma_\omega$) are identified as critical control parameters, with $\gamma_\Omega$ significantly accelerating system stabilization. Furthermore, the introduction of particle influx ($\mu_k$) leads to a complex redistribution of energy, notably populating the atomic state ($|\rm{H},\rm{H}\rangle$). The ionization pathway is exquisitely sensitive to the initial quantum state, dictated by the composition and number of photons, which governs the accessible spin-selective excitation channels. This is conclusively demonstrated in a model with an embedded anode, where the maximum ionization probability is fundamentally constrained to $\frac{3}{4}$ by orbital hybridization. This study provides a unified theoretical foundation for quantum-controlled chemistry, with direct implications for future experiments in cavity QED and quantum information processing.</p>

            <p>Versatile, tunable, and potentially scalable single-photon sources are a key asset in emergent photonic quantum technologies. In this work, a single-photon source based on WS$_2$ micro-domes, created via hydrogen ion irradiation, is realized and integrated into an open, tunable optical microcavity. Single-photon emission from the coupled emitter-cavity system is verified via the second-order correlation measurement, revealing a $g^{(2)}(\tau=0)$ value of 0.3. A detailed analysis of the spectrally selective, cavity enhanced emission features shows the impact of a pronounced acoustic phonon emission sideband, which contributes specifically to the non-resonant emitter-cavity coupling in this system. The achieved level of cavity-emitter control highlights the potential of open-cavity systems to tailor the emission properties of atomically thin quantum emitters, advancing their suitability for real-world quantum technology applications.</p>

            <p>Neutral atoms in optical tweezer arrays possess broad applicability for quantum information science, in computing, simulation, and metrology. Among atomic species, Ytterbium-171 is unique as it hosts multiple qubits, each of which is impactful for these distinct applications. Consequently, this atom is an ideal candidate to bridge multiple disciplines, which, more broadly, has been an increasingly effective strategy within the field of quantum science. Realizing the full potential of this synergy requires high-fidelity generation and transfer of many-particle entanglement between these distinct qubit degrees of freedom, and thus between these distinct applications. Here we demonstrate the creation and coherent mapping of entangled quantum states across multiple qubits in Ytterbium-171 tweezer arrays. We map entangled states onto the optical clock qubit from the nuclear spin qubit or the Rydberg qubit. We coherently transfer up to 20 atoms of a $Z_2$-ordered Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state from the interacting Rydberg manifold to the metastable nuclear spin manifold. The many-body state is generated via a novel disorder-robust pulse in a two-dimensional ladder geometry. We further find that clock-qubit-based spin detection applied to Rydberg and nuclear spin qubits facilitates atom-loss-detectable qubit measurements and $>90\%$ Rydberg decay detection. This enables mid-circuit and delayed erasure detection, yielding an error-detected two-qubit gate fidelity of $99.78(4)\%$ in the metastable qubits. This error detection also enables Rydberg qubit evolution with an effective lifetime of $1.2(2)$ ms, enhancing the fidelity of the observed many-body dynamics. These results establish a versatile architecture that advances multiple fields of quantum information science while also establishing bridges between them.</p>

            <p>Quantum phenomena such as entanglement provide powerful resources for enhancing classical sensing. Here, we theoretically show that collective entanglement of spin qubits, arising from a condensation of particle-hole pairs, can strongly amplify transitions between ground and excited spin states, potentially improving signal contrast in optically detected magnetic resonance. This collective state exhibits an $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$ enhancement of the transition amplitude with respect to an applied microwave field, where $N$ is the number of entangled spin qubits. We computationally realize this amplification using an ensemble of $N$ triplet spins with magnetic dipole interactions, where the largest transition amplitudes occur at geometries for which the condensation of particle-hole pairs is strongest. This effect, robust to noise, originates from the concentration of entanglement into a single collective mode, reflected in a large eigenvalue of the particle-hole reduced density matrix -- an entanglement witness of condensation analogous to off-diagonal long-range order, though realized here in a finite system. These results offer a design principle for quantum sensors that exploit condensation-inspired entanglement to boost sensitivity in spin-based platforms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michela Ignoti, Claudia Frugiuele, Matteo G. A. Paris, Marco G. Genoni</p>
            <p>The precise measurement of the leptonic CP-violating phase $\delta_{CP}$ remains one of the major open challenges in neutrino physics, as current experiments achieve only very limited accuracy. We address this issue through the lens of quantum estimation theory. A distinctive feature of neutrino oscillation experiments is that they cannot freely optimize the probe or measurement, since both are constrained by the production and detection of flavor eigenstates. We therefore examine whether the large uncertainty in $\delta_{CP}$ originates from intrinsic reasons, either of the neutrino quantum state or of flavor measurements, or if it instead stems from experimental limitations. By comparing quantum and classical Fisher information, we demonstrate that the limited sensitivity to $\delta_{CP}$ originates primarily from the information content of flavor measurements. Furthermore, we show that targeting the second oscillation maximum, as in the ESS$\nu$SB proposal, substantially enhances $\delta_{CP}$ information compared to experiments centered on the first maximum.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mikhail Zubarev</p>
            <p>Variational quantum algorithms face a fundamental trainability crisis: barren plateaus render optimization exponentially difficult as system size grows. While recent Lie algebraic theory precisely characterizes when and why these plateaus occur, no practical optimization method exists with finite-sample guarantees for navigating them. We present the sequential plateau-adaptive regime-testing algorithm (SPARTA), the first measurement-frugal scheduler that provides explicit, anytime-valid risk control for quantum optimization. Our approach integrates three components with rigorous statistical foundations: (i) a $\chi^2$-calibrated sequential test that distinguishes barren plateaus from informative regions using likelihood-ratio supermartingales; (ii) a probabilistic trust-region exploration strategy with one-sided acceptance to prevent false improvements under shot noise; and (iii) a theoretically-optimal exploitation phase that achieves the best attainable convergence rate. We prove geometric bounds on plateau exit times, linear convergence in informative basins, and show how Lie-algebraic variance proxies enhance test power without compromising statistical calibration.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Josef Soucek, Michael Petrov, Michal Gulka, Emilie Bourgeois, Milos Nesladek</p>
            <p>We report on a mathematical model of the photoelectric response of NV colour centres in diamond, that can be employed for sensing and quantum science information applications. Although the model applies to NV centre in diamond, it can be applied with small modifications to other semiconducting solid state qubits. In our model, we include the drift and collection of charge carriers as well as the presence of other defects via generation and recombination dynamics. Though the photoluminescence readout and the associated dynamics of the NV defect has been extensively studied experimentally and theoretically, so far, there has been no precise model for photocurrent readout, including these effects. In our description, we use a multilevel-level system including mS=0, mS=+-1 ground and excited states, singlet state and the NV0 neutral state. Also, the presence of substitutional nitrogen (NS), which for example determines the spin coherence via the paramagnetic spin bath, is discussed together with presence of acceptor defects. We model the time-dependent occupation of all electronic sublevels and also consider the electronic charge transport from the Boltzmann transport equation, leading to information about the charge state transitions and recombination dynamics. ODMR and PDMR response as well as their quantum efficiencies, are calculated. On this basis, we determine an optimal parameter space for qubit operations, including the highest spin contrast and especially relate those to NS presence. The model is confirmed experimentally and can become a useful tool for optimisation of the performance of NV qubit photoelectric readout.</p>

            <h2>Berry's phase on photonic quantum computers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Steven Abel, Iwo Wasek, Simon Williams</p>
            <p>We formulate a continuous-variable quantum computing (CVQC) algorithm to study Berry's phase on photonic quantum computers. We demonstrate that CVQC allows the simulation of charged particles with orbital angular momentum under the influence of an adiabatically changing $\vec{B}$ field. Although formulated entirely in the CVQC setting, our construction uses only passive linear-optical operations (beam splitters and phase shifts), which act identically in single-photon photonic architectures. This enables experimental realisation on the Quandella Ascella platform, where we observe the Berry's phase phenomenon with interferometric measurement. We also generalise the framework to more rapid non-adiabatic evolution. By concatenating Aharonov-Anandan cycles for opposing magnetic fields we demonstrate that one can engineer a circuit in which dynamical phases and leading non-geometric errors cancel by symmetry, leaving the intrinsically robust geometric phase contribution.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emanuele Tumbiolo, Lorenzo Maccone, Chiara Macchiavello, Matteo G.A. Paris, Giacomo Guarnieri</p>
            <p>Quantum thermometry aims at determining temperature with ultimate precision in the quantum regime. Standard equilibrium approaches, limited by the Quantum Fisher Information given by static energy fluctuations, lose sensitivity outside a fixed temperature window. Non-equilibrium strategies have therefore been recently proposed to overcome these limits, but their advantages are typically model-dependent or tailored for a specific purpose. This Letter establishes a general, model-independent result showing that any temperature-dependent unitary driving applied to a thermalized probe enhances its quantum Fisher information with respect to its equilibrium value. Such information gain is expressed analytically through a positive semi-definite kernel of information currents that quantify the flow of statistical distinguishability. Our results are benchmarked on a driven spin-$1/2$ thermometer, furthermore showing that resonant modulations remarkably restore the quadratic-in-time scaling of the Fisher information and allow to shift the sensitivity peak across arbitrary temperature ranges. Our findings identify external unitary control as a universal resource for precision metrology and pave the way for future implementations in quantum sensing.</p>

            <h2>Entropy Flow and Exceptional-Point Structure in Two-Mode Squeezed-Bath Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eric R. Bittner</p>
            <p>Squeezed reservoirs provide a powerful means of engineering nonclassical noise and controlling irreversible dynamics in open quantum systems. Here we develop a comprehensive analysis of two coupled harmonic oscillators driven by independent squeezed baths, focusing on the emergence of coherence-driven entropy flow and the structure of exceptional points (EPs) in the corresponding Lindblad dynamics. Working entirely within the Gaussian formalism, we derive closed-form evolution equations for the covariance matrix and show that squeezing induces entropy generation only at *second order* in the anomalous correlations, a nonlinear mechanism absent in thermal environments. This entropy flow is accompanied by a rich non-Hermitian structure: by scanning the squeezing parameters we uncover a characteristic "exceptional-point fan" in the (M1, M2) plane, which separates a narrow PT-unbroken region of oscillatory dynamics from broad PT-broken sectors in which one normal mode becomes purely overdamped. This geometric organization of EPs reveals that PT symmetry survives only when the two reservoirs squeeze opposite quadratures, and is generically broken for in-phase squeezing. Our analysis establishes squeezed reservoirs as a natural setting where information-bearing noise drives irreversible behavior through coherent pathways, and lays the groundwork for experimentally accessible probes of entropy flow and critical mode behavior in more complex open systems.</p>

            <p>Harnessing rare-earth ions in oxides for quantum networks requires integration with bright emitters in III-V semiconductors, but local disorder and interfacial noise limit their optical coherence. Here, we investigate the microscopic origins of the ensemble spectrum in Er$^{3+}$:TiO$_2$ epitaxial thin films on GaAs and GaSb substrates. Ab initio calculations combined with noise-Hamiltonian modeling and Monte Carlo simulations quantify the effects of interfacial and bulk spin noise and local strain on erbium crystal-field energies and inhomogeneous linewidths. Photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy reveals that Er$^{3+}$ ions positioned at increasing distances from the III-V/oxide interface produce a systematic blue shift of the $Y_1\rightarrow Z_1$ transition, consistent with strain relaxation predicted by theory. Thermal annealing produces a compensating redshift and linewidth narrowing, isolating the roles of oxygen-vacancy and gallium-diffusion noise. These results provide microscopic insight into disorder-driven decoherence, offering pathways for precise control of hybrid quantum systems for scalable quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>We investigate photon tunneling in a pair of coupled inverted circular split-ring microwave resonators with four discrete chiral orientations. By varying the spacing between the resonators, we observe strong modulation of the transmission spectra, including mode splitting, interference effects, and the formation of dark states. Measurements on fabricated devices show clear signatures of hybridization that depend on both chirality and proximity, and these results are consistent with full-wave electromagnetic simulations. To describe the observed behavior, we develop a circuit quantum electrodynamics model that captures the dependence of the coupling strength on geometry and the reversal of its sign. Although the experimental excitation is classical, the system reproduces features expected from two quantized harmonic oscillators, providing a classical analogue of a chiral quantum hybrid platform. The ability to control photon tunneling through structural design and excitation parameters suggests potential applications in reconfigurable photonic devices, quantum communication, chiral sensing, and polarization-selective signal processing.</p>

            <p>Quantum sensors based on the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond are leading platforms for high-sensitivity magnetometry with nanometer-scale resolution. State-of-the-art implementations, however, typically rely on bulky free-space optics or sacrifice spatial resolution to achieve high sensitivities. Here, we realize an integrated platform that overcomes this trade-off by fabricating monolithic whispering-gallery-mode cavities from a diamond chip containing a high density of NV centers and by evanescently coupling excitation to and photoluminescence from the cavity using a tapered optical fiber. Employing a lock-in-amplified Ramsey magnetometry scheme, we achieve a photon-shot-noise-limited DC sensitivity of $58\,\text{nT}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ -- the best sensitivity reported to date for a nanofabricated cavity-based magnetometer. The microscopic cavity size enables sub-micrometer-scale spatial resolution and low-power operation, while fiber-coupling provides a path to scalable on-chip integration. Arrays of such sensors could enable NV-NMR spectroscopy of sub-nanoliter samples, new magnetic-gradient imaging architectures, and compact biosensing platforms.</p>

            <p>We propose a scheme to manipulate the Goos-Hänchen shift (GHS) of a reflected probe field in a non-Hermitian cavity magnomechanical system. The platform consists of a yttrium-iron-garnet sphere coupled to a microwave cavity, where a strong microwave drive pumps the magnon mode and a weak field probes the cavity. The traveling field's interaction with the magnon induces gain, yielding non-Hermitian dynamics. When the traveling field is oriented at $\pi/2$ relative to the cavity's $x$-axis, the system realizes $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry; eigenvalue analysis reveals a third-order exceptional point ($\mathrm{EP}_3$) at a tunable effective magnon-photon coupling. Under balanced gain-loss and finite effective magnomechanical coupling, we demonstrate coherent control of the GHS by steering the system across the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric transition and through $\mathrm{EP}_3$ via the effective magnon-photon coupling, enabling pronounced enhancement or suppression of the lateral shift. Furthermore, we show that without effective magnomechanical coupling, the system exhibits a second-order exceptional point ($\mathrm{EP}_2$) with a distinct GHS phase transition. This phase transition vanishes when the effective magnomechanical coupling exceeds a parametric threshold, where strong absorption at resonance suppresses the GHS. We also identify the intracavity length as an additional control parameter for precise shift tuning. Notably, the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric configuration yields substantially larger GHS than its Hermitian counterpart. These results advance non-Hermitian magnomechanics and open a route to GHS-based microwave components for quantum switching and precision sensing.</p>

            <p>Estimating the ground-state energy of Hamiltonians is a fundamental task for which it is believed that quantum computers can be helpful. Several approaches have been proposed toward this goal, including algorithms based on quantum phase estimation and hybrid quantum-classical optimizers involving parameterized quantum circuits, the latter falling under the umbrella of the variational quantum eigensolver. Here, we analyze the performance of quantum Boltzmann machines for this task, which is a less explored ansatz based on parameterized thermal states and which is not known to suffer from the barren-plateau problem. We delineate a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for this task and rigorously prove that it converges to an $\varepsilon$-approximate stationary point of the energy function optimized over parameter space, while using a number of parameterized-thermal-state samples that is polynomial in $\varepsilon^{-1}$, the number of parameters, and the norm of the Hamiltonian being optimized. Our algorithm estimates the gradient of the energy function efficiently by means of a quantum circuit construction that combines classical random sampling, Hamiltonian simulation, and the Hadamard test. Additionally, supporting our main claims are calculations of the gradient and Hessian of the energy function, as well as an upper bound on the matrix elements of the latter that is used in the convergence analysis.</p>

            <p>Quantum machine learning research has expanded rapidly due to potential computational advantages over classical methods. Angle encoding has emerged as a popular choice as feature map (FM) for embedding classical data into quantum models due to its simplicity and natural generation of truncated Fourier series, providing universal function approximation capabilities. Efficient FMs within quantum circuits can exploit exponential scaling of Fourier frequencies, with multi-dimensional inputs introducing additional exponential growth through mixed-frequency terms. Despite this promising expressive capability, practical implementation faces significant challenges. Through controlled experiments with white-box target functions, we demonstrate that training failures can occur even when all relevant frequencies are theoretically accessible. We illustrate how two primary known causes lead to unsuccessful optimization: insufficient trainable parameters relative to the model's frequency content, and limitations imposed by the ansatz's dynamic lie algebra dimension, but also uncover an additional parameter burden: the necessity of controlling non-unique frequencies within the model. To address this, we propose near-zero weight initialization to suppress unnecessary duplicate frequencies. For target functions with a priori frequency knowledge, we introduce frequency selection as a practical solution that reduces parameter requirements and mitigates the exponential growth that would otherwise render problems intractable due to parameter insufficiency. Our frequency selection approach achieved near-optimal performance (median $R^2 \approx 0.95$) with 78\% of the parameters needed by the best standard approach in 10 randomly chosen target functions.</p>

These results highlight HUBO as a practical alternative for current and near-term devices.

This effect, robust to noise, originates from the concentration of entanglement into a single collective mode, reflected in a large eigenvalue of the particle-hole reduced density matrix -- an entanglement witness of condensation analogous to off-diagonal long-range order, though realized here in a finite system. These results offer a design principle for quantum sensors that exploit condensation-inspired entanglement to boost sensitivity in spin-based platforms.</p>

            <h2>Certifying Majorana Fermions with Elegant-Like Bell Inequalities and a New Self-Testing Equivalence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Patryk Michalski, Arturo Konderak, Wojciech Bruzda, Remigiusz Augusiak</p>
            <p>Bell inequalities provide a fundamental tool for probing nonlocal correlations, yet their quantum bound, that is, the maximal value attainable through quantum strategies, is rarely accessible analytically. In this work, we introduce a general construction of Bell inequalities for which this bound can be computed exactly. Our framework generalizes both the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt and Gisin's elegant inequalities, yielding Bell expressions maximally violated by any number of pairwise anticommuting Clifford observables together with the corresponding maximally entangled state. Under suitable assumptions, our inequalities also enable the device-independent certification of Majorana fermions, understood as multiqubit realizations of Clifford algebra generators. Importantly, we identify an additional equivalence that must be incorporated into the definition of self-testing beyond invariance under local isometries and transposition. This equivalence arises from partial transposition applied to the shared state and to the measurements, which in specific cases leaves all observed correlations unchanged.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Algorithm for Estimating Gibbs Free Energy and Entropy via Energy Derivatives</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shangjie Guo, Corneliu Buda, Nathan Wiebe</p>
            <p>Estimating vibrational entropy is a significant challenge in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics due to its reliance on quantum mechanical properties. This paper introduces a quantum algorithm designed to estimate vibrational entropy via energy derivatives. Our approach block encodes the exact expression for the second derivative of the energy and uses quantum linear systems algorithms to deal with the reciprocal powers of the gaps that appear in the expression. We further show that if prior knowledge about the values of the second derivative is used then our algorithm can $\epsilon$-approximate the entropy using a number of queries that scales with the condition number $\kappa$, the temperature $T$, error tolerance $\epsilon$ and an analogue of the partition function $\mathcal{Z}$, as $\widetilde{O}\left(\frac{\mathcal{Z}\kappa^2 }{\epsilon T}\right)$. We show that if sufficient prior knowledge is given about the second derivative then the query scales quadratically better than these results. This shows that, under reasonable assumptions of the temperature and a quantum computer can be used to compute the vibrational contributions to the entropy faster than analogous classical algorithms would be capable of. Our findings highlight the potential of quantum algorithms to enhance the prediction of thermodynamic properties, paving the way for advancements in fields such as material science, molecular biology, and chemical engineering.</p>

            <p>Quantum batteries (QBs) have emerged as promising candidates capable of outperforming classical counterparts by utilizing entangled operators. Spin chains, in particular, exhibit unique {charging} properties across diverse settings. Here, we introduce the kicked-Ising model as a QB and analytically characterize its charging dynamics within the self-dual operator regime, valid for arbitrary system sizes and Floquet cycles. Using Clifford quantum cellular automata and momentum-space Floquet analysis with the Cayley-Hamilton theorem, we obtain exact expressions for energy injection, uncovering the influence of boundary conditions and spin-chain parity on charging performance. The kicked-Ising QB achieves maximal charging while exhibiting remarkable robustness against disorder. We further propose an intensified protocol within a fixed time window that enables faster and more efficient energy injection, while non-uniform kick schedules enhance experimental flexibility. Spin correlators analysis further shows that low-frequency driving boosts energy injection, highlighting a clear connection between charging, scrambling, and kick-induced delocalization. Our theoretical framework are supported by tensor-network simulations and finally verified on IBM quantum hardware. Accounting for platform-specific constraints, we demonstrate that the kicked-Ising QB offers a scalable, disorder-resilient protocol and testbed to assess quantum platforms.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement Generation via Hamiltonian Dynamics Having Limited Resources</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Moein Naseri</p>
            <p>We investigate the fundamental limits of entanglement generation under bipartite Hamiltonian dynamics when only finite physical resources-specifically, bounded energy variance-are available. Using the relative entropy of entanglement, we derive a closed analytical expression for the instantaneous entanglement generation rate for arbitrary pure states and Hamiltonians expressed in the Schmidt basis. We find that constraints based solely on the mean energy of the Hamiltonian are insufficient to bound the entanglement generation rate, whereas imposing a variance constraint ensures a finite and well-defined maximum. We fully characterize the Hamiltonians that achieve this optimal rate, establishing a direct relation between their imaginary components in the Schmidt basis and the structure of the optimal initial states. For systems without ancillas, we obtain a closed-form expression for the maximal rate in terms of the surprisal variance of the Schmidt coefficients and identify the family of optimal states and Hamiltonians. We further extend our analysis to scenarios where Alice and Bob may employ local ancillary systems: using a matrix-analytic framework and a refined description of the Hamiltonians allowed by the physical constraints, we derive an explicit optimization formula and characterize the attainable enhancement in entanglement generation.</p>

We apply the algorithm to quantum chemistry, and in particular, to the potential energy curve calculations of the model problem of the hydrogen molecule in the split valence basis. We compare the number of qudits and the number of gates required between qubit and qutrit HHL implementations. In general, we find that for a fixed precision, the qutrit HHL circuit requires fewer number of qudits and comparable number of two-qudit gates than its qubit counterpart.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vibin Abraham, Priyabrata Senapati, Himadri Pathak, Bo Peng</p>
            <p>Accurately resolving many-body satellite features in molecular core-level spectra requires theoretical approaches that capture electron correlation both efficiently and systematically. The recently developed time-dependent double coupled-cluster (TD-dCC) ansatz achieves this by combining correlation effects from the N- and (N-1)-electron sectors, but its exact formulation remains computationally demanding. Here we introduce a hierarchy of cost-effective approximate TD-dCC ansatzes derived from truncated Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansions, which preserve a single-similarity-transformation structure while retaining the essential correlation diagrams responsible for satellite formation. We further develop a detailed component analysis that isolates hole-mediated excitation pathways, which are correlated processes arising from the coupling between ground-state and ionized-state amplitudes. We use it to interpret quasiparticle and satellite features across the hierarchy. Applications to the single-impurity Anderson model and molecular systems (H2O and CH4) demonstrate that the approximate TD-dCC methods closely and efficiently reproduce exact many-body spectral features and quasiparticle weights. In parallel, we construct a fault-tolerant quantum signal processing algorithm for the core-hole Green's function, providing a scalable quantum route for simulating correlated core-level dynamics. Together, these developments establish complementary classical and quantum methodologies for quantitative, many-body-accurate core spectroscopy.</p>

These capabilities open avenues to address scalability challenges in neutral-atom quantum computers and simulators, enabling fast optical readout, efficient and subwavelength non-diffracting interaction zones, and genuine compatibility with integrated solid-state photon sources, detectors, and stop-band modulators. Beyond controllable quantum matter, the platform also enables in-situ imaging of evanescent fields of light and nanoscale structures, including prospects for three-dimensional scanning microscopy with non-invasive single-atom probes for quantum sensing applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Walter Rieck, Anton Frisk Kockum, Guangze Chen</p>
            <p>Bound states in the continuum (BICs) are spatially localized modes embedded in the spectrum of extended states, typically stabilized by symmetry or interference. While extensively studied in single-particle and linear systems, the many-body regime of BICs remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that giant atoms, quantum emitters coupled nonlocally to structured waveguides, can host robust doublon BICs, i.e., two-photon bound states stabilized by destructive interference and interactions. We first analyze a driven two-photon emission process and show how doublon BICs arise and mediate decoherence-free interaction between distant atoms. We then demonstrate that these many-body BICs also emerge under natural, undriven dynamics via a virtual two-photon emission process in three-level giant atoms. Our results reveal an interference-based mechanism for stabilizing many-body localization in open quantum systems, with potential applications in quantum simulation, non-ergodic dynamics, and protected quantum information processing.</p>

            <p>We theoretically investigate a quantum battery architecture where two identical two-level atoms are charged by a cavity-magnomechanical system, which includes a microwave cavity, a magnon mode hosted in a YIG sphere, and phonon mode due to the deformation of the YIG sphere. The charging process relies on coherent energy exchange, where the atoms couple to the cavity, which in turn, it interacts with the magnon mode via a beam-splitter mechanism. By deriving the system Hamiltonian under the rotating-wave approximation and employing a Lindblad master equation to rigorously model dissipation, we analyze the complete dynamical evolution of the battery. Our study demonstrates that strong, resonant light-matter interactions are crucial for enhancing the key performance metrics: charging efficiency, stored energy, and ergotropy (extractable work). We systematically investigate the deleterious effects of detuning and decoherence, and critically, we uncover a non-trivial interplay between the system's coupling strengths. This reveals optimal operating regimes where constructive interference maximizes performance, while excessive coupling in specific channels can degrade it. Ultimately, our findings provide a quantitative framework for engineering high-efficiency quantum batteries in hybrid magnonic platforms, offering a design roadmap for future experimental realizations.</p>

            <p>The intriguing physical phenomena associated with exceptional points have established non-Hermitian physics as a frontier of modern research. Recent investigations have extended non-Hermitian physics into the fully quantum domain. However, existing studies predominantly concentrate on discrete-variable quantum systems, while non-Hermitian quantum effects in continuous-variable encoded systems remain largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate the exceptional structure for a driven-dissipative Kerr-cat qubit, realized with a Kerr nonlinear resonator. We find that the dissipation leads to a bidirectional jump between the two basis states of the cat qubit, which is in distinct contrast with the unidirectional jump associated with normal two-level systems. The competition between this jump and a single-photon drive gives arise to the emergence of third-order Liouvillian exceptional points (LEP3s), each corresponds to a crossing point of two lines of LEP2s. We further show that the LEP3 can exhibit the topological character of the Hamiltonian EP3s, which cannot be realized with a single qubit. Our work opens the possibility of realizing non-Hermitian phenomena with continuous-variable quantum systems.</p>

            <p>The following paper presents a holistic approach to the processing of entangled links within entanglement based quantum key distribution protocols, whose security relies on the Bell inequality. We investigate the interactions, and the collective impact, of the whole processing chain on the final secure key rate. This includes the quantum mechanical preprocessing in the form of entanglement distillation, processing of the entangled states via measurements and the necessary classical postprocessing based on the measurement results. Our investigations are based on the principle idea of the Eckert 1991 protocol and utilize the secret key capacity introduced by Devetak and Winter in 2005. Our results include a proof on what measurement bases need to be chosen to achieve this capacity for the case of Werner states. It also presents a new processing strategy and compares it with the most common one that can be found within the literature. Furthermore, it answers the question on how much entanglement distillation is optimal. By doing so we propose a unified formalism, describing the whole processing chain, that can be used to make quantitative statements on the relation between the quality and quantity of entangled but noisy quantum states used for generating secure keys.</p>

            <p>Until recently, attosecond optical spectroscopy and quantum optics evolved along non-overlapping directions. In attosecond science, attosecond pulses have been regarded as classical waves, applied to probe electron dynamics on their natural time scale. Here, we transfer fundamental concepts of quantum optics into attosecond physics, enabling control of both the properties of the XUV attosecond pulses and the quantum fluctuations of matter on attosecond time scales. By combining bright squeezed vacuum (BSV) with a strong laser field to drive high-harmonic generation, we transfer the quantum properties of the BSV onto the resulting XUV attosecond pulses. Applying advanced attosecond interferometry, we reconstruct the quantum state of the XUV high harmonics and their associated attosecond pulses with attosecond precision. Finally, we resolve the squeezing of the electron's wavepacket during one of the most fundamental strong-field phenomena - field induced tunneling. The ability to measure and control quantum correlations in both electrons and XUV attosecond pulses establishes a foundation for attosecond quantum electrodynamics, manipulating the quantum state of electrons and photons with sub-cycle precision.</p>

            <h2>Quantum machine learning for efficient reduced order modelling of turbulent flows</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Han Li, Yutong Lou, Dunhui Xiao</p>
            <p>Accurately predicting turbulent flows remains a central challenge in fluid dynamics due to their high dimensionality and intrinsic nonlinearity. Recent developments in quantum algorithms and machine learning offer new opportunities for overcoming the computational barriers inherent in turbulence modeling. Here we present a new hybrid quantum-classical framework that enables faster-than-real-time turbulence prediction by integrating machine learning, quantum computation, and fluid dynamics modeling, in particular, the reduced-order modeling. The novel framework combines quantum proper orthogonal decomposition (QPOD) with a quantum-enhanced deep kernel learning (QDKL) approach. QPOD employs quantum circuits to perform efficient eigenvalue decomposition for low-rank flow reconstruction, while QDKL exploits quantum entanglement and nonlinear mappings to enhance kernel expressivity and dynamic prediction accuracy. The new method is demonstrated on three benchmark turbulent flows, our architecture achieves significantly improved predictive accuracy at reduced model ranks, with training speeds up to 10 times faster and parameter counts reduced by a factor of 1/N compared to classical counterparts, where N is the input dimensionality. Although constrained by current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware, our results demonstrate the potential of quantum machine learning to transform turbulence simulation and lay a solid foundation for scalable, real-time quantum fluid modeling in future quantum computers.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tengyu Ai, Qi Bi, Yuxin He, Jia Liu, Xiao-Ping Wang</p>
            <p>We investigate whether collider experiments can reach the quantum limit of precision, defined by the quantum Fisher information (QFI), using only classical observables such as particle momenta. As a case study, we focus on the $\tau^+\tau^-$ system and the decay channel $\tau \to \pi \nu$, which offers maximal spin-analyzing power and renders the decay a projective measurement. We develop a general framework to determine when collider measurements can, in principle, saturate the QFI in an entangled biparticle system, and this framework extends naturally to other such systems. Within this framework, QFI saturation occurs if and only if the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD) commutes with a complete set of orthonormal separable projectors associated with collider-accessible measurements. This separability condition, reflecting the independence of decay amplitudes, is highly nontrivial. To meet this condition, a key requirement is that the spin density matrix be rank-deficient, allowing the SLD sufficient freedom. We show that the classical Fisher information asymptotically saturates the QFI for magnetic dipole moments and CP-violating Higgs interactions in selected phase-space regions, but not for electric dipole moments. These results bridge quantum metrology and collider physics, providing a systematic method to identify quantum-optimal sensitivity in collider experiments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daigo Oue, Mário G. Silveirinha</p>
            <p>Here, we demonstrate that vacuum fluctuations can induce lateral forces on a small particle positioned near a translation-invariant uniform non-Hermitian substrate with chiral gain. This type of non-Hermitian response can be engineered by biasing a low-symmetry conductor with a static electric field and is rooted in the quantum geometry of the material through the Berry curvature dipole. The chiral-gain material acts as an active medium for a particular circular polarisation handedness, while serving as a passive, dissipative medium for the other polarisation handedness. Owing to the nonreciprocity and gain characteristics, momentum is continuously exchanged in a preferred direction parallel to the surface between the test particle and the surrounding electromagnetic field, giving rise to lateral forces. Interestingly, the force can be viewed as a fluctuation-induced drag analogous to a Hall force. Indeed, although the gain is driven by an electric current, the resulting force acts perpendicular to the bias -- unlike conventional current-drag effects. This effect stems from the skewed propagation characteristics of surface modes and gain-momentum locking. Our theory reveals a Hall-like asymmetry in the field correlations and establishes a novel link between quantum geometry and fluctuation-induced phenomena, offering new possibilities for nanoscale control via tailored electromagnetic environments.</p>

            <p>Ergodic isolated quantum many-body systems satisfy the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), i.e., the expectation values of local observables in the system's eigenstates approach the predictions of the microcanonical ensemble. However, the ETH does not specify what happens to expectation values of local observables within an energy window when the average over disorder realizations is taken. As a result, the expectation values of local observables can be distributed over a relatively wide interval and may exhibit nontrivial structure, as shown in [Phys. Rev. B \textbf{104}, 214201 (2021)] for a quasiperiodic disordered system for site-resolved magnetization. We argue that the non-Gaussian form of this distribution may \textit{falsely} suggest non-ergodicity and a breakdown of ETH. By considering various types of disorder, we find that the functional forms of the distributions of matrix elements of the site-resolved magnetization operator mirror the distribution of the onsite disorder. We argue that this distribution is a direct consequence of the local observable having a finite overlap with moments of the Hamiltonian. We then demonstrate how to adjust the energy window when analyzing expectation values of local observables in disordered quantum many-body systems to correctly assess the system's adherence to ETH, and provide a link between the distribution of expectation values in eigenstates and the outcomes of quench experiments.</p>

            <p>Vacuum cavity control of quantum materials is the engineering of quantum materials systems through electromagnetic zero-point fluctuations. In this work we articulate a generic mechanism for vacuum optical control of correlated electronic order: Casimir control, where the zero-point energy of the electromagnetic continuum, the Casimir energy, depends on the properties of the material system. To assess the experimental viability of this mechanism we focus on the Casimir stabilization of fluctuating nematic order. In nematic Fermi liquids, different orientations of the electronic order are often energetically degenerate. Thus, while local domains of fixed orientation may form, thermal disordering inhibits long range order. By engineering the electromagnetic environment of the electronic system, however, we show that the Casimir energy can be used as a tool to preferentially stabilize particular orientations of the nematic order. As a concrete example, we examine the interplay between a birefringent crystal -- which sources an anisotropic electromagnetic environment -- and a quantum Hall stripe system, an archetypal nematic Fermi fluid. We show that for experimentally feasible setups, the anisotropy induced by the orientation dependent Casimir energy can be $10^4$ times larger than other mechanisms known to stabilize quantum Hall stripes. This finding convincingly implies that our setting may be realized with currently available experimental technology. Having demonstrated that the Casimir energy can be used to stabilize fluctuating nematic order, we close by discussing the implications for recent terahertz cavity experiments on quantum Hall stripes, as well as pave the road towards broader Casimir control of competing correlated electronic phases.</p>

            <p>Phase transitions in one-dimensional lattice systems are well established and have been extensively studied within both Hermitian and non-Hermitian frameworks. In this work, we extend this understanding to a more general setting by investigating localization and delocalization transitions and the behavior of the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) using a tight-binding model on a generalized random graph lattice. Our model incorporates three key parameters, asymmetric hopping $\Delta$, on-site disorder $W$, and a random long-range coupling $p$ that together define the underlying random graph structure. By varying $p$, $\Delta$, and the disorder strength, we explore the interplay between topology, randomness, and non-Hermiticity in determining localization properties. Our results show a strong competition between skin effect driven and Anderson driven localizations across parameter regimes. Notably, even in the presence of strong disorder, skin effect driven localization coexists with Anderson-driven localization. We further discuss the relevance of these results to machine-learning architectures and information propagation in complex networks and other real-world problems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nothando Khumalo, Aman Mehta, William Munizzi, Prineha Narang</p>
            <p>We present a machine learning framework to study the dynamics of entropy vectors and quantum resources, including entanglement and magic, focusing on violations of entropy inequalities. Using a reinforcement learning agent formulated as a Markov decision process, we identify quantum circuits that optimally navigate the entropy vector space to generate violations of Ingleton's inequality. We complement this approach with a classical optimization algorithm to produce arbitrary numbers of Ingleton-violating states, with tunable degrees of violation, and empirically determine the maximal attainable violation for Ingleton's inequality. Our analysis reveals characteristic patterns of quantum resources that accompany Ingleton violation. A comprehensive statistical analysis shows that Ingleton-violating states occupy sharply-defined, isolated regions of the Hilbert space, and are extremely rare. Together, these results establish a unified computational toolkit for studying entropy vector dynamics, tracking quantum resource evolution, and engineering circuits with controlled information-theoretic features.</p>

            <p>The development of nonlinear and frequency-tunable superconducting microwave circuits for operation in large magnetic fields is of high relevance for hybrid quantum systems such as spin resonance spectrometers, microwave quantum magnonics, dark matter axion detectors or flux-mediated optomechanics. With these exciting perspectives in mind, we investigate niobium-based circuits with integrated nano-constriction quantum interferometers in magnetic in-plane fields up to several hundred mT. Our experiments reveal an unexpected and pronounced field-induced asymmetry in the bias-flux response of the circuits, which is demonstrated to originate from a field-induced Josephson-diode effect within the nano-constrictions and which considerably enhances the circuit figures of merit in a magnetic field. An intuitive macroscopic Josephson-diode model attributes the effect to inhomogeneous constriction properties and provides us with the diode current-phase relation as a function of the in-plane field. Finally, we demonstrate that in the diode-state the circuit Kerr nonlinearity is bimodal in frequency, not only eliminating alternative explanations for the bias-flux-asymmetries but also being potentially useful for quantum circuit applications. Overall, our report underlines that niobium nano-constriction circuits belong to the most promising candidates for high-field hybrid quantum systems and reveals the untapped potential of combining Josephson nano-diodes with microwave quantum circuits.</p>

            <h2>Hybrid-spin decoupling for noise-resilient DC quantum sensing</h2>

            <p>The excellent sensitivities of quantum sensors are a double-edged sword: minuscule quantities can be observed, but any undesired signal acts as noise. This is challenging when detecting quantities that are obscured by such noise. Decoupling sequences improve coherence times and hence sensitivities, though only AC signals in narrow frequency bands are distinguishable. Alternatively, comagnetometers operate gaseous spin mixtures at high temperatures in the self-compensating regime to counteract slowly varying noise. These are applied with great success in various exotic spin-interaction searches. Here, we propose a method that decouples specific DC fields from DC and AC magnetic noise. It requires any spin cluster where the effect on each individual spin is different for the target field and local magnetic fields, which allows for a different approach compared to comagnetometers. The presented method has several key advantages, including an orders-of-magnitude increase in noise frequencies to which we are resistant. We explore electron-spin nuclear-spin pairs in nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond, with a focus on their merit for light dark-matter searches. Other applications include gradient sensing, quantum memory, and gyroscopes.</p>

            <h2>Adiabatic reverse annealing is robust to low-temperature decoherence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> An Le, Christopher L. Baldwin</p>
            <p>Adiabatic reverse annealing (ARA) is an improvement to conventional quantum annealing (QA) that uses an initial guess at the desired ground state to circumvent problematic phase transitions. Despite encouraging results in the closed-system setting, Ref. [1] has suggested on the basis of numerical simulations that ARA may lose its advantage in the presence of decoherence. Here, we revisit this problem from a more analytical perspective. Using the $p$-spin model as a solvable example, together with the adiabatic master equation to describe the effects of the environment (valid at weak coupling), we show that ARA can in fact succeed in open systems but that the temperature of the environment plays a key role. We first demonstrate that, in the adiabatic limit, the system will follow the instantaneous equilibrium state as long as the protocol does not pass through any (finite-temperature) phase transitions. Given this, there are two distinct mechanisms by which ARA can break down at high temperature: either there are no paths that avoid transitions, or the equilibrium state itself is disordered. When the temperature is sufficiently low that neither of these occur, then ARA succeeds. Remarkably, there are even situations in which the environment benefits ARA: we find parameter values for which no transition-avoiding paths exist at zero temperature but such paths appear at non-zero temperature.</p>

Our method provides a new state of the art for synthesizing typical unitary matrices from $SU(2^n)$ for $n=3, 4, 5$, and we extend it to the subgroups $SO(2^n)$ and $Sp^\ast(2^n)$. We complement this numerical method by a partial proof, which hinges on an open conjecture that relates universality of an ansatz to it having full Jacobian rank almost everywhere.</p>

However, gaps remain between abstract quantum algorithmic development and practical applications in computational sciences. In this Perspective article, we propose several properties that scalable quantum computational science methods should possess. We further discuss how block-encodings and polynomial transformations can potentially serve as a unified framework with the desired properties. We present recent advancements on these topics including construction and assembly of block-encodings, and various generalizations of quantum signal processing (QSP) algorithms to perform polynomial transformations. We also highlight the scalability of QSP methods on parallel and distributed quantum architectures. Promising applications in simulation and observable estimation in chemistry, physics, and optimization problems are presented. We hope this Perspective serves as a gentle introduction of state-of-the-art quantum algorithms to the computational science community, and inspires future development on scalable quantum computational science methodologies that bridge theory and practice.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Iris Ulčakar, Rustem Sharipov, Gianluca Lagnese, Zala Lenarčič</p>
            <p>Observation of the quantum Mpemba effect has spurred much interest in its enabling conditions and its relation to the classical counterpart. Here, we consider weakly open many-body quantum systems initialized in different thermal states and examine when the initially farther state relaxes to the (non-equilibrium) steady state faster. We claim that the number of conserved quantities in the unitary part plays a crucial role: the Mpemba effect is possible only when the Hamiltonian commutes with other extensive operators or is integrable. The reason lies in the dynamical evolution happening in spaces of different dimensions. When energy is the only approximately conserved quantity, dissipation pushes the dynamics within a single-parameter manifold of different thermal states. In contrast, for Hamiltonians with several conserved quantities, the dynamics drift in the multi-dimensional space of generalized Gibbs ensembles, whose distance to the steady state is less trivial. We provide numerical results for large system sizes using tensor networks and free-fermion techniques, thereby supporting our claim.</p>

            <p>The aim of a quantum network is to enable the generation of end-to-end entangled links between end nodes of the network, so that they can execute quantum network applications. To facilitate this, it is desirable to have robust control of the network in order to be able to provide a reliable service to the end nodes.

This control architecture enables quantum network applications to be executed on end nodes running a modern operating system such as QNodeOS arXiv:2407.18306. In that work, we performed an evaluation of our architecture based on a proof-of-concept implementation. In the course of performing this evaluation, we discovered many outstanding questions and challenges. These relate not only to implementing our specific control architecture, but also to the design of any quantum network control architecture. Here, we describe some outstanding questions and challenges, discuss possible solutions, and identify where existing protocols require adaptation or new protocols must be designed.</p>

            <p>As quantum simulators are scaled up to larger system sizes and lower noise rates, non-Markovian noise channels are expected to become dominant. While provably efficient protocols for Markovian models of quantum simulators, either closed system models (described by a Hamiltonian) or open system models (described by a Lindbladian), have been developed, it remains less well understood whether similar protocols for non-Markovian models exist. In this paper, we consider geometrically local lattice models with both quantum and classical non-Markovian noise and show that, under a Gaussian assumption on the noise, we can learn the noise with sample complexity scaling logarithmically with the system size. Our protocol requires preparing the simulator qubits initially in a product state, introducing a layer of single-qubit Clifford gates and measuring product observables.</p>

            <p>In this thesis, we explore the intersection of two fundamental subfields of quantum information theory: quantum coherence and contextuality. Despite their apparent differences, both areas address key issues relevant to the foundations and applications of quantum theory. By developing a novel graph-theoretic approach, extending a framework recently introduced by Galvão and Brod (Phys. Rev.

Our key contributions include: the development of a graph-theoretic framework for generating coherence and contextuality witnesses; a formal mapping between the inequalities that follows from the work by Galvão and Brod to existing noncontextuality inequalities; the conceptualization of a relational form of quantum coherence; a proof of contextual advantage for the task of quantum interrogation; and the discovery of an infinite family of coherence witnesses that also require quantum states in Hilbert spaces of specific dimensions.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Data Learning of Topological-to-Ferromagnetic Phase Transitions in the 2+1D Toric Code Loop Gas Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shamminuj Aktar, Rishabh Bhardwaj, Andreas Bärtschi, Tanmoy Bhattacharya, Stephan Eidenbenz</p>
            <p>Quantum data learning (QDL) provides a framework for extracting physical insights directly from quantum states, bypassing the need for any identification of the classical observable of the theory. A central challenge in many-body physics is that the identity of quantum phases, especially those with topological order, are often inaccessible through local observables or simple symmetry-breaking diagnostics. Here, we apply QDL techniques to the 2+1-dimensional toric-code loop-gas model in a magnetic field. Ground states are generated across multiple lattice sizes using a parametrized loop-gas circuit (PLGC) with a variational quantum-eigensolver (VQE) approach. We then train a quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) across the full field-parameter range to perform phase classification and capture the overall phase structure. We also employ a physics-aware training protocol that excludes the near-critical region (0.2 <= x <= 0.4)) around (x_c = 0.25), the phase-transition point estimated by quantum Monte Carlo, reserving this window for testing to evaluate the ability of the model to learn the phase transition. In parallel, we implement an unsupervised quantum k-means method based on state overlaps, which partitions the dataset into two phases without prior labeling. Our supervised QDL approach recovers the phase structure and accurately locates the phase transition, in close agreement with previously reported values; the unsupervised QDL approach recovers the phase structure and locates the phase transition with a small offset as expected in finite volumes; both QDL methods outperform classical alternatives. These findings establish QDL as an effective framework for characterizing topological quantum matter, studying finite volume effects, and probing phase diagrams of higher-dimensional systems.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Optical Simulator for Unruh-DeWitt Detector Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tai Hyun Yoon</p>
            <p>We present a quantum-optical platform for simulating relativistic detector-field interactions using entangled nonlinear biphoton sources (ENBSs), realized through phase-controlled single-photon frequency-comb (SPFC) sources. By mapping the dynamical evolution of this system onto the Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detector model, we show that signal-mode excitations emulate detector transitions driven by vacuum fluctuations, while coherently seeded idler modes act as an effective quantum field. This correspondence enables tabletop exploration of Unruh-like excitation, coherence harvesting, and field-induced entanglement. We derive the effective interaction Hamiltonian and Lindblad master equation for two coherently seeded ENBS units and obtain analytical solutions for the signal photon number \(N_{\rm sig}(t)\) and second-order correlation function \(g^{(2)}(0;t)\). Numerical simulations confirm that phase-dependent biphoton dynamics reproduce UDW-type behavior, including tunable excitation and quantum correlations. The output signal state exhibits controllable fidelity, interference visibility, and entanglement entropy as functions of the seeding phase and amplitude. These results establish ENBSs as experimentally accessible quantum simulators of relativistic field phenomena, providing a photonic testbed for analog gravitational effects, vacuum fluctuations, and spacetime-induced coherence-all within reach of current nonlinear-optics technology.</p>

By analyzing the occupations at different frequencies in the emission spectrum, a linear regression suffices in many cases to recognize the relevant parameters of incident squeezed states. Beyond highlighting the general potential of this approach under continuous driving, we illustrate its effectiveness in an explicit nontrivial example where the source is a degenerate optical parametric oscillator (OPO), coupled to a nonlinear polariton microcavity.</p>

            <p>Multiplexing is essential for improving entanglement distribution rates in quantum communication. Frequency multiplexing provides a promising and scalable path toward large-capacity quantum networks. Further progress requires increasing the number of frequency modes and developing broadband photon-pair sources and quantum memories that are spectrally compatible. Here, we report the integration of a cavity-enhanced spontaneous parametric down-conversion source in the telecom C-band with a frequency-multiplexed atomic frequency comb memory. The bow-tie cavity source was simultaneously resonant at 606 nm and 1550 nm, generating non-degenerate photon pairs exhibiting a clustered frequency-comb spectrum. The atomic frequency comb memory, implemented in Praseodymium-doped Yttrium Orthosilicate crystals, provided up to 83 frequency modes with 123 MHz spacing and enabled broadband storage of 606 nm signal photons. By filtering the main cluster, we obtained $32.7 \pm 4.8$ effective modes, as confirmed from coincidence measurements. Importantly, we observed strong nonclassical correlations after storage, with cross-correlation values of $g_{s,i}^{(2)} = 8.1\pm0.7$. Our experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of integrating cavity-enhanced photon-pair sources with rare-earth-ion-doped solid-state memories. The integration reveals a high frequency multiplicity that is essential for scalable quantum networks.</p>

            <p>We propose an scheme for directional single-photon source based on a chiral cavity-magnon system. In this system, the magnon mode in a single-crystal yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere is coupled to only one of two rotating microwave modes in the torus-shaped microwave cavity. When two-photon drives are applied to both ports of the waveguide, the chiral cavity-magnon coupling leads to an unconventional photon blockade in one propagation direction, resulting in directional single-photon emission. The emission direction of the single-photon source can be controlled by reversing the biased magnetic field. Furthermore, we further examine the effects of imperfect chiral cavity-magnon coupling and the coupling between the two cavity modes on the photon blockade behavior. The results show that the system retains robustness in the presence of these nonideal factors, and the unidirectional photon blockade effect remains clearly preserved.</p>

Motivated by these results, we theoretically study $N=2$ coupled quantum emitters and identify threshold values of $\gamma^*$, for four experimentally accessible observables, beyond which collective effects vanish. The thresholds depend sensitively on the chosen observable, highlighting the subtlety of detecting collective behavior.

            <p>Parameterised quantum circuit (PQC) based Quantum Reinforcement Learning (QRL) has emerged as a promising paradigm at the intersection of quantum computing and reinforcement learning (RL). By design, PQCs create hybrid quantum-classical models, but their practical applicability remains uncertain due to training instabilities, barren plateaus (BPs), and the difficulty of isolating the contribution of individual pipeline components. In this work, we dissect PQC based QRL architectures through a systematic experimental evaluation of three aspects recurrently identified as critical: (i) data embedding strategies, with Data Reuploading (DR) as an advanced approach; (ii) ansatz design, particularly the role of entanglement; and (iii) post-processing blocks after quantum measurement, with a focus on the underexplored Output Reuse (OR) technique. Using a unified PPO-CartPole framework, we perform controlled comparisons between hybrid and classical agents under identical conditions. Our results show that OR, though purely classical, exhibits distinct behaviour in hybrid pipelines, that DR improves trainability and stability, and that stronger entanglement can degrade optimisation, offsetting classical gains. Together, these findings provide controlled empirical evidence of the interplay between quantum and classical contributions, and establish a reproducible framework for systematic benchmarking and component-wise analysis in QRL.</p>

            <p>Quantum battery has enormous potential for development, and quantum battery capacity is an important indicator of quantum battery. In this work, we mainly study the evolution of quantum battery capacity of GHZ state and GHZ-like states under Markovian channels in the tripartite system. We find that under the depolarizing channel and bit-phase flip channel, the battery capacity shows a brief sudden death of the capacity. And we also find that under the dephasing channel, the battery capacity gradually decreases and tends to a constant, that is, the frozen capacity. We show that the battery capacity monotonically decreases for GHZ state under the amplitude damping channel on the first subsystem. And we study the variation of capacity under the Markovian channels n times on the first subsystem using the GHZ state. We can observe that under the amplitude damping and dephasing channels, the battery capacity decreases and tends to a constant, i.e. frozen capacity, and the larger n, the earlier this phenomenon occurs. We also investigate the evolution of capacity under three independent same type Markovian channels. We have also conducted corresponding research on GHZ-like states.</p>

We prepare the atomic ensemble by driving the system to its steady state with varying Rabi frequencies $\Omega$ that go from the weak $\Omega \ll \Gamma$ to the strong driving regime $\Omega \gg \Gamma$, where $\Gamma$ is the single-atom decay rate. We investigate the early-time dynamics in the transition between the strong and weak driving regimes using: i) angular-dependent observables such as the light emitted by the cloud, and ii) global observables, i.e., the excited state population. When driving the cloud on-resonance, we find that as a function of the driving frequency, the behavior of the collected light at certain angles transitions from the single-photon subradiant regime to a superradiant regime while the behavior of the excited state population does not show superradiance. The experiment shows good agreement with numerical predictions in the regime of parameters under study.</p>

            <p>The Kerr parametric oscillator (KPO) has recently attracted considerable attention from the perspective of its applications to quantum information processing, and understanding its properties is an important challenge. Spectroscopic measurements serve as an effective means of elucidating detailed information about the system, such as the energy-level structure and the transition matrix elements of the KPO. Conventional spectroscopy requires the drive frequency to match an energy spacing with a nonzero transition matrix element. In recent years, a phenomenon called photonic resonance (PR) has been theoretically predicted in KPO spectroscopy. Specifically, resonance occurs under the condition that the detuning is set to $n/2$ times the Kerr nonlinearity, where $n$ is a natural number. However, under this condition the transition matrix element vanishes, and thus the mechanism by which photonic resonance (PR) arises has remained unclear. In this work, we aim to elucidate the physical origin of PR observed in KPO spectroscopy. We first performed theoretical calculations and experiments of spectroscopic measurements, confirming that PR can indeed be observed and that the theoretical and experimental results are in qualitative agreement. We then carried out an analytical study under the assumption of an ideal noiseless environment. Our analysis revealed that, although the transition matrix element of the external field expressed in the system's energy eigenbasis is zero, higher-order perturbative effects induce Rabi oscillations between the ground and excited states. Furthermore, numerical simulations in a time domain including the effect of decoherence demonstrated that coherent oscillations decay, leading to the appearance of PR.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kai Ryen Bush, Kjetil Børkje</p>
            <p>Entanglement between remote quantum mechanical systems enables a range of quantum information tasks in communication, computation and distributed sensing. Large numbers of entangled subsystems also require experimentally accessible and practically feasible methods of verifying the genuine, i.e., simultaneous, entanglement of all subsystems. We have derived a class of entanglement witnesses suitable for $W$-states, which are states where a single excitation is coherently distributed across subsystems initially in their ground state or a state with low thermal occupation, e.g., via detection of a Raman-scattered photon. The entanglement is witnessed through violation of an inequality involving number statistics, which can be measured via detection of subsequent Raman-scattered photons. Unlike conventional, partially tomographic, witnesses, our method is experimentally accessible for both multipartite and continuous variable systems. The thermal robustness of the method is quantified by the initial thermal occupations for which violation occurs. As an alternative approach, we have derived an inequality which tests the nonlocal, or quantum coherent, nature of the photon measurement backaction which produces the $W$-state. Violation of this alternative inequality implies the entanglement of the resulting state given the assumption of a separable initial state, under less stringent thermal constraints than the general entanglement witness. Our results are applicable to all Raman-scattering systems which can exhibit sufficient degrees of quantum indistinguishability.</p>

This configuration enables radiation-pressure interactions that generate strong quantum correlations between the two sideband modes. Remarkably, these correlations persist even at large numbers of thermal quanta if one properly engineers the optical cooling rate of the mechanical mode. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of robust entanglement under ambient conditions, opening new avenues for hybrid quantum technologies based on mechanical interfaces and continuous-variable quantum information processing.</p>

By combining steady-state and time-domain measurements, we reconstructed the key parameters of the system, including qubit relaxation and dephasing, waveguide-qubit couplings, and cross-waveguide photon transfer efficiency. The observed performance is consistent with a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian formalism and demonstrates clear limits set by flux bias, temperature, and photon number, in agreement with flux- and temperature-induced dephasing models. Crucially, the cell operates reliably at the single-photon level, and in the high-photon regime we directly observe photon dressing induced by the qubit. These results establish a versatile platform for studying open quantum system phenomena and pave the way for scalable implementations of quantum routing and network nodes.</p>

            <h2>Enhancing Infrared Laser Dissociation of Molecules with the Electromagnetic Vacuum</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Johan F. Triana, Felipe Herrera</p>
            <p>Controlling bond breaking is a long-standing goal in molecular physics. Infrared nanocavities are currently being developed for reaching exotic coupling regimes of cavity QED with a few molecules, but it is not well understood how chemical reactions would proceed in such systems. To address this, we study infrared laser photodissociation of a single CS$_{2}$ molecule with a stretching mode that strongly interacts with a resonant infrared vacuum, subject to a strong laser field that either resonantly drives the molecule at its fundamental vibration frequency or injects photons at the cavity resonance. We show that the intensities required for photodissociation are significantly lower inside the cavity than in free space, with a strong dependence on the type of driving condition. By directly injecting photons into the cavity, the molecule dissociates with two orders of magnitude less laser energy than by directly driving the vibrational mode. This photodissociation enhancement is a purely quantum mechanical effect that cannot be captured semi-classically. The intracavity ladder climbing dynamics is substantially modified relative to free space due to vacuum-induced admixing a large number of vibrational quantum numbers and the cavity field acting as a surrogate molecular mode that strongly interacts with the dissociative vibrational motion. Our work provides fundamental mechanistic understanding of chemical dynamics that can be used for designing new types of nanophotonics experiments that probe single-molecule chemistry.</p>

            <h2>Optimal Thermalization under Indefinite Causal Order with Identical and Asymmetric Baths</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Neeraj Sharma, Parveen Kumar</p>
            <p>Indefinite causal order (ICO), in which the order of quantum operations is placed in a coherent superposition, has been demonstrated to enhance various information-processing tasks. Here, we investigate its impact on the thermodynamic processes generated by thermalizing quantum channels. We consider a two-level system interacting with two thermal baths under a quantum SWITCH, with the channel order controlled coherently by an ancillary qubit. We derive closed-form expressions for the effective inverse temperature $\beta_f$ of the postselected system state for both identical and distinct bath temperatures, and identify the control-qubit parameters that maximize heating or cooling. Our analysis reveals how the diagonal and coherent components of the control-qubit state contribute separately to the temperature shift, and how their interplay enables departures from the thermal response attainable under any fixed causal order. Bath asymmetry enhances these effects, while reduced purity of the control qubit state suppresses them. These results provide a systematic framework for assessing the thermodynamic capabilities of ICO and clarify the role of quantum coherence as a tunable thermodynamic resource.</p>

            <p>We propose a scalable and noise-resilient protocol for the detection of the entanglement transition in a projective version of the transverse field Ising model. Entanglement transitions are experimentally difficult to observe due to the inherent randomness of projective measurements and noise in large-scale experimental settings. Our approach combines error correction algorithms with classical shadow tomography to overcome both problems. This allows for experimentally accessible upper and lower bounds on the entanglement transition without postselection or full state tomography. These bounds remain robust under noise and their sharpness is a measure of the noise rate.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Masked Autoencoders for Vision Learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emma Andrews, Prabhat Mishra</p>
            <p>Classical autoencoders are widely used to learn features of input data. To improve the feature learning, classical masked autoencoders extend classical autoencoders to learn the features of the original input sample in the presence of masked-out data. While quantum autoencoders exist, there is no design and implementation of quantum masked autoencoders that can leverage the benefits of quantum computing and quantum autoencoders. In this paper, we propose quantum masked autoencoders (QMAEs) that can effectively learn missing features of a data sample within quantum states instead of classical embeddings. We showcase that our QMAE architecture can learn the masked features of an image and can reconstruct the masked input image with improved visual fidelity in MNIST images. Experimental evaluation highlights that QMAE can significantly outperform (12.86% on average) in classification accuracy compared to state-of-the-art quantum autoencoders in the presence of masks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dharma P. Permana, Mazena Mackoit Sinkevičienė, Julius Ruseckas, Hamid R. Hamedi</p>
            <p>We investigate the propagation of an optical vector vortex weakly interacting with a coherently prepared atomic medium (phaseonium) in a three-level $\Lambda$ configuration. The vector beam consists of vortex pulse pairs with right- and left-circular polarizations, corresponding to opposite spin angular momentum (SAM), and carrying opposite orbital angular momentum (OAM) charges $\pm l$. We show that during the propagation of the vortex pairs, analytically obtained in the linear regime, the medium inherits the topology of the vortex pair, mapping the OAM onto a spatially structured atomic coherence. This mapping produces $2|l|-$fold azimuthal transparency structures that reshape the beam intensity from a ring into a petal-like pattern. The OAM-structured atomic coherence induces a corresponding optical anisotropy within the medium, which feeds back into the propagating vector beam, resulting in optical spin-orbit coupling manifested as SAM exchange, rotation, and evolution of polarization textures. Depending on the initial ground-state population of the phaseonium, the polarization state evolves between left-circular, linear, and right-circular polarizations.</p>

            <p>Leakage to non-computational states is a source of correlated errors in both time and space that limits the effectiveness of quantum error correction (QEC) with superconducting circuits. We present and experimentally demonstrate a high-fidelity, leakage reduction unit (LRU) operating concurrently with transmon measurement without incurring time overhead. Adapted from double-drive reset of population (DDROP), the protocol utilizes simultaneous drives on the transmon and its readout resonator, leveraging the dispersive shift to create a directional process that returns the transmon to the computational subspace. The LRU achieves a 98.4% leakage removal fraction without compromising the computational-state assignment fidelity (99.2%). We combine LRU-enhanced measurement and neural-network decoding to successfully suppress logical error rates in both memory and stability QEC experiments without any post-selection.</p>

            <p>We introduce a reinforcement learning algorithm designed to identify the fixed points of a given quantum operation. The method iteratively constructs the unitary transformation that maps the computational basis onto the basis of fixed points through a reward-penalty scheme based on quantum measurements. In cases where the operation corresponds to a Hamiltonian evolution, this task reduces to determining the Hamiltonian eigenstates. The algorithm is first benchmarked on random Hamiltonians acting on two and three qubits and then applied to many-body systems of up to six qubits, including the transverse-field Ising model and the all-to-all pairing Hamiltonian. In both cases, the algorithm is demonstrated to perform successfully; in the pairing model, it can also reveal hidden symmetries, which can be exploited to restrict learning to specific symmetry sectors. Finally, we discuss the possibility of post-selecting high-fidelity states even when full convergence has not been reached.</p>

            <p>We propose a momentum-space based variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) framework for simulating quasiparticle excitations in interacting quantum many-body systems on near-term quantum devices. Leveraging translational invariance and other symmetries of the Hamiltonian, we reconstruct the momentum-resolved quasiparticle excitation spectrum through targeted simulation of low-lying excited states using VQE. We construct a translationally symmetric variational ansatz designed to evolve a free-fermion particle-hole excited state with definite momentum $q$ to an excited state of the interacting system at the same momentum, employing a fermionic fast Fourier transform (FFFT) circuit coupled to a Hamiltonian Variational Ansatz (HVA) circuit. Even though the particle number is not explicitly conserved in the variational ansatz, the correct quasiparticle state is reached by energetic optimization. We benchmark the performance of the proposed VQE implementation on the XXZ Hamiltonian, which maps onto the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid in the fermionic representation. Our numerical results show that VQE can capture the low-lying excitation spectrum of the bosonic quasiparticle/two-spinon dispersion of this model at various interaction strengths. We estimate the renormalized velocity of the quasiparticles by calculating the slope of the dispersion near zero momentum using the VQE-optimized energies at different system sizes, and demonstrate that it closely matches theoretical results obtained from Bethe ansatz. Finally, we highlight extensions of our proposed VQE implementation to simulate quasiparticles in other interacting quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Florian Koch, Yu-Min Hu, Jan Carl Budich</p>
            <p>Open quantum systems far from thermal equilibrium can exhibit remarkable physical phenomena including topological properties without a direct equilibrium counterpart. Along these lines, in periodically driven dissipative systems within the effective non-Hermitian (NH) Hamiltonian approximation spectral winding numbers have been linked to intriguing nonreciprocal transport properties. Here, going beyond an NH Hamiltonian description, we introduce and study a microscopic lattice model of a driven open quantum system described by a Markovian quantum master equation, which exhibits the mentioned spectral winding within a NH approximation. By encompassing quantum jump processes in the topological analysis, we uncover a distinct \emph{jump-induced} topological phase, which qualitatively corresponds to the richer non-reciprocal transport properties of the fully quantum model. In addition, we find that the NH skin effect, i.e.~the accumulation of a macroscopic number of eigenstates at one end of the system, is already visible in the transient dynamics even for systems with periodic boundary conditions. Our results exemplify the subtle correspondence between NH topological properties and physical manifestations of Liouvillian topological properties in open quantum systems, thus providing a theoretical framework towards understanding unidirectional transport in quantum dissipative Floquet dynamics.</p>

            <p>Solving excited states is a challenging task for interacting systems. For one-dimensional critical systems, however, excited states can be directly accessed from the eigenvectors of the local effective Hamiltonian that is constructed from the ground state obtained by variational matrix product state (MPS) optimization. Despite its numerical success, the theoretical mechanism underlying this method has remained largely unexplored. In this work, we provide a conformal field theory (CFT) perspective that helps elucidate this connection. The key insight is that this construction effectively uses a truncated basis of ground-state Schmidt vectors to represent excited states, where the contribution of each Schmidt vector can be expressed as a CFT correlation function and shown to decay with increasing Schmidt index. The CFT analysis further predicts an entanglement-spectrum transition of excited states as the ratio of the subsystem size to the total system size is varied. Our numerical results support this picture and demonstrate a reorganization of the entanglement spectrum into distinct conformal towers as this ratio changes.</p>

Our approach generalizes to an arbitrary number of degrees of freedom and does not rely on the slow-roll approximation. The computational routine is numerically efficient and allows users to configure arbitrary sequences of decoherence events, with full control over their duration, shape, amplitude and effective wavelength range. The resulting outputs are compatible with nonlinear numerical codes, enabling studies of how decoherence effects propagate during reheating.</p>

            <p>The development of quantum materials for single-photon emission is crucial for the advancement of quantum information technology. Although significant advancement has been witnessed in recent years for single photon sources in near infrared band ({\lambda}~700-1000 nm), several challenges have yet to be addressed for ideal single photon emission at the telecommunication band. In this study, we present a droplet-epitaxy strategy for O-band to C-band single-photon source based semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) using metal-organic vapor-phase epitaxy (MOVPE). Via investigating the growth conditions of the epitaxial process, we have successfully synthesized InAs/InP QDs with narrow emission lines spanning a broad spectral range of {\lambda}~1200-1600 nm. The morphological and optical properties of the samples were characterized using atomic force microscopy and micro photoluminescence spectroscopy. The recorded single-photon purity of a plain QD structure reaches (g(2)(0) = 0.16), with a radiative recombination lifetime as short as 1.5 ns.

            <p>Non-reciprocity is a key resource for pushing the performance of photonic devices beyond the fundamental limits imposed by Lorentz reciprocity. Here, we report on the realization of an optical sensor where non-reciprocal light propagation allows detecting small perturbations with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) that scales exponentially with system size. Our approach is based on encoding two Hatano-Nelson (HN) chains, which is equivalent to the bosonic Kitaev model, within the resonant modes of an electro-optics frequency comb. Non-reciprocal light propagation in the frequency domain is realized through simultaneous phase and amplitude modulation of the circulating field inside the optical fiber cavity. We demonstrate the sensing of a small modulating tone coupling the two HN chains with a SNR that scales exponentially with the lattice size, formed from up to 70 frequency modes per chain. Our results open a new paradigm in non-Hermitian sensing, with potential applications in remote sensing including the optical readout of superconducting circuits.</p>

            <p>Recently, the coherent modified Redfield theory (CMRT) has been widely used to simulate the excitation-energy-transfer (EET) processes in photosynthetic systems. However, the numerical simulation of the CMRT is computationally expensive when dealing with large-scale systems, e.g. photosystem I (PSI) and II (PSII). On the other hand, the chemical reaction and fluorescence loss traditionally treated by the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian approach may result in significantly error in a wide range of parameters. To address these issues, we introduce a quantum jump approach (QJA) based on the CMRT to simulate the evolution of photosynthetic complexes including both the chemical reaction and fluorescence loss. The QJA shows higher accuracy and efficiency in simulating the EET processes. The QJA-CMRT approach may provide a powerful tool to design and optimize artificial photosynthetic systems, which benefits future innovation in the field of energy.</p>

By considering a Gaussian bump modification to the Regge-Wheeler potential with variable amplitude, position, and width parameters, $(\varepsilon,d,\sigma_0)$, a continuous line of EPs (exceptional line, EL) in this three-dimensional parameter space is revealed. We find that the vorticity $\nu=\pm1/2$ and the Berry phase $\gamma=\pi$ for loops encircling the EL, while $\nu=0$ and $\gamma=0$ for those do not encircle the EL. Through matrix perturbation theory, we prove that the $\epsilon$-pseudospectrum contour size scales as $\epsilon^{1/q}$ at an EP, where $q$ is the order of the largest Jordan block of the Hamiltonian-like operator, contrasting with the linear $\epsilon$ scaling at non-EPs. Numerical implements confirm this observation, demonstrating enhanced spectral instability at EPs for non-Hermitian systems including black holes.</p>

B} \textbf{110}, 214438 (2024)}. It was shown that in contrast to the translationally invariant models, such a spin liquid stabilizes a gapped ground state with a finite irrational flux density. In this work, we analyze the strong bond-anisotropic limit of the model and demonstrate that the aperiodic lattice geometry naturally generates a hierarchy of exponentially separated coupling constants in the resulting toric code Hamiltonian. Furthermore, a perturbative magnetic field leads to anomalous localization properties where an anyonic excitation sequentially delocalizes over subsets of sites forming equipotential contours in the quasicrystal. In addition, certain background flux configurations, together with the underlying geometry, give rise to strictly localized eigenstates that remain decoupled from the rest of the spectrum. Using numerical studies, we uncover the key mechanisms responsible for this unconventional localization behavior. Our study highlights that topologically ordered phases, in the presence of geometrical constraints can lead to highly anomalous localization properties of fractionalized charges.</p>

            <p>The decay out-states of unstable Standard Model (SM) particles provide a unique, well-defined intrinsic quantum-information probe of the SM parameter space. We use Higgs decays as a test case: after tracing out kinematics, we compute entanglement among final-state spins and colors across all decay channels and impose a near-maximal entanglement-entropy criterion. This criterion yields quantitative indications for fundamental parameters. Within the SM, the entanglement entropy exhibits a global maximum close to the observed Higgs mass and the measured $W$ mass, the latter being equivalent to the $SU(2)_L$ gauge coupling. In a two-parameter kappa framework, applying the same criterion points to an SM-like balance between vector and fermion couplings, constraining the ratio of the sector-wide rescalings. These results suggest that entanglement extremality can serve as a complementary handle on fundamental parameters.</p>

            <p>Studies of quantum field entanglement in de Sitter space based on the von Neumann entropy of local patches have concluded that curvature enhances entanglement between regions and their complements. Similar conclusions about entanglement enhancement have been reached in analyses of Fourier modes in the cosmological patch of de Sitter space. We challenge this interpretation by adopting a fully local approach: examining entanglement between pairs of field modes compactly supported within de Sitter's cosmological patch. Our approach is formulated in terms of the properties of a metric tensor and an associated complex structure induced by the Bunch-Davies vacuum on the classical phase space. We find that increasing curvature increases correlations between local modes but, somewhat counterintuitively, decreases their entanglement. Our methods allow us to characterize how entanglement is spatially distributed, revealing that a cosmological constant, even if tiny, qualitatively alters the vacuum's entanglement structure. We show that our results are compatible with previous entropy-based studies when properly interpreted. Our findings have implications for entanglement between observables generated during cosmic inflation.</p>

            <p>Identifying experimental signatures of anyons, which exhibit fractional exchange statistics, remains a central challenge in the study of two-dimensional topologically ordered systems. Previous theoretical work has shown that the threshold behavior in linear response spectroscopy can reveal the fractional exchange statistics between an anyon and its antiparticle. In this work, we extend this framework to nonlinear, two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy. We demonstrate by analyzing time-ordered four-point correlation functions that the threshold behavior of nonlinear response functions encodes the fractional statistics between general pairs of anyons that can combine to any composite topological charge. This feature in particular provides a powerful probe for unambiguously distinguishing non-Abelian anyons, which can form multiple composite charges with distinct nontrivial braid statistics. Our approach is validated using numerical simulations that are consistent with the correct fractional exchange statistics for both the Abelian anyons in the toric code and non-Abelian Ising anyons.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Himadri Halder</p>
            <p>Quantum many-body scars are special eigenstates that violate the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis while residing at finite energy density along with thermalizing eigenstates. The spin-1 XY model is known to host a family of such exceptional states originating from long-lived quasiparticle excitations that exhibit anomalously low entanglement entropy and long-time periodic revivals, resulting in weak ergodicity breaking. We study the stability of these scarred states against typical U(1) symmetry preserving perturbations in the XY chain. While perturbation theory can describe the deformed scar states at small system sizes, finite-size scaling of the perturbation matrix elements indicates that the scars ultimately thermalize in larger chains. Nonetheless, we demonstrate that the long-range order associated with the scars decays under the perturbation, and we estimate the relaxation timescale of oscillatory dynamics in certain local observables to be of order $\lambda^{-2}$, where $\lambda$ is the perturbation strength.</p>

            <h2>Fractional Chern insulator edges: crystalline effects and optical measurements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yan-Qi Wang, Johannes Motruk, Andrey Grankin, Mohammad Hafezi</p>
            <p>Edge states of chiral topologically ordered phases are commonly described by chiral Luttinger liquids, effective theories that are exact only in the hydrodynamic limit. Motivated by recent bulk observations of fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) in two-dimensional materials and by synthetic realizations in ultracold atoms, we revisit this framework and quantify deviations from the hydrodynamic limit due to lattice effects. Using a combination of analytical arguments and numerical simulations, we disentangle universal from nonuniversal edge properties. We outline experimental probes in excitonic FCIs and in ultracold atom systems, and in particular propose time-resolved edge spectroscopy to directly access the predicted exponents and velocities.</p>

            <h2>Toward Super-polynomial Quantum Speedup of Equivariant Quantum Algorithms with SU($d$) Symmetry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Han Zheng, Zimu Li, Sergii Strelchuk, Risi Kondor, Junyu Liu</p>
            <p>We introduce a framework of the equivariant convolutional quantum algorithms which is tailored for a number of machine-learning tasks on physical systems with arbitrary SU$(d)$ symmetries. It allows us to enhance a natural model of quantum computation -- permutational quantum computing (PQC) -- and define a more powerful model: PQC+. While PQC was shown to be efficiently classically simulatable, we exhibit a problem which can be efficiently solved on PQC+ machine, whereas no classical polynomial time algorithm is known; thus providing evidence against PQC+ being classically simulatable. We further discuss practical quantum machine learning algorithms which can be carried out in the paradigm of PQC+.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement behavior and localization properties in monitored fermion systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giulia Piccitto, Giuliano Chiriacò, Davide Rossini, Angelo Russomanno</p>
            <p>We study the asymptotic bipartite entanglement in various integrable and nonintegrable models of monitored fermions. We find that, for the integrable cases, the entanglement versus the system size is well fitted, over more than one order of magnitude, by a function interpolating between a linear and a power-law behavior. Up to the sizes we are able to reach, a logarithmic growth of the entanglement can be also captured by the same fit with a very small power-law exponent. We thus propose a characterization of the various entanglement phases using the fitting parameters. For the nonintegrable cases, as the staggered t-V and the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models, the numerics prevents us from spanning different orders of magnitude in the size, therefore we fit the asymptotic entanglement versus the measurement strength and then look at the scaling with the size of the fitting parameters. We find two different behaviors: for the SYK we observe a volume-law growth, while for the t-V model some traces of an entanglement transition emerge. In the latter models, we study the localization properties in the Hilbert space through the inverse participation ratio, finding an anomalous delocalization with no relation with the entanglement properties. Finally, we show that our function fits very well the fermionic logarithmic negativity of a quadratic model in ladder geometry with stroboscopic projective measurements.</p>

            <h2>Partial independence suffices to rule out Real Quantum Theory experimentally</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mirjam Weilenmann, Nicolas Gisin, Pavel Sekatski</p>
            <p>The role of complex quantities in quantum theory has been puzzling physicists since the beginnings. It is thus natural to ask whether, in order to describe our experiments, the mathematical structure of complex Hilbert spaces it is built on is really necessary. Recently, it was shown that this structure is inevitable in network scenarios with independent sources. More precisely, Real Quantum Theory cannot explain the predictions of (Complex) Quantum Theory [Renou et al., Nature 600, 2021]. Here, we revisit the independence assumption underlying this work. We show that assuming partial independence is sufficient for showing the inadequacy of Real Quantum Theory. We derive a tradeoff between source independence and the Bell value achievable in Real Quantum Theory, which also lower bounds the source correlations required to explain previous experiments by means of real quantum systems. We further show that 1 bit of entanglement is necessary and sufficient for recovering the complex quantum correlations by means of Real Quantum Theory in the scenario from [Renou et al., Nature 600, 2021]. Finally, building on [McKague et al., PRL 102, 2009], we provide a construction to simulate any complex quantum setup with m independent sources by means of Real Quantum Theory, by allowing the sources to share a m real-qubit entangled state in the first round of the experiment.</p>

            <h2>Thermalization and irreversibility of an isolated quantum system</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xue-Yi Guo</p>
            <p>The irreversibility and thermalization of many-body systems can be attributed to the erasure of spread non-equilibrium state information by local operations. This thermalization mechanism can be demonstrated by the sequence of $\hat{O}_i(t_i)$, where $\hat{O_i}$ is a local operator, $\hat{O_i}(t_i) = e^{i\hat{H}t_i} \hat{O_i} e^{-i\hat{H}t_i}$, $\hat{H}$ is the system Hamiltonian, $t_i$ can take positive, negative, or zero values, and the sequence is arranged according to the subscript $i$. We numerically demonstrate the information erasure of initial non-equilibrium quantum states through such sequence in a one-dimensional Hubbard model. During this process, the system's entanglement entropy increases monotonically toward a stable value. By incorporating this information erasure mechanism into an isolated system, our numerical simulations reveal that in this completely isolated system, a thermalization process emerges.</p>

            <h2>Experimental observation of quantum interferences in CO-H$_2$ rotational energy transfer at room temperature</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hamza Labiad, Alexandre Faure, Ian R. Sims</p>
            <p>Using time-resolved infrared-vacuum-ultraviolet double-resonance spectroscopy, experimental room temperature measurements of state-to-state rate coefficients for rotational energy transfer within the X $^1\Sigma^+(v=2)$ vibrational state of CO due to H$_2$ collisions have been compared to accurate 4-D close-coupling quantum calculations. Theoretically predicted quantum interferences in the CO-H$_2$ collisional system are experimentally observed for the first time at room temperature, and excellent agreement between theory and experiment is observed. These results provide a valuable benchmark for validating the anisotropic part of the potential energy surface, thereby supporting the theoretical modeling of CO emission in warm astrophysical environments such as photodissociation regions.</p>

            <h2>Pareto-optimality of pulses for robust population transfer in a ladder-type qutrit</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> John J. McCord, Marko Kuzmanović, Gheorghe Sorin Paraoanu</p>
            <p>Frequency-modulation schemes offer an alternative to standard Rabi pulses for realizing robust quantum operations. In this work, we investigate short-duration population transfer between the ground and first excited states of a ladder-type qutrit, with the goal of minimizing leakage into the second excited state. Our multiobjective approach seeks to reduce the maximum transient second-state population and maximize detuning robustness. Inspired by two-state models -- such as the Allen-Eberly and Hioe-Carroll models -- we extend these concepts to our system, exploring a range of pulse families, including those with super-Gaussian envelopes and polynomial detuning functions. We identify Pareto fronts for pulse models constructed from one of two envelope functions paired with one of four detuning functions. We then analyze how each Pareto-optimal pulse parameter influences the two Pareto objectives as well as amplitude robustness.</p>
