            <h2>Vacuum-Induced Quantum Gate</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arash Azizi</p>
            <p>We demonstrate that the quantum vacuum, as perceived by a uniformly accelerating observer, can be harnessed to perform a quantum Z-gate. A two-level Unruh-DeWitt detector, prepared in a superposition of its ground and excited states, undergoes a second-order interaction with the vacuum, resulting in a two-photon emission. We derive the exact analytical form of the final entangled detector-field state and show that this emission is conditional on a phase flip of the detector's initial state-the defining feature of the gate's operation. This process harvests entanglement from the Minkowski vacuum, producing photon pairs entangled across causally disconnected Rindler wedges. This work reframes acceleration-induced radiation not as thermal noise but as a coherent computational resource, offering new pathways for relativistic quantum information.</p>

            <h2>Robust qubit interactions mediated by photonic topological edge states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Boris Gurevich, Weihua Xie, Mohsen Yarmohammadi, Michael H. Kolodrubetz</p>
            <p>We investigate the coupling of two spatially separated qubits via topologically protected edge states in a two-dimensional Hofstadter lattice. In this hybrid platform, the qubits are coupled to distinct edge sites of the lattice, enabling long-range interactions mediated by topological edge modes. We solve the full system Hamiltonian and analyze the resulting eigenstate structure to uncover the conditions under which coherent qubit interactions emerge. Our analysis reveals that the effective coupling is highly sensitive to the qubit placement, energy detuning, and the topological character of the edge spectrum. We obtain an analytical solution that goes beyond the perturbative regime, capturing the full interplay between the qubits and edge modes. These results provide a foundation for exploring information transport and many-body effects in engineered quantum systems where interactions are mediated by topological edge modes.</p>

            <h2>Dissipation in the Broadband and Ultrastrong Coupling Regimes of Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics: An \emph{Ab Initio} Quantized Quasinormal Mode Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chris Gustin, Juanjuan Ren, Sebastian Franke, Stephen Hughes</p>
            <p>Phenomenological approaches to photon loss have long been the workhorse of cavity-QED, but prove inadequate in the presence of sufficiently broadband light-matter interactions. We present a rigorous and \emph{ab initio} derivation of a quantum master equation for a quantized optical cavity mode coupled to a dipole, using a quasinormal mode (QNM) quantization procedure for plasmonic and dielectric open-system cavity-QED, which is valid in broadband light-matter interaction regimes, including ultrastrong coupling (USC). The theory supports general three-dimensional resonators with arbitrary dispersion and loss, and thus can be applied to a wide range of open cavities. Our \emph{ab initio} and gauge-invariant approach fully recovers the recent result of Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 123601 (2025) for the spectral density of a quantized cavity with a single dipole, exhibits a dissipative classical-quantum correspondence for bosonic Hopfield model systems, and reveals important departures from previous heuristic assumptions about system-bath coupling. We identify a new criterion for what we term the ``broadband'' dissipative regime of cavity-QED, where phenomenological models require corrections in accordance with the intrinsic and spatially-dependent complex phase of the QNM, and also shed light on \emph{fundamental limits} to single-mode models in extreme coupling regimes. Using plasmonic and dielectric cavity examples, we show validity ranges of our QNM master equation and spectral USC calculations, and discuss prospects for near-term experimental observation of broadband dissipative effects.</p>

            <h2>High-harmonic generation under electronic strong coupling: A time-dependent combined quantum electrodynamics/quantum chemistry study</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paul A. Albrecht, Eric W. Fischer, Tillmann Klamroth, Peter Saalfrank</p>
            <p>The creation of light-matter hybrid states, polaritons, in a cavity offers new intriguing opportunities to manipulate the electronic structure and electron dynamics of atoms and molecules. Here, we investigate the effect of electronic strong coupling (ESC) between atoms or molecules and field modes of a Fabry-Pérot cavity on High-Harmonic Generation (HHG) spectra within a theoretical model study. We assume that the atom or molecule is driven by an intense classical laser field, giving rise to HHG, while being strongly coupled to quantized cavity modes as described by the Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian in the framework of molecular quantum electrodynamics (QED). Specifically, as a test case, we first consider a model Hamiltonian of a one-dimensional hydrogen atom coupled to a cavity mode, which can be treated ``numerically exact'' using grid methods. Further, a hydrogen molecule coupled to a cavity mode is considered and treated within a recently suggested QED-TD-CI (Quantum Electrodynamics Time-Dependent Configuration Interaction) method [Weidman $\textit{et al.}$, J. Chem. Phys. $\textbf{160}$, 094111 (2024)]. The resulting HHG spectra show (i) a suppression of the harmonic cutoff in line with excitation of quantum light in the cavity and, in some cases, (ii) enhancement of some harmonics of the coupled light-matter system.</p>

            <h2>The Janus State: Strong Photon Antibunching from a Superposition of Squeezed Vacua</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arash Azizi</p>
            <p>Fundamental principles of quantum mechanics, such as superposition, have long been used to create nonclassical "cat states" from classical-like components. We push this concept into the fully quantum regime by introducing the "Janus State"-a superposition of two squeezed vacuum states. Here, we report the discovery that this state, born from two photon-bunched components, exhibits strong photon antibunching. Our exact analytical theory reveals this emergent nonclassicality is driven by pure quantum interference. We identify a universal lower bound of $g^{(2)}=1/2$ in the asymptotic limit of vanishing squeezing, and also find a local minimum of $g^{(2)} \approx 0.567$ in a more experimentally accessible regime. The existence of this operational sweet spot fundamentally challenges the paradigm that strong antibunching requires non-Gaussian resources or post-selection. The Janus State thus constitutes a new foundational tool for quantum engineering, providing a deterministic route to generating highly nonclassical light.</p>

            <h2>Can gravity mediate the transmission of quantum information?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrea Mari, Stefano Zippilli, David Vitali</p>
            <p>We propose an experiment to test the non-classicality of the gravitational interaction. We consider two optomechanical systems that are perfectly isolated, except for a weak gravitational coupling. If a suitable resonance condition is satisfied, an optical signal can be transmitted from one system to the other over a narrow frequency band, a phenomenon that we call gravitationally induced transparency. In this framework, the challenging problem of testing the quantum nature of gravity is mapped to the easier task of determining the non-classicality of the gravitationally-induced optical channel: If the optical channel is not entanglement-breaking, then gravity must have a quantum nature. This approach is applicable without making any assumption on the, currently unknown, correct model of gravity in the quantum regime. In the second part of this work, we model gravity as a quadratic Hamiltonian interaction (e.g. a weak Newtonian force), resulting in a Gaussian thermal attenuator channel between the two systems. Depending on the strength of thermal noise, the system presents a sharp transition from an entanglement-breaking to a non-classical channel capable not only of entanglement preservation but also of asymptotically perfect quantum communication.</p>

            <h2>Controllable single-photon wave packet scattering in two-dimensional resonator array by a giant atom</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weijun Cheng, Zhihai Wang, Yu-Xi Liu</p>
            <p>Nonlocal interactions between photonic resonator array and giant atoms have attracted extensive attentions. Optimization and control of quantum states via giant atoms have been shown. We here study the dynamical scattering of a single-photon wave packet by a giant atom coupled to a two-dimensional photonic resonator array via multiple spatial points. Using several iterations of time evolutions, we can prepare an expected wave packet with a stable size and use it as the incident state for the scattering process. We show that spatially symmetric or asymmetric target scattering states of single-photon wave packet can be generated by adjusting the coupling strengths between the giant atom and different lattice sites of the resonator array. Furthermore, the dynamical scattering of the wave packets enables us to study the atomic excitation and propagating properties of the scattering states. We find that the atomic excitation has negligibly small probability during the scattering process. Our study may provide a new way to generate an expected photon state via photon scattering by a giant atom in two-dimensional photonic array.</p>

            <h2>Limits to the validity of quantum-optical models of the effects of gravitational redshift on photonic quantum states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nils Leber, Luis Adrián Alanís Rodríguez, Alessandro Ferreri, Andreas Wolfgang Schell, David Edward Bruschi</p>
            <p>We analyze the domain of validity of a quantum optical model describing the effects of gravitational redshift on the quantum state of photons that propagate in curved spacetime. We find that the model is consistent for small redshift, but fails for larger redshifts. Surprisingly, the range of the redshift for which the model applies is conditional not only to the gravitational parameters, but also to those that define the photonic modes. We provide an analysis to characterize this aspect and propose a solution. Finally, we discuss implications for theoretical science as well as for the development of quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Multiparameter estimation with position-momentum correlated Gaussian probes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> João C. P. Porto, Carlos H. S. Vieira, Pedro R. Dieguez, Irismar G. da Paz, Lucas S. Marinho</p>
            <p>Gaussian quantum probes have been widely used in quantum metrology and thermometry, where the goal is to estimate the temperature of an environment with which the probe interacts. It was recently shown that introducing initial position-momentum (PM) correlations in such probes can enhance the estimation precision compared to standard, uncorrelated Gaussian states. Motivated by these findings, we investigate whether PM correlations can also be advantageous in a simultaneous estimation setting, specifically, when estimating both the PM correlations themselves and the effective environment temperature that interacts with the probe. Using the Quantum Fisher Information Matrix, we derive new precision bounds for this joint estimation task. Additionally, we demonstrate that such correlations can serve as a resource to improve temperature estimation within this multiparameter context. Finally, we analyze the compatibility between the two parameters, establishing conditions under which the derived bounds can be saturated.</p>

            <h2>Compton Form Factor Extraction using Quantum Deep Neural Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Brandon B. Le, Dustin Keller</p>
            <p>We present an extraction of Compton Form Factors (CFFs) from Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DVCS) experiments conducted at Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, utilizing Quantum Deep Neural Networks (QDNNs). The analysis employs the standard Belitsky, Kirchner, and Müller formalism at twist-two, complemented by a fitting procedure designed to minimize model dependence in a manner analogous to conventional local fits. A pseudodata extraction test of the CFFs is performed using both Classical Deep Neural Networks (CDNNs) and QDNNs, with a detailed comparative analysis. Results indicate that QDNNs can outperform CDNNs in particular cases, offering enhanced predictive accuracy and precision even with limited model complexity. Motivated by this, we develop a metric to quantify the extent of the quantum advantage based on characteristics of DVCS experimental data. These findings underscore the promising role of QDNNs in advancing future investigations into multidimensional parton distributions and hadronic physics.</p>

            <h2>Light and divergences: History and outlook</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gerd Leuchs, Luis L. Sanchez-Soto</p>
            <p>All experimental evidence {indicates} that the vacuum is not void, but filled with something truly quantum. This is reflected by terms such as {zero-point} fluctuations, and Dirac's sea of virtual particle-antiparticle pairs, and last but not least the vacuum is the medium responsible for Maxwell's displacement current. While quantum electrodynamics (QED) is an exceptionally successful theory, it remains a perturbative framework rather than a fully self-contained one. Inherently, it includes singularities and divergences, which prevent the precise calculation of fundamental quantities such as the fine-structure constant $\alpha$. Any direct attempt to compute $\alpha$ results in divergent values. However, and most remarkable, what can be determined is how $\alpha$ ``runs", meaning how it varies with energy or exchanged momentum. In this article, we review the historical development of these ideas, the current state of knowledge, and ongoing efforts to find ways to move further. This includes a simple model to describe vacuum polarization in the low-energy regime, when considering only small (linear) deviations from the equilibrium {state}, relating {Maxwell's displacement} in the vacuum, to the quantum properties of the vacuum.</p>

            <h2>Real-Time Observation of Aharonov-Bohm Interference in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Lattice Gauge Theory on a Hybrid Qubit-Oscillator Quantum Computer</h2>

            <p>Quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories (LGTs) with both dynamical matter and gauge fields provide a promising approach to studying strongly coupled problems beyond classical computational reach. Yet, implementing gauge-invariant encodings and real-time evolution remains experimentally challenging. Here, we demonstrate a resource-efficient encoding of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT using a hybrid qubit-oscillator trapped-ion quantum device, where qubits represent gauge fields and vibrational modes naturally encode bosonic matter fields. This architecture utilises synthetic dimensions to construct higher-dimensional lattice geometries and combines digital and analogue techniques to prepare initial states, realise gauge-invariant real-time evolution, and measure the relevant observables. We experimentally probe dynamics obeying Gauss's law in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ link and extend this to a loop geometry, marking the first steps towards higher-dimensional LGTs. In this quasi-2D setup, we observe Aharonov-Bohm interference for the first time with dynamical gauge fields encoding magnetic flux, demonstrating the interplay between charge and flux. Our results chart a promising path for scalable quantum simulations of bosonic gauge theories and outline a roadmap for realising exotic LGTs in higher dimensions.</p>

            <h2>Characterization of Polariton Dynamics in a Multimode Cavity (II): Coherent-Incoherent Transition Driven by Photon Loss</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Md Qutubuddin, Ilia Tutunnikov, Jianshu Cao</p>
            <p>Motivated by the recent advances in optical imaging and tracking of wave-packet propagation in optical cavities, we systematically explore the non-Hermitian polariton dynamics within a decay- tunable multimode cavity model. The complex eigen-spectrum of the model Hamiltonian allows us to predict the incoherent-coherent transition induced by photon losses, which defines an exceptional point at resonance and evolves analytically as the wavevector shifts off-resonantly. The resulting dispersion relation, group velocity, and relaxation rate exhibit striking signatures, such as curve crossing, level repulsion, turnover, bifurcation, and coalescence, as the decay rate crosses the critical transition or the wavevector crosses the resonance. The spectral characterization leads to surprising features in the non-Hermitian wave packet dynamics: (i) maximal population relaxation rate at the critical transition; (ii) reversed propagation in the center-of-mass motion; (iii) ballistic-to-diffusion transition; (iv) contraction in the displacement and width of the polariton wave-packet. These dynamical features have complementary symmetry between the upper-polariton (UP) branch and lower-polariton (LP) branch in the two-dimensional phase diagram spanned by the photon decay rate and wavevector. Thus, the combination of complex spectral characterization and non-Hermitian wave packet propagation establishes the photon decay rate as a powerful control parameter for polariton transport, reveals the underlying symmetry in lossy cavities, and presents a starting point to incorporate other dissipative mechanisms.</p>

            <h2>Universal Relation Between Quantum Entanglement and Particle Transport</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elvira Bilokon, Valeriia Bilokon, Abhijit Sen, Mohammed Th. Hassan, Andrii Sotnikov, Denys I. Bondar</p>
            <p>Entanglement entropy is a fundamental measure of quantum correlations and a key resource underpinning advances in quantum information and many-body physics. We uncover a universal relationship between bipartite entanglement entropy and particle number after the barrier in a one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard system with an external asymmetric potential. Using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks - a novel machine learning architecture - we learn this relationship across a broad range of interaction strengths with near-perfect predictive accuracy. Furthermore, we propose a simple analytical binary-entropy-like expression that quantitatively captures the observed correlation for fixed parameters. Our findings open new avenues for characterizing quantum correlations in transport phenomena and provide a powerful framework for predicting entanglement evolution in quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>Semiclassical radiation spectrum from an electron in an external plane wave field</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> T. C. Adorno, A. J. D. Farias Junior, D. M. Gitman</p>
            <p>In this work, we study the electromagnetic energy and energy rate spectra produced by a point particle in the presence of plane wave fields. Our approach is based on a semiclassical formulation, in which the current distribution that generates electromagnetic radiation is treated classically while the radiation field is quantum. Unlike the classical energy spectrum--which exhibits divergences linked to the duration of interaction between the particle and the external field--the semiclassical spectrum is finite because radiation is produced during the quantum transition from an initial state without photons to the final state with photons at time $t$. In our formulation, we find that the maximum energy spectrum emitted by the particle is linearly proportional to time or phase, depending on the external field. This allowed us not only to extract the maximum energy rate spectra emitted by the particle but also to correlate them with energy rates derived in the framework of Classical Electrodynamics and Quantum Electrodynamics.</p>

            <p>Young's double slit experiment has often been used to illustrate the concept of complementarity in quantum mechanics. If information can in principle be obtained about the path of the photon, then the visibility of the interference fringes is reduced or even destroyed. This Gedanken experiment discussed by Bohr and Einstein can be realized when the slit is replaced by individual atoms sensitive to the transferred recoil momentum of a photon which "passes through the slit". Early pioneering experiments were done with trapped ions and atom pairs created via photo-dissociation. Recently, it became possible to perform interference experiments with single neutral atoms cooled to the absolute ground state of a harmonic oscillator potential. The slits are now single atoms representing a two-level system, and the excitation in the harmonic oscillator potential is the which-way marker. In this note, we analyze and generalize two recent experiments performed with single atoms and emphasize the different ways they record which-way information.</p>

            <h2>Robust Variational Ground-State Solvers via Dissipative Quantum Feedback Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yunyan Lee, Ian R. Petersen, Daoyi Dong</p>
            <p>We propose a variational framework for solving ground-state problems of open quantum systems governed by quantum stochastic differential equations (QSDEs). This formulation naturally accommodates bosonic operators, as commonly encountered in quantum chemistry and quantum optics. By parameterizing a dissipative quantum optical system, we minimize its steady-state energy to approximate the ground state of a target Hamiltonian. The system converges to a unique steady state regardless of its initial condition, and the design inherently guarantees physical realizability. To enhance robustness against persistent disturbances, we incorporate H-infinity control into the system architecture. Numerical comparisons with the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) highlight the method's structural advantages, stability, and physical implementability. This framework is compatible with experimental platforms such as cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) and photonic crystal circuits.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ali Pedram, Özgür E. Müstecaplıoğlu</p>
            <p>We study the ultimate precision limits of a spin chain, strongly coupled to a heat bath, for measuring a general parameter and report the results for specific cases of magnetometry and thermometry. Employing a full polaron transform, we derive the effective Hamiltonian and obtain analytical expressions for the quantum Fisher information (QFI) of equilibrium states in both weak coupling (WC) and strong coupling (SC) regimes for a general parameter, explicitly accounting for finite-size (FS) effects. Furthermore, we utilize Hill's nanothermodynamics to calculate an effective QFI expression at SC. Our results reveal a potential advantage of SC for thermometry at low temperatures and demonstrate enhanced magnetometric precision through control of the anisotropy parameter. Crucially, we show that neglecting FS effects leads to considerable errors in ultimate precision bounds for equilibrium thermometry. This work also highlights the inadequacy of phenomenological approaches in describing the metrological capability and thermodynamic behavior of systems at SC. Additionally, we demonstrate the effect of bath on system's phase transition at SC.</p>

            <p>Cluster states are a useful resource in quantum computation, and can be generated by applying entangling gates between next-neighbor qubits. Heralded entangling gates offer the advantage of high post-selected fidelity, and can be used to create cluster states at the expense of large space-time overheads. We propose a low-overhead protocol to generate and merge high-fidelity many-atom entangled states into a 3D cluster state that supports fault-tolerant universal logical operations. Our simulations indicate that a state-of-the-art high-finesse optical cavity is sufficient for constructing a scalable fault-tolerant cluster state with loss and Pauli errors remaining an order of magnitude below their respective thresholds. This protocol reduces the space-time resource requirements for cluster state construction, highlighting the measurement-based method as an alternative approach to achieving large-scale error-corrected quantum processing with neutral atoms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jessica John Britto</p>
            <p>Bosons with density-dependent hopping on a one dimensional lattice have been shown to emulate anyonic particles with fractional exchange statistics. Leveraging this, we construct a Josephson junction setup, where an insulating barrier in the form of a Mott-insulator is sandwiched between two superfluid phases. This is obtained by spatially varying either the statistical phase or the strength of the on-site interaction potential on which the ground state of the system depends. Utilizing numerical methods such as exact diagonalization and density renormalization group theory, the ground state properties of this setup are investigated to understand the Josephson effect in a strongly correlated regime. The dynamical properties of this model for different configurations of this model are analyzed to find the configurations that can produce the Josephson effect. Furthermore, it is observed that continuous particle flow over time is achievable in this proposed model solely by creating an initial phase difference without any external biasing.</p>

            <h2>Atom-Field-Medium Interactions III: Quantum Field-mediated Entanglement between Two Atoms near a Conducting Surface</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jen-Tsung Hsiang, Bei-Lok Hu</p>
            <p>This third paper in this series continues the investigation of atom-field interactions in the presence of a conductor or a dielectric medium, focusing on quantum information related basic issues such as decoherence and entanglement. Here we consider the entanglement between two atoms with internal degrees of freedom modeled by a harmonic oscillator, with varying separations between them and varying distances between them and a conducting surface. These are configurations familiar in the Casimir-Polder effect, but the behavior of atom-surface entanglement is quite different from the well-studied behavior of field-induced forces. For one, while the attractive force between an atom and a conducting surface increases as they come closer, the entanglement between the atom and the quantum field actually decreases as the atom gets closer to the conductor, as shown in \cite{Rong,AFD2}. We show how different factors play out, ranging from the coupling between the atoms and the field to the coupling between the atoms, going beyond the weak coupling restrictions often found necessary in the literature. Gathering our results for the entanglement dependence on each variable concerned, we can provide a spatial topography of quantum entanglement, thus enabling a visualized understanding of the behavior of quantum field-mediated entanglement. In particular we can quantify the definition of a three-dimensional \textit{entanglement domain} between the two atoms, how it varies with their coupling, their separation and their distances from the conducting surface, and for practical applications, how to exercise effective control of the entanglement between two atoms by changing these parameters. Our findings are expected to be useful for studies of atom-field-medium interactions in vacuum and surface physics.</p>

            <h2>Real-Space Chemistry on Quantum Computers: A Fault-Tolerant Algorithm with Adaptive Grids and Transcorrelated Extension</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> César Feniou, Christopher Cherfan, Julien Zylberman, Baptiste Claudon, Jean-Philip Piquemal, Emmanuel Giner</p>
            <p>First-quantized, real-space formulations of quantum chemistry on quantum computers are appealing: qubit count scales logarithmically with spatial resolution, and Coulomb operators achieve quadratic instead of quartic computational scaling of two-electron interactions. However, existing schemes employ uniform discretizations, so the resolution required to capture electron-nuclear cusps in high-density regions oversamples low-density regions, wasting computational resources. We address this by deploying non-uniform, molecule-adaptive grids that concentrate points where electronic density is high. Using Voronoi partitions of these grids, the molecular Hamiltonian is expressed in a Hermitian form and in a transcorrelated, isospectral form that eliminates Coulomb singularities and yields cusp-free eigenfunctions. Both formulations slot naturally into quantum eigenvalue solvers: Hermitian Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) and the recent generalised Quantum Eigenvalue Estimation (QEVE) protocol for its non-Hermitian, transcorrelated counterpart. Numerical validation on benchmark systems confirms that this non-heuristic ab initio framework offers a promising path for accurate ground-state chemistry on quantum hardware.</p>

This leads to resonant Rabi oscillations between the Dirac vacuum and mesonic states. The population concentration exhibits oscillations with negligible fluctuations of detuned states also with the inclusion of combined noise sources, from which we can clearly detect multiple dynamical phase transitions.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Circuit Caches and Compressors for Low Latency, High Throughput Computing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ioana Moflic, Alan Robertson, Simon J. Devitt, Alexandru Paler</p>
            <p>Utility-scale quantum programs contain operations on the order of $>10^{15}$ which must be prepared and piped from a classical co-processor to the control unit of the quantum device. The latency of this process significantly increases with the size of the program: existing high-level classical representations of quantum programs are typically memory intensive and do not naïvely efficiently scale to the degree required to execute utility-scale programs in real-time. To combat this limitation, we propose the utilization of high-level quantum circuit caches and compressors. The first save on the time associated with repetitive tasks and sub-circuits, and the latter are useful for representing the programs/circuits in memory-efficient formats. We present numerical evidence that caches and compressors can offer five orders of magnitude lower latencies during the automatic transpilation of extremely large quantum circuits.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samuel Schöpa, Falk-Erik Wiechmann, Franziska Fennel, Dieter Bauer</p>
            <p>We utilize few-level model systems to analyze the polarization and phase properties of below-threshold harmonics (BTH) in aligned molecules. In a two-level system (TLS), we find that the phase of emitted harmonics undergoes a distinct change. For harmonics with photon energies below the transition between the dominant field-dressed states, the phase alternates by $\pi$ between successive odd harmonic orders but remains constant above. Exploiting this behavior, we construct a four-level model composed of two uncoupled TLS subsystems aligned along orthogonal directions. We demonstrate that with selected transition frequencies lower-order harmonics follow the polarization of the linearly polarized driving field while higher-order harmonics exhibit a mirrored polarization. The model predicts that aligned systems with orthogonal transition dipoles may show analogous phase and polarization features in the BTH regime.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Rademacher, A. Pontin, J. M. H. Gosling, P. F. Barker, M. Toroš</p>
            <p>Levitated optomechanics, the interaction between light and small levitated objects, is a new macroscopic quantum system that is being used as a testing ground for fundamental physics and for the development of sensors with exquisite sensitivity. The utility of this system, when compared to other quantum optomechanical systems, is its extreme isolation from the environment and, by the relatively few degrees of freedom that a levitated object has. While work in the field has strongly focused on the three translational degrees of freedom of this system, it has become increasingly important to understand the induced rotational motion of levitated objects, particularly in optical trapping fields, but also in magnetic and electric traps. These additional three degrees of freedom, which are intrinsic to levitated systems, offer a new set of optomechanical nonlinear interactions that lead to a rich and yet largely unexplored roto-translational motion. The control and utilization of these interactions promise to extend the utility of levitated optomechanics in both fundamental studies and applications. In this review, we provide an overview of levitated optomechanics, before focusing on the roto-translational motion of optically levitated anisotropic objects. We first present a classical treatment of this induced motion, bridging the gap between classical and quantum formalisms. We describe the different types of roto-translational motion for different particle shapes via their interaction with polarized optical trapping fields. Subsequently, we provide an overview of the theoretical and experimental approaches as well as applications that have established this new field. The review concludes with an outlook of promising experiments and applications, including the creation of non-classical states of roto-translational motion, quantum-limited torque sensing and particle characterization methods.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Simulation of Molecular Dynamics Processes - A Benchmark Study Using Classical Simulator and Present-Day Quantum Hardware</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tamila Kuanysheva, Brian Kendrick, Lukasz Cincio, Dmitri Babikov</p>
            <p>We explore how the fundamental problems in quantum molecular dynamics can be modelled using classical simulators (emulators) of quantum computers and the actual quantum hardware available to us today. The list of problems we tackle includes propagation of a free wave packet, vibration of a harmonic oscillator, and tunneling through a barrier. Each of these problems starts with the initial wave packet setup. Although Qiskit provides a general method for initializing wavefunctions, in most cases it generates deep quantum circuits. While these circuits perform well on noiseless simulators, they suffer from excessive noise on quantum hardware. To overcome this issue, we designed a shallower quantum circuit for preparing a Gaussian-like initial wave packet, which improves the performance on real hardware. Next, quantum circuits are implemented to apply the kinetic and potential energy operators for the evolution of a wavefunction over time. The results of our modelling on classical emulators of quantum hardware agree perfectly with the results obtained using the traditional (classical) methods. This serves as a benchmark and demonstrates that the quantum algorithms and Qiskit codes we developed are accurate. However, the results obtained on the actual quantum hardware available today, such as IBM's superconducting qubits and IonQ's trapped ions, indicate large discrepancies due to hardware limitations. This work highlights both the potential and challenges of using quantum computers to solve fundamental quantum molecular dynamics problems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Byungmin Kang, Patrick A. Lee</p>
            <p>We propose cyclotron resonance as an optical probe for emergent fractionalized excitations in $\mathrm{U}(1)$ quantum spin liquids, focusing on kagome antiferromagnets. In contrast to conventional systems, where cyclotron resonance directly couples to charged carriers, spinons in spin liquids are charge-neutral and interact only through an emergent gauge field. We identify two key mechanisms by which an external physical electromagnetic field induces emergent electric and magnetic fields, enabling indirect coupling to spinons. Using these mechanisms, we compute the absorption rate of the cyclotron resonance response for Dirac spinons forming Landau levels. Our analysis shows that, although the absorption per layer is small, the absence of a skin-depth limitation in insulating spin liquids allows for cumulative absorption comparable to graphene in realistic sample sizes for the recently discovered spin-liquid candidate material YCu${}_3$(OH)${}_6$Br${}_2$[Br${}_{1-y}$(OH)${}_y$]. Our findings shows that cyclotron resonance is a viable experimental probe of spinon Landau quantization and emergent gauge fields, providing powerful positive experimental signatures of quantum spin liquids.</p>

            <p>Recently discovered 2D van der Waals magnetic materials, and specifically Iron-Germanium-Telluride ($\rm Fe_{5}GeTe_{2}$), have attracted significant attention both from a fundamental perspective and for potential applications. Key open questions concern their domain structure and magnetic phase transition temperature as a function of sample thickness and external field, as well as implications for integration into devices such as magnetic memories and logic. Here we address key questions using a nitrogen-vacancy center based quantum magnetic microscope, enabling direct imaging of the magnetization of $\rm Fe_{5}GeTe_{2}$ at sub-micron spatial resolution as a function of temperature, magnetic field, and thickness. We employ spatially resolved measures, including magnetization variance and cross-correlation, and find a significant spread in transition temperature yet with no clear dependence on thickness down to 15 nm. We also identify previously unknown stripe features in the optical as well as magnetic images, which we attribute to modulations of the constituting elements during crystal synthesis and subsequent oxidation. Our results suggest that the magnetic anisotropy in this material does not play a crucial role in their magnetic properties, leading to a magnetic phase transition of $\rm Fe_{5}GeTe_{2}$ which is largely thickness-independent down to 15 nm. Our findings could be significant in designing future spintronic devices, magnetic memories and logic with 2D van der Waals magnetic materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ahmik Virani, Devraj, Anirudh Suresh, Lei Zhang, M V Panduranga Rao</p>
            <p>Quantum computing in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era presents significant challenges in differentiating quantum software bugs from hardware noise. Traditional debugging techniques from classical software engineering cannot directly resolve this issue due to the inherently stochastic nature of quantum computation mixed with noises from NISQ computers. To address this gap, we propose a statistical approach leveraging probabilistic metrics to differentiate between quantum software bugs and hardware noise. We evaluate our methodology empirically using well-known quantum algorithms, including Grover's algorithm, Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, and Simon's algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy and practical applicability of our approach, providing quantum software developers with a reliable analytical tool to identify and classify unexpected behavior in quantum programs.</p>

            <p>Fluctuations are fundamental in physics and important for understanding and characterizing phase transitions. In this spirit, the phase transition to the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) is of specific importance. Whereas fluctuations of the condensate particle number in atomic BECs have been studied in continuous systems, experimental and theoretical studies for lattice systems were so far missing. Here, we explore the condensate particle number fluctuations in an optical lattice BEC across the phase transition in a combined experimental and theoretical study. We present both experimental data using ultracold $^{87}$Rb atoms and numerical simulations based on a hybrid approach combining the Bogoliubov quasiparticle framework with a master equation analysis for modeling the system. We find strongly anomalous fluctuations, where the variance of the condensate number $\delta N_{\rm BEC}^2$ scales with the total atom number as $N^{1+\gamma}$ with an exponent around $\gamma_{\rm theo}=0.74$ and $\gamma_{\rm exp}=0.62$, which we attribute to the 2D/3D crossover geometry and the interactions. Our study highlights the importance of the trap geometry on the character of fluctuations and on fundamental quantum mechanical properties.</p>

We demonstrate in a general way that for the Dirac-Dunkl oscillator be parity invariant, one of the spinor component must be even, and the other spinor component must be odd, and vice versa. We decouple the differential equations for each of the spinor component and introduce an appropriate $su(1,1)$ algebraic realization for the cases when one of these functions is even and the other function is odd. The eigenfunctions and the energy spectrum are obtained by using the $su(1,1)$ irreducible representation theory. Finally, by setting the Dunkl parameter to vanish, we show that our results reduce to those of the standard Dirac-Moshinsky oscillator.</p>

            <p>We propose and analyze a method for improving quantum chemical energy calculations on a quantum computer impaired by decoherence and shot noise. The error mitigation approach relies on the fact that the one- and two-particle reduced density matrices (1- and 2-RDM) of a chemical system need to obey so-called N-representability constraints. We post-process the result of an RDM measurement by projecting it into the subspace where certain N-representability conditions are fulfilled. Furthermore, we utilize that such constraints also hold in the hole and particle-hole sector and perform projections in these sectors as well. We expand earlier work by conducting a careful analysis of the method's performance in the context of quantum computing. Specifically, we consider typical decoherence channels (dephasing, damping, and depolarizing noise) as well as shot noise due to a finite number of projective measurements. We provide analytical considerations and examine numerically three example systems, \ch{H2}, \ch{LiH}, and \ch{BeH2}. From these investigations, we derive our own practical yet effective method to best employ the various projection options. Our results show the approach to significantly lower energy errors and measurement variances of (simulated) quantum computations.</p>

            <h2>Virtual Quantum Markov Chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Ao Chen, Chengkai Zhu, Keming He, Mingrui Jing, Xin Wang</p>
            <p>Quantum Markov chains generalize classical Markov chains for random variables to the quantum realm and exhibit unique inherent properties, making them an important feature in quantum information theory. In this work, we propose the concept of virtual quantum Markov chains (VQMCs), focusing on scenarios where subsystems retain classical information about global systems from measurement statistics. As a generalization of quantum Markov chains, VQMCs characterize states where arbitrary global shadow information can be recovered from subsystems through local quantum operations and measurements. We present an algebraic characterization for virtual quantum Markov chains and show that the virtual quantum recovery is fully determined by the block matrices of a quantum state on its subsystems. Notably, we find a distinction between two classes of tripartite entanglement by showing that the W state is a VQMC while the GHZ state is not. Furthermore, we introduce the virtual non-Markovianity to quantify the non-Markovianity of a given quantum state, which also assesses the optimal sampling overhead for virtually recovering this state. Our findings elucidate distinctions between quantum Markov chains and virtual quantum Markov chains, extending our understanding of quantum recovery to scenarios prioritizing classical information from measurement statistics.</p>

            <p>We introduce ``dual-unitary shadow tomography'' (DUST), a classical shadow tomography protocol based on dual-unitary brick-wall circuits. To quantify the performance of DUST, we study operator spreading and Pauli weight dynamics in one-dimensional qubit systems, evolved by random two-local dual-unitary gates arranged in a brick-wall structure, ending with a measurement layer. We do this by deriving general constraints on the Pauli weight transfer matrix and specializing to the case of dual-unitarity. Remarkably, we find that operator spreading in these circuits have a rich structure resembling that of relativistic quantum field theories, with massless chiral excitations that can decay or fuse into each other, which we call left- or right-movers. We develop a mean-field description of the Pauli weight in terms of $\rho(x,t)$, which represents the probability of having nontrivial support at site $x$ and depth $t$ starting from a fixed weight distribution. We develop an equation of state for $\rho(x,t)$ and simulate it numerically using Monte Carlo simulations. For the task of predicting operators with (nearly) full support, we show that DUST outperforms brick-wall Clifford shadows of equal depth. This advantage is further pronounced for small system sizes and our results are generally robust to finite-size effects.</p>

            <p>Non-stabilizer states are a fundamental resource for universal quantum computation. However,despite broad significance in quantum computing, the emergence of "many-body" non-stabilizerness in interacting quantum systems remains poorly understood due to its analytical intractability. Here we show that Rydberg atom arrays provide a natural reservoir of non-stabilizerness that extends beyond single qubits and arises from quantum correlations engendered by the Rydberg blockade. We demonstrate that this non-stabilizerness can be experimentally accessed in two complementary ways, either by performing quench dynamics or via adiabatic ground state preparation. Using the analytical framework based on matrix product states, we explain the origin of Rydberg nonstabilizerness via a quantum circuit decomposition of the wave function.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zekun He, A. F. Kemper, J. K. Freericks</p>
            <p>Adiabatic state preparation provides an analytical solution for generating the ground state of a target Hamiltonian, starting from an easily prepared ground state of the initial Hamiltonian. While effective for time-dependent Hamiltonians with an energy gap to the first coupled excited state, the process becomes exceedingly slow as the gap narrows. Rather than strictly following the adiabatic theorem, a more robust approach allows controlled diabatic excitations during the evolution and numerically optimizes the path to eliminate these excitations by the end. In this work, this is achieved via modulated time evolution, using a time dependent oscillating field lambda(t) to modulate the Hamiltonian, in conjunction with a transverse field B(t) whose optimized shape closely resembles a local adiabatic ramp. Beyond modulated time evolution, the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA), which also employs a transverse field defined as beta(t) over gamma(t), exhibits a shape similar to the local adiabatic ramp. This resemblance offers a more intuitive and physically motivated way to understand the QAOA algorithm through the lens of time evolution.</p>

            <p>We explore the important task of applying a phase $\exp(i\,f(x))$ to a computational basis state $\left| x \right>$. The closely related task of rotating a target qubit by an angle depending on $f(x)$ is also studied. Such operations are key in many quantum subroutines, and frequently $f(x)$ can be well-approximated by a piecewise function; examples range from the application of diagonal Hamiltonian terms (such as the Coulomb interaction) in grid-based many-body simulation, to derivative pricing algorithms. Here we exploit a parallelisation of the piecewise approach so that all constituent elementary rotations are performed simultaneously, that is, we achieve a total rotation depth of one. Moreover, we explore the use of recursive catalyst `towers' to implement these elementary rotations efficiently. We find that strategies prioritising execution speed can achieve circuit depth as low as $O(\log{n}{+}\log{S})$ for a register of $n$ qubits and a piecewise approximation of $S$ sections (presuming prior preparation of enabling resource states), albeit total qubit count then scales with $S$. In the limit of multiple repetitions of the oracle, we find that catalyst tower approaches have an $O(S\cdot n)$ T-count.</p>

            <h2>Multipartite Embezzlement of Entanglement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lauritz van Luijk, Alexander Stottmeister, Henrik Wilming</p>
            <p>Embezzlement of entanglement refers to the task of extracting entanglement from an entanglement resource via local operations and without communication while perturbing the resource arbitrarily little. Recently, the existence of embezzling states of bipartite systems of type III von Neumann algebras was shown. However, both the multipartite case and the precise relation between embezzling states and the notion of embezzling families, as originally defined by van Dam and Hayden, was left open. Here, we show that finite-dimensional approximations of multipartite embezzling states form multipartite embezzling families. In contrast, not every embezzling family converges to an embezzling state. We identify an additional consistency condition that ensures that an embezzling family converges to an embezzling state. This criterion distinguishes the embezzling family of van Dam and Hayden from the one by Leung, Toner, and Watrous. The latter generalizes to the multipartite setting. By taking a limit, we obtain a multipartite system of commuting type III$_1$ factors on which every state is an embezzling state. We discuss our results in the context of quantum field theory and quantum many-body physics. As open problems, we ask whether vacua of relativistic quantum fields in more than two spacetime dimensions are multipartite embezzling states and whether multipartite embezzlement allows for an operator-algebraic characterization.</p>

            <p>Solid-state spin systems hold great promise for quantum information processing and the construction of quantum networks. However, the considerable inhomogeneity of spins in solids poses a significant challenge to the scaling of solid-state quantum systems. A practical protocol to individually control and entangle spins remains elusive. To this end, we propose a hybrid spin-phonon architecture based on spin-embedded SiC optomechanical crystal (OMC) cavities, which integrates photonic and phononic channels allowing for interactions between multiple spins. With a Raman-facilitated process, the OMC cavities support coupling between the spin and the zero-point motion of the OMC cavity mode reaching 0.57 MHz, facilitating phonon preparation and spin Rabi swap processes. Based on this, we develop a spin-phonon interface that achieves a two-qubit controlled-Z gate with a simulated fidelity of $96.80\%$ and efficiently generates highly entangled Dicke states with over $99\%$ fidelity, by engineering the strongly coupled spin-phonon dark state which is robust against loss from excited state relaxation as well as spectral inhomogeneity of the defect centers. This provides a hybrid platform for exploring spin entanglement with potential scalability and full connectivity in addition to an optical link, and offers a pathway to investigate quantum acoustics in solid-state systems.</p>

            <p>Machine learning offers a promising methodology to tackle complex challenges in quantum physics. In the realm of quantum batteries (QBs), model construction and performance optimization are central tasks. Here, we propose a cavity-Heisenberg spin chain quantum battery (QB) model with spin-$j (j=1/2,1,3/2)$ and investigate the charging performance under both closed and open quantum cases, considering spin-spin interactions, ambient temperature, and cavity dissipation. It is shown that the charging energy and power of QB are significantly improved with the spin size. By employing a reinforcement learning algorithm to modulate the cavity-battery coupling, we further optimize the QB performance, enabling the stored energy to approach, even exceed its upper bound in the absence of spin-spin interaction. We analyze the optimization mechanism and find an intrinsic relationship between cavity-spin entanglement and charging performance: increased entanglement enhances the charging energy in closed systems, whereas the opposite effect occurs in open systems. Our results provide a possible scheme for design and optimization of QBs.</p>

            <p>TThe organization and structure of bipartite mixed-state quantum entanglement (QE) are more complex and less well understood compared to bipartite pure-state QE. Bipartite mixed-state QEs and their measures play a crucial role in both theory and practical applications. Some existing measures involve quantifying the minimum QE and reflect the inherently complex nature of their computation, while others are only applicable to highly limited-dimensional quantum systems. In this context, we propose a method termed Reduction-induced Variation of Partial Von Neumann Entropy to quantify QE in any bipartite states, particularly focusing on bipartite mixed states. Partial Von Neumann Entropy is merely a special case of this method,Its intuitive and clear physical representation, along with easy computation and wide applicability, facilitates exploring its potential applications. Furthermore, we present examples to demonstrate the superiorities of this method in identifying bipartite QE by comparing with other existing bipartite mixed-state QE measures through both their physical implications and mathematical structures.</p>

We improve previous Hubbard model commutator bounds, further provide tight commutator bounds for periodic extended Hubbard models, and demonstrate the use of tensor network methods for this task. We consider applications of Tile Trotterization to simulate hexagonal lattice Hubbard models and compare the resource requirements of Tile Trotterization for performing quantum phase estimation to a qubitization-based approach, demonstrating that Tile Trotterization scales more efficiently with system size. These advancements significantly broaden the potential applications of early fault-tolerant quantum computers to models of practical interest in materials research and organic chemistry.</p>

            <h2>Randomized Benchmarking with Leakage Errors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi-Hsiang Chen, Charles H. Baldwin</p>
            <p>Leakage errors are unwanted transfer of population outside of a defined computational subspace and they occur in almost every platform for quantum computing. While prevalent, leakage is often overlooked when measuring and reporting the fidelity of quantum gates with standard methods. In fact, when leakage is substantial it can cause a large overestimation of fidelity from the typi- cal method used to measure fidelity, randomized benchmarking. We provide several methods for properly estimating fidelity in the presence of leakage errors that are applicable in different error regimes with carefully chosen sequence lengths. Then, we numerically demonstrate the methods for two-qubit randomized benchmarking, which often have the largest errors. Finally, we reanalyze previously shared data from Quantinuum systems with some of the methods provided.</p>

            <h2>Revealing quantum operator scrambling via measuring Holevo information on digital quantum simulators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bin Sun, Geng-Bin Cao, Xi-Dan Hu, Dan-Bo Zhang</p>
            <p>Quantum operator scrambling describes the spreading of local operators into the whole system in the picture of Heisenberg evolution, which is often quantified by the operator size growth. Here we propose a measure of quantum operator scrambling via Holevo information of operators, by taking its capacity to distinguish operator information locally. We show that the operator size is closely related to a special kind of Holevo information of operators. Moreover, we propose a feasible protocol for measuring Holevo information of operators on digital quantum simulators based on random states. \textcolor{black}{For the mixed-field Ising model,} our numerical simulations show that the integrable system can be told apart from the chaotic system by measuring the spatial-temporal patterns of Holevo information. Furthermore, we find that error mitigation is required to restore the time-oscillation behavior of Holevo information for the integrable system, a crucial feature distinct from the chaotic one. Our work provides a new perspective to understand the information scrambling and quantum chaos from aspects of Holevo information of operators.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dmitry Melnikov</p>
            <p>These notes review a description of quantum mechanics in terms of the topology of spaces, basing on the axioms of Topological Quantum Field Theory and path integral formalism. In this description quantum states and operators are encoded by the topology of spaces that are used as modules to build the quantum mechanical model, while expectation values and probabilities are given by topological invariants of spaces, knots and links. The notes focus on the specific way the topology encodes quantum mechanical features, or, equivalently, on how these features can be controlled through the topology. A topological classification of entanglement is discussed, as well as properties of entanglement entropy and basic quantum protocols. The primary aim is to build a less conventional diagrammatic intuition about quantum mechanics, expanding the paradigm of ``Quantum Picturalism".</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthew Brooks, Foster Sabatino, Charles Tahan, Silas Hoffman</p>
            <p>While the adiabatic exchange of Majorana zero modes (MZMs) enables a non-universal set of geometrically protected gates, realising an experimental implementation of MZM braiding remains challenging. In an alternative proposal, charge-parity measurement of two neighboring MZMs supports braiding by teleportation. Moreover, owing to the lack of definitive evidence of MZMs in semiconducting systems, there have been several simulations of MZMs on NISQ devices which more naturally lend themselves to braiding. In this work, measurement-based braiding about MZM Y-junctions are simulated by multi-qubit Pauli-parity measurements of a logical qubit. Logical single-qubit geometric $S^{(\dagger)}$-gates and entangling two-qubit gates is shown using two-physical-qubit joint measurements alone, whilst partial phase rotations such as a $T^{(\dagger)}$-gates require at least one three-qubit joint measurement. These relatively small scale circuits offer both novel measurement-based geometric gates as well as a measurement-based demonstration of quantum Hamiltonian simulation.</p>

            <h2>Quantum synchronization blockade induced by nonreciprocal coupling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tobias Kehrer, Christoph Bruder</p>
            <p>Recently, the synchronization of coupled quantum oscillators has attracted a great deal of interest. Synchronization requires driven constituents, and in such systems, the coupling can be designed to be nonreciprocal. Nonreciprocally coupled oscillators exhibit a rich variety of behavior including active traveling-wave-type states. In this work, we study the interplay of three competing synchronization mechanisms in a setup of two nonreciprocally coupled quantum van der Pol oscillators. One of the oscillators is driven externally which induces phase locking. A dissipative interaction leads to antiphase locking, whereas a coherent interaction nurtures bistable phase locking and active states. We approximate the phase diagram of the quantum case by evaluating the synchronization measure of a perturbation expansion of the steady state. Effective unidirectional interactions lead to synchronization blockades between the undriven oscillator and the external drive as well as between both oscillators. Furthermore, we study the phase diagrams of two and three oscillators in the mean-field limit and find highly nontrivial active states.</p>

By leveraging Uhlmann's lemma and quantum Pinsker inequalities, the authors establish tighter bounds for information-theoretic security, demonstrating that quantum protocols inherently outperform classical counterparts in balancing privacy and efficiency. Also explores symmetric Quantum Private Information Retrieval (QPIR) protocols that achieve sub-linear communication complexity while ensuring robustness against specious adversaries: A post-quantum cryptography based protocol that can be authenticated for the specious server; A ring-LWE-based protocol for post-quantum security in a single-server setting, ensuring robustness against quantum attacks; A multi-server protocol optimized for hardware practicality, reducing implementation overhead while maintaining sub-linear efficiency. These protocols address critical gaps in secure database queries, offering exponential communication improvements over classical linear-complexity methods. The work also analyzes security trade-offs under quantum specious adversaries, providing theoretical guarantees for privacy and correctness.</p>

            <p>The Quantum Internet, a network of quantum-enabled infrastructure, represents the next frontier in telecommunications, promising capabilities that cannot be attained by classical counterparts. A crucial step in realizing such large-scale quantum networks is the integration of entanglement distribution within existing telecommunication infrastructure. Here, we demonstrate a real-world scalable quantum networking testbed deployed within Deutsche Telekom's metropolitan fibers in Berlin. Using commercially available quantum devices and standard add-drop multiplexing hardware, we distributed polarization-entangled photon pairs over dynamically selectable fiber paths ranging from 10~m to 60 km, and showed entanglement distribution over up to approximately 100~km. Quantum signals, transmitted at 1324~nm (O-band), coexist with conventional bidirectional C-band traffic without dedicated fibers or infrastructure changes. Active stabilization of the polarization enables robust long-term performance, achieving entanglement Bell-state fidelity bounds between 85-99% and Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt parameter $S$-values between 2.36-2.74 during continuous multiday operation. By achieving a high-fidelity entanglement distribution with less than 1.5% downtime, we confirm the feasibility of hybrid quantum-classical networks under real-world conditions at the metropolitan scale. These results establish deployment benchmarks and provide a practical roadmap for telecom operators to integrate quantum capabilities.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pervez Hoodbhoy, M. Haashir Ismail, M. Mufassir</p>
            <p>Coupled instantons are introduced by generalizing the double well potential to multiple mutually coupled wells. Physically this corresponds to the simultaneous tunneling of multiple degrees of freedom. A system with four equal minima is examined in detail. It has three instanton types or flavors with distinct actions. For weak coupling and subject to there being a single large (or small) parameter, the interactive system can be handled perturbatively. The zero mode problem arising from time translation symmetry is handled via the Fadeev-Popov procedure. A diagrammatic procedure allows corrections to the fluctuation determinant to be calculated systematically. Independent instanton contributions are summed over by extending the dilute gas approximation to three flavors and energy splittings of the lowest four states is calculated. All tunneling amplitudes are concisely expressed in terms of elementary functions. While the model is possibly useful for a variety of physical systems, an application is made here to the tunneling of a composite particle in one dimension.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate how a single heat exchange between a probe thermal qubit and multi-qubit thermal machine encoding a Boolean function, can determine whether the function is balanced or constant, thus providing a novel thermodynamic solution to the Deutsch-Jozsa problem. We introduce a thermodynamic model of quantum query complexity, showing how qubit thermal machines can act as oracles, queried via heat exchange with a probe. While the Deutsch-Jozsa problem requires an exponential encoding in the number of oracle bits, we also explore the Bernstein-Vazirani problem, which admits a linear thermal oracle and a single thermal query solution. We establish bounds on the number of samples needed to determine the probe temperature encoding the solution for the Deutsch-Jozsa problem, showing that it remains constant with problem size. Additionally, we propose a proof-of-principle experimental implementation to solve the 3-bit Bernstein-Vazirani problem via thermal kickback.

            <h2>Variational Quantum Algorithm for Solving the Liouvillian Gap</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xu-Dan Xie, Zheng-Yuan Xue, Dan-Bo Zhang</p>
            <p>In open quantum systems, the Liouvillian gap characterizes the relaxation time toward the steady state. However, accurately computing this quantity is notoriously difficult due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space and the non-Hermitian nature of the Liouvillian superoperator. In this work, we propose a variational quantum algorithm for efficiently estimating the Liouvillian gap. By utilizing the Choi-Jamiokowski isomorphism, we reformulate the problem as finding the first excitation energy of an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Our method employs variance minimization with an orthogonality constraint to locate the first excited state and adopts a two-stage optimization scheme to enhance convergence. Moreover, to address scenarios with degenerate steady states, we introduce an iterative energy-offset scanning technique. Numerical simulations on the dissipative XXZ model confirm the accuracy and robustness of our algorithm across a range of system sizes and dissipation strengths. These results demonstrate the promise of variational quantum algorithms for simulating open quantum many-body systems on near-term quantum hardware.</p>

            <p>We establish and analyse the performance and resource requirements of an end-to-end fault-tolerant quantum algorithm for computing the absorption spectrum and population dynamics of photoexcited pyrazine. The quantum circuit construction consists of initial state preparation using uniformly controlled rotations, the time-dependent Hamiltonian propagation based on the grid-based Split Operator Quantum Fourier Transform (SO-QFT) method, and cost-effective measurements including statistical and canonical phase estimation. We use classical emulations to validate the quantum resources required for the task, and propose generalised formulae for the qubit count and gate depth calculation. Simulating the vibronic dynamics of pyrazine in a low-dimensional abstraction requires 17-qubit circuits with a gate depth of $\mathcal{O}(10^4)$, whereas a full-dimensional simulation of pyrazine in 24 modes requires at least 97-qubit circuits with a gate depth of $\mathcal{O}(10^6)$. Our work provides a foundational framework for understanding high-dimensional wavepacket-based quantum simulations of photo-induced dynamics and vibronic spectra, anticipating future applications in the simulation of even larger molecular systems on fault-tolerant quantum computers.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fionnuala Curran, Morteza Moradi, Gabriel Senno, Magdalena Stobinska, Antonio Acín</p>
            <p>Quantum physics exhibits an intrinsic and private form of randomness with no classical counterpart. Any setup for quantum randomness generation involves measurements acting on quantum states. In this work, we consider the following question: Given a quantum measurement, how much randomness can be generated from it? In real life, measurements are noisy and thus contain an additional, extrinsic form of randomness due to ignorance. This extrinsic randomness is not private since, in an adversarial model, it takes the form of quantum side information held by an eavesdropper who can use it to predict the measurement outcomes. Randomness of measurements is then quantified by the guessing probability of this eavesdropper, when minimized over all possible input states. This optimization is in general hard to compute, but we solve it here for any two-outcome qubit measurement and for projective measurements in arbitrary dimension mixed with white noise. We also construct, for a given measured probability distribution, different realizations with (i) a noisy state and noiseless measurement (ii) a noiseless state and noisy measurement and (iii) a noisy state and measurement, and we show that the latter gives an eavesdropper significantly higher guessing power.</p>

            <p>We present a novel framework for Linear Combination of Unitaries (LCU)-style decomposition tailored to structured sparse matrices, which frequently arise in the numerical solution of partial differential equations (PDEs). While LCU is a foundational primitive in both variational and fault-tolerant quantum algorithms, conventional approaches based on the Pauli basis can require a number of terms that scales quadratically with matrix size. We introduce the Sigma basis, a compact set of simple, non-unitary operators that can better capture sparsity and structure, enabling decompositions with only polylogarithmic scaling in the number of terms. We develop both numerical and semi-analytical methods for computing Sigma basis decompositions of arbitrary matrices. Given this new basis is comprised of non-unitary operators, we leverage the concept of unitary completion to design efficient quantum circuits for evaluating observables in variational quantum algorithms and for constructing block encodings in fault-tolerant quantum algorithms. We compare our method to related techniques like unitary dilation, and demonstrate its effectiveness through several PDE examples, showing exponential improvements in decomposition size while retaining circuit efficiency.</p>

            <p>Substitutional nitrogen atoms in a diamond crystal (P1 centers) are, on one hand, a resource for creation of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers, that have been widely employed as nanoscale quantum sensors. On the other hand, P1's electron spin is a source of paramagnetic noise that degrades the NV's performance by shortening its coherence time. Accurate quantification of nitrogen concentration is therefore essential for optimizing diamond-based quantum devices. However, bulk characterization methods based on optical absorption or electron paramagnetic resonance often overlook local variations in nitrogen content. In this work, we use a helium ion microscope to fabricate nanoscale NV center ensembles at predefined sites in a diamond crystal containing low concentrations of nitrogen. We then utilize these NV-based probes to measure the local nitrogen concentration on the level of 230 ppb (atomic parts per billion) using the double electron-electron resonance (DEER) technique. Moreover, by comparing the DEER spectra with numerical simulations, we managed to determine the concentration of other unknown paramagnetic defects created during the ion implantation, reaching 15 ppb depending on the implantation dose.</p>

            <p>Simulating nuclear matter described by quantum chromodynamics using quantum computers is notoriously inefficient because of the assortment of quark degrees of freedom such as matter/antimatter, flavor, color, and spin. Here, we propose to address this resource efficiency challenge by encoding three qubits within individual ytterbium-171 atoms of a neutral atom quantum processor. The three qubits are encoded in three distinct sectors: an electronic "clock" transition, the spin-1/2 nucleus, and the lowest two motional states in one radial direction of the harmonic trapping potential. We develop a family of composite sideband pulses and demonstrate a universal gate set and readout protocol for this three-qubit system. We then apply it to single-flavor quantum chromodynamics in 1+1D axial gauge for which the three qubits directly represent the occupancy of quarks in the three colors. We show that two atoms are sufficient to simulate both vacuum persistence oscillations and string breaking. We consider resource requirements and connections to error detection/correction. Our work is a step towards resource-efficient digital simulation of nuclear matter and opens new opportunities for versatile qubit encoding in neutral atom quantum processors.</p>

            <p>Rydberg atom array experiments have demonstrated the ability to act as powerful quantum simulators, preparing strongly-correlated phases of matter which are challenging to study for conventional computer simulations. A key direction has been the implementation of interactions on frustrated geometries, in an effort to prepare exotic many-body states such as spin liquids and glasses. In this paper, we apply two-dimensional recurrent neural network (RNN) wave functions to study the ground states of Rydberg atom arrays on the kagome lattice. We implement an annealing scheme to find the RNN variational parameters in regions of the phase diagram where exotic phases may occur, corresponding to rough optimization landscapes. For Rydberg atom array Hamiltonians studied previously on the kagome lattice, our RNN ground states show no evidence of exotic spin liquid or emergent glassy behavior. In the latter case, we argue that the presence of a non-zero Edwards-Anderson order parameter is an artifact of the long autocorrelations times experienced with quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations, and we show that autocorrelations can be systematically reduced by increasing numerical effort. This result emphasizes the utility of autoregressive models, such as RNNs, in conjunction with QMC, to explore Rydberg atom array physics on frustrated lattices and beyond.</p>

We show that measurement of the final state distributions for a process that involves only several metastable intermediate states is sufficient to identify the PES that captures the long-range interactions properly. Furthermore, we show that a modest increase in the experimental energy resolution will allow for resolving individual Feshbach resonances and enable a quantitative probe of the interactions at short and intermediate range.</p>

            <p>We establish an analytical criterion for dynamical thermalization within harmonic systems, applicable to both classical and quantum models. Specifically, we prove that thermalization of various observables, such as particle energies in physically relevant random quadratic Hamiltonians, is typical for large systems ($N \gg 1$) with initial conditions drawn from the microcanonical distribution. Moreover, we show that thermalization can also arise from non-typical initial conditions, where only a finite fraction of the normal modes is excited. A different choice of initial conditions, such as all the initial energy localized in a single particle, instead leads to energy equipartition without thermalization. Since the models we consider are integrable, our findings provide a general dynamical basis for an approach to thermalization that bypasses chaos and ergodicity, focusing instead on the physical requirement that thermodynamic observables depend on a large number of normal modes, and build a bridge between the classical and quantum theories of thermalization.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Si-Han Li, Si-Han Shang, Shu-Min Wu</p>
            <p>In a relativistic framework, it is generally accepted that quantum steering of maximally entangled states provide greater advantages in practical applications compared to non-maximally entangled states. In this paper, we investigate quantum steering for four different types of Bell-like states of fermionic modes near the event horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole. In some parameter spaces, the peak of steering asymmetry corresponds to a transition from two-way to one-way steerability for Bell-like states under the influence of the Hawking effect. It is intriguing to find that the fermionic steerability of the maximally entangled states experiences sudden death with the Hawking temperature, while the fermionic steerability of the non-maximally entangled states maintains indefinite persistence at infinite Hawking temperature. In contrast to prior research, this finding suggests that quantum steering of non-maximally entangled states is more advantageous than that of maximally entangled states for processing quantum tasks in the gravitational background. This surprising result overturns the traditional idea of ``the advantage of maximally entangled steering in the relativistic framework" and provides a new perspective for understanding the Hawking effect of the black hole.</p>

            <p>Spin and orbital are two basic degrees of freedom that play significant roles in exploring exotic quantum phases in optical lattices with synthetic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and high orbital bands, respectively. Here, we combine these two crucial ingredients for the first time by proposing a completely new orbital optical Raman lattice scheme to explore exotic high-orbital Bose condensates with Raman-induced SOC in a square lattice. We find that both the SOC and p-orbital interactions influence the condensed state of bosons. Their interplay results in two novel high-orbital many-body quantum phases: the uniform angular momentum superfluid phase, which exhibits a global topological chiral orbital current characterized by a uniform Chern number, and the two-dimensional topological spin-orbital supersolid phase, which is characterized by the spin and orbital angular momentum density wave patterns and topological excitations with opposite Chern numbers, respectively protecting the chiral and antichiral edge modes in the neighboring supersolid clusters. Our scheme may open a new avenue for exploring exotic SOC and high-orbital physics in optical lattices, and is expected to advance the experimental realization of novel supersolids in higher dimensions.</p>

It can further be saturated in two-terminal settings with boxcar-shaped transmission functions and reduces to its classical counterpart in linear response. Upon insertion of a numerical factor, our bound also extends to systems with broken time-reversal symmetry. As an application, we derive trade-off relations between the figures of merit of coherent thermoelectric heat engines and refrigerators, which show that such devices can attain ideal efficiency only at vanishing mean power or diverging power fluctuations. To illustrate our results, we work out a model of a coherent conductor consisting of a chain of quantum dots.</p>

            <p>Diamond lattice magnets, formed by a framework of corner-sharing tetrahedra of magnetic cations, offer unique opportunities to realize novel states of matter for potential utility in information technology. However, research has mostly focused on AB2X4 spinels with Td magnetic ions. This hinders the atomically enabled tunability of competing interactions at different energy scales and the ability to harness many-body electronic states in quantum materials, making the discovery of quantum fluctuations and spin dynamics less accessible. We discover a new material CaCo2TeO6 featuring a diamond lattice of two distinct Oh-Co2+ sites. This material displays strong quantum fluctuations, increased competing magnetic exchange interactions, and field-induced tunability of magnetic structures. The results demonstrate how simple, fundamental refinements in ligand fields can profoundly influence the phase space of quantum matter.</p>

            <h2>Experimental Observation of Single- and Multi-Site Matter-Wave Solitons in 1D Optical Lattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robbie Cruickshank, Francesco Lorenzi, Arthur La Rooij, Ethan Kerr, Timon Hilker, Stefan Kuhr, Luca Salasnich, Elmar Haller</p>
            <p>We report the experimental observation of discrete bright matter-wave solitons with attractive interaction in an optical lattice. Using an accordion lattice with adjustable spacing, we prepare a Bose-Einstein condensate of cesium atoms across a defined number of lattice sites. By quenching the interaction strength and the trapping potential, we generate both single-site and multi-site solitons. Our results reveal the existence and characteristics of these solitons across a range of lattice depths and spacings. We identify stable regions of the solitons, based on interaction strength and lattice properties, and compare these findings with theoretical predictions. The experimental results qualitatively agree with a Gaussian variational model and match quantitatively with numerical simulations of the three-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation, extended with a quintic term to account for the loss of atoms. Our results provide insights into the quench dynamics and collapse mechanisms, paving the way for further studies on transport and dynamical properties of matter-wave solitons in lattices.</p>

            <h2>Zitterbewegung, Momentum and spin dynamics of photon in linear dielectric medium</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adam B. Cahaya</p>
            <p>The momentum of light in dielectric media has been a century-long controversy that continues to attract significant interest. In a linear dielectric medium with refractive index n, the momentum is predicted to be smaller by a factor of n according to Max Abraham, and larger by the same factor according to Hermann Minkowski. By studying the coupled dynamics of electromagnetic waves and dipoles in a dielectric medium, we show that the change in momentum of the dipole, expressed by the Lorentz force, corresponds to the Abraham momentum. On the other hand, the Minkowski momentum arises as the eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian and determines the direction of refraction in accordance with Snell's law. Our model also predicts a zitterbewegung-like oscillation due to helicity mixing between left- and right-handed wave components, mediated by dipole oscillation. These internal wave dynamics may be observable via wavepacket motion or polarization-sensitive measurements.</p>

The electron's anomalous magnetic moment is also included; its effect is expected to be visible in high-resolution experiments. The computed rovibronic energy intervals are in excellent agreement with available high-resolution spectroscopy data, including the rovibronic b $^3\Pi_\mathrm{g}$-state fine structure. Fine-structure splittings are also predicted for the c $^3\Sigma_\mathrm{g}^+$ levels, which have not been fully resolved experimentally, yet.</p>

            <h2>A Hybrid Classical-Quantum Rainbow Table Attack on Human Passwords</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> MA. Khajeian</p>
            <p>Long, human-generated passwords pose significant challenges to both classical and quantum attacks due to their irregular structure and large search space. In this work, we propose an enhanced classical-quantum hybrid attack specifically designed for this scenario. Our approach constructs rainbow tables using dictionary-based password generation augmented with transformation rules that better capture real-world user behavior. These tables are organized into buckets, enabling faster lookup and reduced space complexity. For the search within each bucket, we employ a distributed exact variant of Grover's algorithm. This method provides deterministic success and significantly lower circuit depth, enhancing robustness against noise-particularly depolarizing errors common in near-term quantum devices. Overall, our hybrid framework improves the efficiency and practicality of password recovery for long, human-readable passwords in realistic adversarial settings.</p>

            <h2>Temporal Entanglement from Holographic Entanglement Entropy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michal P. Heller, Fabio Ori, Alexandre Serantes</p>
            <p>Recently, several notions of entanglement in time have emerged as a novel frontier in quantum many-body physics, quantum field theory and gravity. We propose a systematic prescription to characterize temporal entanglement in relativistic quantum field theory in a general state for an arbitrary subregion on a flat, constant-time slice in a flat spacetime. Our prescriptions starts with the standard entanglement entropy of a spatial subregion and amounts to transporting the unchanged subregion to boosted time slices all the way across the light cone when it becomes in general a complex characterization of the corresponding temporal subregion. For holographic quantum field theories, our prescription amounts to an analytic continuation of all codimension-two bulk extremal surfaces satisfying the homology constraint and picking the one with the smallest real value of the area as the leading saddle point. We implement this prescription for holographic conformal field theories in thermal states on both a two-dimensional Lorentzian cylinder and three-dimensional Minkowski space, and show that it leads to results with self-consistent physical properties of temporal entanglement.</p>

            <p>The Josephson junction and shunt capacitor form a transmon qubit, which is the cornerstone of modern quantum computing platforms. For reliable quantum computing, it is important how long a qubit can remain in a superposition of quantum states, which is determined by the coherence time (T1). The coherence time of a qubit effectively sets the "lifetime" of usable quantum information, determining how long quantum computations can be performed before errors occur and information is lost. There are several sources of decoherence in transmon qubits, but the predominant one is generally considered to be dielectric losses in the natural oxide layer formed on the surface of the superconductor. In this paper, we present a numerical study of microwave surface losses in planar superconducting antennas of different transmon qubit designs. An asymptotic method for estimating the energy participation ratio in ultrathin films of nanometer scales is proposed, and estimates are given for the limits of achievable minimum RF losses depending on the electrical properties of the surface oxide and the interface of the qubit with the substrate material.</p>

            <h2>Average-computation benchmarking for local expectation values in digital quantum devices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Flavio Baccari, Pavel Kos, Georgios Styliaris</p>
            <p>As quantum devices progress towards a quantum advantage regime, they become harder to benchmark. A particularly relevant challenge is to assess the quality of the whole computation, beyond testing the performance of each single operation. Here we introduce a scheme for this task that combines the target computation with variants of it, which, when averaged, allow for classically solvable correlation functions. Importantly, the variants exactly preserve the circuit architecture and depth, without simplifying the gates into a classically-simulable set. The method is based on replacing each gate by an ensemble of similar gates, which when averaged together form space-time channels [P. Kos and G. Styliaris, Quantum 7, 1020 (2023)]. We introduce explicit constructions for ensembles producing such channels, all applicable to arbitrary brickwork circuits, and provide a general recipe to find new ones through semidefinite programming. The resulting average computation retains important information about the original circuit and is able to detect noise beyond a Clifford benchmarking regime. Moreover, we provide evidence that estimating average-computation expectation values requires running only a limited number of different circuit realizations.</p>

            <p>In this work, we use path integral techniques to predict the switching rate in a single-mode bistable open quantum system. While analytical expressions are well-known to be accessible for systems subject to Gaussian noise obeying classical detailed balance, we generalize this approach to a class of quantum systems, those which satisfy the recently-introduced hidden time-reversal symmetry [1]. In particular, in the context of quantum computing, we deliver precise estimates of bit-flip error rates in cat-qubit architectures, circumventing the need for costly numerical simulations. Our results open new avenues for exploring switching phenomena in multistable single- and many-body open quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>Secure One-Sided Device-Independent Quantum Key Distribution Under Collective Attacks with Enhanced Robustness</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pritam Roy, Subhankar Bera, A. S. Majumdar</p>
            <p>We study the security of a quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol under the one-sided device-independent (1sDI) setting, which assumes trust in only one party's measurement device. This approach effectively provides a balance between the experimental viability of device-dependent (DD-QKD) and the minimal trust assumptions of device-independent (DI-QKD). An analytical lower bound on the asymptotic key rate is derived to provide security against collective attacks, in which the eavesdropper's information is limited only by the function of observed violation of a linear quantum steering inequality, specifically the three-setting Cavalcanti--Jones--Wiseman--Reid (CJWR) inequality. We provide a closed-form key rate formula by reducing the security analysis to mixtures of Bell-diagonal states by utilizing symmetries of the steering functional. We show that the protocol tolerates higher quantum bit error rates (QBER) than present DI-QKD protocols by benchmarking its performance under depolarizing noise. Furthermore, we explore the impact of detection inefficiencies and show that, in contrast to DI-QKD, which requires near-perfect detection, secure key generation can be achieved even with lower detection efficiency on the untrusted side. These findings demonstrate the viability of using 1sDI-QKD with current technology and highlight its advantages as a steering-based substitute for secure quantum communication.</p>

            <p>The process in which Raman scattering produces correlated Stokes and anti-Stokes radiation is known as Stokes-anti-Stokes (SaS) scattering. It has been shown recently that this process can generate entangled photon pairs, making it a promising tool for quantum optical technologies, but a proper quantum theoretical description was lacking. In this paper, a fully quantum derivation of the electric polarization in a medium with vibrational Raman response, with quantized electromagnetic fields, is developed. Using quantum perturbation theory for Heisenberg operators, we find the solution for the material electric polarization and show that the correlated SaS scattering appears in the first order of perturbation, corresponding to a four-wave mixing phenomenon. We also discuss how to construct the third-order non-linear optical susceptibility for the SaS scattering from the quantum formalism, and show that it coincides with the one derived for classical fields in stimulated Raman.</p>

            <p>Color centers defects in solids, and particularly the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, are crucial physical platforms for quantum technology applications. Therefore, a precise and rigorous numerical modeling of the NV system is indispensable for the continued advancement of the field. Within this context, this work develops a Python software for simulating the NV spin dynamics in pulsed sequences under general experimental conditions, i.e. a digital twin. The library accounts for electromagnetic pulses and other environmental inputs, which are used to solve the system's time-evolution dynamics, resulting in a physical output in the form of a quantum mechanical observable given by the fluorescence. The simulations framework is based on a non-perturbative time-dependent Hamiltonian model, solved in the laboratory frame. Whereby eliminating oversimplifications such as the assumption of instantaneous $\delta$-pulses and rotating wave approximations, our simulations reveal subtle dynamics from the realistic pulse constraints that impact quantum systems. Three use-case examples illustrate the use of the software and validate it by comparing the simulation results with well-established experimental works, relevant to the fields of quantum computing (two-qubit conditional logic gates), sensing (noise resilient dynamical decoupling sequences between NV and couples spins) and networks (teleportation of a quantum state between entangled NVs). Overall, this digital twin delivers a robust and detailed numerical modeling of the NV spin dynamics, with simple and accessible usability, for an extensive application range.</p>

            <p>We investigate a hybrid modeling framework in which a quantum annealer is used to simulate magnetic interactions in molecular qubit lattices inspired by experimentally realizable systems. Using phthalocyanine assemblies as a structurally constrained prototype, we model a continuous deformation from a Lieb to a kagome lattice, revealing frustration-driven disorder and magnetic field-induced reordering in the spin structure. The annealer provides access to observables such as the static structure factor and magnetization over a wide parameter space, enabling the characterization of magnetic arrangements beyond the reach of current molecular architectures. This surrogate modeling approach supports a feedback loop between experiment and programmable quantum hardware, offering a pathway to explore and iteratively design tunable magnetic states in synthetic quantum materials. The synthetic design, structural characterization, and quantum simulation framework established here defines a modular and scalable paradigm for probing the limits of engineered quantum matter across chemistry, condensed matter, and quantum information science.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peng Zhao, Peng Xu, Zheng-Yuan Xue</p>
            <p>Fluxoniums have emerged as a compelling qubit modality for superconducting quantum computing, owing to their strong anharmonicity and high coherence. However, it remains to be seen whether the implementation of high-fidelity entangling gates in a scalable manner will be achieved or not for fluxoniums. Here, we show that fluxonium architectures with tunable plasmon interactions have the capability to implement scalable multi-qubit gates natively while remaining compatible with existing single- and two-qubit gate realizations. Within the architecture, even though qubit states are decoupled, engineered interactions in noncomputational manifolds can facilitate the realization of $(C^{\otimes N})Z$ gates (for $N\geq 2$). This is accomplished by driving qubit-state selective transitions into noncomputational manifolds. Our case studies show that CCZ, CCCZ, and CCCCZ gates with errors of approximately 0.01 (0.001) are achievable, with gate lengths of $50\,(100)\,\text{ns}$, $100\,(250)\,\text{ns}$, and $150\,(300)\,\text{ns}$, respectively. These results underscore the potential of the fluxonium architecture for scalable quantum computation through fast, high-fidelity native multi-qubit gates.</p>

This is achieved by explicitly treating two cavity modes in our calculation with perpendicular polarizations and demonstrate that this ansatz preserves the symmetry of an unpolarized cavity. Furthermore, exploiting point-group symmetry enables the assignment of polaritonic excited states as well as their targeted calculation. Using our implementation, the aromatic species benzene, fluorobenzene and azulene are investigated. We demonstrate that molecules in unpolarized cavities have a complicated excited-state landscapes with a plethora of avoided-crossings. We compare the results for a cavity with a single polarization to those of an unpolarized cavity described by two perpendicular polarization vectors using the excited states of the H$_2$ molecule as an example.</p>

            <p>Multimode multiphoton states are at the center of many photonic quantum technologies, from photonic quantum computing to quantum sensing. In this work, we derive a procedure to generate exactly, and with a controlled number of steps, any such state by using only multiport interferometers, photon number resolving detectors, photon additions, and displacements. We achieve this goal by establishing a connection between photonic quantum state engineering and the algebraic problem of symmetric tensor decomposition. This connection allows us to solve the problem by using corresponding results from algebraic geometry and unveils a mechanism of photon catalysis, where photons are injected and subsequently retrieved in measurements, to generate entanglement that cannot be obtained through Gaussian operations. We also introduce a tensor decomposition, that generalizes our method and allows to construct optimal circuits for particular classes of states. As a benchmark, we numerically evaluate our method and compare its performance with state-of-the art results, confirming 100% fidelity on different classes of states.</p>

            <p>Quantum photon pairs play a pivotal role in many quantum applications. Metasurfaces, two-dimensional arrays of nanostructures, have been studied intensively to enhance and control pair generation via spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC). Van der Waals (VdW) layered materials have emerged as promising candidates for nonlinear materials in quantum light sources, owing to their high nonlinear susceptibility and compatibility with on-chip integration. In this work, we present the first demonstration of SPDC from a metasurface composed of the VdW material 3R-MoS2. The nanoresonators support quasi-bound states in the continuum (qBIC) with a quality factor of up to 120, enhancing light-matter interactions. This design achieves a 20-fold increase in SPDC rate compared to an unstructured film and significantly higher brightness, resulting in enhanced quantum photon-pair generation.

            <h2>Quantum Beatings in Optical Cavities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ishaan Ganti, Jianshu Cao</p>
            <p>Cavity polaritons, quasiparticles formed by coherent light-matter coupling, are at the heart of fundamental concepts of quantum optics. The quintessential signature of this coherent coupling is the Rabi oscillation, which results from the neglect of the counter-rotating-wave (CRW) effect in the weak-coupling regime. The goal of this letter is to predict resonant beatings that envelop the Rabi oscillation on the second or higher excitation manifold. These polariton beatings arise from the CRW term in the Dicke or Pauli-Fierz model and are directly correlated with the asymmetry in polariton eigenenergies. Our findings highlight the relevance of the CRW effect even in the weak-coupling regime, offer novel perspectives about coherent polariton dynamics, and shed new light on experiments of coupled quantum systems.</p>

            <p>The combination of superconductivity and quantum Hall (QH) effect is regarded as a key milestone in advancing topological quantum computation in solid-state systems. Recent quantum interference studies suggest that QH edge states can effectively mediate a supercurrent across high-quality graphene weak links.

We employ a back-gated graphene Josephson junction, comprising high-mobility CVD-grown graphene encapsulated in hexagonal Boron Nitride (hBN) and contacted by Nb leads. Superconducting pockets are detected persisting beyond the QH onset, up to 2.4 T, hence approaching the upper critical field of the Nb contacts. We observe an approximate $\Phi_0=h/2e$ periodicity of the QH-supercurrent as a function of the magnetic field, indicating superconducting interference in a proximitized percolative phase. These results provide a promising experimental platform to investigate the transport regime of percolative supercurrents, leveraging the flexibility of van der Waals devices.</p>

            <p>Random quantum states have various applications in quantum information science, including quantum cryptography, quantum simulation, and benchmarking quantum devices. In this work, we discover a new ensemble of quantum states that serve as an $\epsilon$-approximate state $t$-design while possessing extremely low entanglement, magic, and coherence. We show that those resources such quantum states can reach their theoretical lower bounds, $\Omega\left(\log (t/\epsilon)\right)$, which are also proven in this work. This implies that for fixed $t$ and $\epsilon$, those resources do not scale with the system size, i.e., $O(1)$ with respect to the total number of qubits $n$ in the system. Moreover, we explicitly construct an ancilla-free shallow quantum circuit for generating such states. To this end, we develop an algorithm that transforms $k$-qubit approximate state designs into $n$-qubit ones through a sequence of multi-controlled gates, without increasing the support size. The depth of such a quantum circuit is $O\left(t [\log t]^3 \log n \log(1/\epsilon)\right)$, which is the most efficient among existing algorithms without ancilla qubits. A class of shallow quantum circuits proposed in our work offers reduced cost for classical simulation of random quantum states, leading to potential applications in various quantum information processing tasks. As a concrete example for demonstrating utility of our algorithm, we propose classical shadow tomography using an $O(1)$-entangled estimator, which can achieve shorter runtime compared to conventional schemes.</p>

            <p>Quantum information processing promises significant advantages over classical methods but remains vulnerable to decoherence induced by environmental interactions and spacetime effects. This work investigates the behavior of Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) as a diagnostic tool for entanglement and parameter estimation in a three-qubit entangled Dirac system subjected to dissipative noisy channels in the curved spacetime of a Schwarzschild black hole. In particular, we examine the influence of the squeezed generalized amplitude damping (SGAD) channel, along with its subchannels -- generalized amplitude damping (GAD) and amplitude damping (AD) -- on the QFI with respect to entanglement weight ($\theta$) and phase ($\phi$) parameters. Our results show that under strong squeezing ($r = 1$), the QFI with respect to $\theta$ becomes completely resistant to variations in the Hawking temperature ($T_H$), while still exhibiting degradation with increasing channel temperature ($T_C$). The QFI decay is significantly slower at $r = 1$ compared to $r = 0$, suggesting that squeezing can function as an error mitigation strategy. For QFI with respect to $\phi$, a transient spike is observed at $T_C = 2$, potentially due to thermal resonance or non-monotonic decoherence, and this behavior is unaffected by $T_H$. Similar patterns are noted in the GAD and AD channels, where $T_C$ consistently dominates as the principal source of decoherence. Overall, the results highlight the intricate interplay between environmental noise, relativistic effects, and quantum error resilience in curved spacetime.</p>

            <p>Pushing the boundaries of measurement precision is central for sensing and metrology, pursued by nonclassical resources such as squeezing, and non-Hermitian degeneracies with distinct spectral response. Their convergence, however, remains challenging. We find extraordinary enhancement of sensitivity by unifying both effects in a general framework for quantum sensing in open systems. At the parametric oscillation threshold and an exceptional point, the sensing precision exhibits a unique quartic scaling with the perturbation strength. The result generalizes to multimode squeezed-state sensors with higher-order exceptional points catered to various quantum sensing platforms.</p>

            <h2>Spatial correlations in four-wave mixing with structured light</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mateus R. L. da Motta, Sandra S. Vianna</p>
            <p>We present a detailed theoretical treatment of four-wave mixing (FWM) in a quantized paraxial framework, capturing the multi-spatial-mode nature of the biphoton state generated in the process. By analyzing the biphoton state both in position and momentum representations, we identify the conditions under which these descriptions become equivalent. We also highlight formal and physical similarities between FWM and spontaneous parametric down-conversion (PDC), showing that the transfer of pump structure to the spatial coincidence profile, an important and well-known characteristic of the biphoton state, carries over naturally to FWM. In addition, our treatment captures the transition from position correlations in the near field to momentum correlations in the far field, reflecting the underlying spatial entanglement. The measures of entanglement, including the spiral bandwidth and the Schmidt rank, are discussed. Our work consolidates known and new results on spatial correlations in FWM and provides a theoretical framework that may support future studies in nonlinear and quantum optics with structured light.</p>

            <h2>Molecular Properties in Quantum-Classical Auxiliary-Field Quantum Monte Carlo: Correlated Sampling with Application to Accurate Nuclear Forces</h2>

            <p>We extend correlated sampling from classical auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo to the quantum-classical (QC-AFQMC) framework, enabling accurate nuclear force computations crucial for geometry optimization and reaction dynamics. Stochastic electronic structure methods typically encounter prohibitive statistical noise when computing gradients via finite differences. To address this, our approach maximizes correlation between nearby geometries by synchronizing random number streams, aligning orbitals, using deterministic integral decompositions, and employing a consistent set of classical shadow measurements defined at a single reference geometry. Crucially, reusing this single, reference-defined shadow ensemble eliminates the need for additional quantum measurements at displaced geometries. Together, these methodological choices substantially reduce statistical variance in computed forces. We validate the method across hydrogen chains, confirming accuracy throughout varying correlation regimes, and demonstrate significant improvements over single-reference methods in force evaluations for N$_2$ and stretched linear H$_4$, particularly in strongly correlated regions where conventional coupled cluster approaches qualitatively fail. Orbital-optimized trial wave functions further boost accuracy for demanding cases such as stretched CO$_2$, without increasing quantum resource requirements. Finally, we apply our methodology to the MEA-CO$_2$ carbon capture reaction, employing quantum information metrics for active space selection and matchgate shadows for efficient overlap evaluations, establishing QC-AFQMC as a robust framework for exploring complex reaction pathways.</p>

            <h2>Advancing the hBN Defects Database through Photophysical Characterization of Bulk hBN</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chanaprom Cholsuk, Sujin Suwanna, Tobias Vogl</p>
            <p>Quantum emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have gained significant attention due to a wide range of defects that offer high quantum efficiency and single-photon purity at room temperature. Most theoretical studies on hBN defects simulate monolayers, as this is computationally cheaper than calculating bulk structures. However, most experimental studies are carried out on multilayer to bulk hBN, which creates additional possibilities for discrepancies between theory and experiment. In this work, we present an extended database of hBN defects that includes a comprehensive set of bulk hBN defects along with their excited-state photophysical properties. The database features over 120 neutral defects, systematically evaluated across charge states ranging from -2 to 2 (600 defects in total). For each defect, the most stable charge and spin configurations are identified and used to compute the zero-phonon line, photoluminescence spectrum, absorption spectrum, Huang-Rhys (HR) factor, interactive radiative lifetimes, transition dipole moments, and polarization characteristics. Our analysis reveals that the electron-phonon coupling strength is primarily influenced by the presence of vacancies, which tend to induce stronger lattice distortions and broaden phonon sidebands. Additionally, correlation analysis shows that while most properties are independent, the HR factor strongly correlates with the configuration coordinates. All data are publicly available at this https URL, along with a new application programming interface (API) to facilitate integration with machine learning workflows. This database is therefore designed to bridge the gap between theory and experiment, aid in the reliable identification of quantum emitters, and support the development of machine-learning-driven approaches in quantum materials research.</p>

            <p>Silicon single-photon detectors (Si SPDs) play a crucial role in detecting single photons in the visible spectrum. For various applications, photon detection efficiency (PDE) is the most critical characteristic for effectively collecting photons. Here, we present a Si SPD with a remarkable PDE of up to 84.4% at 785 nm, supporting multiple operation modes. We design and fabricate a thick-junction Si single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) that enhances the avalanche probability through a backside-illumination structure, while minimizing noise through the design of a doping-compensated avalanche region. To maximize PDE, we implement a readout circuit with a 50 V quenching voltage, enabling operation in free-running, gating, or hybrid modes. The SPAD, along with its readout circuits and affiliated circuits, is integrated into a compact SPD module. In free-running mode, the module achieves a maximum PDE of 84.4%, with a dark count rate of 260 cps, and an afterpulse probability of 2.9% at 268 K. This work provides a practical solution for applications requiring ultra-high-efficiency Si SPD with multiple operation modes.</p>

            <p>Exploring potential empirical manifestations of quantum gravity is a challenging pursuit. In this study, we utilise a lattice representation of a (2+1)D massive gravity toy model interacting with Dirac fermions that can support specific spacetime fluctuations. We focus on the evolution of the fermion's spin due to its coupling to spacetime fluctuations. To monitor their dynamics a minimal model is required that comprises two bosonic modes describing spacetime geometry fluctuations coupled with the spin of the fermion. A possible emulation of this system involves encoding spin degrees of freedom in an atom coupled with a bimodal optical cavity that provides the two bosonic modes. We observe diverse spin evolution patterns based on its interaction with fluctuating spacetime geometry. Our proposal introduces a novel approach for modelling the effect of interactions between quantum gravity and matter that can be probed with current technology.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Machine Learning for Predicting Binding Free Energies in Structure-Based Virtual Screening</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pei-Kun Yang</p>
            <p>In structure-based virtual screening, it is often necessary to evaluate the binding free energy of protein-ligand complexes by considering not only molecular conformations but also how these structures shift and rotate in space. The number of possible combinations grows rapidly and can become overwhelming. While classical computing has limitations in this context, quantum computing offers a promising alternative due to its inherent parallelism. In this study, we introduce a quantum machine learning approach that encodes molecular information into quantum states and processes them using parameterized quantum gates. The model is implemented and trained using PyTorch, and its performance is evaluated under three settings: ideal simulation, limited-shot sampling, and simulations with quantum noise. With six quantum circuit units, the model achieves an RMSD of 2.37 kcal/mol and a Pearson correlation of 0.650. Even when using 100,000 shots, the predictions remain consistent, indicating that the model is compatible with near-term quantum hardware. Although noise slightly reduces accuracy, the ranking of ligand affinities remains largely unchanged. These findings point to a practical and scalable strategy that balances robustness and predictive power, offering a viable path to accelerate virtual screening through moderately deep quantum circuits.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> William Huie, Cianan Conefrey-Shinozaki, Zhubing Jia, Patrick Draper, Jacob P. Covey</p>
            <p>Simulating nuclear matter described by quantum chromodynamics using quantum computers is notoriously inefficient because of the assortment of quark degrees of freedom such as matter/antimatter, flavor, color, and spin. Here, we propose to address this resource efficiency challenge by encoding three qubits within individual ytterbium-171 atoms of a neutral atom quantum processor. The three qubits are encoded in three distinct sectors: an electronic "clock" transition, the spin-1/2 nucleus, and the lowest two motional states in one radial direction of the harmonic trapping potential. We develop a family of composite sideband pulses and demonstrate a universal gate set and readout protocol for this three-qubit system. We then apply it to single-flavor quantum chromodynamics in 1+1D axial gauge for which the three qubits directly represent the occupancy of quarks in the three colors. We show that two atoms are sufficient to simulate both vacuum persistence oscillations and string breaking. We consider resource requirements and connections to error detection/correction. Our work is a step towards resource-efficient digital simulation of nuclear matter and opens new opportunities for versatile qubit encoding in neutral atom quantum processors.</p>

            <p>Quantum states of motion are critical components in the second quantum revolution. We investigate the generation and control of non-Gaussian motional states in a tripartite hybrid quantum system consisting of a collection of qubits coupled to a mechanical resonator, which in turn interacts with an externally driven photonic cavity. This hybrid architecture provides a versatile platform for quantum control by integrating nonlinear interactions and multiple control parameters. Operating in the strong coupling regime, we study the transient dynamics resulting from a time-dependent external drive that has a boxcar profile. Starting from coherent states in both the mechanical and cavity subsystems, we show that this drive protocol, combined with time-independent interaction and frequency configurations, leads to the emergence of highly non-Gaussian quantum states in the intermediary mechanical degree of freedom. These states are characterized by a pronounced negative volume in the Wigner quasi-probability distribution and enhanced quantum Fisher information, indicative of their quantum utility. We systematically analyze the impact of the qubit phase, interaction strengths, and drive parameters on the degree of non-Gaussianity. Our findings underscore the tunability and richness of this hybrid platform, paving the way for advanced quantum state engineering and applications in quantum sensing, metrology, and information processing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gilberto Cunha, Alexandra Ramôa, André Sequeira, Michael de Oliveira, Luís Barbosa</p>
            <p>Reinforcement learning (RL) provides a principled framework for decision-making in partially observable environments, which can be modeled as Markov decision processes and compactly represented through dynamic decision Bayesian networks. Recent advances demonstrate that inference on sparse Bayesian networks can be accelerated using quantum rejection sampling combined with amplitude amplification, leading to a computational speedup in estimating acceptance probabilities.\\ Building on this result, we introduce Quantum Bayesian Reinforcement Learning (QBRL), a hybrid quantum-classical look-ahead algorithm for model-based RL in partially observable environments. We present a rigorous, oracle-free time complexity analysis under fault-tolerant assumptions for the quantum device. Unlike standard treatments that assume a black-box oracle, we explicitly specify the inference process, allowing our bounds to more accurately reflect the true computational cost. We show that, for environments whose dynamics form a sparse Bayesian network, horizon-based near-optimal planning can be achieved sub-quadratically faster through quantum-enhanced belief updates. Furthermore, we present numerical experiments benchmarking QBRL against its classical counterpart on simple yet illustrative decision-making tasks. Our results offer a detailed analysis of how the quantum computational advantage translates into decision-making performance, highlighting that the magnitude of the advantage can vary significantly across different deployment settings.</p>

            <p>We explore how recent advances in the manipulation of single-ion wave packets open new avenues for detecting weak magnetic fields sourced by ultralight dark matter. A trapped ion in a ``Schrödinger cat'' state can be prepared with its spin and motional degrees of freedom entangled and be used as a matter-wave interferometer that is sensitive to the Aharonov-Bohm-like phase shift accumulated by the ion over its trajectory. The result of the spin-motion entanglement is a parametrically-enhanced sensitivity to weak magnetic fields as compared with an un-entangled ion in a trap. Taking into account the relevant boundary conditions, we demonstrate that a single trapped ion can probe unexplored regions of kinetically-mixed dark-photon dark matter parameter space in the $10^{-15}~\text{eV} \lesssim m_{A'} \lesssim 10^{-14}$~eV mass window. We also show how such a table-top quantum device will also serve as a complementary probe of axion-like particle dark matter in the same mass window.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michal P. Heller, Fabio Ori, Alexandre Serantes</p>
            <p>Recently, several notions of entanglement in time have emerged as a novel frontier in quantum many-body physics, quantum field theory and gravity. We propose a systematic prescription to characterize temporal entanglement in relativistic quantum field theory in a general state for an arbitrary subregion on a flat, constant-time slice in a flat spacetime. Our prescriptions starts with the standard entanglement entropy of a spatial subregion and amounts to transporting the unchanged subregion to boosted time slices all the way across the light cone when it becomes in general a complex characterization of the corresponding temporal subregion. For holographic quantum field theories, our prescription amounts to an analytic continuation of all codimension-two bulk extremal surfaces satisfying the homology constraint and picking the one with the smallest real value of the area as the leading saddle point. We implement this prescription for the holographic conformal field theories in thermal states on both a two-dimensional Lorentzian cylinder and three-dimensional Minkowski space, and show that it leads to results with self-consistent physical properties of temporal entanglement.</p>

            <p>Efficient coupling between light and bulk plasmons (BPs) remains a central challenge because of their inherent mode mismatch, limited penetration depth, and pronounced resonant energy mismatch between visible-range photons and BPs. In this work, we demonstrate that ultrafast free electrons can coherently mediate an interaction between electromagnetic fields and BPs at the nanoscale. An electron pulse emitted from the photocathode of ultrafast transmission electron microscope, functions as a quantum intermediary that is capable of simultaneously interacting with the laser field by multiphoton processes and BPs by perturbative scattering. Electron energy-loss spectroscopy can capture this indirect interaction, the final electron energy distribution encodes both quantum pathways arising from distinct combinations of multiphoton absorption and emission and BP scattering events. Interference among these pathways gives rise to characteristic spectral modulations, directly revealing the exchange of energy and information between photons and BPs via the electron delivery. Our results show that femtosecond-driven, ultrafast electrons provide a viable route to modulate and even control bulk plasmon excitations in a volume, thereby extending beyond the conventional nanoplasmonics schemes on manipulating surface plasmons by light. This indirect light-BP interaction paves the promising way for exploring fundamental light-matter interaction at ultrafast and nanometer scales.</p>

            <p>Due to the merits of high efficiency and strong security against timing and side-channel attacks, ChaCha has been widely applied in real-time communication and data streaming scenarios. However, with the rapid development of AI-assisted cryptanalysis and quantum computing technologies, there are serious challenges to the secure implementation of ChaCha cipher. To further strengthen the security of ChaCha cipher, we propose an improved variant based on quantum random numbers, i.e., Quantum Random Number Enhanced ChaCha (QRE-ChaCha). Specifically, the design XORs the initial constants with quantum random numbers and periodically injects quantum random numbers into selected state words during odd rounds to enhance diffusion. Compared with the original ChaCha, the present variant shows stronger resistance to differential attacks and generates a keystream with statistical randomness, thereby offering increased robustness against both classical and quantum attacks. To evaluate the security and performance of the present ChaCha, our analysis proceeds in three main parts. Firstly, we analyze its theoretical security in terms of quantum randomness and attack testing, and conduct differential cryptanalysis with an automated search method based on the Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT). Secondly, we subject the keystream generated by the cipher to randomness tests using the NIST statistical test suite and the GM/T 0005-2021 randomness testing standard. Finally, we assess its encryption and decryption performance by measuring its encryption speed on files of various sizes. According to the results, the present ChaCha is significantly improved to resist differential attacks while maintaining the high efficiency of the original ChaCha cipher, and its keystream successfully passes statistical randomness tests using the NIST and GM/T 0005-2021 standards, meeting cryptographic application requirements.</p>

            <p>Quantum chemistry is a key target for quantum computing, but benchmarking quantum algorithms for large molecular systems remains challenging due to the lack of exactly solvable yet structurally realistic models. In particular, molecular Hamiltonians typically contain $O(N^4)$ Pauli terms, significantly increasing the cost of quantum simulations, while many exactly solvable models, such as the one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard (1D FH) model, contain only $O(N)$ terms. In this work, we introduce the orbital-rotated Fermi-Hubbard (ORFH) model as a scalable and exactly solvable benchmarking problem for quantum chemistry algorithms. Starting from the 1D FH model, we apply a spin-involved orbital rotation to construct a Hamiltonian that retains the exact ground-state energy but exhibits a Pauli term count scaling as $O(N^4)$, similar to real molecular systems. We analyze the ORFH Hamiltonian from multiple perspectives, including operator norm and electronic correlation. We benchmark variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) optimizers and Pauli term grouping methods, and compare their performance with those for hydrogen chains. Furthermore, we show that the ORFH Hamiltonian increases the computational difficulty for classical methods such as the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), offering a nontrivial benchmark beyond quantum algorithms. Our results demonstrate that the ORFH model provides a versatile and scalable testbed for benchmarking quantum chemistry algorithms under realistic structural conditions, while maintaining exact solvability even at large system sizes.</p>

            <p>A non-local quantum computation (NLQC) replaces an interaction between two quantum systems with a single simultaneous round of communication and shared entanglement. We study two classes of NLQC, $f$-routing and $f$-BB84, which are of relevance to classical information theoretic cryptography and quantum position-verification. We give the first non-trivial lower bounds on entanglement in both settings, but are restricted to lower bounding protocols with perfect correctness. Within this setting, we give a lower bound on the Schmidt rank of any entangled state that completes these tasks for a given function $f(x,y)$ in terms of the rank of a matrix $g(x,y)$ whose entries are zero when $f(x,y)=0$, and strictly positive otherwise. This also leads to a lower bound on the Schmidt rank in terms of the non-deterministic quantum communication complexity of $f(x,y)$. Because of a relationship between $f$-routing and the conditional disclosure of secrets (CDS) primitive studied in information theoretic cryptography, we obtain a new technique for lower bounding the randomness complexity of CDS.</p>

The construction of the quantum oracle is based exclusively on multicontrolled Toffoli (MCX) gates and quantum NOT (Pauli-$X$) gates. The efficiency of the algorithm is evaluated by comparison with a quantum algorithm based on binary clauses. Furthermore, we analyse the impact of traspilation and introduce an appropriate metric to assess the complexity of the algorithm, the \emph{quantum circuit area}. We explicitly analyse three-, four- and five-eloop topologies, which have not previously been explored due to their higher complexity and the current limitations of quantum simulators.</p>

            <p>Quantum Information scrambling (QI-scrambling) is a pivotal area of inquiry within the study of quantum many-body systems. This research derives mathematical upper and lower bounds for the scrambling rate by applying the Maligranda inequality. Our results indicate that the upper bounds, lower bounds, and scrambling rates coincide precisely when local operators exhibit to be unitary-Hermitian. Crucially, the convergence or divergence of these upper and lower bounds relative to the scrambling rate is contingent upon the system's initial state. The spin-star model to validate this theoretical framework is investigated, considering thermal and pure initial states. The implantation of the ancilla or external qubit aligns the scrambling rate with the established bounds. The upper and lower bounds may diverge from the scrambling rate based on the system's initial state when both local operators are multi-quit systems. The scrambling rate found grows with the increase of the qubit number in local operators.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christopher Gerhard, Todd A. Brun</p>
            <p>Many current quantum error-correcting codes that achieve full fault tolerance suffer from having low ratios of logical to physical qubits and significant overhead. This makes them difficult to implement on current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers and results in the inability to perform quantum algorithms at useful scales with near-term quantum processors. As a result, calculations are generally done without encoding. We propose a middle ground between these two approaches: constructions in the $[[n,n-2,2]]$ quantum error-detecting code that can detect any error from a single faulty gate by measuring the stabilizer generators of the code and additional ancillas at the end of the computation. This achieves weak fault tolerance. As we show, this yields a significant improvement over no error correction for small computations with low enough physical error probabilities and requires much less overhead than codes that achieve full fault tolerance. We give constructions for a set of gates that achieve universal quantum computation in this error-detecting code, while satisfying weak fault tolerance up to analog imprecision on the physical rotation gate.</p>

            <p>The generation and manipulation of multipartite entanglement and EPR steering in macroscopic systems not only play a fundamental role in exploring the nature of quantum mechanics, but are also at the core of current developments of various nascent quantum technologies. Here we report a theoretical method using squeezing-phase-controlled quantum noise flows to selectively generate and manipulate quantum entanglement and asymmetric EPR steering in a nonlinear $\chi^{(2)}$ whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) optomechanical resonator. We show that by pumping the $\chi^{(2)}$ nonlinear medium with two-photon optical fields and broadband squeezed lights, a pair of counterpropagating squeezed optical modes could be introduced to the WGM resonator, each coupled with an independent squeezed vacuum reservoir. This configuration could enable squeezing-phase-controlled light-reservoir interaction for each squeezed optical mode, providing a flexible tool for tailoring asymmetric optical noise flows in the counterpropagating modes. Based on this unique feature, it is found that with the injection of asymmetric noise flows, the generation of various types of bipartite and tripartite entanglement become phase-dependent and thus they can be produced in an asymmetric way. More excitingly, it is also found that by further properly adjusting the squeezing parameters, the overall asymmetry of EPR steering can also be stepwise driven from no-way regime, one-way regime to two-way regime. These findings, holding promise for preparing rich types of entangled quantum resources with asymmetric features, may have potential applications in the area of secure quantum information processing such as quantum secure direct communication and one-way quantum computing.</p>

            <p>Analysis of quantum processes, especially in the context of noise, errors, and decoherence is essential for the improvement of quantum devices. An intuitive representation of those processes modeled by quantum channels are Pauli transfer matrices. They display the action of a linear map in the $n$-qubit Pauli basis in a way, that is more intuitive, since Pauli strings are more tangible objects than the standard basis matrices. We set out to investigate classical algorithms that convert the various representations into Pauli transfer matrices. We propose new algorithms that make explicit use of the tensor product structure of the Pauli basis. They convert a quantum channel in a given representation (Chi or process matrix, Choi matrix, superoperator, or Kraus operators) to the corresponding Pauli transfer matrix. Moreover, the underlying principle can also be used to calculate the Pauli transfer matrix of other linear operations over $n$-qubit matrices such as left-, right-, and sandwich multiplication as well as forming the (anti-)commutator with a given operator. Finally, we investigate the runtime of these algorithms, derive their asymptotic scaling and demonstrate improved performance using instances with up to seven qubits.</p>

            <p>To demonstrate supremacy of quantum computing, increasingly large-scale superconducting quantum computing chips are being designed and fabricated. However, the complexity of simulating quantum systems poses a significant challenge to computer-aided design of quantum chips, especially for large-scale chips. Harnessing the scalability of graph neural networks (GNNs), we here propose a parameter designing algorithm for large-scale superconducting quantum circuits. The algorithm depends on the so-called 'three-stair scaling' mechanism, which comprises two neural-network models: an evaluator supervisedly trained on small-scale circuits for applying to medium-scale circuits, and a designer unsupervisedly trained on medium-scale circuits for applying to large-scale ones. We demonstrate our algorithm in mitigating quantum crosstalk errors. Frequencies for both single- and two-qubit gates (corresponding to the parameters of nodes and edges) are considered simultaneously. Numerical results indicate that the well-trained designer achieves notable advantages in efficiency, effectiveness, and scalability. For example, for large-scale superconducting quantum circuits consisting of around 870 qubits, our GNNs-based algorithm achieves 51% of the errors produced by the state-of-the-art algorithm, with a time reduction from 90 min to 27 sec. Overall, a better-performing and more scalable algorithm for designing parameters of superconducting quantum chips is proposed, which initially demonstrates the advantages of applying GNNs in superconducting quantum chips.</p>

            <h2>Non-Variational Quantum Random Access Optimization with Alternating Operator Ansatz</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zichang He, Rudy Raymond, Ruslan Shaydulin, Marco Pistoia</p>
            <p>Solving hard optimization problems is one of the most promising application domains for quantum computers due to the ubiquity of such problems in industry and the availability of broadly applicable quantum speedups. However, the ability of near-term quantum computers to tackle industrial-scale optimization problems is limited by their size and the overheads of quantum error correction. Quantum Random Access Optimization (QRAO) has been proposed to reduce the space requirements of quantum optimization. However, to date QRAO has only been implemented using variational algorithms, which suffer from the need to train instance-specific variational parameters, making them difficult to scale. We propose and benchmark a non-variational approach to QRAO based on the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA) for the MaxCut problem. We show that instance-independent ``fixed" parameters achieve good performance, removing the need for variational parameter optimization. Additionally, we evaluate different design choices, such as various mixers, initial states, and QRAO-specific implementations of the QAOA cost operator, and identify a strategy that performs well in practice. Our results pave the way for the practical execution of QRAO on early fault-tolerant quantum computers.</p>

            <h2>Role of Nonstabilizerness in Quantum Optimization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chiara Capecci, Gopal Chandra Santra, Alberto Bottarelli, Emanuele Tirrito, Philipp Hauke</p>
            <p>Quantum optimization has emerged as a promising approach for tackling complicated classical optimization problems using quantum devices. However, the extent to which such algorithms harness genuine quantum resources and the role of these resources in their success remain open questions. In this work, we investigate the resource requirements of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) through the lens of the resource theory of nonstabilizerness. We demonstrate that the nonstabilizerness in QAOA increases with circuit depth before it reaches a maximum, to fall again during the approach to the final solution state -- creating a barrier that limits the algorithm's capability for shallow circuits. We find curves corresponding to different depths to collapse under a simple rescaling, and we reveal a nontrivial relationship between the final nonstabilizerness and the success probability. Finally, we identify a similar nonstabilizerness barrier also in adiabatic quantum annealing. Our results provide deeper insights into how quantum resources influence quantum optimization.</p>

            <h2>Evidence of Memory Effects in the Dynamics of Two-Level System Defect Ensembles Using Broadband, Cryogenic Transient Dielectric Spectroscopy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qianxu Wang, Sara Magdalena Gómez, Juan S. Salcedo-Gallo, Roy Leibovitz, Jake Freeman, Salil Bedkihal, Mattias Fitzpatrick</p>
            <p>Two-level system (TLS) defects in dielectrics are a major source of decoherence in superconducting circuits, yet their atomistic origin, frequency distribution, and dipole moments remain poorly understood. Current probes, which are predominantly based on qubits or resonators, require complex fabrication and only measure defects within a narrow frequency band and limited mode volume, hindering direct insight into TLS defect behaviour in isolated materials and interfaces. Here, we introduce a broadband 3D waveguide spectroscopy technique that enables cryogenic probing of ensembles of TLS defects that we call Broadband Cryogenic Transient Dielectric Spectroscopy (BCTDS). Complementary to the dielectric dipper method, this approach probes a broader spectrum and reveals interference of drive-induced sidebands of the ensembles of TLS defects. The broadband and power-tunable nature of BCTDS makes it especially well-suited to the study of dressed-state physics in driven ensembles of TLS defects, including multi-photon processes and sideband-resolved dynamics. Additionally, BCTDS enables the identification of eigenmode frequencies of the undriven ensembles of TLS defects through characteristic V-shaped features obtained via Fourier analysis of time-domain signals, and shows evidence of memory effects arising from interactions and the broadband nature of our approach. Crucially, our method is modular and can be applied throughout the device fabrication process, informing mitigation strategies and advancing the design of low-loss materials with broad implications for quantum technologies and materials science.</p>

            <h2>Entropic Dynamics approach to Relational Quantum Mechanics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ariel Caticha, Hassaan Saleem</p>
            <p>The general framework of Entropic Dynamics (ED) is used to construct non-relativistic models of relational quantum mechanics from well known inference principles - probability, entropy and information geometry. Although only partially relational - the absolute structures of simultaneity and Euclidean geometry are still retained - these models provide a useful testing ground for ideas that will prove useful in the context of more realistic relativistic theories. The fact that in ED the positions of particles have definite values, just as in classical mechanics, has allowed us to adapt to the quantum case some intuitions from Barbour and Bertotti's classical framework. Here, however, we propose a new measure of the mismatch between successive states that is adapted to the information metric and the symplectic structures of the quantum phase space. We make explicit that ED is temporally relational and we construct non-relativistic quantum models that are spatially relational with respect to rigid translations and rotations. The ED approach settles the longstanding question of what form should the constraints of a classical theory take after quantization: the quantum constraints that express relationality are to be imposed on expectation values. To highlight the potential impact of these developments, the non-relativistic quantum model is parametrized into a generally covariant form and we show that the ED approach evades the analogue of what in quantum gravity has been called the problem of time.</p>

            <p>While quantum annealers have emerged as versatile and controllable platforms for experimenting on correlated spin systems, the important phenomenology of magnetic memory and hysteresis remain unexplored on hardware designed to escape metastable states via quantum tunneling. Here, we present the first general protocol to experiment on magnetic hysteresis on programmable quantum annealers, and implement it on three D-Wave superconducting qubit quantum annealers, using up to thousands of spins, for both ferromagnetic and disordered Ising models, and across different graph topologies. We observe hysteresis loops whose area depends non-monotonically on quantum fluctuations, exhibiting both expected and unexpected features, such as disorder-induced steps and non-monotonicities. Our work establishes quantum annealers as a platform for probing non-equilibrium emergent magnetic phenomena, thereby broadening the role of analog quantum computers into foundational questions in condensed matter physics.</p>

Finally, the total theoretical-security analysis against the THA side channel considering the spectral reflectance and transmittance data over this spectral range is conducted. To the best of our knowledge, our OTDR setup and the corresponding results are the first of their kind in a wide spectral range.</p>

            <p>By combining the assumption of Bell locality with that of generalized noncontextuality, we define different classes of noncontextuality inequalities for correlations in a bipartite Bell scenario. These classes are distinguished by which operational identities are enforced, where certain natural subsets form a hierarchy and provide a new way to understand and classify different forms of quantum correlations. Specifically, we show that violations of inequalities at different levels of this hierarchy can serve as witnesses to determine whether a bipartite quantum state exhibits entanglement, steering, or nonlocality, thereby giving a systematic and unified method for certifying these distinct bipartite quantum resources. To illustrate the power of this approach, we demonstrate the violation of one such inequality in an experiment with polarization-entangled photons. This experimental implementation enables us to certify entanglement in certain two-qubit isotropic states for which certification by Bell or steering inequalities is known to be impossible. Our entanglement certification scheme is the first to combine all of the following desirable features: it requires no prior characterization of the measurements, it delivers a verdict based on quantities that are independent of the tomographic gauge freedom, and it is able to certify {\em any} entangled state without requiring any auxiliary entangled sources.</p>

            <h2>Quantum walks reveal topological flat bands, robust edge states and topological phase transitions in cyclic graphs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dinesh Kumar Panda, Colin Benjamin</p>
            <p>Topological phases, edge states, and flat bands in synthetic quantum systems are a key resource for topological quantum computing and noise-resilient information processing. We introduce a scheme based on step-dependent quantum walks on cyclic graphs, termed cyclic quantum walks (CQWs), to simulate exotic topological phenomena using discrete Fourier transforms and an effective Hamiltonian. Our approach enables the generation of both gapped and gapless topological phases, including Dirac cone-like energy dispersions, topologically nontrivial flat bands, and protected edge states, all without resorting to split-step or split-coin protocols. Odd and even-site cyclic graphs exhibit markedly different spectral characteristics, with rotationally symmetric flat bands emerging exclusively in $4n$-site graphs ($n\in \mathbf{N}$). We analytically establish the conditions for the emergence of topological, gapped flat bands and show that gap closings in rotation space imply the formation of Dirac cones in momentum space. Further, we engineer protected edge states at the interface between distinct topological phases in both odd and even cycle graphs. We numerically demonstrate that the edge states are robust against moderate static and dynamic gate disorder and remain stable against phase-preserving perturbations. This scheme serves as a resource-efficient and versatile platform for engineering topological phases, transitions, edge states, and flat bands in quantum systems, opening new avenues for fault-tolerant quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>Pauli spin blockade (PSB) is a spin-dependent charge transport process that typically appears in double quantum dot (QD) devices and is employed in fundamental research on single spins in nanostructures to read out semiconductor qubits. The operating temperature of PSB is limited by that of the QDs and remains below 10 K, limiting wide application development. Herein, we confirm that a single deep dopant in the channel of a silicon field effect transistor functions as a room-temperature QD; consequently, transport through two different deep dopants exhibits PSB up to room temperature. The characteristic magnetoconductance provides a means to identify PSB and enables the PSB device to function as a magnetic sensor with a sensitivity below geomagnetic field. Lifting in PSB caused by magnetic resonance (50 K) and Rabi oscillations (10 K) are also observed. Further development of this unique system may lead to room-temperature quantum technologies based on silicon technology.</p>

            <p>Persistent currents flowing in spatially closed tracks define one of the most iconic concepts in mesoscopic physics. They have been studied in solid-state platforms such as superfluids, superconductors and metals. Cold atoms trapped in magneto-optical toroidal circuits and driven by suitable artificial gauge fields allow us to study persistent currents with unprecedented control and flexibility of the system's physical conditions. Here, we review persistent currents of ultracold matter. Capitalizing on the remarkable progress in driving different atomic species to quantum degeneracy, persistent currents of single or multicomponent bosons/fermions, and their mixtures can be addressed within the present experimental know-how. This way, fundamental concepts of quantum science and many-body physics, like macroscopic quantum coherence, solitons, vortex dynamics, fermionic pairing and BEC-BCS crossover can be studied from a novel perspective. Finally, we discuss how persistent currents can form the basis of new technological applications like matter-wave gyroscopes and interferometers.</p>

            <p>We introduce the complex frequency fingerprint (CFF), an experimentally accessible method for detecting the complex frequency Green's function (GF). Unlike the real frequency GF, where $\omega$ is real, this complex frequency GF is shown to play a necessary role in both non-Hermitian and quantum many-body systems. For non-Hermitian systems, we will prove that our method detects complex energy spectra, eigenstates, and complex frequency GFs throughout the complex plane, providing necessary identification of the non-Hermitian skin effect. For quantum many-body systems, our method reveals quasiparticle peaks across the complex plane and intuitively illustrates interaction effects. This information is difficult to obtain with real frequency detection. Our method paves the way for exploring exotic phenomena in both non-Hermitian and quantum many-body systems, bridging theory and experiment across diverse physical areas.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shivam Sharma, Amartya S. Banerjee</p>
            <p>In recent years, materials with topological flat bands have attracted significant attention due to their association with extraordinary transport properties and strongly correlated electrons. Yet, generic principles linking lattice architecture, strain, and band topology remain scarce. Here, using a unified graph-theoretic framework we generate entire families of two-dimensional lattices and, using analytical tight-binding calculations, demonstrate that a single mechanical knob -- uniform in-plane strain -- drives universal transitions between trivial insulating, Dirac semimetal, and quantum spin-Hall phases across all lattices. The framework yields several flat band lattices that were hitherto absent or largely unexplored in the literature -- for example, the checkerboard split-graph and triangular-Kagome lattices -- whose strain-driven topological phase diagrams we establish here for the first time. The design rules implied by our studies provide a blueprint for engineering topological states in a wide variety of 2D materials, photonic crystals, and circuit lattices, and are anticipated to accelerate the discovery of strain-programmable quantum matter.</p>

            <p>We identify a three-dimensional system that exhibits long-range entanglement at sufficiently small but nonzero temperature--it therefore constitutes a quantum topological order at finite temperature. The model of interest is known as the fermionic toric code, a variant of the usual 3D toric code, which admits emergent fermionic point-like excitations. The fermionic toric code, importantly, possesses an anomalous 2-form symmetry, associated with the space-like Wilson loops of the fermionic excitations. We argue that it is this symmetry that imbues low-temperature thermal states with a novel topological order and long-range entanglement. Based on the current classification of three-dimensional topological orders, we expect that the low-temperature thermal states of the fermionic toric code belong to an equilibrium phase of matter that only exists at nonzero temperatures. We conjecture that further examples of topological orders at nonzero temperatures are given by discrete gauge theories with anomalous 2-form symmetries. Our work therefore opens the door to studying quantum topological order at nonzero temperature in physically realistic dimensions.</p>

            <p>A tunable magnetic field at low temperatures is essential for numerous applications, including spintronics, magnetic resonance imaging, and condensed matter physics. While commercial superconducting vector magnets are available, they are complex, expensive, and often not adaptable to specific experimental needs. As a result, simple in-house designs are often being used in research environments. However, no comprehensive step-by-step guide for their construction currently exists. In this work, we provide a detailed manual for designing and building a cryogenically compatible three-axis vector magnet. The system is tested at the mixing chamber of a dilution refrigerator at temperatures ranging from 15 mK to 4 K, with no significant increase in base temperature. Safety measures are implemented to mitigate heating from quenching. The coils are successfully driven with DC currents as high as 3 A, generating magnetic fields of up to 2.5 T in the bobbin's bore and 0.4 T at the sample position. Magnetic field measurements using Hall sensors demonstrate good agreement with the predictions of the designed performance.</p>

            <h2>The Integral Decimation Method for Quantum Dynamics and Statistical Mechanics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryan T. Grimm, Alexander J. Staat, Joel D. Eaves</p>
            <p>The solutions to many problems in the mathematical, computational, and physical sciences often involve multidimensional integrals. A direct numerical evaluation of the integral incurs a computational cost that is exponential in the number of dimensions, a phenomenon called the curse of dimensionality. The problem is so substantial that one usually employs sampling methods, like Monte Carlo, to avoid integration altogether. Here, we derive and implement a quantum algorithm to compress a multidimensional integrand into a product of matrix-valued functions - a spectral tensor train - changing the computational complexity of integration from exponential to polynomial. The algorithm compresses the integrand by applying a sequence of quantum gates to an unentangled quantum state, where each term corresponds to a body-ordered term in the potential. Because it allows for the systematic elimination of small contributions to the integral through decimation, we call the method integral decimation. The functions in the spectral basis are analytically differentiable and integrable, and in applications to the partition function, integral decimation numerically factorizes an interacting system into a product of noninteracting ones. We illustrate integral decimation by evaluating the absolute free energy and entropy of a chiral XY model as a continuous function of temperature. We also compute the nonequilibrium time-dependent reduced density matrix of a quantum chain with between two and forty levels, each coupled to colored noise. When other methods provide numerical solutions to these models, they quantitatively agree with integral decimation. When conventional methods become intractable, integral decimation can be a powerful alternative.</p>

            <p>We introduce a covariant canonical quantization for a particle in curved spacetime that tracks operator-ordering ambiguities. Parameterizing spatial and temporal ordering, we derive a Hermitian Hamiltonian with leading quantum-relativistic corrections. In a uniformly accelerated frame, we show the semiclassical heat-capacity approximation misses these effects and then develop a perturbative quantum treatment using Airy-function modes to obtain analytical first- and second-order energy shifts. Including these shifts in the partition function yields nontrivial, ordering-dependent specific-heat corrections. Numerical studies for electrons in extreme electric fields and ultra-light particles in strong gravitational fields demonstrate that these corrections become significant at intermediate temperatures. Enforcing the Tolman-Ehrenfest relation for spatial temperature variation further modulates the heat-capacity profile. Our results suggest that precision calorimetry in laser-acceleration or analogue gravity setups could probe quantum-ordering effects in relativistic regimes.</p>

            <p>The Adaptive Variational Quantum Eigensolver (ADAPT-VQE) is a promising approach for quantum algorithms in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, offering advantages over traditional VQE methods by reducing circuit depth and mitigating challenges in classical optimization. However, a major challenge in ADAPT-VQE is the high quantum measurement (shot) overhead required for circuit parameter optimization and operator selection. In this work, we propose two integrated strategies to reduce the shot requirements in ADAPT-VQE. First, we reuse Pauli measurement outcomes obtained during VQE parameter optimization in the subsequent operator selection step of the next ADAPT-VQE iteration, which involves operator gradient measurements. Second, we apply variance-based shot allocation to both Hamiltonian and operator gradient measurements. Our numerical results demonstrate that each method, individually and in combination, significantly reduces the number of shots needed to achieve chemical accuracy while maintaining result fidelity across the studied molecular systems.</p>

            <p>Quantum many-body systems with sufficiently strong disorder can exhibit a non-equilibrium phenomenon, known as the many-body localization (MBL), which is distinct from conventional thermalization. While the MBL regime has been extensively studied in one dimension, its existence in higher dimensions remains elusive, challenged by the avalanche instability. Here, using a 70-qubit two-dimensional (2D) superconducting quantum simulator, we experimentally explore the robustness of the MBL regime in controlled finite-size 2D systems. We observe that the decay of imbalance becomes more pronounced with increasing system sizes, scaling up from 21, 42 to 70 qubits, with a relatively large disorder strength, and for the first time, provide an evidence for the many-body delocalization in 2D disordered systems. Our experimental results are consistent with the avalanche theory that predicts the instability of MBL regime beyond one spatial dimension. This work establishes a scalable platform for probing high-dimensional non-equilibrium phases of matter and their finite-size effects using superconducting quantum circuits.</p>

This advantage can be realized with far lower hardware requirements than purely computational quantum advantage. We explain how several recent proposals and experiments can be understood as quantum computational sensing, and discuss categorizations of the general architectures that quantum-computational-sensing protocols can have.

            <p>Cavity polaritons, quasiparticles formed by coherent light-matter coupling, are at the heart of fundamental concepts of quantum optics. The quintessential signature of this coherent coupling is the Rabi oscillation, which results from the neglect of the counter-rotating-wave (CRW) effect in the weak-coupling regime. The goal of this letter is to predict resonant beatings that envelop the Rabi oscillation on the second or higher excitation manifold. These polariton beatings arise from the CRW term in the Dicke or Pauli-Fierz model and are directly correlated with the asymmetry in polariton eigenenergies. Our findings highlight the relevance of the CRW effect even in the weak-coupling regime, offer novel perspectives about coherent polariton dynamics, and shed new light on experiments of coupled quantum systems.</p>

            <p>The interaction between atoms and a quantized radiation field is fundamentally important in quantum optics and quantum information science. Due to their unusual properties, Rydberg atoms are promising building blocks for two-qubit gates and atom-light quantum interfaces, exploiting the Rydberg blockade interaction, which prevents two atoms at close distance from being simultaneously excited to Rydberg states. Recently, this effect was used to engineer quantum processors based on arrays of interacting Rydberg atoms illuminated by Raman lasers. Motivated by these experiments, we extend the Jaynes-Cummings model to study the interaction between two Rydberg atoms interacting by the Rydberg blockade and a quantized radiation field. We consider both number (Fock) states of the field and single-mode quantum coherent states. In particular, we discuss different types of entanglements between various components of the total system consisting of the two Rydberg-interacting atoms and coherent states of the field, and show that the behavior is significantly different compared to a system with non-interacting atoms corresponding to the two-atom Tavis-Cummings model. Our results are relevant in view of atom-light quantum interfaces as components for future long-distance quantum communication.</p>

Specifically, when the artificial atoms of the array are arranged randomly, the energy and ergotropy of the optical system are shown to decay at a subexponential rate over long periods, in contrast to the energy decay of a single atom in a waveguide. In the case of atoms arranged in an ordered lattice, collective effects slow down dissipative discharging only for a specific lattice spacing. Thus, in both configurations, collective effects can be used to boost the energy-protection properties of optical systems.</p>

            <h2>Hybrid quantum lattice model: Polaritons, photons, and spin waves propagation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maritza Ahumada, Natalia Valderrama-Quinteros, Diego Tancara, Guillermo Romero</p>
            <p>Controlling the propagation of quantum excitations in low-dimensional systems is pivotal for quantum technologies, including communication networks and quantum simulators. We propose a one-dimensional hybrid quantum lattice model, where each lattice unit integrates a single-mode resonator that interacts with a two-level system (TLS), featuring direct coupling between adjacent TLSs. This configuration enables the coherent propagation of polaritons, spin waves, and photons, depending on the interplay between light-matter coupling and qubit-qubit interactions. Employing the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm, we simulate the dynamics of various excitation configurations and analyze their transport characteristics using local observables. Our analysis reveals the importance of matching impedance and resonance conditions via system parameters for the propagation of different types of excitations or swapping the nature of excitations along the hybrid lattice. These findings offer insights into designing controllable quantum links and single-excitation swaps in low-dimensional quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Quasinormal Mode Theory for Dissipative Nano-Optics and Magnetodielectric Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lars Meschede, Daniel D. A. Clarke, Ortwin Hess</p>
            <p>The unprecedented pace of evolution in nanoscale architectures for cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) has posed crucial challenges for theory, where the quantum dynamics arising from the non-perturbative dressing of matter by cavity electric and magnetic fields, as well as the fundamentally non-hermitian character of the system are to be treated without significant approximation. The lossy electromagnetic resonances of photonic, plasmonic or magnonic nanostructures are described as quasinormal modes (QNMs), whose properties and interactions with quantum emitters and spin qubits are central to the understanding of dissipative nano-optics and magnetodielectric cQED. Despite recent advancements toward a fully quantum framework for QNMs, a general and universally accepted approach to QNM quantization for arbitrary linear media remains elusive. In this work, we introduce a unified theoretical framework, based on macroscopic QED and complex coordinate transformations, that achieves QNM quantization for a wide class of spatially inhomogeneous, dissipative (with possible gain components) and dispersive, linear, magnetodielectric resonators. The complex coordinate transformations equivalently convert the radiative losses into non-radiative material dissipation, and via a suitable transformation that reflects all the losses of the resonator, we define creation and annihilation operators that allow the construction of modal Fock states for the joint excitations of field-dressed matter. By directly addressing the intricacies of modal loss in a fully quantum theory of magnetodielectric cQED, our approach enables the exploration of modern, quantum nano-optical experiments utilizing dielectric, plasmonic, magnetic or hybrid cQED architectures, and paves the way towards a rigorous assessment of room-temperature quantum nanophotonic technologies without recourse to ad hoc quantization schemes.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Complementarity ad Infinitum: Switching Higher-Order Coherence from Infinity to Zero</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arash Azizi</p>
            <p>We report a profound manifestation of quantum complementarity in the higher-order photon statistics of the ``Janus state,'' a coherent superposition of two squeezed vacua. We find that the state acts as a perfect quantum switch for multi-photon correlations, toggled by the availability of which-path information. Erasing this information activates quantum interference that can be tuned to be maximally destructive. This reveals a remarkable hierarchy of suppression: while two-photon correlations remain finite, we prove analytically and demonstrate numerically that it is possible to drive all higher-order correlations ($g^{(k)}$ for $k \ge 3$) to zero. This transition from the extreme bunching of the constituent states ($g^{(k)} \to \infty$) to a state of profound quantum order is visualized by the emergence of negativity in the state's Wigner function, an unambiguous signature of non-classicality. This work provides a foundational demonstration of quantum complementarity in multi-photon statistics and introduces a new paradigm for engineering highly ordered, non-classical light from Gaussian resources.</p>

            <h2>Tunneling driven by quantum light described via field Bohmian trajectories</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sangwon Kim, Seongjin Ahn, Denis V. Seletskiy, Andrey S. Moskalenko</p>
            <p>Recent realization of an intense quantum light, namely bright squeezed vacuum, opened a new perspective on quantum light-matter interaction. Several theoretical works have appeared based on coherent state expansions of quantum state of light to investigate non-classical driving of high-harmonic generation in atomic gases and solids, or free-electron dynamics, but their predictions surprisingly coincide with what one could expect from essentially classical interpretations of the light statistics. A deeper theoretical insight into the underlying physics is necessary for understanding of observed experimental findings and predicting emerging effects relying on this new configuration. Here we present a theoretical framework to describe tunneling driven by quantum light, where the properties of such light are captured by a statistical ensemble of classical fields via a hydrodynamic, also referred to as Bohmian, formulation. Generalizing the quasiclassical theory of non-adiabatic tunneling driven by classical light, a single tunneling event is described by a bundle of tunneling solutions, each driven by a classical field corresponding to one realization in the ensemble. Quantum statistics of light are thus imprinted on the measured current. Fully quantum description of light via the Bohmian trajectories of its field provides a perfect fit to the description of the electron (under-) above-barrier dynamics in terms of (complex quasiclassical) real classical trajectories, resulting in a consistent and elegant theoretical approach. To illustrate this, we consider BSV-induced electron transport from the tip to the surface in the tunneling microscope configuration demonstrating the transition from the multiphoton to the direct tunneling regime.</p>

            <h2>Schr{ö}dinger cat state formation in small bosonic Josephson junctions at finite temperatures and dissipation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> D V Tsarev, D V Ansimov, S A Podoshvedov, A P Alodjants</p>
            <p>In this work, we consider the feasibility of Schr{ö}dinger cat (SC) and $N00N$ states formation by a convenient bosonic Josephson junction (BJJ) system in two-mode approximation. Starting with purely quantum description of two-mode Bose-Einstein condensate we investigate the effective potential approach that provides an accurate analytical description for the system with a large number of particles. We show that in the zero temperature limit SC states result from a quantum phase transition that occurs when the nonlinear strength becomes comparable with the Josephson coupling parameter. The Wigner function approach demonstrates the growth of the SC state halves separation and formation of $N00N$-like states (a Fock state superposition) with the particle number increase. We examine the possibility to attain the SC state at finite temperatures and a weak dissipation leading to appearing of some critical temperature; it defines the second-order phase transition from classical activation process to the SC state formation through the quantum tunneling phenomenon. Numerical estimations demonstrate that the critical temperature is sufficiently below the temperature of atomic condensation. The results obtained may be useful for experimental observation of SC states with small condensate Josephson junctions.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement-Efficient Compilation of Quantum Circuits over Large-Scale Quantum Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Felix Burt, Kuan-Cheng Chen, Kin K. Leung</p>
            <p>Quantum computers face inherent scaling challenges, a fact that necessitates investigation of distributed quantum computing systems, whereby scaling is achieved through interconnection of smaller quantum processing units. However, connecting large numbers of QPUs will eventually result in connectivity constraints at the network level, where the difficulty of entanglement sharing increases with network path lengths. This increases the complexity of the quantum circuit partitioning problem, since the cost of generating entanglement between end nodes varies with network topologies and existing links. We address this challenge using a simple modification to existing partitioning schemes designed for all-to-all connected networks, that efficiently accounts for both of these factors. We investigate the performance in terms of entanglement requirements and optimisation time of various quantum circuits over different network topologies, achieving lower entanglement costs in the majority of cases than state-of-the-art methods. We provide techniques for scaling to large-scale quantum networks employing both network and problem coarsening. We show that coarsened methods can achieve improved solution quality in most cases with significantly lower run-times than direct partitioning methods.</p>

            <p>Engineering quantum bath networks through non-Hermitian subsystem Hamiltonians has recently emerged as a promising strategy for qubit cooling, state stabilization, and fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, scaling these systems while maintaining precise control over their complex interconnections, especially in the optical domain, poses significant challenges in both theoretical modeling and physical implementation. In this work, drawing on principles from quantum and mathematical physics, we introduce a systematic framework for constructing non-Hermitian subsystems within entirely Hermitian photonic platforms. In particular, controlled exponential decay without actual absorption loss is realized in finite 1-D waveguide chains through discrete-to-continuum coupling and Lanczos transformations. Using this new methodology, we implement parity-time symmetric quantum systems and experimentally demonstrate that these artificial bath environments accurately replicate the dynamics of non-Hermitian arrangements in both single- and multi-photon excitation regimes. Since the non-Hermitian subsystem response deterministically arises from an artificially built Hermitian bath, the quantum evolution can be monitored via post-selection in this fully conservative configuration. This approach bridges the gap between theoretical models and experimental realizations, thus paving the way for exploiting quantum bath engineering in advanced information processing and emerging quantum technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A.Yu. Bazhenov, M. Nikitina, Alexander Alodjants</p>
            <p>In the present work we propose a novel quantum material concept, which enables super- and/or ultrastrong interaction of two-level systems with the photonic field in a complex network. Within the mean field approximation we examine phase transition to superradiance that results in two excitation (polariton) branches and is accompanied by the appearance of non-zero macroscopic polarization of two-level systems. We characterize the statistical properties of networks by the first, ${\langle}k{\rangle}$, and second normalized, $\zeta\equiv{\langle}k^2{\rangle}/{\langle}k{\rangle}$, moments for node degree distribution. We have shown that the Rabi frequency is essentially enhanced due to the topology of the network within the anomalous domain where ${\langle}k{\rangle}$ and $\zeta$ sufficiently grow. The multichannel (multimode) structure of matter-field interaction leads superstrong coupling that provides primary behavior of the high temperature phase transition. The results obtained pave the way to design new photonic and polaritonic circuits, quantum networks for efficient processing quantum information at high (room) temperatures.</p>

            <h2>A Mixed-Order Phase Transition in Continuous-Variable Quantum Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yaqi Zhao, Kan He, Yongtao Zhang, Jinchuan Hou, Jianxi Gao, Shlomo Havlin, Xiangyi Meng</p>
            <p>Quantum networks (QNs) have been predominantly driven by discrete-variable (DV) architectures. Yet, many optical platforms naturally generate Gaussian states--the common states of continuous-variable (CV) systems, making CV-based QNs an attractive route toward scalable, chip-integrated quantum computation and communication. To bridge the conceptual gap between well-studied DV entanglement percolation theories and their CV counterpart, we introduce a Gaussian-to-Gaussian entanglement distribution scheme that deterministically transports two-mode squeezed vacuum states across large CV networks. Analysis of the scheme's collective behavior using statistical-physics methods reveals a new form of entanglement percolation--negativity percolation theory (NegPT)--characterized by a bounded entanglement measure called the ratio negativity. We discover that NegPT exhibits a mixed-order phase transition, marked simultaneously by both an abrupt change in global entanglement and a long-range correlation between nodes. This distinctive behavior places CV-based QNs in a new universality class, fundamentally distinct from DV systems. Additionally, the abruptness of this transition introduces a critical vulnerability of CV-based QNs: conventional feedback mechanism becomes inherently unstable near the threshold, highlighting practical implications for stabilizing large-scale CV-based QNs. Our results not only unify statistical models for CV-based entanglement distribution but also uncover previously unexplored critical phenomena unique to CV systems, providing valuable insights and guidelines essential for developing robust, feedback-stabilized QNs.</p>

            <h2>Unidirectional perfect absorption induced by chiral coupling in spin-momentum locked waveguide magnonics</h2>

            <p>Chiral coupling opens new avenues for controlling and exploiting light-matter interactions. We demonstrate that chiral coupling can be utilized to achieve unidirectional perfect absorption. In our experiments, chiral magnon-photon coupling is realized by coupling the magnon modes in yttrium iron garnet (YIG) spheres with spin-momentum-locked waveguide modes supported by spoof surface plasmon polaritons (SSPPs). These photon modes exhibit transverse spin, with the spin direction determined by the propagation direction. Due to the intrinsic spin properties of the magnon mode, it exclusively couples with microwaves traveling in one direction, effectively suppressing the reflection channel. Under the critical coupling condition, transmission is also eliminated, resulting in unidirectional perfect absorption. By incorporating additional YIG spheres, bidirectional and multi-frequency perfect absorption can be achieved. Our work introduces a novel platform for exploring and harnessing chiral light-matter interactions within spin-momentum locked devices, offering a paradigm for unidirectional signal processing and energy harvesting technologies.</p>

            <p>Large-scale quantum computers possess the capacity to effectively tackle practical problems that can be insurmountable for classical computers. The main challenge in building these quantum computers is to realize scalable modules for remote qubits and entanglement. By assembling small, specialized parts into a larger architecture, the modular approach mitigates complexity and uncertainty. Such a distributed architecture requires non-local quantum gate operations between remote qubits. An essential method for implementing such operations, known as quantum gate teleportation, requires only local operations, classical communication, and shared entanglement. Till today, the quantum gate teleportation using a photonic chip has remained elusive. Here we experimentally demonstrate the quantum teleportation of an on-chip controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate, assisted with the scalable silicon chip platform, high-fidelity local quantum logic gates, linear optical components, post-selected entanglement, and coincidence measurements from photonic qubits. First, we measure and characterize our teleported chip-scale CNOT gate with an average truth table fidelity of 93.1 +- 0.3%. Second, for different input polarization states, we obtain an average quantum state fidelity of 87.0 +- 2.2% with our teleported on-chip CNOT gate. Third, we use our non-local CNOT gate for remote entanglement creation of four Bell states, with an average quantum state fidelity of 86.2 +- 0.8%. Fourthly, we fully characterize our teleported on-chip CNOT gate with a quantum process fidelity 83.1 +- 2.0%, and an average non-local CNOT gate fidelity of 86.5 +- 2.2%. Our teleported photonic on-chip quantum logic gate could be extended both to multiple qubits and chip-scale modules towards fault-tolerant and large-scale distributed quantum computation.</p>

            <h2>Many-Body Physics from Spin-Phonon Coupling in Rydberg Atom Arrays</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shuo Zhang, Langxuan Chen, Pengfei Zhang</p>
            <p>The rapid advancement of quantum science and technology has established Rydberg atom arrays as a premier platform for exploring quantum many-body physics with exceptional precision and controllability. Traditionally, each atom is modeled as a spin degree of freedom with its spatial motion effectively frozen. This simplification has facilitated the discovery of a rich variety of novel equilibrium and non-equilibrium phases, including $\mathbb{Z}_{\text{N}}$ symmetry-breaking orders and quantum scars. In this work, we investigate the consequences of incorporating atomic vibrations in optical tweezers, which give rise to spin-phonon coupling. For systems in thermal equilibrium, we find that this coupling leads to a new symmetry-breaking phase in the weak driving limit, as a result of induced three-spin interactions. Furthermore, we show that the violation of quantum thermalization in $\mathbb{Z}_2$-ordered states is suppressed when spin-phonon coupling is introduced. Our results are readily testable in state-of-the-art Rydberg atom array experiments.</p>

            <p>We discuss quantum speed limits (QSLs) for finite-dimensional quantum systems undergoing general physical processes. These QSLs were obtained using Schatten $\alpha$-norms, firstly exploiting geometric features of the quantum state space, and secondly by applying the Holder's inequality for matrix norms. For single-qubit states, we find that the geometric QSL is independent of the chosen Schatten norm, thus revealing universality behavior. We compare these QSLs with existing speed limits in literature, showing that the latter results represent particular cases of a general class of QSLs related to Schatten $\alpha$-norms. We address necessary and sufficient conditions for the tightness of the QSLs that depends on populations and coherences of the qubits, also addressing their geometric meaning. We compare the QSLs obtained for qubit dynamics, also exploring their geometrical meaning. Finally, we show that the geometric QSL is tighter for general qubit dynamics with initial pure states, which indicates a universal QSL.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Savannah Garmon, Gonzalo Ordonez, Kenichi Noba</p>
            <p>A striking feature of cavity quantum electrodynamics is the existence of atom-photon bound states, which typically form when the coupling between the atom and its environment are strong enough that after de-excitation the atom can ``grab'' an emitted photon and re-absorb it, resulting in a virtual cloud surrounding the atom. Here we will demonstrate the existence of bound states that instead form in the case of weak coupling. Specifically, we show that when a quantum emitter is weakly coupled to a structured reservoir exhibiting topologically-protected surface states, hybridizations between these states and the emitter can form, resulting in mid-gap bound states. We illustrate this using a semi-infinite extension of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model as our reservoir. First, we diagonalize the bare semi-infinite SSH chain and reveal a winding number that predicts only the edge state on the finite side of the chain survives the semi-infinite extension. Then, after coupling the quantum emitter to this end of the chain, we analyze the modified emitter spectrum and reveal the existence of bound states in three parameter regions. Two of these represent the usual strong-coupling bound states, while the third gives the weak-coupling bound states with eigenvalue appearing in the SSH band gap and which exhibit partial sublattice localization. We demonstrate that oscillations between the weak-coupling bound states can be used to transfer the particle from the emitter into the lattice in a predictable and reversible manner.</p>

            <p>We introduce configuration space path integrals for quantum fields interacting with classical fields. We show that this can be done consistently by proving that the dynamics are completely positive directly, without resorting to master equation methods. These path integrals allow one to readily impose space-time symmetries, including Lorentz invariance or diffeomorphism invariance. They generalize and combine the Feynman-Vernon path integral of open quantum systems and the stochastic path integral of classical stochastic dynamics while respecting symmetry principles. We introduce a path integral formulation of general relativity where the space-time metric is treated classically. The theory is a candidate for a fundamental theory that reconciles general relativity with quantum mechanics. The theory is manifestly covariant, and may be inequivalent to the theory derived using master-equation methods. We prove that entanglement cannot be created via the classical field, reinforcing proposals to test the quantum nature of gravity via entanglement generation.</p>

However, understanding textured optical waves within Te remains a challenge due to the semi-classical limitations of long-wavelength approximation. To unveil these textured optical waves, we develop a spin-resolved deep-microscopic optical bandstructure for Te analogous to its electronic counterpart. We demonstrate that the degeneracies in this optical bandstructure is lifted by the twisted lattice of Te, which induces optical gyrotropy. Our theory shows excellent agreement with experimental optical gyrotropy measurements. At the lattice level, we reveal that the chirality of Te manifests as deep-microscopic optical spin texture within the optical wave. Our framework uncovers the finite-momentum origin of optical activity and provides a microscopic basis for light-matter interactions in chiral crystalline materials.</p>

Near the two-photon resonance, we calculate the renormalizations due to nonresonant interactions, which are more prominent with the higher Josephson energy of the coupler.

We show that light matter interactions are effectively captured by a dissipative cavity QED model, wherein the emitter coherently couples to a fictitious cavity mode emerging as a superposition of edge modes. This mode has support on only one sublattice and, most notably, displays an unconventional power law localization around the qubit, yet remaining normalizable in the thermodynamic limit, with a spatial range that can be tuned by introducing lattice anisotropy We predict occurrence of vacuum Rabi oscillations and efficient state transfer between distant emitters.

In those configurations of the cavity where there is thermal production, we derive fitting expressions that quantify deviations from idealized thermal spectra through gray-body factors, revealing oscillatory behaviors tied to acceleration duration.

            <p>Spontaneous emission in dipole approximation is studied theoretically using both source-field theory and a Schrodinger picture approach. Using source-field theory we obtain formal equations for the Poynting vector and energy density without making the rotating wave approximation (RWA) and Weisskopf-Wigner approximation (WWA). The initial condition at t=0 is one in which the atom is in an excited state and the field in the vacuum state. The source-field expressions are evaluated within the the RWA and WWA and are found to satisfy Poynting's theorem. To explore the consequences of not making the RWA and WWA, the Poynting vector and energy density are calculated using perturbation theory. We use a Schrodinger picture approach and essentially reproduce and complement the results of Compagno, Passante, and Persico [J. Mod. Optics 37:8, 1377 (2007)] and those of Power and Thirunamachandran [Phys. Rev. A 45, 54 (1992)] obtained using a Heisenberg picture approach. The theory involves a sum over field mode frequencies and both finite cutoffs and convergence factors are used to carry out the sums. It is shown that the perturbation theory calculation leads to unphysical values for atomic state populations for all times when a sum over all field frequencies is taken, even if a convergence factor is used. It is also proved that the fields calculated using source-field theory always satisfy Poynting's theorem for ct not equal to R, where R is the distance from the atom.</p>

            <h2>Robust Surface-Induced Enhancement of Exciton Transport in Magic-Angle-Oriented Molecular Aggregates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Siwei Wang, Liang-Yan Hsu, Hsing-Ta Chen</p>
            <p>Exciton transport in molecular aggregates with magic-angle orientation is expected to be strongly suppressed due to their negligible dipole-dipole interactions. However, recent reports show that light-matter interactions can significantly enhance exciton transport attributed to the effective long-range coupling mediated by the photonic fields. To elucidate their interplay, we employ the macroscopic quantum electrodynamics framework to simulate exciton transport within a chromophore array arranged in a magic-angle configuration in proximity to a silver surface. Our results show a significant enhancement of the exciton diffusion coefficient that is robust across variations in chromophore-surface separation, intermolecular distance, and molecular transition frequency. Furthermore, based on the image-dipole method, we derive analytical expressions that agree well with numerical simulations, revealing the enhancement's origin in the near-field coupling term as induced by the radiative scattering at the metallic surface. More importantly, we observe non-trivial differences in the diffusion coefficient's scaling near metallic surfaces compared to free space. Our findings highlight the potential to control exciton transport by designing coupled exciton-photon systems and engineering the dielectric environments.</p>

            <h2>Dark-state engineering in Fock-state lattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xuan Zhao, Yi Xu, Le-Man Kuang, Jie-Qiao Liao</p>
            <p>Fock-state lattices (FSLs) are becoming an emerging research hotspot in quantum physics, not only because the FSLs provide a new perspective for studying atom-field interactions, but also because they build the connection between quantum optics and condensed matter physics. Owing to the multiple transition paths in the lattices, inherent quantum interference effect exists in these systems, and hence how to find new quantum coherent phenomena and exploit their applications becomes a significant and desired task in this field. In this work, we study the dark-state effect in the FSLs generated by the multimode Jaynes-Cummings (JC) models. By considering the FSLs in certain-excitation-number subspaces, we study the dark states with respect to the states associated with the atomic excited state using the arrowhead-matrix method. We find that there exist dark-state subspaces with the dimensions determined by the number of orthogonal dark states. When the dimension is larger than one, the forms of these dark-state bases are not unique. Further, we obtain the number and form of the orthogonal dark states in the two-, three-, and four-mode JC models. In addition, we find that for a general $N$-mode JC model, there are $C_{N+n-2}^{N-2}$ orthogonal dark states in the $n$-excitation subspace. We also build the relationship between the dark modes and dark states. Our work will pave the way for exploring quantum optical effects and quantum information processing based on the FSLs.</p>

            <h2>Preparing spin-squeezed states in Rydberg atom arrays via quantum optimal control</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Edison S. Carrera, Harold Erbin, Grégoire Misguich</p>
            <p>We present a quantum optimal control protocol to generate highly spin-squeezed states in Rydberg atom arrays coupled via Ising-type Van der Waals interactions. Using gradient-based optimization techniques we construct time-dependent pulse sequences that steer an initial product state toward highly entangled, spin-squeezed states with predefined magnetization and squeezing axes. We focus on the Wineland parameter $\xi_W^2$ to measure spin squeezing and our approach achieves near-optimal spin squeezing in one-dimensional ring arrays of up to $N=8$ spins, significantly outperforming conventional quench dynamics for all system sizes studied. Remarkably, optimized pulse sequences can be directly scaled to larger arrays without additional optimization, achieving a squeezing parameter as low as $\xi_W^2 = 0.227$ in systems containing $N=50$ spins. This work demonstrates the potential of quantum optimal control methods for preparing highly spin-squeezed states, opening pathways to enhanced quantum metrology.</p>

            <p>Strongly coupling two systems allows them to exchange coherent information before the systems decohere. This important regime in light-matter interactions has predominantly been reached in optical resonator configurations. In this work, we present the experimental realization of strong coupling between optical and acoustic fields within a continuum of modes in a cavity-less configuration after a single-pass through an optical waveguide. The underlying physical effect of anti-Stokes Brillouin-Mandelstam scattering in a highly nonlinear fiber at T = 4 K allows us to experimentally demonstrate strong coupling in a waveguide scenario. We show the splitting of the optoacoustic spectral response and introduce a novel technique to measure the avoided crossing of hybrid optoacoustic modes via forced detuning. This demonstration opens a path towards in-line acoustic-waves-based quantum signal processing in waveguide systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sounak Bhowmik, Talita Perciano, Himanshu Thapliyal</p>
            <p>Dementia is a devastating condition with profound implications for individuals, families, and healthcare systems. Early and accurate detection of dementia is critical for timely intervention and improved patient outcomes. While classical machine learning and deep learning approaches have been explored extensively for dementia prediction, these solutions often struggle with high-dimensional biomedical data and large-scale datasets, quickly reaching computational and performance limitations. To address this challenge, quantum machine learning (QML) has emerged as a promising paradigm, offering faster training and advanced pattern recognition capabilities. This work aims to demonstrate the potential of quantum transfer learning (QTL) to enhance the performance of a weak classical deep learning model applied to a binary classification task for dementia detection. Besides, we show the effect of noise on the QTL-based approach, investigating the reliability and robustness of this method. Using the OASIS 2 dataset, we show how quantum techniques can transform a suboptimal classical model into a more effective solution for biomedical image classification, highlighting their potential impact on advancing healthcare technology.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ratun Rahman, Atit Pokharel, Dinh C. Nguyen</p>
            <p>Quantum Federated Learning (QFL) is an emerging paradigm that combines quantum computing and federated learning (FL) to enable decentralized model training while maintaining data privacy over quantum networks. However, quantum noise remains a significant barrier in QFL, since modern quantum devices experience heterogeneous noise levels due to variances in hardware quality and sensitivity to quantum decoherence, resulting in inadequate training performance. To address this issue, we propose SpoQFL, a novel QFL framework that leverages sporadic learning to mitigate quantum noise heterogeneity in distributed quantum systems. SpoQFL dynamically adjusts training strategies based on noise fluctuations, enhancing model robustness, convergence stability, and overall learning efficiency. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that SpoQFL significantly outperforms conventional QFL approaches, achieving superior training performance and more stable convergence.</p>

            <p>Hybrid quantum-classical neural networks represent a promising frontier in the search for improved machine learning models. This thesis explores the integration of quantum layers within classical convolutional neural network architectures, aiming to leverage quantum entanglement and feature mapping to enhance learning capabilities. A detailed methodology for constructing and training such hybrid models is presented, using PyTorch and Qiskit Machine Learning frameworks. Experiments investigate the performance impact of inserting quantum layers at different stages of the neural network pipeline. The results suggest that quantum components can introduce meaningful transformations even with a limited number of qubits, motivating further research into scalable quantum machine learning.

            <h2>Unfolded distillation: very low-cost magic state preparation for biased-noise qubits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Diego Ruiz, Jérémie Guillaud, Christophe Vuillot, Mazyar Mirrahimi</p>
            <p>Magic state distillation enables universal fault-tolerant quantum computation by implementing non-Clifford gates via the preparation of high-fidelity magic states. However, it comes at the cost of substantial logical-level overhead in both space and time. In this work, we propose a very low-cost magic state distillation scheme for biased-noise qubits. By leveraging the noise bias, our scheme enables the preparation of a magic state with a logical error rate of $3 \times 10^{-7}$, using only 53 qubits and 5.5 error correction rounds, under a noise bias of $\eta \gtrsim 5 \times 10^6$ and a phase-flip noise rate of $0.1\%$. This reduces the circuit volume by more than one order of magnitude relative to magic state cultivation for unbiased-noise qubits and by more than two orders of magnitude relative to standard magic state distillation. Moreover, our scheme provides three key advantages over previous proposals for biased-noise qubits. First, it only requires nearest-neighbor two-qubit gates on a 2D lattice. Second, the logical fidelity remains nearly identical even at a more modest noise bias of $\eta \gtrsim 80$, at the cost of a slightly increased circuit volume. Third, the scheme remains effective even at high physical phase-flip rates, in contrast to previously proposed approaches whose circuit volume grows exponentially with the error rate. Our construction is based on unfolding the $X$ stabilizer group of the Hadamard 3D quantum Reed-Muller code in 2D, enabling distillation at the physical level rather than the logical level, and is therefore referred to as $\textit{unfolded}$ distillation.</p>

            <h2>Spacetime duality between sequential and measurement-feedback circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tsung-Cheng Lu, Sarang Gopalakrishnan, Yizhi You</p>
            <p>Two prevalent approaches for preparing long-range entangled quantum states are (i) linear-depth sequential unitary (SU) circuits, which apply local unitary gates sequentially, and (ii) constant-depth measurement-feedback (MF) circuits, which employ mid-circuit measurements and conditional feedback based on measurement outcomes. Here, we establish that a broad class of SU and MF circuits are dual to each other under a spacetime rotation. We investigate this spacetime duality in the preparation of various long-range entangled states, including GHZ states, topologically ordered states, and fractal symmetry-breaking states. As an illustration, applying a spacetime rotation to a linear-depth SU circuit that implements a non-invertible Kramers-Wannier duality, originally used to prepare a 1D GHZ state, yields a constant-depth MF circuit that implements a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry gauging map, which equivalently prepares the GHZ state. Leveraging this duality, we further propose experimental protocols that require only a constant number of qubits to measure unconventional properties of 1D many-body states. These include (i) measurement of disorder operators, which diagnose the absence of spontaneous symmetry breaking, and (ii) postselection-free detection of measurement-induced long-range order, which emerges in certain symmetry-protected topological phases. We also show that measurement-induced long-range order provides a lower bound for strange correlators, which may be of independent interest.</p>

            <h2>Scalable dissipative quantum error correction for discrete-variable codes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ivan Rojkov, Elias Zapusek, Florentin Reiter</p>
            <p>Dissipative quantum error correction (QEC) autonomously protects quantum information using engineered dissipation and offers a promising alternative to error correction via measurement and feedback. However, scalability remains a challenge, as correcting high-weight errors typically requires increasing dissipation rates and exponentially many correction operators. Here, we present a scalable dissipative QEC protocol for discrete-variable codes, correcting multi-qubit errors via a trickle-down mechanism that sequentially reduces errors weight. Our construction exploits redundancy in the Knill-Laflamme conditions to design correction operators that act on multiple error subspaces simultaneously, thereby reducing the overhead from exponential to polynomial in the number of required operators. We illustrate our approach with repetition codes under biased noise, showing a fourfold improvement in the exponential suppression factor at realistic physical error rates. Our approach connects autonomous QEC for discrete-variable codes with demonstrated dissipative protocols for bosonic codes and opens up new avenues for traditional measurement-feedback QEC and fault-tolerant quantum operations.</p>

The former is limited by fiber optic attenuation while the latter is limited by atmospheric extinction and diffraction. Here, we propose a hybrid network and protocol that outperform both ground- and satellite-based designs and lead to high-fidelity entanglement at a continental or even global scale.</p>

            <p>We present and test a protocol to learn the matrix-product operator (MPO) representation of an experimentally prepared quantum state. The protocol takes as an input classical shadows corresponding to local randomized measurements, and outputs the tensors of a MPO which maximizes a suitably-defined fidelity with the experimental state. The tensor optimization is carried out sequentially, similarly to the well-known density matrix renormalization group algorithm. Our approach is provably efficient under certain technical conditions which are expected to be met in short-range correlated states and in typical noisy experimental settings. Under the same conditions, we also provide an efficient scheme to estimate fidelities between the learned and the experimental states. We experimentally demonstrate our protocol by learning entangled quantum states of up to $N = 96$ qubits in a superconducting quantum processor. Our method upgrades classical shadows to large-scale quantum computation and simulation experiments.</p>

By incorporating both coherent and dissipative dynamics into the neural network training, our method enables simultaneous identification of Hamiltonian parameters and decay rates from noisy experimental data. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the approach through numerical simulations of two-qubit open systems. Our results show that PINNverse provides a scalable and noise-resilient framework for quantum system identification, with potential applications in quantum control and error mitigation.</p>

            <p>A major challenge in the burgeoning field of quantum simulation for high-energy physics is the realization of scalable $2+1$D lattice gauge theories on state-of-the-art quantum hardware, which is an essential step towards the overarching goal of probing $3+1$D quantum chromodynamics on a quantum computer. Despite great progress, current experimental implementations of $2+1$D lattice gauge theories are mostly restricted to relatively small system sizes and two-level representations of the gauge and electric fields. Here, we propose a resource-efficient method for quantum simulating $2+1$D spin-$S$ $\mathrm{U}(1)$ quantum link lattice gauge theories with dynamical matter using qudit-based quantum processors. By integrating out the matter fields through Gauss's law, we reformulate the quantum link model in a purely spin picture compatible with qudit encoding across arbitrary spatial dimensions, eliminating the need for ancillary qubits and reducing resource overhead. Focusing first on the spin-$1/2$ case, we construct explicit circuits for the full Hamiltonian and demonstrate through numerical simulations that the first-order Trotterized circuits accurately capture the quench dynamics even in the presence of realistic noise levels. Additionally, we introduce a general method for constructing coupling-term circuits for higher-spin representations $S>1/2$. Compared to conventional qubit encodings, our framework significantly reduces the number of quantum resources and gate count. Our approach significantly enhances scalability and fidelity for probing nonequilibrium phenomena in higher-dimensional lattice gauge theories, and is readily amenable to implementation on state-of-the-art qudit platforms.</p>

            <p>An overarching goal in the flourishing field of quantum simulation for high-energy physics is the first-principles study of the microscopic dynamics of scattering processes on a quantum computer. Currently, this is hampered by small system sizes and a restriction to two-level representations of the gauge fields in state-of-the-art quantum simulators. Here, we propose efficient experimentally feasible digital qudit quantum circuits for far-from-equilibrium quench dynamics of a $\mathrm{U}(1)$ quantum link lattice gauge theory, where the electric and gauge fields are represented as spin-$1$ operators. Using dedicated numerical simulations, we probe scattering processes in this model on these proposed circuits, focusing on meson-meson and meson-antimeson collisions. The latter are not possible with a two-level representation of the fields, highlighting the suitability of qudits in exploring scattering processes relevant to quantum electrodynamics. The probed scattering dynamics showcases rich physics, including meson flipping and a reflection-transmission transition in meson-antimeson collisions as a function of the gauge coupling strength. Our simulations, which include realistic noise models of dephasing and depolarization, show very good agreement with the exact noiseless dynamics, signaling the readiness of current qudit platforms to observe microscopic scattering dynamics with significantly shallower circuit depths than their qubit counterparts.</p>

            <p>Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is the most efficient process to synthesize graphene sheets using methane as precursor, making it a strategic alternative route for the Liquefied Natural Gas market. In this reaction, tetracyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (TAH) are produced as residual and intermediary molecules. Sorting a combinatorial space of variants of TAHs by energy is a poorly studied problem needed to optimize CVD, while it is also a candidate for quantum advantage in quantum computers. We extend on Sridhara's polynomial root formula to perform block-diagonalization (hence SBD) of six TAHs using Hartree-Fock Hamiltonians with STO-3G basis set and active orbital space growing from 2 to 6 orbitals, with equal numbers for the number of active electrons. We show that the proposed compression algorithm followed by Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) allows for sorting of the molecules by ground state energy, while speeding up the VQE simulation up to tenfold and reducing its error to the $10^{-1}$ scale. The compression capability of $(1-2^{-k})\cdot 100\%$ in matrix size for $k$ qubits allows VQEs to have a broader set of applications, providing a new and necessary tool to overcome the circuit size and quantum noise limitations of large quantum processing units.</p>

            <p>Reliable detection and quantification of quantum entanglement, particularly in high-spin or many-body systems, present significant computational challenges for traditional methods. This study examines the effectiveness of ensemble machine learning models as a reliable and scalable approach for estimating entanglement, measured by negativity, in quantum systems. We construct an ensemble regressor integrating Neural Networks (NNs), XGBoost (XGB), and Extra Trees (ET), trained on datasets of pure states and mixed Werner states for various spin dimensions. The ensemble model with stacking meta-learner demonstrates robust performance by CatBoost (CB), accurately predicting negativity across different dimensionalities and state types. Crucially, visual analysis of prediction scatter plots reveals that the ensemble model exhibits superior predictive consistency and lower deviation from true entanglement values compared to individual strong learners like NNs, even when aggregate metrics are comparable. This enhanced reliability, attributed to error cancellation and variance reduction inherent in ensembling, underscores the potential of this approach to bypass computational bottlenecks and provide a trustworthy tool for characterizing entanglement in high-dimensional quantum physics. An empirical formula for estimating data requirements based on system dimensionality and desired accuracy is also derived.</p>

            <p>We study the behavior of magic as a bipartite correlation in the quantum Ising chain across its quantum phase transition, and at finite temperature. In order to quantify the magic of partitions rigorously, we formulate a hybrid scheme that combines stochastic sampling of reduced density matrices via quantum Monte Carlo, with state-of-the-art estimators for the robustness of magic - a {\it bona fide} measure of magic for mixed states. This allows us to compute the mutual robustness of magic for partitions up to 8 sites, embedded into a much larger system. We show how mutual robustness is directly related to critical behaviors: at the critical point, it displays a power law decay as a function of the distance between partitions, whose exponent is related to the partition size. Once finite temperature is included, mutual magic retains its low temperature value up to an effective critical temperature, whose dependence on size is also algebraic. This suggests that magic, differently from entanglement, does not necessarily undergo a sudden death.</p>

            <p>Four-component Schrödinger cat states, superpositions of four coherent states symmetrically arranged in phase space, offer rich nonclassical features and enhanced resilience to decoherence, making them promising resources for quantum information science. We propose a Floquet-engineered scheme to deterministically generate four-component Schrödinger cat states in a hybrid quantum system composed of two superconducting qubits, a microwave cavity, and a magnon mode. By applying periodic transverse drives to the qubits, we derive an effective Hamiltonian that conditionally displaces the magnon mode depending on the joint qubit state. Conditional measurements in the $\sigma_x$ basis project the magnon mode into nonclassical four-component cat states with high fidelity. The Wigner functions in the original frame verified the non-classicality of the four-component Schrödinger cat states. Results of systematically analyzing the impacts of qubit decoherence, magnon loss, and cavity dissipation demonstrate the robustness to the dissipation. The results show that this scheme can realize the generation of multi-component quantum superposition states in a scalable solid-state platform, providing a new approach for hybrid quantum information processing based on nonclassical magnon this http URL.</p>

            <p>The classical Kramers-Henneberger transformation connects, via a series of unitary transformations, the dynamics of a quantum particle of mass $m$ located in a trap at position $\alpha(t)$, with the dynamics of a charge $e$ moving in an electric field $e{\cal{E}}(t)=-m\ddot{\alpha}(t)$ within the dipole approximation. In this paper, we extend the classical Kramers-Henneberger transformation to the quantum electrodynamic and quantum optical realm, by explicitly treating the trap location quantum mechanically, thus taking into account the quantum fluctuations of the time-dependent displacement force. Compared to the classical case, we show that quantum electrodynamic corrections appear, and we propose an optomechanical realization for the quantized position of the trap to show that such corrections can manifest in state-of-the-art experiments. These results open the path to novel quantum simulation of quantum electrodynamics and quantum optics of attoscience and ultrafast physics by using ultracold trapped atoms and ions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stefano Longhi</p>
            <p>Preserving entanglement in the presence of decoherence remains a major challenge for quantum technologies. Recent proposals [M.A. Selim et al., Science 387, 1424 (2025)] have employed photonic filters based on anti-parity-time symmetry to recover certain entangled states, but these approaches require intricate, symmetry-constrained waveguide architectures and precise bath engineering. In this work, we show that such strict non-Hermitian symmetry constraints are not necessary for entanglement filtering. Instead, we identify post-selection and the emergence of dark states -- arising naturally through destructive interference in simple photonic settings -- as the essential mechanisms. By avoiding the need for special bath engineering or non-Hermitian symmetries, our approach significantly simplifies the design and architecture, enhances universality, and extends applicability beyond previously studied dimer configurations. We demonstrate this concept using minimal waveguide network designs, offering a broadly accessible route to robust entanglement filtering.</p>

The combination of unique spin structure and strong nonlinear response opens the possibility of direct experimental observation of a plethora of nontrivial optical polarization phenomena.

In the present paper, based on the quantum hydrodynamics approach for a two-component liquid, we derive the set of the corresponding equations where both energy and spin relaxation terms appear naturally. We analyze in detail how these terms affect the dynamics of spinor polariton droplets in the external magnetic field and the dispersion of elementary excitations of a uniform polariton condensate. Although we focus on the case of cavity polaritons, our approach can be applied to other cases of spinor bosonic condensates, where the processes of spin relaxation play a major role.</p>

            <p>A new scheme for detecting wave-like dark matter (DM) using Rydberg atoms is proposed. Recent advances in trapping and manipulating Rydberg atoms make it possible to use Rydberg atoms trapped in optical tweezer arrays for DM detection. We present a simple and innovative experimental procedure that searches for excitations of trapped Rydberg atoms due to DM-induced electric field. A scan over DM mass is enabled with the use of the Zeeman and diamagnetic shifts of energy levels under an applied external magnetic field. Taking dark photon DM as an example, we demonstrate that our proposed experiment can have high sensitivity enough to probe previously unexplored regions of the parameter space of dark photon coupling strengths and masses.</p>

            <h2>Utility-Scale Quantum Computation of Ground-State Energy in a 100+ Site Planar Kagome Antiferromagnet via Hamiltonian Engineering</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muhammad Ahsan</p>
            <p>We present experimental quantum computation of the ground-state energy in a 103-site flat Kagome lattice under the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model (KAFH), with IBM's Heron r1 and Heron r2 quantum processors. For spin-1/2 KAFH, our per-site ground-state energy estimate is $-0.417\,J$, which, under open-boundary corrections, matches the energy in the thermodynamic limit, i.e., $-0.4386\,J$. To achieve this, we used a hybrid approach that splits the conventional Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) into local (classical) and global (quantum) components for efficient hardware utilization. More importantly, we introduce a Hamiltonian engineering strategy that increases coupling on defect triangles to mimic loop-flip dynamics, allowing us to simplify the ansatz while retaining computational accuracy. Using a single-repetition, hardware-efficient ansatz, we entangle up to 103 qubits with high fidelity to determine the Hamiltonian's lowest eigenvalue. This work demonstrates the scalability of VQE for frustrated 2D systems and lays the foundation for future studies using deeper ansatz circuits and larger lattices on utility quantum processors.</p>

            <h2>Efficient Preparation of Fermionic Superfluids in an Optical Dipole Trap through Reinforcement Learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yueyang Min, Ziliang Li, Yi Zhong, Jia-An Xuan, Jian Lin, Lei Feng, Xiaopeng Li</p>
            <p>We demonstrate a reinforcement learning (RL) based control framework for optimizing evaporative cooling in the preparation of strongly interacting degenerate Fermi gases of Li6. Using a Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm, the system autonomously explores a high-dimensional parameter space to learn optimal cooling trajectories. Compared to conventional exponential ramps, our method achieves up to 130% improvement in atomic density within a 0.5 second, revealing non-trivial control strategies that balance fast evaporation and thermalization. While our current optimization focuses on the evaporation stage, future integration of other cooling stages, such as grey molasses cooling, could further extend RL to the full preparation pipeline. Our result highlights the promise of RL as a general tool for closed-loop quantum control and automated calibration in complex atomic physics experiments.</p>

            <h2>Dynamics Simulation of Arbitrary Non-Hermitian Systems Based on Quantum Monte Carlo</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaogang Li, Qiming Ding, Kecheng Liu, Xiao Yuan</p>
            <p>Non-Hermitian quantum systems exhibit unique properties and hold significant promise for diverse applications, yet their dynamical simulation poses a particular challenge due to intrinsic openness and non-unitary evolution. Here, we introduce a hybrid classical-quantum algorithm based on Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) for simulating the dynamics of arbitrary time-dependent non-Hermitian systems. Notably, this approach constitutes a natural extension of the quantum imaginary-time evolution (QITE) algorithm. This algorithm combines the advantages of both classical and quantum computation and exhibits good applicability and adaptability, making it promising for simulating arbitrary non-Hermitian systems such as PT-symmetric systems, non-physical processes, and open quantum systems. To validate the algorithm, we applied it to the dynamic simulation of open quantum systems and achieved the desired results.</p>

            <h2>Tripartite Entanglement in Multimode Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nishan Amgain, Mahir Rahman, Umar Arshad, Fernando Romero Consuegra, Emil Sayahi, Imran M. Mirza</p>
            <p>We numerically investigate the generation and dynamics of tripartite entanglement among qubits (quantum emitters or atoms) in multimode cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED). Our cQED architecture features three initially unentangled excited two-level quantum emitters confined within a triangle-shaped multimode optical cavity, which later become entangled due to a Jaynes-Cummings-like interaction. Using the tripartite negativity measure of entanglement and fidelity with respect to the genuine tripartite entangled state (Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (or GHZ) state, to be precise), we analyze the impact of the number of cavity modes, qubit locations, and losses (spontaneous emission from qubits and photon leakage from the cavity mirrors) on the generated entanglement. Our key results include the presence of two kinds of retardation effects: one resulting from the time it takes for photons to propagate from one qubit to another, and the other to complete one round trip in the cavity. We observed these retardation effects only in multimode cavities, with the exciting possibility of controlling the collapse and revival patterns of tripartite entanglement by altering the qubit locations in the cavity. Furthermore, the impact of losses on the generated entanglement and the dependence of maximum entanglement on the total number of modes yield results that surpass those reported for single and two excitations. With recent advances in circuit quantum electrodynamics, these findings hold promise for the development of entanglement-based quantum networking protocols and quantum memories.</p>

            <h2>Observation of quantum noise reduction in a Raman amplifier via quantum correlation between atom and light</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jianmin Wang, Rong Zhu, Yue Li, Z. Y. Ou</p>
            <p>Any amplifier requires coupling to its internal degrees of freedom for energy gain. This coupling introduces extra quantum noise to the output. On the other hand, if the internal degree of the amplifier can be accessed and manipulated, we can manage and even reduce the quantum noise of the amplifier's output. In this paper, we present an experiment to reduce the quantum noise of a Raman amplifier by preparing the atomic medium in a correlated state with the Stokes light field. We report an observation of quantum noise reduction of more than 3.5 dB in the atomic Raman amplification process. From another perspective, the Raman amplifier at high gain in turn serves as a measurement tool for the quantum correlation between the atom and light. Furthermore, such a scheme, when viewed as a whole, also forms a quantum-entangled atom-light hybrid interferometer that can lead to quantum-enhanced sensors.</p>

            <h2>Optomagnonic continuous-variable quantum teleportation enhanced by non-Gaussian distillation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zi-Xu Lu, Xuan Zuo, Zhi-Yuan Fan, Jie Li</p>
            <p>The capability of magnons to coherently couple with various quantum systems makes them an ideal candidate to build hybrid quantum systems. The optomagnonic coupling is essential for constructing a hybrid magnonic quantum network, as the transmission of quantum information among remote quantum nodes must be accomplished using light rather than microwave field. Here we provide an optomagnonic continuous-variable quantum teleportation protocol, which enables the transfer of an input optical state to a remote magnon mode. To overcome the currently relatively weak coupling in the experiment, we introduce non-Gaussian distillation operations to enhance the optomagnonic entanglement and thus the fidelity of the teleportation. An auxiliary microwave cavity is adopted to realize the non-Gaussian and displacement operations on magnons. We show that a series of optical states, such as coherent, single-photon, squeezed and cat states, can be teleported to the magnon mode. The work provides guidance for the experimental realization of magnonic quantum repeaters and quantum networks and a new route to prepare diverse magnonic quantum states exploiting the photon-to-magnon quantum teleportation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maritza Ahumada, Natalia Valderrama-Quinteros, Diego Tancara, Guillermo Romero</p>
            <p>Controlling the propagation of quantum excitations in low-dimensional quantum systems is pivotal for advancing quantum technologies, including communication networks and quantum simulators. We propose a one-dimensional hybrid quantum lattice model comprising coupled cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) units. Each unit integrates a single-mode cavity that interacts with a two-level system (TLS), featuring direct coupling between adjacent TLLs. This configuration enables the coherent propagation of polaritons, spin waves, and photons, depending on the interplay between light-matter coupling and spin-spin interactions. Employing the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm, we simulate the dynamics of various excitation configurations and analyze their transport characteristics using local observables. Our analysis reveals the importance of matching impedance and resonance conditions via system parameters for the propagation of different types of excitations or swapping the nature of excitations along the hybrid lattice. These findings offer insight into designing controllable quantum links and single-excitation swaps in low-dimensional quantum systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kenan Qu, Nathaniel J. Fisch</p>
            <p>Quantum squeezed states enable precision measurements beyond the standard quantum limit, but conventional solid-state media fundamentally limit pump intensities to the ionization threshold. We demonstrate that plasma waves can mediate ultra-strong two-mode squeezing through stimulated Raman scattering, achieving up to ultrastrong squeezing using $10^{16}{Wcm^{-2}}$ pump lasers. Employing two copropagating pump beams with frequency difference matching twice the plasma frequency, we generate quantum-correlated photon pairs through phonon-mediated four-wave mixing. The process exhibits remarkable thermal noise tolerance, allowing strong squeezing even with large thermal phonon numbers. This plasma-based approach produces squeezed states with ultrahigh photon numbers, opening new possibilities for strong-field applications across optical to X-ray wavelengths.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander Schuckert, Eleanor Crane, Alexey V. Gorshkov, Mohammad Hafezi, Michael J. Gullans</p>
            <p>Simulating the dynamics of electrons and other fermionic particles in quantum chemistry, materials science, and high-energy physics is one of the most promising applications of fault-tolerant quantum computers. However, the overhead in mapping time evolution under fermionic Hamiltonians to qubit gates renders this endeavor challenging. We introduce fermionic fault-tolerant quantum computing, a framework which removes this overhead altogether. Using native fermionic operations we first construct a repetition code which corrects phase errors only. Within a fermionic color code, which corrects for both phase and loss errors, we then realize a universal fermionic gate set, including transversal fermionic Clifford gates. Interfacing with qubit color codes we introduce qubit-fermion fault-tolerant computation, which allows for qubit-controlled fermionic time evolution, a crucial subroutine in state-of-the-art quantum algorithms. As an application, we consider simulating crystalline materials, finding an exponential improvement in circuit depth for a single time step from $\mathcal{O}(N)$ to $\mathcal{O}(\log(N))$ with respect to lattice site number $N$ while retaining a site count of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(N)$, implying a linear-in-$N$ end-to-end gate depth for simulating materials, as opposed to quadratic in previous approaches. We also introduce a fermion-inspired qubit algorithm with $O(\mathrm{log}(N)$ depth, but a prohibitive number of additional ancilla qubits. We show how our framework can be implemented in neutral atoms, overcoming the apparent inability of neutral atoms to implement non-number-conserving gates. Our work opens the door to fermion-qubit fault-tolerant quantum computation in platforms with native fermions such as neutral atoms, quantum dots and donors in silicon, with applications in quantum chemistry, material science, and high-energy physics.</p>

            <h2>Are Molecules Magical? Non-Stabilizerness in Molecular Bonding</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthieu Sarkis, Alexandre Tkatchenko</p>
            <p>Isolated atoms as well as molecules at equilibrium are presumed to be simple from the point of view of quantum computational complexity. Here we show that the process of chemical bond formation is accompanied by a marked increase in the quantum complexity of the electronic ground state. By studying the hydrogen dimer H$_{2}$ as a prototypical example, we demonstrate that when two hydrogen atoms form a bond, a specific measure of quantum complexity exhibits a pronounced peak that closely follows the behavior of the binding energy. This measure of quantum complexity, known as magic in the quantum information literature, reflects how difficult it is to simulate the state using classical methods. This observation suggests that regions of strong bonding formation or breaking are also regions of enhanced intrinsic quantum complexity. This insight suggests a connection of quantum information measures to chemical reactivity and advocates the use of stretched molecules as a quantum computational resource.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Magic in Discrete-Time Quantum Walk</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vikash Mittal, Yi-Ping Huang</p>
            <p>Quantum magic, which accounts for the non-stabilizer content of a state, is essential for universal quantum computation beyond classically simulable resources. We investigate the generation and evolution of quantum magic in discrete-time quantum walks (DTQWs) using the Stabilizer Renyi Entropy as a measure of quantum magic. We investigate single- and two-walker quantum walks on a one-dimensional lattice, considering a wide range of initial coin states. Our results reveal that DTQWs can dynamically generate significant magic, with the amount and structure strongly dependent on the initial state of the coin. In the case of a single walker, the relationship between magic and entanglement is found to be nontrivial and complementary at long times. These findings position DTQWs as accessible and controllable platforms for producing quantum magic, offering a new perspective on their role in quantum information processing and reliable quantum computation.</p>

            <p>We propose a method to sympathetically cool polar molecules with Rydberg atoms without destroying the quantum information encoded in the polar molecules. While the interactions between the two are usually state-dependent, we show how to engineer state-insensitive interactions between the hot molecules and the cold atoms with a suitable choice of internal states and the application of external fields. The resulting interactions, which may be van der Waals or dipolar, induce a phonon swap interaction between the two species, thereby coherently cooling the polar molecules without affecting the internal state, a process which can be repeated if the atoms are cooled again or new cold atoms are brought in. Our cooling schemes open the possibility of extending quantum computation and simulation times in emerging hybrid tweezer arrays of polar molecules and neutral atoms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sam Alterman, Peter J. Love</p>
            <p>In the light-front (LF) formulation of quantum field theory (QFT), physics is formulated from the perspective of a massless observer necessarily traveling at the speed of light. The LF formulation provides an alternative computational approach to lattice gauge theory, and has recently been investigated as a future application of quantum computers. A natural question is how quantum resources such as entanglement and contextuality amongst physical qubits in the laboratory are utilized in LF simulations of QFTs. We use the (1+1)D transverse-field Ising model to explore this question. We derive the LF energy operator that generates the LF dynamics of the system, which is distinct from the instant-form (IF) Hamiltonian. We find that while the eigenstates of the IF Hamiltonian exhibit pairwise entanglement between positive and negative momenta in IF momentum-space, the eigenstates of the LF Hamiltonian are separable in LF momentum-space. We then calculate the momentum-space magic of the IF-momentum-space ground state and show that it always requires more magic to prepare than the LF-momentum-space ground state. At the quantum critical point, corresponding to a massless free fermion, both LF and IF ground states are stabilizers, but the LF ground state is separable in LF momentum-space while the IF ground state is a product of maximally entangled pairs in IF momentum-space. These results show that quantum resources such as entanglement and magic are utilized differently by quantum simulations formulated in LF and IF, and that the simplicity of the LF ground state results in fewer required quantum resources.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement production in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Model and its variants</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tanay Pathak, Masaki Tezuka</p>
            <p>Understanding how quantum chaotic systems generate entanglement can provide insight into their microscopic chaotic dynamics and can help distinguish between different classes of chaotic behavior. Using von Neumann entanglement entropy, we study a nonentangled state evolved under three variants of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model with a finite number of Majorana fermions $N$. All the variants exhibit linear entanglement growth at early times, which at late times saturates to a universal value consistent with random matrix theory (RMT), but their growth rates differ. We interpret this as a large-$N$ effect, arising from the enhanced non-locality of fermionic operators in SYK and binary SYK, absent in spin operators of the spin-SYK model. Numerically, we find that these differences emerge gradually with increasing $N$. Although all variants are quantum chaotic, their entanglement dynamics reflect varying degrees of chaos and indicate that the entanglement production rate serves as a fine-grained probe of chaos beyond conventional measures. To probe its effect on thermalization properties of these models, we study the two-point autocorrelation function, finding no differences between the SYK variants, but deviations from RMT predictions for $N \geq 24$, particularly near the crossover from exponential decay to saturation regime.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ye-jun Xu, Long-hua Zhai, Peng Fu, Shou-jing Cheng, Guo-Qiang Zhang</p>
            <p>We investigate the nonreciprocal quantum phase transition in a cavity magnonic system driven by a parametric field, where an yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere is placed in a spinning microwave resonator. The system exhibits a rich phase diagram due to both magnon Kerr nonlinearity in YIG and parametric drive on the resonator. Especially, Sagnac-Fizeau shift caused by the spinning of the resonator brings about a significant modification in the critical driving strengths for second- and first-order quantum phase transitions, which means that the highly controllable quantum phase can be realized by the spinning speed of the resonator. More importantly, based on the difference in the detunings of the counterclockwise and clockwise modes induced by spinning direction of the resonator, we show that the phase transition in this system is nonreciprocal, that is, the quantum phase transition occurs when the cavity is driven in one direction but not the other. Our work offers an alternative path to engineer and design nonreciprocal magnonic devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Edoardo Ballini, Julius Mildenberger, Matteo M. Wauters, Philipp Hauke</p>
            <p>Non-Abelian gauge theories underlie our understanding of fundamental forces of modern physics. Simulating them on quantum hardware is an outstanding challenge in the rapidly evolving field of quantum simulation. A key prerequisite is the protection of local gauge symmetries against errors that, if unchecked, would lead to unphysical results. While an extensive toolkit devoted to identifying, mitigating, and ultimately correcting such errors has been developed for Abelian groups, non-commuting symmetry operators complicate the implementation of similar schemes in non-Abelian theories. Here, we discuss two techniques for error mitigation through symmetry verification, tailored for non-Abelian lattice gauge theories implemented in noisy qudit hardware: dynamical post-selection (DPS), based on mid-circuit measurements without active feedback, and post-processed symmetry verification (PSV), which combines measurements of correlations between target observables and gauge transformations. We illustrate both approaches for the discrete non-Abelian group $D_3$ in 2+1 dimensions, explaining their usefulness for current NISQ devices even in the presence of fast fluctuating noise. Our results open new avenues for robust quantum simulation of non-Abelian gauge theories, for further development of error-mitigation techniques, and for measurement-based control methods in qudit platforms.</p>

Multipartite features, going beyond so far reported two-mode correlation, naturally arise due to a cascade of non-linear optical processes, making a single-color laser pump sufficient to initiate their generation. Our results show the transition from two-mode to multipartite correlation, witnessed by noise reductions as low as $-2.5$\,dB and $-2$\,dB, respectively, compared to corresponding classical levels. A constant of the movement of the non-linear interaction Hamiltonian is identified and used to asses the multipartite behavior.

A co-trapped $^{25}$Mg$^+$ ion provides sympathetic cooling and quantum logic readout of the $^{27}$Al$^+$ $^1$S$_0\leftrightarrow^3$P$_0$ clock transition. A Rabi probe duration of 1 s, enabled by laser stability transfer from a remote cryogenic silicon cavity across a 3.6 km fiber link, results in a threefold reduction in instability compared to previous $^{27}$Al$^+$ clocks. Systematic uncertainties are lower due to an improved ion trap electrical design, which reduces excess micromotion, and a new vacuum system, which reduces collisional shifts. We also perform a direction-sensitive measurement of the ac magnetic field due to the RF ion trap, eliminating systematic uncertainty due to field orientation.</p>

            <p>Kitaev's honeycomb model is a paradigmatic exactly solvable system hosting a quantum spin liquid with non-Abelian anyons and topologically protected edge modes, offering a platform for fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, real candidate Kitaev materials invariably include complex secondary interactions that obscure the realization of spin-liquid behavior and demand novel quantum computational approaches for efficient simulation. Here we report quantum simulations of a 22-site Kitaev honeycomb lattice on a trapped-ion quantum processor, without and with non-integrable Heisenberg interactions that are present in real materials. We develop efficient quantum circuits for ground-state preparation, then apply controlled perturbations and measure time-dependent spin correlations along the system's edge. In the non-Abelian phase, we observe chiral edge dynamics consistent with a nonzero Chern number -- a hallmark of topological order -- which vanishes upon transition to the Abelian toric code phase. Extending to the non-integrable Kitaev-Heisenberg model, we find that weak Heisenberg interactions preserve chiral edge dynamics, while stronger couplings suppress them, signaling the breakdown of topological protection. Our work demonstrates a viable route for probing dynamical signatures of topological order in quantum spin liquids using programmable quantum hardware, opening new pathways for quantum simulation of strongly correlated materials.</p>

            <p>In this work, we present the first implementation of the face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice model for protein structure prediction with a quantum algorithm. Our motivation to encode the FCC lattice stems from our observation that the FCC lattice is more capable in terms of modeling realistic secondary structures in proteins compared to other lattices, as demonstrated using root mean square deviation (RMSD). We utilize two quantum methods to solve this problem: a polynomial fitting approach (PolyFit) and the Variational Quantum Eigensolver with constraints (VQEC) based on the Lagrangian duality principle. Both methods are successfully deployed on Eagle R3 (ibm_cleveland) and Heron R2 (ibm_kingston) quantum computers, where we are able to recover ground state configurations for the 6-amino acid sequence KLVFFA under noise. A comparative analysis of the outcomes generated by the two QPUs reveals a significant enhancement (reaching nearly a two-fold improvement for PolyFit and a three-fold improvement for VQEC) in the prediction and sampling of the optimal solution (ground state conformations) on the newer Heron R2 architecture, highlighting the impact of quantum hardware advancements for this application.</p>

            <p>Proton transfer reactions are fundamental to many chemical and biological systems, where quantum effects such as tunneling, delocalization, and zero-point motion play key kinetic control roles. However, classical methods capable of accurately capturing these phenomena scale prohibitively with system size. Here, we develop and demonstrate quantum computing algorithms based on the Nuclear-Electronic Orbital framework, treating the transferring proton quantum mechanically. We assess the potential of current quantum devices for simulating proton transfer kinetics with high accuracy. We first construct a deep initial ansätze within a truncated orbital space by employing the frozen natural orbital approximation. Then, to balance circuit depth against state fidelity, we implement an adaptive form of approximate quantum compiling. Using resulting circuits at varying compression levels transpiled for the ibm_fez device, we compute barrier heights and delocalised proton densities along the proton transfer pathway using a realistic hardware noise model. We find that, although current quantum hardware introduces significant noise relative to the demanding energy tolerances involved, our approach allows substantial circuit simplification while maintaining energy barrier estimates within 13% of the reference value. Despite present hardware limitations, these results offer a practical means of approximating key circuit segments in near-term devices and early fault-tolerant quantum computing systems.</p>

            <h2>Photon-Number-Resolving Detector Based on a Cascade of Waveguide-Coupled Quantum Emitters</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abdolreza Pasharavesh, Sai Sreesh Venuturumilli, Michal Bajcsy</p>
            <p>We investigate the operation of a photon-number-resolving (PNR) detector consisting of a cascade of waveguide-coupled lambda-type emitters, where each waveguide-coupled emitter extracts a single photon from the input light and sends it to a single-photon detector. Using Green's function and input-output formalisms, we derive the scattering matrices and photon-photon correlators for individual scatterers. By cascading these results, we obtain a closed-form expression for the detector's precision in the linear regime and predict how correlations generated by nonlinear photon-photon interactions influence this precision. To evaluate the performance of this PNR detector in the nonlinear regime, we apply the quantum trajectory method to the cascaded setup, calculating the achievable precision and analyzing its dependence on key system parameters, such as the number of emitters and their coupling strength to the waveguide. We compare the performance of the proposed PNR detector with that of a conventional PNR scheme based on spatial demultiplexing via beamsplitters. Our results indicate that the proposed scheme can outperform conventional detectors under realistic conditions, making it a promising candidate for next-generation PNR detection.</p>

            <h2>Time crystals and nonequilibrium dissipative phase transitions mediated by squeezed bath</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhenghao Zhang, Qingtian Miao, G. S. Agarwal</p>
            <p>Nonequilibrium dissipative phase transition, arising from the competition of cooperative behavior and coherent field driving, discovered in the 1970s by Narducci et al. and Walls et al., has been found to exhibit time-crystal behavior when the driving field exceeds the cooperative decay rate. This was seen through the study of the eigenvalues of the Liouvillian superoperator that describes the joint effect of drive and cooperativity. The cooperative decay depends on the nature of the reservoir correlations. If the reservoir correlations have phase-sensitive behavior, then the eigenvalues of the Liouvillian will be different. We investigate the time-crystal behavior of the nonequilibrium dissipative phase transitions under the influence of a squeezed vacuum reservoir. We analyze the steady-state phase diagram as a function of the control parameter and demonstrate that increasing the squeezing strength sharpens the dissipative phase transition. Spectral analysis of the Liouvillian reveals gap closings and the emergence of purely imaginary eigenvalues in the thermodynamic limit, indicating the time-crystal phase. We find that the real parts of subleading eigenvalues exhibit nonmonotonic behavior with increasing squeezing, reflecting the sensitivity of relaxation dynamics to the reservoir properties. Time-domain simulations confirm that the oscillation frequencies correspond to the imaginary parts of the Liouvillian eigenvalues. We also present results on quantum fluctuations in the time-crystal phase. Our results call attention to the study of time crystals in models of cooperativity based on engineered environments.</p>

            <h2>The temporal resolution limit in quantum sensing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cong-Gang Song, Qing-yu Cai</p>
            <p>Temporal resolution is a critical figure of merit in quantum sensing. This study combines the distinguishable condition of quantum states with quantum speed limits to establish a lower bound on interrogation time. When the interrogation time falls below this bound, the output state becomes statistically indistinguishable from the input state, and the information will inevitably be lost in noise. Without loss of generality, we extend these conclusions to time-dependent signal Hamiltonian. In theory, leveraging certain quantum control techniques allows us to calculate the minimum interrogation time for arbitrary signal Hamiltonian. Finally, we illustrate the impact of quantum speed limits on magnetic field measurements and temporal resolution.</p>

            <p>Quantum metrology experiments in atomic physics and quantum optics have demonstrated measurement accuracy beyond the shot-noise limit via multi-particle entanglement. At the same time, electron microscopy, an essential tool for high-resolution imaging of biological systems, is severely constrained in its signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by shot noise, due to the dose limit imposed by electron beam-induced damage. Here, we show theoretically that spin squeezing, a form of quantum metrology based on entanglement, is a natural fit for improving the SNR in electron microscopy. We investigate the generation of the necessary entangled states through electron-electron Coulomb interactions and quantum non-demolition measurements. Our results connect the fields of quantum metrology and electron interferometry, paving the way toward electron microscopy with SNR beyond the shot-noise limit.</p>

            <h2>Order-preserving condition for coherence measures of projective measurements with One Example</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hai Wang</p>
            <p>Superposition is an essential feature of quantum mechanics. From the Schrodinger's cat to quantum algorithms such as Deutsch-Jorsza algorithm, quantum superposition plays an important role. It is one fundamental and crucial question how to quantify superposition. Until now, the framework of coherence has been well established as one typical instance of quantum resource theories. And the concept of coherence has been generalized into linearly independent basis, projective measurements and POVMs. In this work, we will focus on coherence measures for projective measurements or orthogonal subspaces. One new condition, order-preserving condition, is proposed for such measures. This condition is rooted in the mathematical structure of Hilbert spaces' orthogonal decomposition. And by generalizing the 1/2-affinity of coherence into subspace cases, we verify that this generalized coherence measure satisfies the order-preserving condition. And it also satisfies other reasonable conditions to be a good coherence measure. As the partial order relationship exists for not only projective measurements, but also POVMs, it's natural to study the order-preserving condition in POVM cases, which will be the last part of this work.</p>

The coupling inductor is fabricated in granular Aluminum, a superinductor material able to provide large surface inductances. Spectroscopy measurements on the qubit-resonator system reveal a Bloch-Siegert shift of \SI{23}{\mega\hertz} and a coupling fraction of $g/\omega_r \simeq 0.13$, entering the perturbative ultrastrong coupling (USC) regime. We estimate the inductance of the coupler independently by low-temperature resistance measurements providing $L_c = (0.74\pm0.14)\,\mathrm{nH}$, which is compatible with $g/\omega \gtrsim 0.1$. Our results show that superinductors are a promising tool to study USC physics in high-coherence circuits using flux qubits with small loop areas and low persistent currents.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ramaseshan R, Prateek P. Kulkarni, Sharanya Madhusudhan, Kaustav Bhowmick</p>
            <p>Entanglement is a cornerstone of quantum technology, playing a key role in quantum computing, cryptography, and information processing. Conventional methods for generating entanglement via optical setups rely on beam splitters, nonlinear media, or quantum dots, which often require bulky configurations and precise phase control. In contrast, metasurfaces - ultrathin, engineered optical interfaces - offer a compact and tunable alternative for quantum photonics. In this work, we demonstrate that metasurfaces can serve as a promising platform for generating Bell states through a Hamiltonian-driven spin-entanglement mechanism. By analyzing the system's evolution under a metasurface interaction Hamiltonian, we show that an initially separable spin state evolves into a maximally entangled Bell state. We further study classical and quantum correlations, evaluate the impact of environmental decoherence, and compute quantum discord to quantify correlation robustness beyond entanglement. Our analysis shows that metasurfaces can generate Bell states with a concurrence of about 0.995 and maintain quantum discord for up to 29 microseconds. These results establish metasurfaces as scalable, high-fidelity components for next-generation quantum photonic architectures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Noura Chabar, Mohamed Amazioug</p>
            <p>We propose an experimental scheme for enhancing entanglement, achieving asymmetric Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering, and creating nonreciprocal quantum correlations within a hybrid system. This system integrates a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere, which exhibits magnon-phonon coupling via magnetostriction, with a silica sphere featuring optomechanical whispering-gallery modes. By tuning the Barnett effect through the magnetic field direction, our system enables controllable asymmetric EPR steering and nonreciprocal entanglement between both directly and indirectly coupled modes. We demonstrate that adjusting the reflectivity of a beam splitter can boost stationary quantum steering and entanglement, effectively countering thermal noise. This approach allows for the generation of multipartite entanglement and both one-way and two-way steering. The proposed system is experimentally feasible and holds significant promise for various quantum information applications.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Convolution for Structure-Based Virtual Screening</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pei-Kun Yang</p>
            <p>Structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) is a key computational strategy for identifying potential drug candidates by estimating the binding free energies (delta G_bind) of protein-ligand complexes. The immense size of chemical libraries, combined with the need to account for protein and ligand conformations as well as ligand translations and rotations, makes these tasks computationally intensive on classical hardware. This study proposes a quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) framework to estimate delta G_bind efficiently. Using the PDBbind v2020 dataset, we trained QCNN models with 9 and 12 qubits, with the core set designated as the test set. The best-performing model achieved a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.694 on the test set. To assess robustness, we introduced quantum noise under two configurations. While noise increased the root mean square deviation, the Pearson correlation coefficient remained largely stable. These results demonstrate the feasibility and noise tolerance of QCNNs for high-throughput virtual screening and highlight the potential of quantum computing to accelerate drug discovery.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Singular Value Transformation for Solving the Time-Dependent Maxwell's Equations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gal G. Shaviner, Ziv Chen, Steven H. Frankel</p>
            <p>This work presents a quantum algorithm for solving linear systems of equations of the form $\mathbf{A}{\frac{\mathbf{\partial f}}{\mathbf{\partial x}}} = \mathbf{B}\mathbf{f}$, based on the Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT). The algorithm uses block-encoding of $A$ and applies an 21st-degree polynomial approximation to the inverse function $f(x) = 1/x$, enabling relatively shallow quantum circuits implemented on 9 qubits, including two ancilla qubits, corresponding to a grid size of 128 points. Phase angles for the QSVT circuit were optimized classically using the Adagrad gradient-based method over 100 iterations to minimize the solution cost. This approach was simulated in PennyLane and applied to solve a 1D benchmark case of Maxwell's equations in free space, with a Gaussian pulse as the initial condition, where the quantum-computed solution showed high fidelity of more than 99.9% when compared to the normalized classical solution. Results demonstrate the potential of QSVT-based linear solvers on simulators with full quantum state access. However, practical hardware implementations face challenges because accessing the complete quantum state is infeasible. This limitation restricts applicability to cases where only $O({poly}(n))$ observables are needed. These findings highlight both the promise and current limitations of using quantum algorithms, such as QSVT, to solve linear systems of equations, and they point to the need for the development of measurement-efficient algorithms for near-term quantum devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hanfeng Wang, Kurt Jacobs, Donald Fahey, Yong Hu, Dirk R. Englund, Matthew E. Trusheim</p>
            <p>Phase transitions can dramatically alter system dynamics, unlocking new behavior and improving performance. Exceptional points (EPs), where the eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors of a coupled linear system coalesce, are particularly relevant for sensing applications as they can increase sensor response to external perturbations to a range of phenomena from optical phase shifts to gravitational waves. However, the coalescence of eigenstates at linear EPs amplifies noise, negating the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) enhancement. Here, we overcome this limitation using nonlinearity, which exhibits exceptional SNR around a bistable transition point (BP). We couple a state-of-the-art diamond quantum sensor to a nonlinear Van der Pol oscillator, forming a self-oscillating hybrid system that exhibits both a single-valued and bistable phase. The boundaries between these phases are marked by both adiabatic and deterministic non-adiabatic transitions that enable chiral state switching and state coalescence at the BP. Crucially, NV magnetometry performed near the BP exhibits a 17x enhancement in SNR, achieving a record sensitivity of 170 fT/\sqrt{Hz}. This result surpasses the sensitivity limit of an ideal, thermally-limited electron magnetometer and resolves a long-standing debate regarding EP-like physics in advanced quantum sensing.</p>

            <p>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have demonstrated immense potential in synthesizing diverse and high-fidelity images. However, critical questions remain unanswered regarding how quantum principles might best enhance their representational and computational capacity. In this paper, we investigate hybrid quantum-classical GAN architectures supplemented by transfer learning to systematically examine whether incorporating Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) into the generator, the discriminator, or both improves performance over a fully classical baseline. Our findings indicate that fully hybrid models, which incorporate VQCs in both the generator and the discriminator, consistently produce images of higher visual quality and achieve more favorable quantitative metrics compared to their fully classical counterparts. In particular, VQCs in the generator accelerate early feature learning, whereas those in the discriminator, despite exhibiting slower initial convergence, ultimately facilitate more refined synthetic outputs. Moreover, the model sustains near-comparable performance even when the dataset size is drastically reduced, suggesting that transfer learning and quantum enhancements mitigate the problem of data scarcity. Overall, the results underscore that carefully integrating quantum computing with classical adversarial training and pretrained feature extraction can considerably enrich GAN-based image synthesis. These insights open avenues for future work on higher-resolution tasks, alternative quantum circuit designs, and experimentation with emerging quantum hardware.</p>

We introduce a passive, interference-based methodology for suppressing radiative decay using only the intrinsic multi-mode structured environment of superconducting circuits. By taking into account the full electromagnetic mode-mode couplings within the device, we derive analytic conditions that enable destructive interference. These conditions are realized by introducing controlled geometric asymmetries -- such as localized perturbations to the transmon capacitor -- which increase mode hybridization and activate interference between multiple decay pathways. We validate this methodology using perturbation theory, full-wave electromagnetic simulations, and experimental measurements of a symmetry-broken transmon qubit with improved coherence times.</p>

            <p>We investigate the sequential composition of weak values in the framework of time-symmetric quantum mechanics. Specifically, we consider a forward'' weak measurement from a preselected state $\ket{\psi}$ to a post-selected state $\ket{\phi}$, followed by a reverse'' weak measurement. We show that the product of these two weak values corresponds to the normalized expectation value of a strong, state-conditioned observable $B = A P_\psi A$, where $P_\psi = \ket{\psi}\bra{\psi}$ is the projector onto the preselected state. Analyzing the structure of $B$, we demonstrate how it encodes interference information, particularly when $\ket{\psi}$ is a superposition rather than an eigenstate of $A$. This formulation extends naturally to mixed states by replacing $P_\psi$ with a generic density matrix $\rho$, linking the construction to the formalism of generalized quantum measurements. We illustrate practical applications in quantum information, including state-specific error witnessing in quantum computing, and show how the phase of a weak value can be inferred via strong measurements in the pure-state case.</p>

            <p>Quantum entanglement is a key resource for quantum technologies, yet its efficient and high-fidelity generation remains a challenge due to the complexity of quantum dynamics. This paper presents a quantum optimal control framework to maximize bipartite entanglement within a fixed time horizon, under bounded control inputs. By leveraging Pontryagin's Minimum Principle, we derive a set of necessary conditions that guide the design of time-dependent control fields to steer a two-qubit system toward maximally entangled Bell states. The entanglement is quantified using concurrence, and the control objective is formulated as maximizing this measure at the terminal time. Our approach is validated through numerical simulations of Liouville-von Neumann dynamics. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of switching-based control strategies in achieving robust entanglement, offering insights into practical implementations of quantum control for entanglement generation in quantum networks.</p>

In downconversion, throughput of this magnitude at the few-photon noise level is unprecedented. Using the quantum channel capacity, we also find an expression for the maximum rate at which quantum information can be transduced, providing insight into the importance of improving both a transducer's throughput and noise performance. With feasible improvements, the high throughput achieved with this device positions membrane-based transducers as a strategic choice for demonstrations of a quantum network with reasonable averaging times.</p>

            <p>Characterization of quantum systems from experimental data is a central problem in quantum science and technology. But which measurements should be used to gather data in the first place? While optimal measurement choices can be worked out for small quantum systems, the optimization becomes intractable as the system size grows large. To address this problem, we introduce a deep neural network with a sequence model architecture that searches for efficient measurement choices in a data-driven, adaptive manner. The model can be applied to a variety of tasks, including the prediction of linear and nonlinear properties of quantum states, as well as state clustering and state tomography tasks. In all these tasks, we find that the measurement choices identified by our neural network consistently outperform the uniformly random choice. Intriguingly, for topological quantum systems, our model tends to recommend measurements at the system's boundaries, even when the task is to predict bulk properties. This behavior suggests that the neural network may have independently discovered a connection between boundaries and bulk, without having been provided any built-in knowledge of quantum physics.</p>

By contrast, treating the wave-function as ontic allows a consistent and natural derivation of quantum uncertainty from the mathematical structure of Hilbert space.

            <p>Device-independent quantum random number generation (DIQRNG) is the gold standard for generating truly random numbers, as it can produce certifiably random numbers from untrusted devices. However, the stringent device requirements of traditional DIQRNG protocols have limited their practical applications. Here, we introduce Device-Independent Private Quantum Randomness Beacon (DIPQRB), a novel approach to generate random numbers from untrusted devices based on routed Bell tests. This method significantly relaxes the device requirements, enabling a more practical way of generating randomness from untrusted devices. By distributing the device requirements across a network of servers and clients, our proposal allows the server to operate high-performance devices while the clients can be equipped with more cost-effective devices. Moreover, the outputs of the client's device are also private, even against the server, which is essential in cryptographic applications. Therefore, DIPQRB provides a cost-effective method to generate secure and private random numbers from untrusted devices.</p>

The quantum limitation is fundamental, and cannot be relaxed by super-resolution techniques.</p>

            <h2>Has Anything Changed? Tracking Long-Term Interpretational Preferences in Quantum Mechanics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Petr O. Jedlička, Šimon Kos, Martin Šmíd, Jiří Vomlel, Jan Slavík</p>
            <p>As we approach the centennial anniversary of modern quantum mechanics this paper revisits the foundational debates through a new poll within the research community. Inspired by the survey by Schlosshauer, Kofler, and Zeilinger at the specialized 2011 Quantum Physics and the Nature of Reality conference, we expanded our recruitment to include a more representative sample of the broader community of physicists with the aim to reveal potential shifts in scientists' views and compare our findings with those from several previous polls. While quantum foundations still lack a consensus interpretation, our results indicate a persistent preference for the Copenhagen interpretation. This enduring support likely reflects both the educational emphasis on the Copenhagen interpretation and its pragmatic appeal in avoiding complex metaphysical questions and introducing new notions (e.g., other worlds or the pilot wave). Our findings thus underscore the relative stability of interpretational preferences over the past decades.</p>

            <h2>Indiscernibility of quantum states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jan van Neerven, Marijn Waaijer</p>
            <p>In this paper we develop a mathematical framework for indiscernibility of quantum states, arguing that, given a set of observables, the ``distinguishable objects'' are the equivalence classes modulo indiscernibility relative to the observables. The structure of the set of distinguishable objects - called the Holevo space - is investigated in detail, and it is shown that the observables admit a natural lift to continuous functions on the Holevo space. The theory is illustrated by several examples where the ``distinguishable objects'' can be described explicitly. Among other things, the Holevo spaces and the lifted functions are described for position measurements on a free particle and for spin measurements in the EPR and Bell experiments.</p>

            <h2>Testing APS conjecture on regular graphs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenxuan Tao, Fen Zuo</p>
            <p>The maximum energy of the EPR model on a weighted graph is known to be upper-bounded by the sum of the total weight and the value of maximum-weight fractional matching~(MWFM). Recently, Apte, Parekh and Sud~(APS) conjecture that the bound could be strengthened by replacing MWFM with maximum weight matching~(MWM). Here we test this conjecture on a special class of regular graphs that Henning and Yeo constructed many years ago. On this class of regular graphs, MWMs achieve tight lower bounds. As for the maximum energy of the EPR model, we have recently devised a new algorithm called Fractional Entanglement Distribution~(FED) based on quasi-homogeneous fractional matchings, which could achieve rather high accuracy. Applying the FED algorithm to the EPR model on Henning-Yeo graphs, we could thus obtain energy as high as possible and matching value as low as possible, and then make high-precision tests of the APS conjecture. Nevertheless, our numerical results do not show any evidence that the APS conjecture could be violated.</p>

            <p>We derive a thermodynamically consistent quantum master equation that satisfies locality for quadratic systems coupled to independent and identical baths at each site. We show that the quasi-local Redfield equation coincides exactly with the Davies equation, which satisfies the detailed-balance condition, due to cancellation of quantum coherence generated by each bath. This derivation does not rely on the secular approximation, which fails in systems with vanishing energy-level spacings. We discuss generalizations of our result to slowly driven quadratic systems and generic quantum many-body systems. Our result paves the way to a thermodynamically consistent description of quantum many-body systems.</p>

The feasibility of large-capacity quantum dense coding based on these entangled sideband modes is proved experimentally, which is of great significance for optimizing the utilization of quantum resources, thereby contributing to the advancement of large-capacity quantum communication networks and enabling the realization of more secure and efficient quantum communication systems.</p>

            <p>We present a systematic study of how quantum circuit design, specifically the depth of the variational ansatz and the choice of quantum feature mapping, affects the performance of hybrid quantum-classical neural networks on a causal classification task. The architecture combines a convolutional neural network for classical feature extraction with a parameterized quantum circuit acting as the quantum layer. We evaluate multiple ansatz depths and nine different feature maps. Results show that increasing the number of ansatz repetitions improves generalization and training stability, though benefits tend to plateau beyond a certain depth. The choice of feature mapping is even more critical: only encodings with multi-axis Pauli rotations enable successful learning, while simpler maps lead to underfitting or loss of class separability. Principal Component Analysis and silhouette scores reveal how data distributions evolve across network stages. These findings offer practical guidance for designing quantum circuits in hybrid models.

            <p>Quantum digital signatures ensure unforgeable message authenticity and integrity using quantum principles, offering unconditional security against both classical and quantum attacks. They are crucial for secure communication in high-stakes environments, ensuring trust and long-term protection in the quantum era. Nowadays, the majority of arbitrated quantum signature (AQS) protocols encrypt data qubit by qubit using the quantum one-time pad (QOTP). Despite providing robust data encryption, QOTP is not a good fit for AQS because of its susceptibility to many types of attacks. In this work, we present an efficient AQS protocol to encrypt quantum message ensembles using a distinct encryption technique, the chained controlled unitary operations. In contrast to existing protocols, our approach successfully prevents disavowal and forgery attacks. We hope this contributes to advancing future investigations into the development of AQS protocols.</p>

            <p>Non-Gaussian states are essential resources in quantum information processing. In this work, we investigate methods for quantifying bosonic non-Gaussianity in many-body systems. Building on recent theoretical insights into the self-convolution properties of bosonic pure states, we introduce non-Gaussian entropy as a new measure to characterize non-Gaussianity in bosonic pure states. We further propose a practical protocol for measuring non-Gaussian entropy using three beam splitters and four copies of the input state. In addition, we extend this framework to mixed states, providing a general approach to quantifying non-Gaussianity. Our results offer a convenient and efficient method for characterizing bosonic non-Gaussianity, paving the way for its implementation on near-term experimental platforms.</p>

            <p>A qubit-oscillator junction connecting as a series two bosonic heat baths at different temperatures can display heat valve and diode effects. In particular, the rectification can change in magnitude and even in sign, implying an inversion of the preferential direction for the heat current with respect to the temperature bias. We perform a systematic study of these effects in a circuit QED model of qubit-oscillator system and find that the features of current and rectification crucially depend on the qubit-oscillator coupling. While at small coupling, transport occurs via a resonant mechanism between the sub-systems, in the ultrastrong coupling regime the junction is a unique, highly hybridized system and the current becomes largely insensitive to the detuning. Correspondingly, the rectification undergoes a change of sign. In the nonlinear transport regime, the coupling strength determines whether the current scales sub- or super-linearly with the temperature bias and whether the rectification, which increases in magnitude with the bias, is positive or negative. We also find that steady-state coherence largely suppresses the current and enhances rectification. An insight on these behaviors with respect to changes in the system parameters is provided by analytical approximate formulas.</p>

            <h2>From Linear Differential Equations to Unitaries: A Moment-Matching Dilation Framework with Near-Optimal Quantum Algorithms</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiantao Li</p>
            <p>Quantum speed-ups for dynamical simulation usually demand unitary time-evolution, whereas the large ODE/PDE systems encountered in realistic physical models are generically non-unitary. We present a universal moment-fulfilling dilation that embeds any linear, non-Hermitian flow $\dot x = A x$ with $A=-iH+K$ into a strictly unitary evolution on an enlarged Hilbert space: \[ ( (l| \otimes I ) \mathcal T e^{-i \int ( I_A\otimes H +i F\otimes K) dt} ( |r) \otimes I ) = \mathcal T e^{\int A dt}, \] provided the triple $( F, (l|, |r) )$ satisfies the compact moment identities $(l| F^{k}|r) =1$ for all $k\ge 0$ in the ancilla space. This algebraic criterion recovers both \emph{Schrödingerization} [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 230602 (2024)] and the linear-combination-of-Hamiltonians (LCHS) scheme [Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 150603 (2023)], while also unveiling whole families of new dilations built from differential, integral, pseudo-differential, and difference generators. Each family comes with a continuous tuning parameter \emph{and} is closed under similarity transformations that leave the moments invariant, giving rise to an overwhelming landscape of design space that allows quantum dilations to be co-optimized for specific applications, algorithms, and hardware. As concrete demonstrations, we prove that a simple finite-difference dilation in a finite interval attains near-optimal oracle complexity. Numerical experiments on Maxwell viscoelastic wave propagation confirm the accuracy and robustness of the approach.</p>

            <p>Excited states play a central role in determining the physical properties of quantum matter, yet their accurate computation in many-body systems remains a formidable challenge for numerical methods. While neural quantum states have delivered outstanding results for ground-state problems, extending their applicability to excited states has faced limitations, including instability in dense spectra and reliance on symmetry constraints or penalty-based formulations. In this work, we rigorously formalize the framework introduced by Pfau et al.~\cite{pfau2024accurate} in terms of Grassmann geometry of the Hilbert space. This allows us to generalize the Stochastic Reconfiguration method for the simultaneous optimization of multiple variational wave functions, and to introduce the multidimensional versions of operator variances and overlaps. We validate our approach on the Heisenberg quantum spin model on the square lattice, achieving highly accurate energies and physical observables for a large number of excited states.</p>

            <p>Understanding how a quantum many-body state is maintained stably as a nonequilibrium steady state is of fundamental and practical importance for exploration and exploitation of open quantum systems. We establish a general equivalent condition for an open quantum many-body system governed by the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad dynamics under local drive and/or dissipation to have a quantum independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) steady state. We present a sufficient condition for a system to have a quantum i.i.d. steady state by identifying a set of operators that commute with arbitrary quantum i.i.d. states. In particular, a set of quantum i.i.d. states is found to be an invariant subset of time evolution superoperators for systems that satisfy the sufficient condition. These findings not only identify a class of models with exactly solvable steady states but also lead to a no-go theorem that precludes quantum entanglement and spatial correlations in a broad class of quantum many-body steady states in a dissipative environment.</p>

            <p>We present a method to suppress crosstalk from implementing controlled-Z gates via local addressing in neutral atom quantum computers. In these systems, a fraction of the laser light that is applied locally to implement gates typically leaks to other atoms. We analyze the resulting crosstalk in a setup of two gate atoms and one neighboring third atom. We then perturbatively derive a spin-echo-inspired gate protocol that suppresses the leading order of the amplitude error, which dominates the crosstalk. Numerical simulations demonstrate that our gate protocol improves the fidelity by two orders of magnitude across a broad range of experimentally relevant parameters. To further reduce the infidelity, we develop a circuit to cancel remaining phase errors. Our results pave the way for using local addressing for high-fidelity quantum gates on Rydberg-based quantum computers.</p>

            <h2>Exponential-recovery model for free-running SPADs with capacity-induced dead-time imperfections</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jan Krause, Nino Walenta</p>
            <p>Current count-rate models for single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) typically assume an instantaneous recovery of the quantum efficiency following dead-time, leading to a systematic overestimation of the effective detection efficiency for high photon flux. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a generalized analytical count-rate model for free-running SPADs that models the non-instantaneous, exponential recovery of the quantum efficiency following dead-time. Our model, framed within the theory of non-homogeneous Poisson processes, only requires one additional detector parameter -- the exponential-recovery time constant $\tau_\mathrm{r}$. The model accurately predicts detection statistics deep into the saturation regime, outperforming the conventional step-function model by two orders of magnitude in terms of the impinging photon rate. For extremely high photon flux, we further extend the model to capture paralyzation effects. Beyond photon flux estimation, our model simplifies SPAD characterization by enabling the extraction of quantum efficiency $\eta_0$, dead-time $\tau_\mathrm{d}$, and recovery time constant $\tau_\mathrm{r}$ from a single inter-detection interval histogram. This can be achieved with a simple setup, without the need for pulsed lasers or externally gated detectors. We anticipate broad applicability of our model in quantum key distribution (QKD), time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC), LIDAR, and related areas. Furthermore, the model is readily adaptable to other types of dead-time-limited detectors. A Python implementation is provided as supplementary material for swift adoption.</p>

            <h2>State-Based Classical Shadows</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zvika Brakerski, Nir Magrafta, Tomer Solomon</p>
            <p>Classical Shadow Tomography (Huang, Kueng and Preskill, Nature Physics 2020) is a method for creating a classical snapshot of an unknown quantum state, which can later be used to predict the value of an a-priori unknown observable on that state. In the short time since their introduction, classical shadows received a lot of attention from the physics, quantum information, and quantum computing (including cryptography) communities. In particular there has been a major effort focused on improving the efficiency, and in particular depth, of generating the classical snapshot. Existing constructions rely on a distribution of unitaries as a central building block, and research is devoted to simplifying this family as much as possible. We diverge from this paradigm and show that suitable distributions over \emph{states} can be used as the building block instead. Concretely, we create the snapshot by entangling the unknown input state with an independently prepared auxiliary state, and measuring the resulting entangled state. This state-based approach allows us to consider a building block with arguably weaker properties that has not been studied so far in the context of classical shadows. Notably, our cryptographically-inspired analysis shows that for \emph{efficiently computable} observables, it suffices to use \emph{pseudorandom} families of states. To the best of our knowledge, \emph{computational} classical shadow tomography was not considered in the literature prior to our work. Finally, in terms of efficiency, the online part of our method (i.e.\ the part that depends on the input) is simply performing a measurement in the Bell basis, which can be done in constant depth using elementary gates.</p>

            <p>In this work we present a comprehensive method of characterization and optimization of laser irradiation within a confocal microscope tailored to quantum sensing experiments using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centres. While confocal microscopy is well-suited for such experiments, precise control and understanding of several optical parameters are essential for reliable single-emitter studies. We investigate the laser beam intensity profile, single-photon emission statistics, fluorescence response under varying polarization and saturation conditions, spectral characteristics, and the temporal profiles of readout and reinitialization pulses. The beam quality is assessed using the beam propagation factor $M^2$, determined via the razorblade technique. Optical fluorescence spectrum is recorded to confirm NV centre emission. To confirm single-emitter operation, we measure second-order autocorrelation function $g^{(2)}(\tau)$. Saturation behaviour is analysed by varying laser power and recording the corresponding fluorescence, while polarization dependence is studied using a half-wave ($\lambda/2$) plate. Temporal laser pulse profile is examined by modulating the power of an acousto-optic modulator. After optimizing all relevant parameters, we demonstrate the microscope's capabilities in driving spin transitions of a single NV centre. This work establishes a straightforward and effective protocol for laser excitation optimization, enhancing the performance and reliability of NV-based quantum sensors.</p>

            <p>We investigate the response of a Ramsey interferometric quantum sensor based on a frustrated, three-spin system (a Kitaev trimer) to a classical time-dependent field (signal). The system eigenspectrum is symmetric about a critical point, $|\vec{b}| = 0$, with four of the spectral components varying approximately linearly with the magnetic field and four exhibiting a nonlinear dependence. Under the adiabatic approximation and for appropriate initial states, we show that the sensor's response to a zero-mean signal is such that below a threshold, $|\vec{b}| < b_\mathrm{th}$, the sensor does not respond to the signal, whereas above the threshold, the sensor acts as a detector that the signal has occurred. This thresholded response is approximately omnidirectional. Moreover, when deployed in an entangled multisensor configuration, the sensor achieves sensitivity at the Heisenberg limit. Such detectors could be useful both as standalone units for signal detection above a noise threshold and in two- or three-dimensional arrays, analogous to a quantum bubble chamber, for applications such as particle track detection and long-baseline telescopy.</p>

            <h2>Wave packets in QFT: leading order width corrections to decay rates and clock behaviour under Lorentz boosts</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ariel Edery</p>
            <p>Decay rates in quantum field theory (QFT) are typically calculated assuming the particles are represented by momentum eigenstates (i.e. plane waves). However, strictly speaking, localized free particles should be represented by wave packets. This yields width corrections to the decay rate and to the clock behaviour under Lorentz boosts. We calculate the decay rate of a particle of mass $M$ modeled as a Gaussian wavepacket of width $a$ and centered at zero momentum. We find the decay rate to be $\Gamma_0 \big[1- \frac{3 a^2}{4 M^2} +\mathcal{O}\big(\tfrac{a^4}{M^4}\big)\big]$ where $\Gamma_0$ is the decay rate of the particle at rest treated as a plane wave. The leading correction is then of order $\tfrac{a^2}{M^2}$. We then perform a Lorentz boost of velocity $v$ on the above Gaussian and find that its decay rate does not decrease \textit{exactly} by the Lorentz factor $\sqrt{1-v^2}$. There is a correction of order $\tfrac{a^2v^2}{M^2}$. Therefore, the decaying wave packet does not act exactly like a typical clock under Lorentz boosts and we refer to it is a "WP clock" (wave packet clock). A WP clock does not move with a single velocity relative to an observer but has a spread in velocities (more specifically, a spread in momenta). Nonetheless, it is best viewed as a single clock as the wave packet represents a one-particle state in QFT. WP clocks do not violate Lorentz symmetry and are not based on new physics: they are a consequence of the combined requirements of special relativity, quantum mechanics and \textit{localized} free particles.</p>

            <h2>Two types of series expansions valid at strong coupling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ariel Edery</p>
            <p>It is known that perturbative expansions in powers of the coupling in quantum mechanics (QM) and quantum field theory (QFT) are asymptotic series. This can be useful at weak coupling but fails at strong coupling. In this work, we present two types of series expansions valid at strong coupling. We apply the series to a basic integral as well as a QM path integral containing a quadratic and quartic term with coupling constant $\lambda$. The first series is the usual asymptotic one, where the quartic interaction is expanded in powers of $\lambda$. The second series is an expansion of the quadratic part where the interaction is left alone. This yields an absolutely convergent series in inverse powers of $\lambda$ valid at strong coupling. For the basic integral, we revisit the first series and identify what makes it diverge even though the original integral is finite. We fix the problem and obtain, remarkably, a series in powers of the coupling which is absolutely convergent and valid at strong coupling. We explain how this series avoids Dyson's argument on convergence. We then consider the QM path integral (discretized with time interval divided into $N$ equal segments). As before, the second series is absolutely convergent and we obtain analytical expressions in inverse powers of $\lambda$ for the $n$th order terms by taking functional derivatives of generalized hypergeometric functions. The expressions are functions of $N$ and we work them out explicitly up to third order. The general procedure has been implemented in a Mathematica program that generates the expressions at any order $n$. We present numerical results at strong coupling for different values of $N$ starting at $N=2$. The series matches the exact numerical value for a given $N$ (up to a certain accuracy). The continuum is formally reached when $N\to \infty$ but in practice this can be reached at small $N$.</p>

The competition between the repulsive interaction between the quasiholes themselves and the attractive interaction between the quasiholes and the impurity leads to states with different numbers of quasiholes bound to the impurity. Tuning the chemical potential via gating while remaining within a quantum Hall plateau changes the number of quasiholes bound to the impurity. We propose methods for studying these states experimentally, for example using scanning tunneling microscopy and exciton spectroscopy. While the impurities in traditional platforms such as GaAs heterostructures are typically too weak to observe the binding of anyons, the recently discovered zero-field fractional Chern insulators in twisted MoTe$_2$ offer a platform which may realize the strong-impurity regime.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nader Mostaan, Nathan Goldman, Ataç İmamoğlu, Fabian Grusdt</p>
            <p>The study of anyons in topologically ordered quantum systems has mainly relied on edge-state interferometry. However, realizing controlled braiding of anyons necessitates the ability to detect and manipulate individual anyons within the bulk. Here, we propose and theoretically investigate a first step toward this goal by demonstrating that a long-lived, optically generated interlayer exciton can bind to a quasihole in a fractional quantum Hall state, forming a composite excitation we term an anyon-trion. Using exact diagonalization, we show that mobile anyon-trions possess a binding energy of approximately 0.5 meV, whereas static anyon-trions exhibit a binding energy of about 0.9 meV, that is linearly proportional to the quasiholes fractional charge. An experimental realization based on photoluminescence from localized interlayer excitons in a quantum twisting microscope setup should allow for a direct optical observation of anyon-trions.</p>

            <p>Improving the coherence of superconducting qubits is essential for advancing quantum technologies. While superconductors are theoretically perfect conductors, they consistently exhibit residual energy dissipation when driven by microwave currents, limiting coherence times. Here, we report a universal scaling between microwave dissipation and the superfluid density, a bulk property of superconductors related to charge carrier density and disorder. Our analysis spans a wide range of superconducting materials and device geometries, from highly disordered amorphous films to ultra-clean systems with record-high quality factors, including resonators, 3D cavities, and transmon qubits. This scaling reveals an intrinsic bulk dissipation channel, independent of surface dielectric losses, that originates from a universal density of nonequilibrium quasiparticles trapped within disorder-induced spatial variations of the superconducting gap. Our findings define a fundamental limit to coherence set by intrinsic material properties and provide a predictive framework for selecting materials and the design of next-generation superconducting quantum circuits.</p>

            <p>Machine Learning (ML) models for electronic structure rely on large datasets generated through expensive Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory simulations. This study reveals a surprisingly high level of redundancy in such datasets across various material systems, including molecules, simple metals, and complex alloys. Our findings challenge the prevailing assumption that large, exhaustive datasets are necessary for accurate ML predictions of electronic structure. We demonstrate that even random pruning can substantially reduce dataset size with minimal loss in predictive accuracy, while a state-of-the-art coverage-based pruning strategy retains chemical accuracy and model generalizability using up to 100-fold less data and reducing training time by threefold or more. By contrast, widely used importance-based pruning methods, which eliminate seemingly redundant data, can catastrophically fail at higher pruning factors, possibly due to the significant reduction in data coverage. This heretofore unexplored high degree of redundancy in electronic structure data holds the potential to identify a minimal, essential dataset representative of each material class.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julian Schwingel, Michael Turaev, Johann Kroha, Sayak Ray</p>
            <p>We study the spatio-temporal dynamics of interacting bosons on a two-dimensional Hubbard lattice in the strongly interacting regime, taking into account the dynamics of condensate amplitude as well as the direct transport of non-condensed fluctuations. To that end we develop a selfconsistent density-matrix approach which goes beyond the standard Gutzwiller mean-field theory. Starting from the Liouville-von-Neumann equation we derive a quantum master equation for the time evolution of the system's local density matrix at each lattice site, with a dynamical bath that represents the rest of the system. We apply this method to the expansion dynamics of an initially prepared cloud of interacting bosons in an optical lattice. We observe a ballistic expansion of the condensate, as expected, followed by slow, diffusive transport of the normal bosons. We discuss, in particular, the robustness of the Mott insulator phase as well as its melting due to incoherent transport. The method should be applicable to various models of lattice bosons in the strongly correlated regime.</p>

            <h2>Lyapunov formulation of band theory for disordered non-Hermitian systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Konghao Sun, Haiping Hu</p>
            <p>Non-Bloch band theory serves as a cornerstone for understanding intriguing non-Hermitian phenomena, such as the skin effect and extreme spectral sensitivity to boundary conditions. Yet this theory hinges on translational symmetry and thus breaks down in disordered systems. Here, we develop a real-space Lyapunov formulation of band theory that governs the spectra and eigenstates of disordered non-Hermitian systems. This framework yields universal non-Hermitian Thouless relations linking spectral density and localization to Lyapunov exponents under different boundary conditions. We further identify an exact topological criterion: skin modes and Anderson-localized modes correspond to nonzero and zero winding numbers, respectively, revealing the topological nature of the skin-Anderson transition. This transition is dictated by an essential Lyapunov exponent and gives rise to novel unidirectional critical states. Our formulation provides a unified and exact description of spectra and localization in generic one-dimensional non-Hermitian systems without translational symmetry, offering new insights into the interplay among non-Hermiticity, disorder, and topology.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Victor Berenstein, Giacomo Valtolina, Zohar Amitay, Nimrod Moiseyev</p>
            <p>The gas-phase hydrogen exchange reaction (HER) is the most fundamental chemical process for benchmarking quantum reaction dynamics. In this Letter, we focus on controlling HER by means of strong light-matter coupling inside a resonant cavity, an approach often called polariton chemistry. In particular, we focus on the isotopic variation of HER involving collisions between molecular hydrogen H$_2$ and deuterium atom D, i.e., H$_2$+D$\to$HD+H. We find that the asymmetry introduced by the different isotopes, despite being small, enables strong cavity-induced modifications of reaction rates. Outside of the cavity the reaction is as usual D+H${_2}$$\to$DH+H. However, inside the cavity another type of reactions take place where D+H$_2$$\to$DH+H+E$_{photon}$, where E$_{photon}$=$\hbar\omega_{cav}$. Our results show that HER is an ideal platform to make a significant step toward closing the gap between theory and experiment in polariton chemistry.</p>

            <h2>Emergent Distance from Mutual Information in the Critical 1D XXZ Spin Chain</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Beau Leighton-Trudel</p>
            <p>The possibility that spatial geometry may emerge from the entanglement structure of a quantum many-body system is a subject of fundamental interest. Here, we propose and numerically test a candidate distance metric in 1D, d_E, defined purely from quantum mutual information (I) via the relation d_E = K_0 / sqrt(I). Using large-scale density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we compute this emergent distance for the ground state of the 1D spin-1/2 XXZ chain, a canonical model system. Our simulations show that in the quantum critical phase at anisotropy $\Delta = 1.0$, the mutual information exhibits a power-law decay consistent with the emergence of a valid metric space. In stark contrast, within the gapped, antiferromagnetic phase ($\Delta = 2.0$), where mutual information decays exponentially, the emergent distance grows exponentially, a behavior inconsistent with the triangle inequality. These results provide numerical evidence that this information-theoretic definition can yield a well-behaved geometry in critical systems, offering a quantitative tool for probing quantum phases and motivating further analytical investigation into the foundations of emergent space.</p>

            <p>Multi-donor architecture developed on the base of silicon technology holds significant potential towards room-temperature qubit and other single-electron tunneling (SET) functionalities. However, within such architecture, the overlap of multiple donor wave-functions results in a complex internal electronic configuration with discrete energy levels. Probing these discrete states, observed as multiple conductance peaks, is essential for understanding inter-donor coupling and exchange interactions towards coherent electron transfer. In this direction, we have experimentally demonstrated one-by-one electron filling within multiple-donor molecules with the fundamental analysis of clear and sustained quantum Coulomb blockade (QCB) effect. Moreover, the underlying physics of molecular orbitals, where the increasing energy leads to a larger spatial extent of the corresponding orbital, has been reflected by the systematic decrement of the respective charging-energies. The molecular energy levels, resulting from the orbital hybridization of individual donors, are also confirmed through first-principles simulations using density functional theory (DFT). Furthermore, Monte Carlo simulations based on the orthodox theory of Coulomb blockade support the observed QCB characteristics.</p>

            <h2>Thermodynamic adsorption potential of superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiu Hui Wu, Jiamin Niu, Kejiang Zhou</p>
            <p>Based on the general thermodynamic analysis of Polanyi adsorption potential, the adsorption potential condition for superconductors is obtained exactly by using the quantum state equation we presented. Because this adsorption potential results in changes of electron concentration, temperature and pressure in a certain volume (adsorption space) adjacent to the surface of the lattice, the composition and structure of superconductors are of course decisive for the adsorption potential. Then we calculate the molar adsorption potentials for those typical superconductors, and find that it is positively correlated to the superconductivity temperature , which reveals that those high-superconductors are mainly determined by the higher molar adsorption potentials. In addition, the adsorption potential at still works despite the disappearance of the energy gap of the BCS theory. This shows that beyond the electron-phonon interaction mechanism, the Cooper-paired electrons are mainly formed by this physical adsorption potential for high-superconductors. This adsorption potential theory could explain almost all common facts about high-temperature superconductors, including many anomalies of the normal and superconducting states.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Koustabh Gogoi, Tanay Nag, Arnob Kumar Ghosh</p>
            <p>Periodic drive is an intriguing way of creating topological phases in a non-topological setup. However, most systems are often studied as a closed system, despite being always in contact with the environment, which induces dissipation. Here, we investigate a periodically driven Rashba nanowire in proximity to an $s$-wave superconductor in a dissipative background. The system's dynamics is governed by a periodic Liouvillian operator, from which we construct the Liouvillian time-evolution operator and use the third-quantization method to obtain the `Floquet damping matrix', which captures the spectral and topological properties of the system. We show that the system exhibits edge-localized topological Majorana $0$-modes (MZMs) and $\pi$-modes (MPMs). Additionally, the system also supports a trivial $0$-modes (TZMs) and $\pi$-modes (TPMs), which are also localized at the edges of the system. The MZMs and the MPMs are connected to the bulk topology and carry a bulk topological invariant, while the emergence of TZMs and TPMs is primarily tied to exceptional points and is topologically trivial. We study the topological phase diagrams in terms of the topological invariants and show that the dissipation can modify the topological phase diagram substantially and even induce topological phases in the system. Our work extends the understanding of a driven-dissipative topological superconductor.</p>

            <p>The negatively charged diamond nitrogen-vacancy ($\mathrm{{NV}^-}$) center plays a central role in many cutting edge quantum sensing applications; despite this, much is still unknown about the energy levels in this system. The ionization energy of the $\mathrm{^{1}E}$ singlet state in the $\mathrm{{NV}^-}$ has only recently been measured at between 2.25 eV and 2.33 eV. In this work, we further refine this energy by measuring the $\mathrm{^{1}E}$ energy as a function of laser wavelength and diamond temperature via magnetically mediated spin-selective photoluminescence (PL) quenching; this PL quenching indicating at what wavelength ionization induces population transfer from the $\mathrm{^{1}E}$ into the neutral $\mathrm{{NV}^0}$ charge configuration. Measurements are performed for excitation wavelengths between 450 nm and 470 nm and between 540 nm and 566 nm in increments of 2 nm, and for temperatures ranging from about 50 K to 150 K in 5 K increments. We determine the $\mathrm{^{1}E}$ ionization energy to be between 2.29 and 2.33 eV, which provides about a two-fold reduction in uncertainty of this quantity. Distribution level: A.

            <p>Photonic and polaritonic systems offer a fast and efficient platform for accelerating machine learning (ML) through physics-based computing. To gain a computational advantage, however, polaritonic systems must: (1) exploit features that specifically favor nonlinear optical processing; (2) address problems that are computationally hard and depend on these features; (3) integrate photonic processing within broader ML pipelines. In this letter, we propose a polaritonic machine learning approach for solving graph-based data problems. We demonstrate how lattices of condensates can efficiently embed relational and topological information from point cloud datasets. This information is then incorporated into a pattern recognition workflow based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), leading to significantly improved learning performance compared to physics-agnostic methods. Our extensive benchmarking shows that photonic machine learning achieves over 90\% accuracy for Betti number classification and clique detection tasks - a substantial improvement over the 35\% accuracy of bare CNNs. Our study introduces a distinct way of using photonic systems as fast tools for feature engineering, while building on top of high-performing digital machine learning.</p>

            <p>Distinguishability is fundamental to information theory and extends naturally to quantum systems. While quantum state discrimination is well understood, quantum channel discrimination remains challenging due to the dynamic nature of channels and the variety of discrimination strategies. This work advances the understanding of quantum channel discrimination and its fundamental limits. We develop new tools for quantum divergences, including sharper bounds on the quantum hypothesis testing relative entropy and additivity results for channel divergences. We establish a quantum Stein's lemma for memoryless channel discrimination, and link the strong converse property to the asymptotic equipartition property and continuity of divergences. Notably, we prove the equivalence of exponentially strong converse properties under coherent and sequential strategies. We further explore the interplay among operational regimes, discrimination strategies, and channel divergences, deriving exponents in various settings and contributing to a unified framework for channel discrimination. Finally, we recast quantum communication tasks as discrimination problems, uncovering deep connections between channel capacities, channel discrimination, and the mathematical structure of channel divergences. These results bridge two core areas of quantum information theory and offer new insights for future exploration.</p>

            <p>Optimization of constrained quantum control problems powers quantum technologies. This task becomes very difficult when these control problems are non-convex and plagued with dense local extrema. For such problems current optimization methods must be repeated many times to find good solutions, each time requiring many simulations of the system. Here, we present Quantum Control via Polynomial Optimization (QCPOP), a method that eliminates this problem by directly finding globally optimal solutions. The resulting increase in speed, which can be a thousandfold or more, makes it possible to solve problems that were previously intractable. This remarkable advance is due to global optimization methods recently developed for polynomial functions. We demonstrate the power of this method by showing that it obtains an optimal solution in a single run for a problem in which local extrema are so dense that gradient methods require thousands of runs to reach a similar fidelity. Since QCPOP is able to find the global optimum for quantum control, we expect that it will not only enhance the utility of quantum control by making it much easier to find the necessary protocols, but provide a key tool for understanding the precise limits of quantum technologies. Finally, we note that the ability to cast quantum control as polynomial optimization resolves an open question regarding the computability of exact solutions to quantum control problems.</p>

            <p>Quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) is a rapidly developing quantum communication approach, where secure information is directly transmitted, providing an alternative to key-based (de)encryption processes via Quantum Key Distribution (QKD). During the last decade, optical QSDC protocols based on discrete variable encodings have been successfully realized. Recently, continuous-variable (CV) QSDC schemes have been proposed, benefiting from less-sophisticated implementations with proven security. Here, we report the first table-top experimental demonstration of a CV-QSDC system and assess its security. For this realization, we analyze the security of different configurations, including coherent and squeezed sources, with Wyner wiretap channel theory in presence of a beam splitter attack. This practical protocol not only demonstrates the principle of QSDC systems based on CV encoding, but also showcases the advantage of squeezed states over coherent ones in attaining enhanced security and reliable communication in lossy and noisy channels. Our realization, which is founded on mature telecom components, paves the way into future threat-less quantum metropolitan networks, compatible with coexisting advanced wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) systems.</p>

These intersections are identified through this transcendental function. EPs emerge between pairs of adjacent excited energy levels, shifting toward lower coupling strengths as energy levels increase. The fidelity susceptibility diverges to negative infinity at the EPs, consistent with recent findings in non-Hermitian systems, while it diverges to positive infinity at the doubly degenerate points. The EPs are further confirmed by the vanishing c-product in the biorthogonal basis. All eigenstates are characterized by conserved energy and QRM parity. We conclude that the non-Hermitian QRM is integrable, analogous to its Hermitian counterpart.</p>

            <h2>Rate Function Modelling of Quantum Many-Body Adiabaticity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vibhu Mishra, Salvatore Manmana, Stefan Kehrein</p>
            <p>The quantum adiabatic theorem is a fundamental result in quantum mechanics, with a multitude of applications, both theoretical and practical. Here, we investigate the dynamics of adiabatic processes for quantum many-body systems %in detail by analysing the properties of observable-free, intensive quantities. In particular, we study the adiabatic rate function $f(T, \Delta \lambda)$ in dependence of the ramp time $T$, which gives us a complete characterization of the many-body adiabatic fidelity as a function of $T$ and the strength of the parameter displacement $\Delta \lambda$. $f(T, \Delta \lambda)$ quantifies the deviation from adiabaticity for a given process and therefore allows us to control and define the notion of adiabaticity in many-body systems. First we study $f(T, \Delta \lambda)$ for the 1D transverse field Ising model and the Luttinger liquid, both of which are quadratic systems and therefore allow us to look at the thermodynamic limit. For ramps across gapped phases, we relate $f(T, \Delta \lambda)$ to the transition probability of the system and for ramps across a gapless point, or gapless phase we relate it to the excitation density of the relevant quasiparticles. Then we investigate the XXZ model which allows us to see the qualitative features that survive when interactions are turned on. Several key results in the literature regarding the interplay of the thermodynamic and the adiabatic limit are obtained as inferences from the properties of $f(T, \Delta \lambda)$ in the large $T$ limit.</p>

            <p>This study introduces the Quantum Federated Neural Network for Financial Fraud Detection (QFNN-FFD), a cutting-edge framework merging Quantum Machine Learning (QML) and quantum computing with Federated Learning (FL) for financial fraud detection. Using quantum technologies' computational power and the robust data privacy protections offered by FL, QFNN-FFD emerges as a secure and efficient method for identifying fraudulent transactions within the financial sector.

We derive the local GKSL equation on the basis of the Lieb-Robinson bound, which provides an upper bound of the propagation of information in quantum many-body systems. We numerically test the validity of the derived local GKSL equation for a one-dimensional tight-binding fermion chain.</p>

            <p>A universal quantum computer can simulate diverse quantum systems, with electronic structure for chemistry offering challenging problems for practical use cases around the hundred-qubit mark. While current quantum processors have reached this size, deep circuits and large number of measurements lead to prohibitive runtimes for quantum computers in isolation. Here, we demonstrate the use of classical distributed computing to offload all but an intrinsically quantum component of a workflow for electronic structure simulations. Using a Heron superconducting processor and the supercomputer Fugaku, we simulate the ground-state dissociation of N$_2$ and the [2Fe-2S] and [4Fe-4S] clusters, with circuits up to 77 qubits and 10,570 gates. The proposed algorithm processes quantum samples to produce upper bounds for the ground-state energy and sparse approximations to the ground-state wavefunctions. Our results suggest that, for current error rates, a quantum-centric supercomputing architecture can tackle challenging chemistry problems beyond sizes amenable to exact diagonalization.</p>

            <p>This study investigates the efficacy of Stochastic Hill Climbing with Random Restarts (SHC-RR) compared to Local Search (LS) strategies within the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) framework across various problem models. Employing uniform parameter settings, including the number of restarts and SHC steps, we analyze LS with two distinct perturbation operations: multiplication and summation. Our comparative analysis encompasses multiple versions of max-cut and random Ising model (RI) problems, utilizing QAOA models with depths ranging from $1L$ to $3L$. These models incorporate diverse mixing operator configurations, which integrate $RX$ and $RY$ gates, and explore the effects of an entanglement stage within the mixing operator. Our results consistently show that SHC-RR outperforms LS approaches, showcasing superior efficacy despite its ostensibly simpler optimization mechanism. Furthermore, we observe that the inclusion of entanglement stages within mixing operators significantly impacts model performance, either enhancing or diminishing results depending on the specific problem context.</p>

            <h2>Probing quantum complexity via universal saturation of stabilizer entropies</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tobias Haug, Leandro Aolita, M.S. Kim</p>
            <p>Nonstabilizerness or `magic' is a key resource for quantum computing and a necessary condition for quantum advantage. Non-Clifford operations turn stabilizer states into resourceful states, where the amount of nonstabilizerness is quantified by resource measures such as stabilizer Rényi entropies (SREs). Here, we show that SREs saturate their maximum value at a critical number of non-Clifford operations. Close to the critical point SREs show universal behavior. Remarkably, the derivative of the SRE crosses at the same point independent of the number of qubits and can be rescaled onto a single curve. We find that the critical point depends non-trivially on Rényi index $\alpha$. For random Clifford circuits doped with T-gates, the critical T-gate density scales independently of $\alpha$. In contrast, for random Hamiltonian evolution, the critical time scales linearly with qubit number for $\alpha>1$, while is a constant for $\alpha<1$. This highlights that $\alpha$-SREs reveal fundamentally different aspects of nonstabilizerness depending on $\alpha$: $\alpha$-SREs with $\alpha<1$ relate to Clifford simulation complexity, while $\alpha>1$ probe the distance to the closest stabilizer state and approximate state certification cost via Pauli measurements. As technical contributions, we observe that the Pauli spectrum of random evolution can be approximated by two highly concentrated peaks which allows us to compute its SRE. Further, we introduce a class of random evolution that can be expressed as random Clifford circuits and rotations, where we provide its exact SRE. Our results opens up new approaches to characterize the complexity of quantum systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Quoc Hoan Tran, Yasuhiro Endo, Hirotaka Oshima</p>
            <p>Quantum machine learning (QML) requires significant quantum resources to address practical real-world problems. When the underlying quantum information exhibits hierarchical structures in the data, limitations persist in training complexity and generalization. Research should prioritize both the efficient design of quantum architectures and the development of learning strategies to optimize resource usage. We propose a framework called quantum curriculum learning (Q-CurL) for quantum data, where the curriculum introduces simpler tasks or data to the learning model before progressing to more challenging ones. Q-CurL exhibits robustness to noise and data limitations, which is particularly relevant for current and near-term noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. We achieve this through a curriculum design based on quantum data density ratios and a dynamic learning schedule that prioritizes the most informative quantum data. Empirical evidence shows that Q-CurL significantly enhances training convergence and generalization for unitary learning and improves the robustness of quantum phase recognition tasks. Q-CurL is effective with physical learning applications in physics and quantum chemistry.</p>

            <p>Accurately estimating the properties of quantum systems is a central challenge in quantum computing and quantum information. We propose a method to obtain unbiased estimators of multiple observables with low statistical error by post-processing informationally complete measurements using tensor networks. Compared to other observable estimation protocols based on classical shadows and measurement frames, our approach offers several advantages: (i) it can be optimised to provide lower statistical error, resulting in a reduced measurement budget to achieve a specified estimation precision; (ii) it scales to a large number of qubits due to the tensor network structure; (iii) it can be applied to any measurement protocol with measurement operators that have an efficient tensor-network representation. We benchmark the method through various numerical examples, including spin and chemical systems, and show that our method can provide statistical error that are orders of magnitude lower than the ones given by classical shadows.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kaiyuan Ji, Hemant K. Mishra, Milán Mosonyi, Mark M. Wilde</p>
            <p>Quantum state exclusion is an operational task that has significance in studying foundational questions related to interpreting quantum theory. In such a task, one is given a system whose state is randomly selected from a finite set, and the goal is to identify a state from the set that is not the true state of the system. An error, i.e., an unsuccessful exclusion, occurs if and only if the state identified is the true state. In this paper, we study the optimal error probability of quantum state exclusion and its error exponent -- the rate at which the error probability decays asymptotically -- from an information-theoretic perspective. Our main finding is a single-letter upper bound on the error exponent of state exclusion given by the multivariate log-Euclidean Chernoff divergence, and we prove that this improves upon the best previously known upper bound. We also extend our analysis to the more complicated task of quantum channel exclusion, and we establish a single-letter and efficiently computable upper bound on its error exponent, even assuming the use of adaptive strategies. We derive both upper bounds, for state and channel exclusion, based on one-shot analysis and formulate them as a type of multivariate divergence measure called a barycentric Chernoff divergence. Moreover, our result on channel exclusion has implications in two important special cases. First, for the special case of two hypotheses, our upper bound provides the first known efficiently computable upper bound on the error exponent of symmetric binary channel discrimination. Second, for the special case of classical channels, we show that our upper bound is achievable by a parallel strategy, thus solving the exact error exponent of classical channel exclusion and generalising a similar result on symmetric binary classical channel discrimination.</p>

            <h2>A Counterdiabatic Route to Entanglement Steering and Dynamical Freezing in the Floquet Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nakshatra Gangopadhay, Sayan Choudhury</p>
            <p>Controlling the dynamics of quantum many-body systems is crucial for developing quantum technologies. This work demonstrates that counter-diabatic (CD) driving provides a powerful tool for steering collective spin systems along entangled trajectories for a long time. In particular, CD driving leads to approximate stroboscopic freezing and eternal entanglement oscillations for a large class of initial states in the periodically driven Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model. Intriguingly, CD driving generates spin squeezing and its associated metrologically useful multipartite entanglement at the mid-point of every drive cycle, when the system is initially prepared in a fully x-polarized state. The CD driving induced non-ergodic dynamics is accompanied by a decrease in the average eigenstate entanglement and inverse participation ratio, thereby signalling greater eigenstate localization. Our work opens a new route to evade Floquet heating and control entanglement generation in collective spin systems.</p>

            <p>The performance of quantum key distribution (QKD) heavily depends on statistical inference. For a broad class of protocols, the central statistical task is a random sampling problem, customarily addressed using a hypergeometric tail bound due to Serfling. Here, we provide an alternative solution for this task of unprecedented tightness among QKD security analyses. As a by-product, confidence intervals for the average of nonidentical Bernoulli parameters follow too. These naturally fit in statistical analyses of decoy-state QKD and also outperform standard tools. Last, we show that, in a vast parameter regime, the use of tail bounds is not enforced because the cumulative mass function of the hypergeometric distribution is accurately computable. This sharply decreases the minimum block sizes necessary for QKD, and reveals the tightness of our analytical bounds when moderate-to-large blocks are considered.</p>

Our method also presents an alternative computational tool for extracting the exact entanglement depth and all separable partitions of a stabilizer state. Our construction is gauge invariant and goes beyond traditional entanglement measures by visually revealing how quantum information and entanglement is distributed. We use this tool to analyze the internal structures of prototypical stabilizer states (GHZ state, cluster state, stabilizer error correction codes) and are able to contrast the complexity of highly entangled volume law states generated by random unitary operators and random projective measurements.</p>

            <p>Analyzing Heisenberg--Robertson (HR) and Schrödinger uncertainty relations we found, that there can exist a large set of states of the quantum system under considerations, for which the lower bound of the product of the standard deviations of a pair of non--commuting observables, $A$ and $B$, is zero, and which differ from those described in the literature. These states are not eigenstates of either the observable $A$ or $B$. The correlation function for these observables in such states is equal to zero. We have also shown that the so--called "sum uncertainty relations" also do not provide any information about lower bounds on the standard deviations calculated for these states. We additionally show that the uncertainty principle in its most general form has two faces: one is that it is a lower bound on the product of standard deviations, and the other is that the product of standard deviations is an upper bound on the modulus of the correlation function of a pair of the non--commuting observables in the state under consideration.</p>

We rigorously show that this `projected ensemble' exhibits deep thermalization: For large system sizes, it converges towards a universal ensemble that is uniform over the manifold of Gaussian fermionic states. As well as proving moment-wise convergence of these ensembles, we demonstrate that the full distribution of any physical observable in the projected ensemble is close to its universal form in Wasserstein-1 distance, which we argue is an appropriate and efficiently computable measure of convergence when studying deep thermalization. Using this metric, we also numerically find that local matchgate circuits deeply thermalize after a timescale $t \sim L^2$ set by the diffusive spreading of quantum information. Our work opens up new avenues to experimentally accessible protocols to probe the emergence of quantum statistical mechanics and benchmark quantum simulators.</p>

Accurate predictions enable financial institutions to make informed decisions, mitigate risks, and effectively adapt services to meet customer needs. However, the complexity and the high-dimensional nature of financial data have always posed significant challenges to achieving this level of precision. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel approach that employs Quantum Machine Learning (QML) for Loan Eligibility Prediction using Quantum Neural Networks (LEP-QNN). Our innovative approach achieves an accuracy of 98% in predicting loan eligibility from a single, comprehensive dataset. This performance boost is attributed to the strategic implementation of a dropout mechanism within the quantum circuit, aimed at minimizing overfitting and thereby improving the model's predictive reliability. In addition, our exploration of various optimizers leads to identifying the most efficient setup for our LEP-QNN framework, optimizing its performance. We also rigorously evaluate the resilience of LEP-QNN under different quantum noise scenarios, ensuring its robustness and dependability for quantum computing environments. This research showcases the potential of QML in financial predictions and establishes a foundational guide for advancing QML technologies, marking a step towards developing advanced, quantum-driven financial decision-making tools.</p>

            <h2>Overcoming Quantum Metrology Singularity through Sequential Measurements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yaoling Yang, Victor Montenegro, Abolfazl Bayat</p>
            <p>The simultaneous estimation of multiple unknown parameters is the most general scenario in quantum sensing. Quantum multi-parameter estimation theory provides fundamental bounds on the achievable precision of simultaneous estimation. However, these bounds can become singular (no finite bound exists) in multi-parameter sensing due to parameter interdependencies, limited probe accessibility, and insufficient measurement outcomes. Here, we address the singularity issue in quantum sensing through a simple mechanism based on a sequential measurement strategy. This sensing scheme overcomes the singularity constraint and enables the simultaneous estimation of multiple parameters with a local and fixed measurement throughout the sensing protocol. This is because sequential measurements, involving consecutive steps of local measurements followed by probe evolution, inherently produce correlated measurement data that grows exponentially with the number of sequential measurements. Finally, through two different examples, namely a strongly correlated probe and a light-matter system, we demonstrate how such singularities are reflected when inferring the unknown parameters through Bayesian estimation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wen-Zheng Ling, Zhao-Fan Cai, Tao Liu</p>
            <p>In contrast to the conventional (first-order) non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) in a $d$-dimensional system with linear size $L$, the $n$th-order (higher-order) NHSE is characterized by skin modes localized at lower-dimensional boundaries of dimension $(d-n)$. The total number of these modes scales linearly with the system size $L$. Significant progress has been made in understanding higher-order NHSE in non-interacting systems. In this work, we demonstrate the many-body interaction induced second-order skin effect in a two-dimensional non-Hermitian bosonic system. Specifically, we construct a square lattice that incorporates nonreciprocal single-boson hopping, onsite many-body interactions and two-boson pairing hopping. In the absence of interactions, no second-order NHSE is observed. However, with the inclusion of interactions, we identify interaction-induced skin modes for in-gap doublon states (i.e., bound pairs of bosons) localized at the corners of the lattice, while the bulk doublon states remain extended. These corner-localized skin modes arise from the interplay between interaction-induced edge states, localized along one-dimensional boundaries, and the nonreciprocal hopping along these boundaries. Furthermore, the number of corner skin modes scales linearly with the system size, confirming the presence of second-order NHSE in this interacting system. Our findings introduce a novel approach to realizing higher-order skin effects by leveraging interactions.</p>

            <p>As quantum computers require highly specialized and stable environments to operate, expanding their capabilities within a single system presents significant technical challenges. By interconnecting multiple quantum processors, distributed quantum computing can facilitate the execution of more complex and larger-scale quantum algorithms. End-to-end heuristics for the distribution of quantum circuits have been developed so far. In this work, we derive an exact integer programming approach for the Distributed Quantum Circuit (DQC) problem, assuming fixed module allocations. Since every DQC algorithm necessarily yields a module allocation function, our formulation can be integrated with it as a post-processing step. This improves on the hypergraph partitioning formulation, which finds a module allocation function and an efficient distribution at once. We also show that a suboptimal heuristic to find good allocations can outperform previous methods. In particular, for quantum Fourier transform circuits, we conjecture from experiments that the optimal module allocation is the trivial one found by this method.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cong-Gang Song, Qing-yu Cai</p>
            <p>Precision and accuracy, as two crucial criteria for quantum metrology, have previously lacked rigorous definitions and distinctions. In this paper, we provide a unified definition of precision and accuracy from the perspective of distinguishing neighboring quantum states. Using the quantum Cramér-Rao bound as a lower bound for precision, we find that the corresponding accuracy will fall short of expectations, because the bias of the parameter estimation cannot be ignored. Given that probability estimation is unbiased, defining precision from the perspective of probability distributions provides a more comprehensive approach. This leads to a correction of the traditional precision lower bound by a factor of 2. The trade-off between precision and accuracy shows that precision can be further improved by sacrificing accuracy, while it should be restricted by inherent precision limit. The inherent precision limit, determined by the number of sampling, can reach the Heisenberg scaling even without entanglement resources, which, however, comes at the cost of significantly reduced accuracy. We show that accuracy may actually decrease with increasing sampling when one pursues excessive precision, which indicates the trade-off should be considered even with unlimited resources.</p>

Quantum correction is incorporated in the drift potential, and is determined by quasi-stationary conditions and minimal uncertainty relation. The semiclassical rate obtained here is consistent in form with those from the quantum Smoluchowski equations deduced heuristically by modifying the diffusion coefficient using the path-integral method. Unlike approaches using the path-integral, which involves continuation into imaginary time, the approach here is simpler and more easily understood in terms of classical picture.</p>

            <p>We explore the performance of the metrology scheme by employing a quantum time flip during encoding, a specific case of processes with indefinite time direction, which we refer to as indefinite time directed metrology (ITDM). In the case of single parameter estimation of a unitary, we demonstrate that our protocol can achieve Heisenberg scaling (1/N) with product probe states, surpassing the standard quantum limit (1/\sqrt{N}), where N is the number of particles in the probe. We establish this by computing the quantum Fisher information (QFI) which is a lower bound on the root mean square error occurred during parameter estimation. Although we analytically prove the optimality of the symmetric product probe state in ITDM, entangled probe states produce a higher QFI than optimal product probes without enhancing scaling, highlighting the non-essentiality of entanglement. For phase estimation, we propose a single-qubit measurement on the control qubit that accomplishes near-optimal Fisher information and eventually reaches Heisenberg scaling. Our findings reveal the best orientation of product probe states in every pertinent situation, emphasizing its independence from the parameter to be estimated in the limiting case. Furthermore, we illustrate the benefits of ITDM in noisy metrology, outperforming existing techniques in some situations.</p>

            <h2>Fidelity Aware Multipath Routing for Multipartite State Distribution in Quantum Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Evan Sutcliffe, Alejandra Beghelli</p>
            <p>We consider the problem of distributing entangled multipartite states across a quantum network with improved distribution rate and fidelity. For this, we propose fidelity-aware multi-path routing protocols, assess their performance in terms of the rate and fidelity of the distributed Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states, and compare such performance against that of single-path routing. Simulation results show that the proposed multi-path routing protocols select routes that require more Bell states compared to single-path routing, but also require fewer rounds of Bell state generation. We also optimised the trade-off between distribution rate and fidelity by selecting an appropriate cutoff to the quantum memory storage time. Using such a cutoff technique, the proposed multi-path protocols can achieve up to an 8.3 times higher distribution rate and up to a 28% improvement in GHZ state fidelity compared to single-path routing. These results show that multi-path routing both improves the distribution rates and enhances fidelity for multipartite state distribution.</p>

            <p>The study of entanglement and magic properties in topologically frustrated systems suggests that, in the thermodynamic limit, these quantities decompose into two distinct contributions. One is determined by the specific nature of the model and its Hamiltonian, and another arises from topological frustration itself, resulting in being independent of the Hamiltonian's parameters. In this work, we test the generality of this picture by investigating an additional quantum resource, namely quantum coherence, in two different models where topological frustration is induced through an appropriate choice of boundary conditions. Our findings reveal a perfect analogy between the behavior of quantum coherence and that of other quantum resources, particularly magic, providing further evidence in support of the universality of this picture and the topological nature of this source of frustration.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jakob Murauer, Rajiv Krishnakumar, Sabine Tornow, Michaela Geierhos</p>
            <p>Existing approaches to quantum reservoir computing can be broadly categorized into restart-based and continuous protocols. Restart-based methods require reinitializing the quantum circuit for each time step, while continuous protocols use mid-circuit measurements to enable uninterrupted information processing. A gap exists between these two paradigms: while restart-based methods naturally have high execution times due to the need for circuit reinitialization, they can employ novel feedback connections to enhance performance. In contrast, continuous methods have significantly faster execution times but typically lack such feedback mechanisms. In this work, we investigate a novel quantum reservoir computing scheme that integrates feedback connections, which can operate within the coherence time of a qubit. We demonstrate our architecture using a minimal example and evaluate memory capacity and predictive capabilities. We show that the correlation coefficient for the short-term memory task on past inputs is nonzero, indicating that feedback connections can effectively operate during continuous processing to allow the model to remember past inputs.</p>

            <p>Variational quantum algorithms (VQA) based on Hamiltonian simulation represent a specialized class of quantum programs well-suited for near-term quantum computing applications due to its modest resource requirements in terms of qubits and circuit depth. Unlike the conventional single-qubit (1Q) and two-qubit (2Q) gate sequence representation, Hamiltonian simulation programs are essentially composed of disciplined subroutines known as Pauli exponentiations (Pauli strings with coefficients) that are variably arranged. To capitalize on these distinct program features, this study introduces PHOENIX, a highly effective compilation framework that primarily operates at the high-level Pauli-based intermediate representation (IR) for generic Hamiltonian simulation programs. PHOENIX exploits global program optimization opportunities to the greatest extent, compared to existing SOTA methods despite some of them also utilizing similar IRs. Experimental results demonstrate that PHOENIX outperforms SOTA VQA compilers across diverse program categories, backend ISAs, and hardware topologies.</p>

            <h2>Survival of the Optimized: An Evolutionary Approach to T-depth Reduction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Archisman Ghosh, Avimita Chatterjee, Swaroop Ghosh</p>
            <p>Quantum Error Correction (QEC) is the cornerstone of practical Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computing (FTQC), but incurs enormous resource overheads. Circuits must decompose into Clifford+T gates, and the non-transversal T gates demand costly magic-state distillation. As circuit complexity grows, sequential T-gate layers ("T-depth") increase, amplifying the spatiotemporal overhead of QEC. Optimizing T-depth is NP-hard, and existing greedy or brute-force strategies are either inefficient or computationally prohibitive. We frame T-depth reduction as a search optimization problem and present a Genetic Algorithm (GA) framework that approximates optimal layer-merge patterns across the non-convex search space. We introduce a mathematical formulation of the circuit expansion for systematic layer reordering and a greedy initial merge-pair selection, accelerating the convergence and enhancing the solution quality. In our benchmark with ~90-100 qubits, our method reduces T-depth by 79.23% and overall T-count by 41.86%. Compared to the reversible circuit benchmarks, we achieve a 2.58x improvement in T-depth over the state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its viability for near-term FTQC.</p>

            <h2>Entropy bounds from quantum thermodynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Massimo Giovannini</p>
            <p>Within an inherently classical perspective, there is always an unavoidable energy cost associated with the information deletion and this common lore is at the heart of the Landauer's conjecture that does not impose, per se, any relevant limit on the information acquisition. Although such a mindset should generally apply to systems of any size, its quantum mechanical implications are particularly intriguing and, for this reason, we examine here a minimal physical structure where the system and the environment are described, respectively, by a pair of quantum oscillators coupled by an appropriate Hermitian interaction able to amplify the entropy of the initial state. Since at the onset of the dynamical evolution the system is originally in a pure state, its entropy variation is always positive semidefinite and the Landauer's conjecture should not impose any constraint. Nonetheless, provided the quantum amplification is effective, it turns out that the entropy variation of the system always undershoots the heat transferred to the environment. When the initial thermal state of the environment is characterized by a chemical potential, the entropy growth is bounded both by the particles and by the heat flowing to the environment. The limits deduced in the quantum thermodynamical framework are also scrutinized from a field theory standpoint where species of different spins are copiously produced (especially in a cosmological context) thanks to the rapid variation of the space-time curvature.</p>

            <p>Conventional Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) for Quantum Machine Learning typically rely on a fixed Hermitian observable, often built from Pauli operators. Inspired by the Heisenberg picture, we propose an adaptive non-local measurement framework that substantially increases the model complexity of the quantum circuits. Our introduction of dynamical Hermitian observables with evolving parameters shows that optimizing VQC rotations corresponds to tracing a trajectory in the observable space. This viewpoint reveals that standard VQCs are merely a special case of the Heisenberg representation. Furthermore, we show that properly incorporating variational rotations with non-local observables enhances qubit interaction and information mixture, admitting flexible circuit designs. Two non-local measurement schemes are introduced, and numerical simulations on classification tasks confirm that our approach outperforms conventional VQCs, yielding a more powerful and resource-efficient approach as a Quantum Neural Network.</p>

This study analyzes MDI-QKD performance in thermal-loss and phase noise channels, modeled as depolarizing and dephasing channels to capture thermal and phase noise effects. Based on this channel framework, we derive analytical expressions for Bell state measurement probabilities, quantum bit error rates (QBER), and secret key rates (SKR) of MDI-QKD. Our simulations reveal that SKR decreases exponentially with transmission distance, with performance further degraded by increasing thermal noise and phase noise, particularly under high thermal noise conditions. These findings offer insights into enhancing MDI-QKD's noise resilience, supporting secure key generation in practical, noisy environments.</p>

            <p>Recent advances in artificial intelligence have highlighted the remarkable capabilities of neural network (NN)-powered systems on classical computers. However, these systems face significant computational challenges that limit scalability and efficiency. Quantum computers hold the potential to overcome these limitations and increase processing power beyond classical systems. Despite this, integrating quantum computing with NNs remains largely unrealized due to challenges posed by noise, decoherence, and high error rates in current quantum hardware. Here, we propose a novel quantum echo-state network (QESN) design and implementation algorithm that can operate within the presence of noise on current IBM hardware. We apply classical control-theoretic response analysis to characterize the QESN, emphasizing its rich nonlinear dynamics and memory, as well as its ability to be fine-tuned with sparsity and re-uploading blocks. We validate our approach through a comprehensive demonstration of QESNs functioning as quantum observers, applied in both high-fidelity simulations and hardware experiments utilizing data from a prototypical chaotic Lorenz system. Our results show that the QESN can predict long time-series with persistent memory, running over 100 times longer than the median T1 and T2 of the IBM Marrakesh QPU, achieving state-of-the-art time-series performance on superconducting hardware.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adithi Udupa, Timo Hillmann, Rabsan Galib Ahmed, Andrea Smirne, Giulia Ferrini</p>
            <p>Decoherence in quantum devices, such as qubits and resonators, is often caused by bistable fluctuators modeled as random telegraph noise (RTN), leading to significant dephasing. We analyze the impact of individual and multiple fluctuators on a bosonic mode in continuous variable systems, identifying non-Markovian behavior governed by two timescales: the fluctuator switching rate ($\xi$) and coupling strength ($\nu$). Using the Breuer-Piilo-Laine (BLP) measure, we show that for Gaussian states, squeezing and thermal fluctuations do not enhance non-Markovianity. In contrast, for non-Gaussian states, the measure becomes unbounded. For rotation-symmetric bosonic (RSB) codes, known for their error correction advantages, non-Markovianity grows linearly with code symmetry. We evaluate the performance of RSB codes under simultaneous loss and RTN dephasing. For a teleportation-based Knill error-correction circuit, the codes perform robustly in the Markovian limit. In the non-Markovian regime, the performance depends on the time the error correction is performed for a given codeword. The average gate fidelity of the error-corrected state in this case exhibits oscillations as a function of time due to the oscillatory nature of the dephasing function of the RTN noise; however, for most of the parameter ranges, the values stay above the break-even point. Extending to multiple fluctuators that produce $1/f$ noise, we observe that non-Markovianity decays with increasing fluctuator count, while the performance of RSB codes remains effective with increasing number of fluctuators.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Naga Dileep Varikuti, Soumik Bandyopadhyay, Philipp Hauke</p>
            <p>Non-stabilizerness, alongside entanglement, is a crucial ingredient for fault-tolerant quantum computation and achieving a genuine quantum advantage. Despite recent progress, a complete understanding of the generation and thermalization of non-stabilizerness in circuits that mix Clifford and non-Clifford operations remains elusive. While Clifford operations do not generate non-stabilizerness, their interplay with non-Clifford gates can strongly impact the overall non-stabilizing dynamics of generic quantum circuits. In this work, we establish a direct relationship between the final non-stabilizing power and the individual powers of the non-Clifford gates, in circuits where these gates are interspersed with random Clifford operations. By leveraging this result, we unveil the thermalization of non-stabilizing power to its Haar-averaged value in generic circuits. As a precursor, we analyze two-qubit gates and illustrate this thermalization in analytically tractable systems. Extending this, we explore the operator-space non-stabilizing power and demonstrate its behavior in physical models. Finally, we examine the role of non-stabilizing power in the emergence of quantum chaos in brick-wall quantum circuits. Our work elucidates how non-stabilizing dynamics evolve and thermalize in quantum circuits and thus contributes to a better understanding of quantum computational resources and of their role in quantum chaos.</p>

            <p>Certifying maximal quantum randomness without assumptions about system dimension remains a pivotal challenge for secure communication and foundational studies. Here, we introduce a generalized framework to directly certify maximal randomness from observed probability distributions across systems with arbitrary user numbers, without relying on the Bell-inequality violations. By analyzing probability distributions directly, we identify a class of quantum states and projective measurements that achieve maximal randomness in bipartite and tripartite scenarios, ensuring practical feasibility. Further analysis reveals a counterintuitive trade-off governing measurement incompatibility among users: sufficient incompatibility for one user permits arbitrarily small incompatibility for others, defying conventional symmetry assumptions in the Bell test. This asymmetry provides a pathway to optimize device-independent protocols by strategically distributing quantum resources. Our results establish a versatile and experimentally accessible route to scalable randomness certification, with implications for quantum cryptography and the physics of nonlocal correlations.</p>

            <p>We investigate the spectral properties and quantum criticality of the two-photon Rabi-Stark model. Using the exact solution of this model, we rigorously derive a condition for complete spectral collapse, where all bound states vanish. In this case, the energy gap closes at a critical coupling, signaling a continuous quantum phase transition. The corresponding gap exponent differs from those in both the one-photon Rabi-Stark model and the quantum Rabi model, suggesting a distinct universality class. While in the general case, an infinite number of discrete bound states exist when spectral collapse occur and the energy gap remains open. By mapping to an inverse square potential well, these bound levels approach the threshold energy exponentially. Our results offer new insights into novel spectral phenomena in nonlinear quantum Rabi models, with potential implications for experimental realizations in circuit QED and trapped ion systems.</p>

Quantum computing and quantum-inspired methods offer a promising avenue for efficiently simulating such phenomena. In this work, we investigate meson scattering in a (1+1)-dimensional Z2 lattice gauge theory with staggered fermions. We develop a quantum subspace expansion technique to construct high-fidelity meson creation operators across a broad range of masses and momenta. Using Tensor Networks simulations, we study both elastic and inelastic scattering and provide a detailed analysis of energy transfer, entanglement entropy, and new particle production during the dynamics. In addition, we design an efficient quantum circuit for meson wave packet preparation using Givens rotations, significantly reducing the circuit depth compared to existing methods. Our work provides a non-variational and scalable framework for simulating meson scattering on near-term quantum devices, and provides a concrete strategy for quantum simulation to analyze non-perturbative dynamical processes in confining gauge theories.</p>

            <p>In the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, quantum error mitigation (QEM) is essential for producing reliable outputs from quantum circuits. We present a statistical signal processing approach to QEM that estimates the most likely noiseless outputs from noisy quantum measurements. Our model assumes that circuit depth is sufficient for depolarizing noise, producing corrupted observations that resemble a uniform distribution alongside classical bit-flip errors from readout. Our method consists of two steps: a filtering stage that discards uninformative depolarizing noise and an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm that computes a maximum likelihood (ML) estimate over the remaining data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on small-qubit systems using IBM circuit simulations in Qiskit and compare its performance to contemporary statistical QEM techniques. We also show that our method scales to larger qubit counts using synthetically generated data consistent with our noise model. These results suggest that principled statistical methods can offer scalable and interpretable solutions for quantum error mitigation in realistic NISQ settings.</p>

            <p>We investigate the emergence of quantum complexity and chaos in doped Clifford circuits acting on qudits of odd prime dimension $d$. Using doped Clifford Weingarten calculus and a replica tensor network formalism, we derive exact results and perform large-scale simulations in regimes challenging for tensor network and Pauli-based methods. We begin by analyzing generalized stabilizer entropies, computable magic monotones in many-qudit systems, and identify a dynamical phase transition in the doping rate, marking the breakdown of classical simulability and the onset of Haar-random behavior. The critical behavior is governed by the qudit dimension and the magic content of the non-Clifford gate. Using the qudit $T$-gate as a benchmark, we show that higher-dimensional qudits converge faster to Haar-typical stabilizer entropies. For qutrits ($d=3$), analytical predictions match numerics on brickwork circuits, showing that locality plays a limited role in magic spreading. We also examine anticoncentration and entanglement growth, showing that $O(\log N)$ non-Clifford gates suffice for approximating Haar expectation values to precision $\varepsilon$, and relate antiflatness measures to stabilizer entropies in qutrit systems. Finally, we analyze out-of-time-order correlators and show that a finite density of non-Clifford gates is needed to induce chaos, with a sharp transition fixed by the local dimension, twice that of the magic transition. Altogether, these results establish a unified framework for diagnosing complexity in doped Clifford circuits and deepen our understanding of resource theories in multiqudit systems.</p>

            <p>Noise is a major challenge for building practical quantum computing systems. Precise characterization of quantum noise is crucial for developing effective error mitigation and correction schemes. However, state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors on many current platforms can introduce large ambiguity into conventional noise characterization methods. In this work, we propose a scheme for enhancing quantum noise characterization using additional energy levels. We first develop a comprehensive theory on the identifiability of n-qudit SPAM noise given high-quality single-qudit control, showing the existence of gauge freedoms which can be completely described using subsystem depolarizing maps. We then show how to use these extra energy levels to reduce the gauge ambiguity in characterizing both SPAM and gate noise in the qubit subspace. We experimentally implement these ideas on a superconducting quantum computing device and demonstrate a qutrit-enabled enhancement in noise characterization precision.</p>

            <p>Symmetric quantum states are fascinating objects. They correspond to multipartite systems that remain invariant under particle permutations. This symmetry is reflected in their compact mathematical characterisation but also in their unique physical properties: they exhibit genuine multipartite entanglement and notable robustness against noise and perturbations. These features make such states particularly well-suited for a wide range of quantum information tasks. Here, we provide a pedagogic analysis of the mathematical structure and relevant physical properties of this class of states. Beyond the theoretical framework, robust tools for certifying and verifying the properties of symmetric states in experimental settings are essential. In this regard, we explore how standard techniques -- such as quantum state tomography, Bell tests, and entanglement witnesses -- can be specifically adapted for symmetric systems. Next, we provide an up-to-date overview of the most relevant applications in which these states outperform other classes of states in specific tasks. Specifically, we address their central role in quantum metrology, highlight their use in quantum error correction codes, and examine their contribution in computation and communication tasks. Finally, we present the current state-of-the-art in their experimental generation, ranging from systems of cold atoms to implementations via quantum algorithms. We also review the most significant results obtained in the different experimental realizations. Despite the notable progress made in recent years with regard to the characterisation and application of symmetric quantum states, several intriguing questions remain unsolved.

            <p>Quantum speed limits set fundamental lower bounds on the time required for a quantum system to evolve between states. Traditional bounds, such as those by Mandelstam-Tamm and Margolus-Levitin, rely on state distinguishability and become trivial for cyclic evolutions where the initial and final states coincide. In this work, we explore an alternative approach based on isoholonomic inequalities, which bound the length of closed state space trajectories in terms of their holonomy. Building on a gauge-theoretic framework for mixed state geometric phases, we extend the concept of isoholonomic inequalities to closed curves of isospectral and isodegenerate density operators. This allows us to derive new quantum speed limits that remain nontrivial for cyclic evolutions. Our results reveal deep connections between the temporal behavior of cyclic quantum systems and holonomy.</p>

            <h2>Observing High-dimensional Bell Inequality Violations using Multi-Outcome Spectral Measurements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kiki Dekkers, Laura Serino, Nicola DAlessandro, Abhinandan Bhattacharjee, Benjamin Brecht, Armin Tavakoli, Christine Silberhorn, Jonathan Leach</p>
            <p>Violation of Bell inequalities is an essential requirement for many quantum information and communication protocols. In high-dimensional systems, Bell inequality tests face the challenge of implementing genuinely multi-outcome measurements, since the emulation of these with separate dichotomic projections opens a binarisation loophole that local hidden variable theories can exploit. Here we show that the joint spectral intensity of a two-photon entangled state contains access to the necessary multi-outcome measurements to overcome this obstacle and certify and violate a Bell inequality for high-dimensional states. This result is contrary to the belief that the joint spectral intensity is a phase-insensitive quantity and does not have sufficient information to certify entanglement or Bell-nonlocality. Using this approach, we violate the CGLMP Bell inequality up to dimension d = 8, all with negligible p-values, and for the first time close the binarisation loophole in high-dimensional Bell experiments. Guaranteeing Bell-nonlocal correlations using frequency-only measurements removes the technological hurdle of measurements in the temporal domain, thus greatly simplifying any practical implementation of future high-dimensional quantum information protocols.</p>

            <h2>HaQGNN: Hardware-Aware Quantum Kernel Design Based on Graph Neural Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuxiang Liu, Fanxu Meng, Lu Wang, Yi Hu, Sixuan Li, Xutao Yu, Zaichen Zhang</p>
            <p>Designing effective quantum kernels is a central challenge in Quantum Machine Learning (QML), particularly under the limitations of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices with a limited number of qubits, error-prone gate operations, and restricted qubit connectivity. To address this, we propose HaQGNN, a hardware-aware quantum kernel design method that integrates quantum device topology, noise characteristics, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to evaluate and select task-relevant quantum circuits that define quantum kernels. First, each quantum circuit is represented as a directed acyclic graph that encodes hardware-specific features, including gate types, target qubits, and noise characteristics. Next, two GNNs are trained to predict surrogate metrics, Probability of Successful Trials (PST) and Kernel-Target Alignment (KTA), for fast and accurate fidelity and performance estimation. Additionally, feature selection is further incorporated to reduce input dimensionality and improve compatibility with limited-qubit devices. Finally, extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, Credit Card (CC), MNIST-5, and FMNIST-4, demonstrate that HaQGNN outperforms existing baselines in terms of classification accuracy. Our results highlight the potential of learning-based and hardware-aware strategies for advancing practical quantum kernel design on near-term quantum hardware.</p>

I also think it would be a good idea to share the second volume on arXiv so that more people can read it for free, and I can continue to update the contents. As of July 2025, I have finished the trapped ion quantum computer part.

Furthermore, two points in C are equivalent if and only if they are related by a group of order 24 acting on C. There exists a set of 3 invariant polynomials that separates equivalence classes of 5-qubit AME states. We also show that every 4-qubit pure code is equivalent to a subspace of the unique ((4,4,2)) and construct an infinite family of 3-uniform n-qubit states for even $n\geq 6$. The proofs rely heavily on results from Vinberg and classical invariant theory.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mahmoud Mahdian, Ali Babapour-Azar, Zahra Mousavi, Rashed Khanjani-Shiraz</p>
            <p>Quantum measurements are inherently noisy, hindering reliable entanglement detection and limiting the scalability of quantum technologies. While error mitigation and correction strategies exist, they often impose prohibitive resource overheads. Here, we introduce a machine-learning-based approach to achieve noise-resilient entanglement classification even with imperfect measurements. Using support vector machines (SVMs) trained on features extracted from Pauli measurements, we develop a robust optimal entanglement witness (ROEW) that remains effective under unknown measurement noise. By optimizing SVM parameters against worst-case errors, our protocol significantly outperforms conventional methods in classification accuracy. Numerical experiments demonstrate that ROEW achieves high-fidelity entanglement detection with minimal measurements, even when measurement errors exceed 10\%. This work bridges machine learning and quantum information science, offering a practical tool for noise-robust quantum characterization and advancing the feasibility of entanglement-based technologies in real-world settings.</p>

            <h2>Tight Bound for Quantum Unitary Time-Reversal</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kean Chen, Nengkun Yu, Zhicheng Zhang</p>
            <p>Time-reversal of unitary evolution is fundamental in quantum information processing. Many scenarios, particularly those in quantum learning and metrology, assume free access to the time-reverse of an unknown unitary. In this paper, we settle the query complexity of the unitary time-reversal task: approximately implementing $U^{-1}$ given only black-box access to an unknown $d$-dimensional unitary $U$. We provide a tight query lower bound $\Omega((1-\epsilon)d^2)$ for the unitary time-reversal to within diamond norm error $\epsilon$. Notably, our lower bound applies to general coherent protocols with unbounded ancillas, and holds even when $\epsilon$ is an average-case distance error. Moreover, our result implies a query lower bound $\Omega(d^2)$ for approximately implementing control-$U$ up to an irrelevant phase, which is also tight with respect to the dimension.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gaetano Fiore, Fedele Lizzi</p>
            <p>We discuss the concept of transformations among reference frames (classical or quantum). Usually transformations among classical reference frames have sharply defined parameters; geometrically they can be considered as pure states in the parameters' space, and they form a group. It is however possible that the distributions in the parameters' space are mixed state; such states form a semigroup. Similarly, transformations among quantum reference frames can be either pure or mixed. This gives rise to interesting consequences, in particular, the state of a system S can be pure with respect to a reference frame and mixed with respect to another. We argue that these nonpure transformations are natural, and give an application to the connections of time and (inverse) temperature for thermal states.</p>

            <p>Understanding topological features in networks is crucial for unravelling complex phenomena across fields such as neuroscience, condensed matter, and high-energy physics. However, identifying higher-order topological structures -- such as $k$-cliques, fundamental building blocks of complex networks -- remains a significant challenge. Here we develop a universal programmable photonic quantum processor that enables the encoding of arbitrary complex-weight networks, providing a direct pathway to uncovering their topological structures. We demonstrate how this quantum approach can identify weighted $k$-cliques and estimate Betti numbers by leveraging the Gaussian boson sampling algorithm's ability to preferentially select high-weight, dense subgraphs. The unique capabilities of our programmable quantum processor allow us to observe topological phase transitions and identify clique percolation phenomena directly from the entropy of the sampling results. These findings showcase how photonic quantum computing can be applied to analyse the topological characteristics of real-world complex networks, opening new possibilities for quantum-enhanced data analysis.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dingzu Wang, Wenxuan Zhang, Xiansong Xu, Dario Poletti</p>
            <p>Neural quantum states are a promising framework for simulating many-body quantum dynamics, as they can represent states with volume-law entanglement. As time evolves, the neural network parameters are typically optimized at discrete time steps to approximate the wave function at each point in time. Given the differentiability of the wave function stemming from the Schrödinger equation, here we impose a time-continuous and differentiable parameterization of the neural network by expressing its parameters as linear combinations of temporal basis functions with trainable, time-independent coefficients. We test this ansatz, referred to as the smooth neural quantum state ($s$-NQS) with a loss function defined over an extended time interval, under a sudden quench of a non-integrable many-body quantum spin chain. We demonstrate accurate time evolution using simply a restricted Boltzmann machine as the instantaneous neural network architecture. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the parameterization is efficient in the number of parameters and the smooth neural quantum state allows us to initialize and evaluate the wave function at times not included in the training set, both within and beyond the training interval.</p>

            <p>In the revised International System of Units (SI), the ohm and the volt are realized from the von Klitzing constant and the Josephson constant, and a practical realization of the ampere is possible by applying Ohm's law directly to the quantum Hall and Josephson effects. As a result, it is possible to create an instrument capable of realizing all three primary electrical units, but the development of such a system remains challenging. Here we report a unified realization of the volt, ohm, and ampere by integrating a quantum anomalous Hall resistor (QAHR) and a programmable Josephson voltage standard (PJVS) in a single cryostat. Our system has a quantum voltage output that ranges from 0.24 mV to 6.5 mV with combined relative uncertainties down to 3 $\mu$V/V. The QAHR provides a realization of the ohm at zero magnetic field with uncertainties near 1 $\mu\Omega$/$\Omega$. We use the QAHR to convert a longitudinal current to a quantized Hall voltage and then directly compare that against the PJVS to realize the ampere. We determine currents in the range of 9.33 nA to 252 nA, and our lowest uncertainty is 4.3 $\mu$A/A at 83.9 nA. For other current values, a systematic error that ranges from -10 $\mu$A/A to -30 $\mu$A/A is present due to the imperfect isolation of the PJVS microwave bias.</p>

            <h2>A hierarchy of eigencomputations for polynomial optimization on the sphere</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benjamin Lovitz, Nathaniel Johnston</p>
            <p>We introduce a convergent hierarchy of lower bounds on the minimum value of a real form over the unit sphere. The main practical advantage of our hierarchy over the real sum-of-squares (RSOS) hierarchy is that the lower bound at each level of our hierarchy is obtained by a minimum eigenvalue computation, as opposed to the full semidefinite program (SDP) required at each level of RSOS. In practice, this allows us to compute bounds on much larger forms than are computationally feasible for RSOS. Our hierarchy outperforms previous alternatives to RSOS, both asymptotically and in numerical experiments. We obtain our hierarchy by proving a reduction from real optimization on the sphere to Hermitian optimization on the sphere, and invoking the Hermitian sum-of-squares (HSOS) hierarchy. This opens the door to using other Hermitian optimization techniques for real optimization, and gives a path towards developing spectral hierarchies for more general constrained real optimization problems. To this end, we use our techniques to develop a hierarchy of eigencomputations for computing the real tensor spectral norm.</p>

            <p>We say of an isolated macroscopic quantum system in a pure state $\psi$ that it is in macroscopic thermal equilibrium (MATE) if $\psi$ lies in or close to a suitable subspace $\mathcal{H}_{eq}$ of Hilbert space. It is known that every initial state $\psi_0$ will eventually reach and stay there most of the time (``thermalize'') if the Hamiltonian is non-degenerate and satisfies the appropriate version of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), i.e., that every eigenvector is in MATE. Tasaki recently proved the ETH for a certain perturbation $H_\theta^{fF}$ of the Hamiltonian $H_0^{fF}$ of $N\gg 1$ free fermions on a one-dimensional lattice. The perturbation is needed to remove the high degeneracies of $H_0^{fF}$. Here, we first point out that also for degenerate Hamiltonians all $\psi_0$ thermalize if the ETH holds, i.e., if every eigenbasis lies in MATE, and we prove that this is the case for $H_0^{fF}$. Inspired by the fact that there is one eigenbasis of $H_0^{fF}$ for which MATE can be proved more easily than for the others, with smaller error bounds, and also in higher spatial dimensions, we show for any given $H_0$ that the existence of one eigenbasis in MATE implies quite generally that most eigenbases of $H_0$ lie in MATE. We also show that, as a consequence, after adding a small generic perturbation, $H=H_0+\lambda V$ with $\lambda\ll 1$, for most perturbations $V$ the perturbed Hamiltonian $H$ satisfies ETH and all states thermalize.</p>

            <p>Quantum computers are expected to enable fast solving of large-scale combinatorial optimization problems. However, their limitations in fidelity and the number of qubits prevent them from handling real-world problems. Recently, a quantum-inspired solver using tensor networks has been proposed, which works on classical computers. Particularly, tensor networks have been applied to constrained combinatorial optimization problems for practical applications. By preparing a specific tensor network to sample states that satisfy constraints, feasible solutions can be searched for without the method of penalty functions. Previous studies have been based on profound physics, such as U(1) gauge schemes and high-dimensional lattice models. In this study, we devise to design feasible tensor networks using elementary mathematics without such a specific knowledge. One approach is to construct tensor networks with nilpotent-matrix manipulation. The second is to algebraically determine tensor parameters. We showed mathematically that such feasible tensor networks can be constructed to accommodate various types of constraints. For the principle verification, we numerically constructed a feasible tensor network for facility location problem, to find much faster construction than conventional methods. Then, by performing imaginary time evolution, feasible solutions were always obtained, ultimately leading to the optimal solution.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Feng-Li Lin, Sayid Mondal</p>
            <p>Black holes, as characterized by the Hawking effect and Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, can be treated as a compact object carrying nontrivial quantum information obscured behind the event horizon. Thus, the black hole may convey and retract its quantum information to the nearby quantum probes via the surrounding mediator fields. In this paper, we investigate the effects of a quantum black hole on the reduced states of a pair of static qubit-type Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detectors acting as a probe, using three complementary quantum information measures: concurrence characterizing entanglement harvesting, quantum discord, and Bell's nonlocality bound. This sheds light on the nature of the quantum state of the black holes. By treating the black hole as a tidally deformable thermal body under the quantum fluctuation of the mediator fields as observed in \cite{Goldberger:2019sya, goldberger2020virtual, biggs2024comparing}, we employ a post-Newtonian effective field theory (PN-EFT) to derive the reduced states of the UDW probes analytically. Based on this, we can easily obtain all three quantum information measures without encountering the complicated Matsubara sum of infinite thermal poles, as in the conventional approach based on quantum fields in curved spacetime. By tuning the relative strengths in the action of PN-EFT, we can extract the effects of the black hole on the entanglement, quantum correlation, and nonlocality bound of the UDW probe systems. Our PN-EFT approach can be extended to include the backreaction on the black holes in future studies by taking the higher-order PN corrections into account.</p>

            <p>Motivated by near term quantum computing hardware limitations, combinatorial optimization problems that can be addressed by current quantum algorithms and noisy hardware with little or no overhead are used to probe capabilities of quantum algorithms such as the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). In this study, a specific class of near term quantum computing hardware defined combinatorial optimization problems, Ising models on heavy-hex graphs both with and without geometrically local cubic terms, are examined for their classical computational hardness via empirical computation time scaling quantification. Specifically the Time-to-Solution metric using the classical heuristic simulated annealing is measured for finding optimal variable assignments (ground states), as well as the time required for the optimization software Gurobi to find an optimal variable assignment. Because of the sparsity of these Ising models, the classical algorithms are able to find optimal solutions efficiently even for large instances (i.e. $100,000$ variables). The Ising models both with and without geometrically local cubic terms exhibit average-case linear-time or weakly quadratic scaling when solved exactly using Gurobi, and the Ising models with no cubic terms show evidence of exponential-time Time-to-Solution scaling when sampled using simulated annealing. These findings point to the necessity of developing and testing more complex, namely more densely connected, optimization problems in order for quantum computing to ever have a practical advantage over classical computing. Our results are another illustration that different classical algorithms can indeed have exponentially different running times, thus making the identification of the best practical classical technique important in any quantum computing vs. classical computing comparison.</p>

            <p>In this work, we study the low-energy properties of the spin-boson model (SBM), which describes the dynamics of a 1/2 spin associated with a thermostat characterized by a power law spectral density, $f(\omega)\propto \omega^s$. The theoretical description is constructed in the Schwinger--Keldysh technique, based on the representation of the 1/2-spin by Majorana spinors. We study the critical dynamics of the system near the quantum phase transition by constructing and analyzing the system of renormalization group equations. Our theoretical approach is more universal, contrary to the one based on quantum-classical mapping, since it is applicable for $s\leq 1$. We show that in both the ohmic case $s=1$, and the weakly subohmic case $s\lesssim 1$, the second order quantum phase transition is observed in the model considered, and the critical magnetization exponent agrees with the exact hyperscaling result, $1/\delta=(1-s)/(1+s)$. Furthermore, we obtain the dependence of the critical value of the spin-boson coupling constant on the temperature of the ohmic bosonic thermal bath.</p>

In the weak nonlinear regime of our formalism, we demonstrate the ability of the echo peak to distinguish between elastic and inelastic scattering processes, in perfect agreement with the intuition developed in isolated two-level systems. Furthermore, we discuss unique many-body effects on the echo peak signature arising from interaction induced quantum fluctuations. In particular, we show that these quantum fluctuations induce a finite nonrephasable broadening and examine how the echo peak is influenced by the attractive or repulsive nature of the collective excitations.</p>

            <h2>Interaction-Induced Higher-Order Topological Insulator via Floquet Engineering</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chun-Ping Su, Zhao-Fan Cai, Tao Liu</p>
            <p>Higher-order topological insulators have attracted significant interest in both static single-particle and many-body lattice systems. While periodically driven (Floquet) higher-order topological phases have been explored at the single-particle level, the role of interactions in such systems remains less understood. In this paper, we extend previous studies by investigating interaction-induced higher-order topological phases through Floquet engineering. To achieve this, we construct an extended Bose-Hubbard model on a square lattice subjected to periodic driving. We demonstrate the emergence of interaction-induced normal Floquet second-order topological corner states for doublons (i.e., bound boson pairs) from a trivial phase, which exhibit robustness against disorder. Notably, beyond the normal phase, we reveal an interaction-induced anomalous Floquet second-order topological phase, where in-gap corner states of doublons emerge within the $\pi/T$ gap ($T$ being the driving period). Our model, accessible with state-of-the-art ultracold atom techniques, provides a platform for realizing interaction-driven higher-order topological phases uniquely enabled by periodic driving, with no direct counterparts in static or single-particle systems.</p>

            <h2>Particles in finite volumes and a toy model of decaying neutrons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christian Käding</p>
            <p>It is well-known that the momentum spectra of particles confined to finite spatial volumes deviate from the continuous spectra used for unconfined particles. In this article, we consider real scalar particles confined to finite volumes with periodic boundary conditions, such that the particles' spectra are discrete. We directly compute the density matrices describing the decay processes $\phi \to \varphi^2$ and $\phi \to \varphi\chi\nu$, and subsequently derive expressions for the decay probabilities both for confined and unconfined particles. The latter decay process is used as a rough toy model for a neutron decaying into a proton, an electron, and an anti-electron neutrino. We propose that finite volume effects can have an impact on the outcomes of experiments measuring the neutron lifetime. In addition, our findings at the toy model level suggest that taking into account possible initial correlations between neutrons and their daughter particles might be relevant as well.</p>

            <h2>Multiparty entanglement loops in quantum spin liquids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liuke Lyu, Deeksha Chandorkar, Samarth Kapoor, So Takei, Erik S. Sørensen, William Witczak-Krempa</p>
            <p>Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) give rise to exotic emergent particles by weaving intricate entanglement patterns in the underlying electrons. Bipartite measures between subregions can detect the presence of anyons, but little is known about the full entanglement structure of QSLs. Here, we study the multiparty entanglement of QSLs via entanglement microscopy. We find that in contrast to conventional matter, the genuine multiparty entanglement (GME) between spins is absent in the smallest subregions, a phenomenon we call "entanglement frustration". Instead, GME is more collective, and arises solely in loops. By exploiting exact results and large-scale numerics, we confirm these properties in various gapped and gapless QSLs realised in physically motivated Hamiltonians, as well as with string-net wavefunctions hosting abelian or non-abelian anyons. Our results shed new light on the phase diagram of Kitaev's honeycomb model in a Zeeman field, and the Kagome Heisenberg model under various perturbations. Going beyond QSLs, we provide evidence that entanglement loops are a universal property of quantum gauge theories. This leads to a new understanding of fractionalization, and the means by which gauge bosons encode quantum information.</p>

            <p>Achieving quantum-limited motional control of optically trapped particles beyond the sub-micrometer scale is an outstanding problem in levitated optomechanics. A key obstacle is solving the light scattering problem and identifying particle geometries that allow stable trapping and efficient motional detection of their center of mass and rotational motion in three dimensions. Here, we present a computational framework that combines an efficient electromagnetic scattering solver with the adjoint method to inversely design printable microparticles tailored for levitated optomechanics. Our method allows identifying optimized geometries, characterized by enhanced optical trapping and detection efficiencies compared to conventional microspheres. This improves the feasibility of quantum-limited motional control of all translational and rotational degrees of freedom in a standard standing-wave optical trap.</p>

            <h2>Scaling and Universality at Noisy Quench Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saeid Ansari, R. Jafari, Alireza Akbari, Mehdi Abdi</p>
            <p>Dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) have been studied in the extended XY model under both noiseless and noisy linear driven staggered field cases. In the time-independent staggered field case, the model exhibits a single critical point where the transition occurs from the spin-liquid phase to the antiferromagnetic phase. In the noiseless ramp case, unlike the transverse field XY model where DQPT always occurs for a quench crossing the single critical point, there is a critical sweep velocity above which the kinks corresponding to a DQPT are completely removed. Furthermore, in this case there are only two critical modes whose excitation probability is one-half. In the presence of a Gaussian white noise, we find that this critical sweep velocity decreases by increasing the noise strength, and scales linearly with the square of the noise intensity. A surprising result occurs when the noise intensity and sweep velocity are about the same order of magnitude, the number of critical modes is significantly increased, signalling a region with multiple critical modes. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the scaling of the dynamical free energy near the DQPTs time is the same for both noiseless and noisy ramp quenches.</p>

            <p>Color centers in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have attracted significant interest due to their potential applications in future optical quantum technologies. For most applications, scalable on-demand fabrication is a key requirement. Recent advances using localized electron irradiation have demonstrated near-identical emitters in the blue and yellow spectral regions. While the blue emitters have been demonstrated in cryogenic temperatures, the yellow emitters remain uncharacterized under such conditions. In this work, we therefore extended the study of yellow emitters to cryogenic temperatures. Initially, multiple spectral features were observed, prompting a systematic investigation that led to the identification of a defect emission centered around 547.5 nm with high brightness and excellent photostability. By tuning the excitation wavelength, we are able to distinguish Raman scattering peaks from the emitter emission. Further analysis of the vibronic emissions allowed us to identify an optical phonon mode, whose contribution becomes increasingly dominant at elevated temperatures. Photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy (PLE) reveals excitation through this phonon mode enhances the emission by almost 5-fold in cryogenic temperature. Temperature-dependent studies further elucidate the role of phonons in the emission process. These observations deepen our understanding of the nature of the emitters, opening new avenues for precise tuning of quantum light sources.</p>

            <h2>Neural networks leverage nominally quantum and post-quantum representations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paul M. Riechers, Thomas J. Elliott, Adam S. Shai</p>
            <p>We show that deep neural networks, including transformers and RNNs, pretrained as usual on next-token prediction, intrinsically discover and represent beliefs over 'quantum' and 'post-quantum' low-dimensional generative models of their training data -- as if performing iterative Bayesian updates over the latent state of this world model during inference as they observe more context. Notably, neural nets easily find these representation whereas there is no finite classical circuit that would do the job. The corresponding geometric relationships among neural activations induced by different input sequences are found to be largely independent of neural-network architecture. Each point in this geometry corresponds to a history-induced probability density over all possible futures, and the relative displacement of these points reflects the difference in mechanism and magnitude for how these distinct pasts affect the future.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oktay K Pashaev, Aygul Kocak</p>
            <p>We propose supersymmetric extension of deformed quantum oscillator with two parameters quantum group structure. As particular cases, specified by values of $p$ and $q$ parameters it includes symmetric and non-symmetric $q$-oscillators, Fibonacci and Fibonacci divisors hierarchy of Golden oscillators, Tamm-Dankov oscillator etc. By $pq$-deformed supersymmetric annihilation operator, the set of corresponding supersymmetric coherent states is introduced. The states are characterized by the pair of $pq$-quantum states from the Fock space or equivalently, by the set of infinite number of qubit states. Entanglement of fermions with $pq$-deformed bosons is characterized by the concurrence as the linear entropy, taking form of the Gram determinant of inner products. As shown, for two types of the reference states, the concurrence depends on values of $p$ and $q$ parameters, and it reaches the value one for the maximally entangled states. Entanglement of the super-coherent states and the uncertainty relations for the coordinate and momentum in these states are calculated. Non-classical nature of the entangled states is reflected in non-minimal character of the uncertainty relations.</p>

            <h2>Enhanced entanglement from quantum ergodicity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amit Vikram</p>
            <p>The quantum chaos conjecture associates the spectral statistics of a quantum system with abstract notions of quantum ergodicity. Such associations are taken to be of fundamental and sometimes defining importance for quantum chaos, but their practical relevance has been challenged by theoretical and experimental developments. Here, in counterpoint, we show that ergodic dynamics can be directly utilized for the preparation of quantum states with parametrically higher entanglement than generated by maximally scrambling circuits such as random unitaries. Our setting involves quantum systems coupled via a "non-demolition" interaction of conserved charges. We derive an exact relation between the evolving entanglement of an initial product state and a measure of spectral statistics of the interacting charges in this state. This connection is explained via a notion of Krylov vector ergodicity, tied to the ability of quantum dynamics to generate orthonormal states over time. We consider exploiting this phenomenon for the preparation of approximate Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) states between complex systems, a crucial resource for tasks such as quantum teleportation. We quantitatively show that the transfer of operators between entangled systems, which underlies the utility of the EPR state, can be performed with parametrically larger capacity for entanglement generated via ergodic dynamics than with maximal scrambling. Our analysis suggests a direct application of "ergodic" spectral statistics as a potential resource for quantum information tasks.</p>

            <p>Long-range quantum communication, distributed quantum computing, and sensing applications require robust and reliable ways to encode transmitted quantum information. In this context, time-bin encoding has emerged as a promising candidate due to its resilience to mechanical and thermal perturbations, depolarization from refractive index changes, and birefringence in fiber optic media. Time-bin quantum bits (qubits) can be produced in various ways, and each implementation calls for different considerations regarding design parameters, component compatibility (optical, electrical, electro-optical), and measurement procedures. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of experimental methods for preparing and characterizing time-bin qubits (TBQs) for quantum communication protocols, with an assessment of their advantages and limitations. We discuss challenges in transmitting TBQs over optical fibers and free-space channels, and methods to overcome them. We also analyze the selection of key time-bin parameters and component requirements across experiments. This leads us to explore the preparation and characterization of time-bin entanglement and examine requirements for interference of time-bins from separate sources. Further, we cover preparation and characterization techniques for high-dimensional time-bin states, namely qudits, and the generation of time-bin entangled qudit pairs. We review time-energy entanglement and key experimental realizations. Finally, we present notable applications of time-bin encoded quantum states, from quantum communication protocols to photonic quantum computation. This work serves as an accessible introduction and a comprehensive review of recent developments.</p>

            <p>Parity-time ($PT$)-symmetric Hamiltonians exhibit non-unitary dynamical evolution while maintaining real spectra, and offer unique approaches to quantum sensing and entanglement generation. Here we present a method for simulating the quantum dynamics of $PT$-symmetric systems on unitary-gate-based quantum computers by leveraging Hermitian equivalents through similarity transformations. We introduce two algorithms for simulating $PT$-symmetric systems near exceptional points where eigenvalues and eigenstates coalesce. The first is a hybrid classical-quantum algorithm and the second reduces the classical component by using an ancilla qubit. We then use perturbation theory to extend this method to consider the dynamics of two weakly interacting $PT$-symmetric systems. Demonstrations on a quantum device and noisy simulators validate the algorithm on current quantum devices, offering potential for scalable simulations of $PT$-symmetric systems and pseudo-Hermitian operators in quantum computation.</p>

            <p>In the field of quantum machine learning (QML), parametrized quantum circuits (PQCs) -- constructed using a combination of fixed and tunable quantum gates -- provide a promising hybrid framework for tackling complex machine learning problems. Despite numerous proposed applications, there remains limited exploration of datasets relevant to quantum chemistry. In this study, we investigate the potential benefits and limitations of PQCs on two chemically meaningful datasets: (1) the BSE49 dataset, containing bond separation energies for 49 different classes of chemical bonds, and (2) a dataset of water conformations, where coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) wavefunctions are predicted from lower-level electronic structure methods using the data-driven coupled-cluster (DDCC) approach. We construct a comprehensive set of 168 PQCs by combining 14 data encoding strategies with 12 variational ans{ä}tze, and evaluate their performance on circuits with 5 and 16 qubits. Our initial analysis examines the impact of circuit structure on model performance using state-vector simulations. We then explore how circuit depth and training set size influence model performance. Finally, we assess the performance of the best-performing PQCs on current quantum hardware, using both noisy simulations ("fake" backends) and real quantum devices. Our findings underscore the challenges of applying PQCs to chemically relevant problems that are straightforward for classical machine learning methods but remain non-trivial for quantum approaches.</p>

            <h2>Exponential onset of scalable entanglement via twist-and-turn dynamics in XY models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tommaso Roscilde, Meenu Kumari, Alexandre Cooper, Fabio Mezzacapo</p>
            <p>The efficient preparation of scalable multipartite entanglement is a central goal in the development of next-generation quantum devices. In this work, we show that the so-called ``twist-and-turn" (TaT) dynamics for interacting spin ensembles, generated by Hamiltonians with U(1)-symmetric interactions and with a transverse field, can offer an important resource to reach this goal. For models with sufficiently high connectivity, TaT dynamics exhibits two key features: 1) it features both scalable squeezing at short times, as well as quantum Fisher information with Heisenberg scaling at later times; and 2) scalable multipartite entanglement (up to Heisenberg scaling) is reached in a time growing only logarithmically with system size, associated with an exponential buildup of quantum correlations. These results can be shown exactly in the XY model with a Rabi field and infinite range interactions, and numerically in the case of spatially decaying XY interactions, such as dipolar interactions in two dimensions, provided that unstable spin-wave modes do not develop for large system sizes and/or strong fields. For dipolar interactions, the entanglement dynamics at intermediate times is completely at odds with thermalization; and it appears to saturate the maximum speed of entanglement buildup allowed by Lieb-Robinson bounds generalized to power-law interacting systems.</p>

            <h2>Witnessing nonlocality in quantum network of continuous-variable systems by generalized quasiprobability functions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Taotao Yan, Jinchuan Hou, Xiaofei Qi, Kan He</p>
            <p>Gaussian measurements can not be used to witness nonlocality in Gaussian states as well as the network nonlocality in networks of continuous-variable (CV) systems. Thus special non-Gaussian measurements have to be utilized. In the present paper, we first propose a kind of nonlinear Bell-type inequality that is applicable to quantum networks of both finite or infinite dimensional systems. Violation of the inequality will witness the network nonlocality. This inequality allows us to propose a method of the supremum strategy for detecting network nonlocality in CV systems with source states being any multipartite multi-mode Gaussian states according to the configurations of the networks by utilizing non-Gaussian measurements based on generalized quasiprobability functions. The nonlinear Bell-type inequalities for CV networks, which depend solely on the generalized quasiprobability functions of Gaussian states, are straightforward to construct and implement. As illustrations, we propose the corresponding nonlinear Bell-type inequalities for any chain, star, tree-shaped and cyclic networks in CV systems with source states being $(1+1)$-mode Gaussian states. The examples show that this approach works well for witnessing the nonlocality in networks of CV systems. Particularly, a thorough discussion is given for the entanglement swapping network. Our study provide a strong signature for the network nonlocality nature of CV systems and lead to precise recipes for its experimental verification.</p>

            <p>We compare the semiclassical and quantum predictions for the unitary dynamics of a two-level atom interacting with a single-mode electromagnetic field in the presence of parametric modulation of the atomic parameters, in the regime of multiphoton atom-field resonances. We derive approximate analytic solutions for the semiclassical Rabi model when the atomic transition frequency and the atom-field coupling strength undergo harmonic external modulations. These solutions are compared to the predictions of the quantum Rabi model, which is solved numerically for the initial coherent state with a large average photon number, of the order of $10^4$, in the regime of three-photon resonance. We show that for initial times and sufficiently intense coherent state the semiclassical dynamics agrees quite well with the quantum one, although for large times it inevitably fails due to the lack of the collapse-revival behavior. Furthermore, we describe how the field state is modified throughout the evolution, presenting numeric results for the average photon number, entropies (related to the atom-field entanglement) and other quantities that characterize the photon number statistics of the electromagnetic field.</p>

            <p>Modular architectures are a promising approach to scaling quantum computers beyond the limits of monolithic designs. However, non-local communications between different quantum processors might significantly impact overall system performance. In this work, we investigate the role of the network infrastructure in modular quantum computing architectures, focusing on coherence loss due to communication constraints. We analyze the impact of classical network latency on quantum teleportation and identify conditions under which it becomes a bottleneck. Additionally, we study different network topologies and assess how communication resources affect the number and parallelization of inter-core communications. Finally, we conduct a full-stack evaluation of the architecture under varying communication parameters, demonstrating how these factors influence the overall system performance. The results show that classical communication does not become a bottleneck for systems exceeding one million qubits, given current technology assumptions, even with modest clock frequencies and parallel wired interconnects. Additionally, increasing quantum communication resources generally shortens execution time, although it may introduce additional communication overhead. The optimal number of quantum links between QCores depends on both the algorithm being executed and the chosen inter-core topology. Our findings offer valuable guidance for designing modular architectures, enabling scalable quantum computing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shaurya Aarav, S. A. Wadood, Jason W Fleischer</p>
            <p>Quantum speckles exhibit significantly richer behavior than their classical counterparts due to their higher dimensionality. A simple example is the far-field speckle pattern in 1D light scattering: classical light forms 1D speckles defined by the numerical aperture, whereas biphoton scattering depends in addition on the photon correlation length, forming 2D elliptical speckles. To date, the behavior of quantum speckles for shorter propagation distances has not been considered. We remedy this here by considering the paraxial evolution of two-photon entanglement at arbitrary propagation distances from an isotropic scatterer. We show, theoretically, numerically, and experimentally, that the two length scales of the biphoton introduce a new Fresnel regime between the conventional near and far fields. Further, we show that the quantum near field is characterized by speckles with a square shape that remain constant during propagation. In contrast, the intermediate regime can be engineered to have a constant speckle size along the sum coordinate but a linearly expanding speckle size along the difference coordinate, with a speckle shape that transitions from square to elliptical. The results merge quantum coherence with scattering statistics and suggest new regimes of operation for correlation-based quantum sensing and imaging.</p>

            <p>The relativistic electron vortex beam (REVB) has attracted increasing attention due to its nontrivial spin-orbit structure recently. As relativistic electrons are governed by the Dirac equation, exact solutions to this equation provide the most reliable starting point for understanding angular momentum characteristics of REVBs. In this work, a set of exact eigensolutions of the Dirac equation are derived in a complex cylindrical coordinate system using a generalized series expansion method. We demonstrate that the eigenstate carries net angular momentum with the vortex charge being the quantum number of the total angular momentum along the propagation direction and deduce the explicit expression for the intrinsic spin-orbit coupling strength. Furthermore, we show that helicity, which exhibits anomaly in the vortex state, can serve as a practical characterizing quantity for the REVB. This work lays a theoretical foundation for further exploration of REVBs in both theory and experiment.</p>

            <p>Encoding a qubit in the continuous degrees of freedom of a quantum system, such as bosonic modes, is a powerful alternative to modern quantum error correction (QEC). Among the most prominent bosonic QEC codes, binomial codes provide protection against loss and dephasing errors by encoding logical states in superpositions of Fock states with binomially weighted coefficients. While much attention has been given to their error-correcting capabilities and integration into fault-tolerant architectures, efficient methods for generating arbitrary binomial codewords remain scarce. In this work, we propose a novel scheme for generating these codewords by exploiting nonlinear multiphoton interactions between a continuous-variable bosonic mode (oscillator) and a two-level system (spin/qubit). Our proposed scheme assumes the ability to prepare the oscillator in an arbitrary Fock state and the qubit in an arbitrary superposition of its basis states and access to arbitrarily high multiphoton interactions. To enhance the experimental feasibility of our scheme, we further demonstrate how to reduce the required order parameter of multiphoton interactions by a factor of two for a special class of code states.</p>

            <p>In recent years, the investigation of nonlinear electromagnetic responses has received significant attention due to its potential for elucidating the quantum properties of matter. Although remarkable progress has been achieved in developing quantum theories of nonlinear responses to electric field, a comprehensive quantum theory framework that systematically addresses nonlinear responses to both electric and magnetic fields has yet to be thoroughly discussed. Here, we present a systematic quantum theory of nonlinear electromagnetic response using the Matsubara Green's function approach, which explicitly incorporates the wave vector dependence of external electromagnetic fields. We provide diagrammatic representation and reveal the general properties of transport coefficients. We apply our theory to second-order responses, deriving the nonlinear Hall effects and magneto-nonlinear Hall effects in both time-reversal symmetric and time-reversal breaking systems. These effects stem from diverse quantum geometric sources. Additionally, we analyze the contributions arising from the Zeeman interaction. Our work presents a unified quantum theory of nonlinear electromagnetic response, paving the way for further exploration of novel phenomena in this field.</p>

            <h2>Polarization dynamics in vertical-cavity surface emitting lasers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thorsten Ackemann, Markus Sondermann</p>
            <p>Experiments and their interpretation on polarization dynamics and polarization switching in vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers operated in the fundamental transverse mode regime are reviewed. Important observations are switching events to a mode with the lower unsaturated gain and the existence of elliptically polarized dynamical transition states after the destabilization of the low-frequency polarization mode. The observations demonstrate the need to consider explicitly the phase properties of the optical field as well as nonlinear effects affecting polarization selection above threshold. Good qualitative agreement is found with a model which takes into account the spin degrees of freedom of the light field as well as of the carriers (`spin-flip model'), if the spin-flip rate is taken to be some tens of $10^9$~s$^{-1}$. This constitutes a strong -- though indirect -- indication that spin dependent processes are important in polarization selection in the devices investigated.</p>

            <h2>Cavity-less Brillouin strong coupling in a solid-state continuous system</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Laura Blázquez Martínez, Changlong Zhu, Birgit Stiller</p>
            <p>Strongly coupling two systems allows them to exchange coherent information before the systems decohere. This important regime in light-matter interactions has predominantly been reached in optical resonator configurations. In this work, we present the experimental realization of strong coupling between optical and acoustic fields within a continuum of modes in a cavity-less configuration after a single-pass through an optical waveguide. The underlying physical effect of anti-Stokes Brillouin-Mandelstam scattering in a highly nonlinear fiber at T = 4 K allows us to experimentally demonstrate strong coupling in a waveguide scenario. We show the splitting of the optoacoustic spectral response and introduce a novel technique to measure the avoided crossing of hybrid optoacoustic modes via forced detuning. This demonstration opens a path towards in-line acoustic-waves-based quantum signal processing in waveguide systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. M. Majczak, K. Krajewska, A. Bechler, J. Z. Kamiński</p>
            <p>We study helicity correlations of electron-positron pairs created by a homogeneous time-dependent electric field in the Sauter-Schwinger scenario. Our analysis is based on solving the Dirac equation with the Feynman or anti-Feynman boundary conditions, which is equivalent to the scattering matrix approach widely used in high energy physics. Most importantly, both these methods allow to fully account for the helicity (or, more generally, spin) correlations of created particles. The influence of helicity correlations and the carrier-envelope phase of the electric pulse on the properties of topological structures (such as spirals and vortices) in momentum distributions of created particles is investigated. The generation of maximally entangled helicity states is discussed and the possibility of using a short electric pulse as a fast switch between them is indicated.</p>

            <h2>Non-Markovian effects in long-range polariton-mediated energy transfer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kristin B. Arnardottir, Piper Fowler-Wright, Christos Tserkezis, Brendon W. Lovett, Jonathan Keeling</p>
            <p>Intramolecular energy transfer driven by near-field effects plays an important role in applications ranging from biophysics and chemistry to nano-optics and quantum communications. Advances in strong light-matter coupling in molecular systems have opened new possibilities to control energy transfer. In particular, long-distance energy transfer between molecules has been reported as the result of their mutual coupling to cavity photon modes, and the formation of hybrid polariton states. In addition to strong coupling to light, molecular systems also show strong interactions between electronic and vibrational modes. The latter can act as a reservoir for energy to facilitate off-resonant transitions, and thus energy relaxation between polaritonic states at different energies. However, the non-Markovian nature of those modes makes it challenging to accurately simulate these effects. Here we capture them via process tensor matrix product operator (PT-MPO) methods, to describe exactly the vibrational environment of the molecules combined with a mean-field treatment of the light-matter interaction. In particular, we study the emission dynamics of a system consisting of two spatially separated layers of different species of molecules coupled to a common photon mode, and show that the strength of coupling to the vibrational bath plays a crucial role in governing the dynamics of the energy of the emitted light; at strong vibrational coupling this dynamics shows strongly non-Markovian effects, eventually leading to polaron formation. Our results shed light on polaritonic long-range energy transfer, and provide further understanding of the role of vibrational modes of relevance to the growing field of molecular polaritonics.</p>

            <h2>Hollow-grams: Generalized Entanglement Wedges from the Gravitational Path Integral</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sami Kaya, Pratik Rath, Kyle Ritchie</p>
            <p>Recently, Bousso and Penington (BP) made a proposal for the entanglement wedge associated to a gravitating bulk region. In this paper, we derive this proposal in time-reflection symmetric settings using the gravitational path integral. To do this, we exploit the connection between random tensor networks (RTNs) and fixed-geometry states in gravity. We define the entropy of a bulk region in an RTN by removing tensors in that region and computing the entropy of the open legs thus generated in the "hollowed" RTN. We thus derive the BP proposal for RTNs and hence, also for fixed-geometry states in gravity. By then expressing a general holographic state as a superposition over fixed-geometry states and using a diagonal approximation, we provide a general gravitational path integral derivation of the BP proposal. We demonstrate that the saddles computing the Rényi entropy $S_n$ depend on how the bulk region is gauge-invariantly specified. Nevertheless, we show that the BP proposal is universally reproduced in the $n\to1$ limit.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomis Prajapati, Harsh Mehta, Shreya Banerjee, Prasanta K. Panigrahi, V. Narayanan</p>
            <p>The experimental verification of multipartite entangled states is essential for advancing quantum information processing. Entanglement witnesses (EWs) provide a widely used and experimentally accessible approach for detecting genuinely multipartite entangled states. In this work, we theoretically derive the entanglement witness for the four-qubit Dicke state and experimentally evaluate it on two distinct IBM 127-qubit Quantum Processing Units (QPUs), namely ibm\_sherbrook and ibm\_brisbane. A negative expectation value of the witness operator serves as a sufficient condition for confirming genuine multipartite entanglement. We report the maximum (negative) values of the witness achieved on these QPUs as $-0.178 \pm 0.009$ and $-0.169 \pm 0.002$, corresponding to two different state preparation protocols. Additionally, we theoretically investigate the effect of various noise channels on the genuine entanglement of a four-qubit Dicke state using the Qiskit Aer simulator. We show the behavior of the EW constructed under the assumption of Markovian and non-Markovian amplitude damping and depolarizing noises, bit-phase flip noise, and readout errors. We also investigate the effect of varying thermal relaxation time on the EW, depicting a bound on the $T_1$ time required for successful generation of a Dicke State on a superconducting QPU.</p>

            <p>Apprenticeship learning is a method commonly used to train artificial intelligence systems to perform tasks that are challenging to specify directly using traditional methods. Based on the work of Abbeel and Ng (ICML'04), we present a quantum algorithm for apprenticeship learning via inverse reinforcement learning. As an intermediate step, we give a classical approximate apprenticeship learning algorithm to demonstrate the speedup obtained by our quantum algorithm. We prove convergence guarantees on our classical approximate apprenticeship learning algorithm, which also extends to our quantum apprenticeship learning algorithm. We also show that, as compared to its classical counterpart, our quantum algorithm achieves an improvement in the per-iteration time complexity by a quadratic factor in the dimension of the feature vectors $k$ and the size of the action space $A$.</p>

            <p>We consider a three-mode electro-optomechanical system in which a mechanical oscillator is coupled to an optical cavity and a LC circuit through radiation pressure and capacitive coupling, respectively. By controlling the two-tone driving of the optical cavity and the microwave driving of the LC circuit, the strong squeezing of both the microwave field of the LC circuit and the mechanical mode will be obtained. Moreover, by further altering the driving power of the system, the perfect one-way Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering between the optical cavity and the mechanical oscillator will be generated. The degree of the one-way EPR steering can be controlled by the driving light of the system. We also show the robustness of the squeezing and EPR steering against environmental temperature. This scheme may provide a promising platform for quantum information processing and microwave quantum communication.</p>

            <p>We present a detailed simulation and design framework for realizing traveling wave parametric amplifiers (TWPAs) using the nonlinear kinetic inductance of disordered superconductors -- in our case niobium-titanium-nitride (NbTiN). These kinetic inductance TWPAs (KITs) operate via three-wave mixing (3WM) to achieve high broadband gain and near-quantum-limited (nQL) noise. Representative fabricated devices -- realized using an inverted microstrip (IMS), dispersion-engineered, artificial transmission line -- demonstrate power gains above 25 dB, bandwidths beyond 3 GHz, and achieve ultimate system noise levels of 1.1 quanta even when operated with no magnetic shielding. These performance metrics are competitive with state-of-the-art Josephson-junction-based TWPAs but involve simpler fabrication and able to providing three orders of magnitude higher dynamic range ($IIP_1 = -68$ dBm, $IIP_3 = -55$ dBm), and high magnetic field resilience -- making KITs an attractive technology for highly multiplexed readout of quantum information and superconducting detector systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yinchen Liu, James R. Seddon, Tamara Kohler, Emilio Onorati, Toby S. Cubitt</p>
            <p>We revisit the problem of fitting Lindbladian models to the outputs of quantum process tomography. A sequence of prior theoretical works approached the problem by considering whether there exists a Lindbladian generator close to a matrix logarithm of the tomographically estimated transfer matrix. This technique must take into account the non-uniqueness of the matrix logarithm, so that in general multiple branches of the logarithm must be checked. In contrast, all practical demonstrations of Lindbladian fitting on real experimental data have to our knowledge eschewed logarithm search, instead adopting direct numerical optimisation or ad-hoc approaches tailored to a particular experimental realisation. In our work, we introduce algorithmic improvements to logarithm search, demonstrating that it can be applied in practice to settings relevant for current quantum computing hardware. We additionally augment the task of Lindbladian fitting with techniques from gate set tomography to improve robustness against state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors, which can otherwise obfuscate estimates of the model underlying the process of interest. We benchmark our techniques extensively using simulated tomographic data employing a range of realistic error models, before demonstrating their application to tomographic data collected from real superconducting-qubit hardware.</p>

            <h2>Fast and High Excitation Transport in Waveguide Quantum Electrodynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ya-Tang Yu, I Gusti Ngurah Yudi Handayana, Wei Chen, H. H. Jen</p>
            <p>Waveguide quantum electrodynamics (wQED) with underlying collective and long-range atom-atom interactions has led to many distinct dynamical phenomena, including modified collective radiations and intriguing quantum correlations. It stands out as a unique platform to illustrate correlated photon transport, as well as to promise applications in quantum information processing. Here we manifest a fast and high atomic excitation transport by employing two well-separated chirally-coupled atomic arrays. This enhanced waveguide-mediated transport of excitations emerges due to the dominance of spectrally isolated and right-localized right eigenstates in the system's dynamics. Contrary to the instinct of applying the cascaded systems with unidirectional couplings to expedite direct and high excitation transport, the optimal system configurations in open wQED systems demand slight or finite nonreciprocal decay channels to facilitate energy transport by exploiting waveguide-mediated couplings. We also investigate the effect of the couplings' directionality and the scaling of atom number on the transport properties. Our results showcase the wide applicability in wQED platforms and provide insights to quantum engineering and quantum information applications.</p>

            <h2>Variational Quantum Simulations of a Two-Dimensional Frustrated Transverse-Field Ising Model on a Trapped-Ion Quantum Computer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ammar Kirmani, Elijah Pelofske, Andreas Bärtschi, Stephan Eidenbenz, Jian-Xin Zhu</p>
            <p>Quantum computers are an ideal platform to study the ground state properties of strongly correlated systems due to the limitation of classical computing techniques particularly for systems exhibiting quantum phase transitions. While the error rates of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers are still high, simulating strongly correlated systems on such devices and extracting information of possible phases may be within reach. The frustrated transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) is such a system with multiple ordered magnetic phases. In this study, we simulate a two-dimensional frustrated TFIM with next-nearest-neighbor spin-exchange interactions at zero temperature. The competition between the nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic and next-nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic coupling gives rise to frustration in the system. Moreover, the presence of quantum fluctuations makes the ground-state phase profile even richer. We use the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) to compute the phases on a square lattice with periodic boundary conditions for a system of 16 sites (qubits). The trained VQE circuits are compared to exact diagonalization, allowing us to extract error measures of VQE. We focus on the ground-state phase transitions of this model, where VQE succeeds in finding the dominant magnetic phases. The optimized VQE circuits are then executed on the Quantinuum H1-1 trapped-ion quantum computer without using any error mitigation techniques. Our experiments show near perfect recovery of the magnetic phases of the frustrated model through ground-state energy, the energy derivative, and the spin correlation functions. Thus, we show that the trapped-ion quantum processor is able to achieve reliable simulations of a strongly correlated system within the limitations of the VQE approach.</p>

            <h2>Unraveling superradiance: Entanglement and mutual information in collective decay</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xin H. H. Zhang, Daniel Malz, Peter Rabl</p>
            <p>We study the collective decay of an initially inverted ensemble of two-level emitters in two distinct scenarios: when coupled to a squeezed photonic reservoir and when interacting with a one-dimensional waveguide. Using a quantum-state diffusion approach to unravel the emission process, we investigate entanglement and classical correlations along individual quantum trajectories over time. This numerical analysis shows that despite an initial build-up of entanglement and a significant amount of entanglement due to either spin squeezing or dark states at late times, the essential features of the superradiant burst are well described by averages over fully factorizable states. We explain this observation in terms of an almost complete factorization of all 2-local observables, which we identify as a generic property of superradiant decay. Based on this insight, we provide a purely classical theory for the burst in squeezed superradiance, which is both intuitive and exact for a large number of emitters. Moreover, we find that our numerical approach also performs well in the presence of subradiant states, which dominate the slow residual decay of non-uniform ensembles at late times.</p>

We simulate the colour parts of the interactions directly on the quantum computer, while the kinematic parts are for now pre-computed classically. For processes where some of the external particles are identical, we find the first hints of a potential quantum advantage. We validate our techniques using simulated quantum computers. Furthermore, for toy examples we also demonstrate our algorithms on a 56-qubit trapped-ion quantum computer. The work constitutes a further key step towards a full quantum simulation of generic perturbative QCD processes.</p>

            <p>The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model delivers an analytically tractable framework for exotic strongly correlated phases where conventional paradigms like Landau's Fermi liquid theory collapse. This review offers a pedagogical introduction to the SYK physics, highlighting its unique capacity to model \textit{strange metals} -- systems exhibiting linear-in-temperature resistivity, Planckian dissipation, and quasiparticle breakdown. We systematically construct both Majorana and complex fermion variants, transforming them into training grounds for modern many-body physics techniques, for instance, (1) large-$N$ formulations via disorder averaging and replica symmetry, (2) Schwinger-Dyson and Kadanoff-Baym equations, (3) imaginary time Matsubara formulation, (4) real-time dynamics via Keldysh formalism, and the associated (5) non-perturbative Keldysh contour deformations. These tools lay the foundation for equilibrium thermodynamics, quantum chaos, quench dynamics, and transport in the thermodynamic limit -- all within a solvable, chaotic quantum system. Designed as a self-contained resource, the review bridges advanced technical machinery to physical insights, with computational implementations provided. Though principally treating the SYK model as a condensed matter laboratory, we also highlight its profound connection to quantum gravity -- woven throughout this work -- underscoring how this solvable chaotic fermionic model serves as a lens onto black hole thermodynamics and holographic duality.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. A. Saharian, H. H. Asatryan</p>
            <p>We investigate the properties of the vacuum state for the Proca field in the geometry of two parallel plates on background of (D+1)-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. The two-point functions for the vector potential and the field tensor are evaluated for higher-dimensional generalizations of the perfect magnetic conductor (PMC) and perfect electric conductor (PEC) boundary conditions. Explicit expressions are provided for the vacuum expectation values (VEVs) of the electric and magnetic field squares, field condensate, and for the VEV of the energy-momentum tensor. In the zero-mass limit the VEVs of the electric and magnetic field squares and the condensate reduce to the corresponding expressions for a massless vector field. The same is the case for the VEV of the energy-momentum tensor in the problem with PEC conditions. However, for PMC conditions the zero-mass limit for the vacuum energy-momentum tensor differs from the corresponding VEV for a massless field. This difference in the zero-mass limits is related to the different influences of the boundary conditions on the longitudinal polarization mode of a massive vector field. The PMC conditions constrain all the polarization modes including the longitudinal mode, whereas PEC conditions do not influence the longitudinal mode. The vacuum energy-momentum tensor is diagonal. The normal stress is uniformly distributed in the region between the plates and vanishes in the remaining regions. The corresponding Casimir forces are attractive for both boundary conditions.</p>

            <p>We introduce a generalized \textit{Probabilistic Approximate Optimization Algorithm (PAOA)}, a classical variational Monte Carlo framework that extends and formalizes prior work by Weitz \textit{et al.}~\cite{Combes_2023}, enabling parameterized and fast sampling on present-day Ising machines and probabilistic computers. PAOA operates by iteratively modifying the couplings of a network of binary stochastic units, guided by cost evaluations from independent samples. We establish a direct correspondence between derivative-free updates and the gradient of the full $2^N \times 2^N$ Markov flow, showing that PAOA admits a principled variational formulation. Simulated annealing emerges as a limiting case under constrained parameterizations, and we implement this regime on an FPGA-based probabilistic computer with on-chip annealing to solve large 3D spin-glass problems. Benchmarking PAOA against QAOA on the canonical 26-spin Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model with matched parameters reveals superior performance for PAOA. We show that PAOA naturally extends simulated annealing by optimizing multiple temperature profiles, leading to improved performance over SA on heavy-tailed problems such as SK-Lévy.</p>

Notably, neural nets easily find these representation whereas there is no finite classical circuit that would do the job. The corresponding geometric relationships among neural activations induced by different input sequences are found to be largely independent of neural-network architecture. Each point in this geometry corresponds to a history-induced probability density over all possible futures, and the relative displacement of these points reflects the difference in mechanism and magnitude for how these distinct pasts affect the future.</p>

While strong spin frustration is known to induce quantum fluctuations at low temperatures, previous classical approaches restricted to binary (up or down) spin configurations have been insufficient to fully capture the quantum contributions of frustration. In this study, we introduced a quantitative metric to evaluate the quantum effects arising from frustration and employed QAOA to differentiate between classical and quantum regimes. Notably, we found that in the weakly frustrated region, QAOA measurements rarely capture first excited states, as they are energetically well separated from the ground state. In contrast, near the quantum phase transition point, excited states appear more frequently in QAOA measurements, highlighting the increased role of quantum fluctuations.</p>

            <p>Sensing with undetected photons has become a vibrant, application-driven research domain with a special focus on the mid-infrared (mid-IR) wavelength region. Since the mid-IR contains spectral bands with highly specific and strong molecular absorbance signatures, often referred to as fingerprints, a multitude of different samples and their compositions can be detected and quantified spectroscopically. Enhancing this inherently sample alteration-free spectroscopic method with imaging capabilities leads to a powerful technique for environmental monitoring and biomedical applications that enables automated diagnostics while omitting time-consuming and non-reversible labeling steps. To evade the shortcomings of state-of-the-art instruments for mid-IR hyperspectral microscopy related to cost, complexity, power-consumption, and performance, which are associated with technological challenges for mid-IR cameras and low-noise and broadband mid-IR sources, here, we construct a proof-of-concept nonlinear interferometer in a wide-field imaging arrangement combined with high-resolution spectral acquisition by pixelwise quantum Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. For the broadband range of 2300-3100 cm$^{-1}$, covering the important CH-stretch band, we perform hyperspectral imaging that simultaneously resolves 3500 spatial modes, each with a spectral resolution of 10 cm$^{-1}$ leveraging in total around $10^5$ spatio-spectrally entangled photon modes.

            <p>A three-dimensional magneto-optical trap (MOT), as an efficient method of producing cold atoms from room-temperature atomic vapor, has been widely used to develop atomic sensors. Various compact MOTs using a single laser beam have been reported, simplifying apparatuses and leading to miniaturized devices. Here, we propose single-beam MOTs based on back-to-back pyramidal and conical mirrors. In such back-to-back mirrors, a MOT trapping volume is formed by an incident laser beam, a retroreflected beam, and multiple reflections from the mirror surfaces. We present the design of back-to-back mirrors and a series of compact MOT configurations, with the potential of increasing access to the MOT and simultaneously creating multiple MOTs. We demonstrate a MOT in a back-to-back conical mirror, loading 10 million rubidium-87 atoms from background vapor and cooling the atoms to 7 {\mu}K using polarization gradients. Single-beam MOTs based on back-to-back mirrors will contribute to building compact and scalable cold-atom-based sensors.</p>

            <h2>A c-theorem for the effective central charge in the R=1 replica limit, and applications to systems with measurement-induced randomness</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rushikesh A. Patil, Andreas W. W. Ludwig</p>
            <p>We present a general theorem demonstrating non-perturbatively the decrease of the "effective central charge" $c_{\text{eff}}=(d c/dR)|_{R=1}$ under renormalization group (RG) flow in the $R\rightarrow1$ replica limit of a $R$-copy $2D$ conformal field theory (CFT) action $S_{*}$ perturbed by a replica interaction of the form $$-\mathbb{S}=-\sum_{a=1}^{R}S_{*}^{(a)}+\Delta\int d^2 x \sum_{\substack{a,b=1\\ a\neq b}}^{R}\varphi^{(a)}(x)\varphi^{(b)}(x).$$ Here $\varphi$ is a scaling field belonging to the CFT with action $S_*$ and the coupling $\Delta$ is relevant in the RG sense. We show that the infrared value of $c_{\text{eff}}$ is always $\textit{less}$ than the central charge $c$ of the unperturbed CFT $S_{*}$. We refer to this result as the "$c$-effective theorem". As an application of this theorem, we consider replica field theories in the limit of $R \to 1$ replicas of the form above, shown by Nahum and Jacobsen [arXiv:2504.01264] to describe $2D$ classical monitored systems, where measurements introduce a form of quenched randomness via Bayes' theorem. Lastly, we discuss a possible relationship of our theorem with the effective central charge $c_{\text{eff}}^{(R\rightarrow0)}=(dc/dR)|_{R=0}$ for the above replica action in the different $R\rightarrow0$ replica limit, which is of relevance to systems with generic uncorrelated impurity-type quenched disorder, as opposed to measurements.</p>

            <h2>Spin-only dynamics of the multi-species nonreciprocal Dicke model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joseph Jachinowski, Peter B. Littlewood</p>
            <p>The Hepp-Lieb-Dicke model is ubiquitous in cavity quantum electrodynamics, describing spin-cavity coupling which does not conserve excitation number. Coupling the closed spin-cavity system to an environment realizes the open Dicke model, and by tuning the structure of the environment or the system-environment coupling, interesting spin-only models can be engineered. In this work, we focus on a variation of the multi-species open Dicke model which realizes mediated nonreciprocal interactions between the spin species and, consequently, an interesting dynamical limit-cycle phase. In particular, we improve upon adiabatic elimination and, instead, employ a Redfield master equation in order to describe the effective dynamics of the spin-only system. We assess this approach at the mean-field level, comparing it both to adiabatic elimination and the full spin-cavity model, and find that the predictions are sensitive to the presence of single-particle incoherent decay. Additionally, we clarify the symmetries of the model and explore the dynamical limit-cycle phase in the case of explicit parity-time-symmetry breaking, finding a region of phase coexistence terminating at an codimension-two exceptional point. Lastly, we go beyond mean-field theory by exact numerical diagonalization of the master equation, appealing to permutation symmetry in order to increase the size of accessible systems. We find signatures of phase transitions even for small system sizes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhe He, Yide Zhang, Xin Tong, Lei Li, Lihong V. Wang</p>
            <p>Entangled biphoton sources exhibit nonclassical characteristics and have been applied to imaging techniques such as ghost imaging, quantum holography, and quantum optical coherence tomography. The development of wide-field quantum imaging to date has been hindered by low spatial resolutions, speeds, and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs). Here, we present quantum microscopy by coincidence (QMC) with balanced pathlengths, which enables super-resolution imaging at the Heisenberg limit with substantially higher speeds and CNRs than existing wide-field quantum imaging methods. QMC benefits from a configuration with balanced pathlengths, where a pair of entangled photons traversing symmetric paths with balanced optical pathlengths in two arms behave like a single photon with half the wavelength, leading to 2-fold resolution improvement. Concurrently, QMC resists stray light up to 155 times stronger than classical signals. The low intensity and entanglement features of biphotons in QMC promise nondestructive bioimaging. QMC advances quantum imaging to the microscopic level with significant improvements in speed and CNR toward bioimaging of cancer cells. We experimentally and theoretically prove that the configuration with balanced pathlengths illuminates an avenue for quantum-enhanced coincidence imaging at the Heisenberg limit.</p>

            <p>In the current era of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) technology, quantum devices present new avenues for addressing complex, real-world challenges including potentially NP-hard optimization problems. Acknowledging the fact that quantum methods underperform classical solvers, the primary goal of our research is to demonstrate how to leverage quantum noise as a computational resource for optimization. This work aims to showcase how the inherent noise in NISQ devices can be leveraged to solve such real-world problems effectively. Utilizing a D-Wave quantum annealer and IonQ's gate-based NISQ computers, we generate and analyze solutions for managing train traffic under stochastic disturbances. Our case study focuses on the Baltimore Light RailLink, which embodies the characteristics of both tramway and railway networks. We explore the feasibility of using NISQ technology to model the stochastic nature of disruptions in these transportation systems. Our research marks the inaugural application of both quantum computing paradigms to tramway and railway rescheduling, highlighting the potential of quantum noise as a beneficial resource in complex optimization scenarios.</p>

            <p>We consider the computational model of IQP circuits (in which all computational steps are $X$ basis diagonal gates), supplemented by intermediate $X$ or $Z$ basis measurements. We show that if we allow non-adaptive or adaptive $X$ basis measurements, or allow non-adaptive $Z$ basis measurements, then the computational power remains the same as that of the original IQP model; and with adaptive $Z$ basis measurements the model becomes quantum universal. Furthermore we show that the computational model having circuits of only $CZ$ gates and adaptive $X$ basis measurements, with input states that are tensor products of 1-qubit states from the set $\{ |+\rangle, |1\rangle,\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle+i|1\rangle), \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle+e^{i\pi/4}|1\rangle) \} $, is quantum universal. In contrast to the relation of IQP to PH collapse, all our results here are manifestly stable under small additive implementational errors.</p>

            <p>Our work integrates an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) with the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) to optimize ansatz parameters in place of traditional gradient-based methods. We benchmark this Evolutionary-QAOA (E-QAOA) approach on the Max-Cut problem for $d$-3 regular graphs of 4 to 26 nodes, demonstrating equal or higher accuracy and reduced variance compared to COBYLA-based QAOA, especially when using Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) for fitness evaluations. Additionally, we propose a novel distributed multi-population EA strategy, executing parallel, independent populations on two quantum processing units (QPUs) with classical communication of 'elite' solutions. Experiments on quantum simulators and IBM hardware validate the approach. We also discuss potential extensions of our method and outline promising future directions in scalable, distributed quantum optimization on hybrid quantum-classical infrastructures.</p>

            <h2>Pseudoentanglement from tensor networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zihan Cheng, Xiaozhou Feng, Matteo Ippoliti</p>
            <p>Pseudoentangled states are defined by their ability to hide their entanglement structure: they are indistinguishable from random states to any observer with polynomial resources, yet can have much less entanglement than random states. Existing constructions of pseudoentanglement based on phase- and/or subset-states are limited in the entanglement structures they can hide: e.g., the states may have low entanglement on a single cut, on all cuts at once, or on local cuts in one dimension. Here we introduce new constructions of pseudoentangled states based on (pseudo)random tensor networks that affords much more flexibility in the achievable entanglement structures. We illustrate our construction with the simplest example of a matrix product state, realizable as a staircase circuit of pseudorandom unitary gates, which exhibits pseudo-area-law scaling of entanglement in one dimension. We then generalize our construction to arbitrary tensor network structures that admit an isometric realization. A notable application of this result is the construction of pseudoentangled `holographic' states whose entanglement entropy obeys a Ryu-Takayanagi `minimum-cut' formula, answering a question posed in [Aaronson et al., arXiv:2211.00747].</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anne Matthies, Nicolas Dannenfeld, Silvia Pappalardi, Achim Rosch</p>
            <p>We systematically investigate whether classical hydrodynamic field theories can predict the long-time dynamics of many-particle quantum systems. We study both numerically and analytically the time evolution of a chain of spins (or qubits) subjected to stroboscopic dynamics. The time evolution is implemented by a sequence of local and nearest-neighbor gates that conserve the total magnetization. The long-time dynamics of such a system is believed to be describable by a hydrodynamic field theory, which, importantly, includes the effect of noise. Based on a field theoretical analysis and symmetry arguments, we map each operator in the spin model to the corresponding fields in hydrodynamics. This allows us to predict which expectation values decay exponentially and which decay with a hydrodynamic long-time tail. We illustrate these findings by studying the time evolution of all 255 Hermitian operators that can be defined on four neighboring sites. All operators not protected by hydrodynamics decay exponentially, while the others show a slow hydrodynamic decay. While most hydrodynamic power laws seem to follow the analytical predictions, we also discuss cases where there is an apparent discrepancy between analytics and the finite-size numerical data.</p>

            <p>The realization of fault-tolerant quantum computers hinges on effective quantum error correction protocols, whose performance significantly relies on the nature of the underlying noise. In this work, we directly study the structure of non-Markovian correlated errors and their impact on surface code memory performance. Specifically, we compare surface code performance under non-Markovian noise and independent circuit-level noise, while keeping marginal error rates constant. Our analysis shows that while not all temporally correlated structures are detrimental, certain structures, particularly multi-time "streaky" correlations affecting syndrome qubits and two-qubit gates, can severely degrade logical error rate scaling. Furthermore, we discuss our results in the context of recent quantum error correction experiments on physical devices. These findings underscore the importance of understanding and mitigating non-Markovian noise toward achieving practical, fault-tolerant quantum computing.</p>

            <p>It is demonstrated that the Aharonov-Casher (AC) phase is a geometric phase that, in general, depends on the details of the closed path taken by a particle with a magnetic moment that is subject to an electric field. Consequently, it is not a topological phase. The proof of this statement is obtained by developing a counterexample that elucidates the dependence of the AC phase on the details of the path. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, in the particular example considered here, paths having an Abelian AC phase factor, also have an AC phase that is path-independent, whereas paths having a non-Abelian AC phase factor may have an AC phase that is path-dependent (i.e., not topological).</p>

            <p>An important challenge with the current generation of noisy, large-scale quantum computers is the question of validation. Does the hardware generate correct answers? If not, what are the errors? This issue is often combined with questions of computational advantage, but it is a fundamentally distinct issue. In current experiments, complete validation of the output statistics is generally not possible because it is exponentially hard to do so. Here, we apply phase-space simulation methods to partially verify recent experiments on Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) implementing photon-number resolving (PNR) detectors. The positive-P phase-space distribution is employed, as it uses probabilistic sampling to reduce complexity. It is \sim10^{18} times faster than direct classical simulation for experiments on 288 modes where quantum computational advantage is claimed. When combined with binning and marginalization to improve statistics, multiple validation tests are efficiently computable, of which some tests can be carried out on experimental data. We show that the data as a whole shows discrepancies with theoretical predictions for perfect squeezing. However, a small modification of the GBS parameters greatly improves agreement for some tests. We suggest that such validation tests could form the basis of feedback methods to improve GBS experiments.</p>

            <h2>Direct phase encoding in QAOA: Describing combinatorial optimization problems through binary decision variables</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Simon Garhofer, Oliver Bringmann</p>
            <p>The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and its derived variants are widely in use for approximating combinatorial optimization problem instances on gate-based Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers. Commonly, circuits required for QAOA are constructed by first reformulating a given problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem. It is then straightforward to synthesize a QAOA circuit from QUBO equations. In this work, we illustrate a more qubit-efficient circuit construction for combinatorial optimization problems by the example of the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP). Conventionally, the qubit encoding in QAOA for the TSP describes a tour using a sequence of nodes, where each node is written as a 1-hot binary vector. We propose to encode TSP tours by selecting edges included in the tour. Removing certain redundancies, the number of required qubits can be reduced by a linear factor compared to the aforementioned conventional encoding. We examined implementations of both QAOA encoding variants in terms of their approximation quality and runtime. Our experiments show that for small instances results are just as accurate using our proposed encoding, whereas the number of required classical optimizer iterations increases only slightly.</p>

            <p>Photonics represents one of the most promising approaches to large-scale quantum computation with millions of qubits and billions of gates, owing to the potential for room-temperature operation, high clock speeds, miniaturization of photonic circuits, and repeatable fabrication processes in commercial photonic foundries. We present an end-to-end architecture for fault-tolerant continuous variable (CV) quantum computation using only passive on-chip components that can produce photonic qubits above the fault tolerance threshold with probabilities above 90%, and encodes logical qubits using physical qubits sampled from a distribution around the fault tolerance threshold. By requiring only low photon number resolution, the architecture enables the use of high-bandwidth photodetectors in CV quantum computing. Simulations of our qubit generation and logical encoding processes show a Gaussian cluster squeezing threshold of 12 dB to 13 dB. Additionally, we present a novel magic state generation protocol which requires only 13 dB of cluster squeezing to produce magic states with an order of magnitude higher probability than existing approaches, opening up the path to universal fault-tolerant quantum computation at less than 13 dB of cluster squeezing.</p>

Our experimental results reveal that Regev's algorithm indeed outperforms Shor's algorithm for certain composite numbers in practice. However, we observed significant performance variations across different input values. Despite Regev's algorithm's theoretical asymptotic efficiency advantage, our implementation exhibited execution times longer than Shor's algorithm for small integer factorization in both quantum and classical components. These findings offer insights into the practical challenges and performance characteristics of implementing Regev's algorithm in realistic quantum computing scenarios.</p>

Using this nonequilibrium-physics approach, we certify the conditions under which the collision process of the model exhibits quantum traits, and we quantify the rate of energy exchanged by the quantum system by looking at the variance of the KDQ energy distributions. Finally, we propose an experimental test of our results on a superconducting quantum circuit implementing a qubit system, with microwave photons representing the environment particles.</p>

            <p>Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is one of the most promising candidates to achieve the quantum advantage in solving combinatorial optimization problems. The process of finding a good set of variational parameters in the QAOA circuit has proven to be challenging due to multiple factors, such as barren plateaus. As a result, there is growing interest in exploiting parameter transferability, where parameter sets optimized for one problem instance are transferred to another that could be more complex either to estimate the solution or to serve as a warm start for further optimization. But can we transfer parameters from one class of problems to another? Leveraging parameter sets learned from a well-studied class of problems could help navigate the less studied one, reducing optimization overhead and mitigating performance pitfalls. In this paper, we study whether pretrained QAOA parameters of MaxCut can be used as is or to warm start the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) circuits. Specifically, we design machine learning models to find good donor candidates optimized on MaxCut and apply their parameters to MIS acceptors. Our experimental results show that such parameter transfer can significantly reduce the number of optimization iterations required while achieving comparable approximation ratios.</p>

            <p>We derive a generalized quantum Langevin equation and its fluctuation-dissipation relation describing the quantum dynamics of a tagged particle interacting with a medium (environment), where both the particle and the environment are driven by an external time-dependent (e.g. oscillating) field. We specialize on the case of a charged tagged particle interacting with a bath of charged oscillators, under an external AC electric field, although the results are much more general and can be applied to any type of external time-dependent fields. We derive the corresponding quantum Langevin equation, which obeys a modified fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR) where the AC field plays an explicit role. The modified FDR is non-Markovian even if the undriven particle-bath system is Markovian without the external field. We provide an illustration of the usefulness of these results and derive a new form of the quantum Nyquist noise for the voltage fluctuations in electrical circuits under AC conditions (finite frequency), which is the most general since it also accounts for the response of the heat bath (e.g. lattice ions) to the applied AC electric field in the GHz-THz region, of relevance for 5G/6G wireless technologies. This generalized quantum fluctuation-dissipation relation for driven systems can also find other applications ranging from quantum noise in quantum optics to quantum computing with trapped ions.</p>

            <p>We study the collective decay of an initially inverted ensemble of two-level emitters in two distinct scenarios: when coupled to a squeezed photonic reservoir and when interacting with a one-dimensional waveguide. Using a quantum-state diffusion approach to unravel the emission process, we investigate entanglement and classical correlations along individual quantum trajectories over time. This numerical analysis shows that despite an initial build-up of entanglement and a significant amount of entanglement due to either spin squeezing or dark states at late times, the essential features of the superradiant burst are well described by averages over fully factorizable states. We explain this observation in terms of an almost complete factorization of all 2-local observables, which we identify as a generic property of superradiant decay. Based on this insight, we provide a purely classical theory for the burst in squeezed superradiance, which is both intuitive and exact for a large number of emitters. Moreover, we find that our numerical approach also performs well in the presence of subradiant states, which dominate the slow residual decay of non-uniform ensembles at late times.</p>

            <p>Quantum computers are an ideal platform to study the ground state properties of strongly correlated systems due to the limitation of classical computing techniques particularly for systems exhibiting quantum phase transitions. While the error rates of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers are still high, simulating strongly correlated systems on such devices and extracting information of possible phases may be within reach. The frustrated transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) is such a system with multiple ordered magnetic phases. In this study, we simulate a two-dimensional frustrated TFIM with next-nearest-neighbor spin-exchange interactions at zero temperature. The competition between the nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic and next-nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic coupling gives rise to frustration in the system. Moreover, the presence of quantum fluctuations makes the ground-state phase profile even richer. We use the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) to compute the phases on a square lattice with periodic boundary conditions for a system of 16 sites (qubits). The trained VQE circuits are compared to exact diagonalization, allowing us to extract error measures of VQE. We focus on the ground-state phase transitions of this model, where VQE succeeds in finding the dominant magnetic phases. The optimized VQE circuits are then executed on the Quantinuum H1-1 trapped-ion quantum computer without using any error mitigation techniques. Our experiments show near perfect recovery of the magnetic phases of the frustrated model through ground-state energy, the energy derivative, and the spin correlation functions. Thus, we show that the trapped-ion quantum processor is able to achieve reliable simulations of a strongly correlated system within the limitations of the VQE approach.</p>

            <p>Waveguide quantum electrodynamics (wQED) with underlying collective and long-range atom-atom interactions has led to many distinct dynamical phenomena, including modified collective radiations and intriguing quantum correlations. It stands out as a unique platform to illustrate correlated photon transport, as well as to promise applications in quantum information processing. Here we manifest a fast and high atomic excitation transport by employing two well-separated chirally-coupled atomic arrays. This enhanced waveguide-mediated transport of excitations emerges due to the dominance of spectrally isolated and right-localized right eigenstates in the system's dynamics. Contrary to the instinct of applying the cascaded systems with unidirectional couplings to expedite direct and high excitation transport, the optimal system configurations in open wQED systems demand slight or finite nonreciprocal decay channels to facilitate energy transport by exploiting waveguide-mediated couplings.

            <h2>The effect of partial post-selection on quantum discrimination</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qipeng Qian, Christos N. Gagatsos</p>
            <p>The discrimination of quantum states is a central problem in quantum information science and technology. Meanwhile, partial post-selection has emerged as a valuable tool for quantum state engineering. In this work, we bring these two areas together and ask whether partial measurements can enhance the discrimination performance between two unknown and non-orthogonal pure states. Our framework is general: the two unknown states interact with the same environment-set in a pure state-via an arbitrary unitary transformation. A partial measurement is then performed on one of the output modes, modeled by an arbitrary positive operator-valued measure (POVM). We then allow classical communication to inform the unmeasured mode of the outcome of the partial measurement on the other mode, which is subsequently measured by a POVM that is optimal in the sense that the probability of error is minimized. The two POVMs act locally, but since we allow for classical communication between the two modes, we consider a scheme involving local operations and classical communication (LOCC). Under these considerations, we show that the minimum error probability, averaged over all possible post-selected branches, cannot be reduced below the minimum error probability of discriminating the original input states. In other words, prior state engineering via partial measurement does not improve the average discrimination performance. However, we also identify specific post-selection outcomes under which the conditional discrimination can achieve strictly lower error probabilities than the original optimal measurement, illustrating that while post-selection does not improve average performance, it can enable better discrimination in certain branches of the post-selected ensemble.</p>

            <h2>Enhancing photon-axion conversion probability with squeezed coherent states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Taiki Ikeda, Sugumi Kanno, Jiro Soda</p>
            <p>In particle physics, axions and axion-like particles are ubiquitous. Remarkably, ultra-light axions could constitute dark matter or dark energy. Therefore, it is important to detect axions experimentally. In the presence of a magnetic field, a photon can be converted into an axion, and vice versa. Utilizing the conversion phenomenon, several methods for detecting axions have been proposed. To improve detectability, it is desirable to use quantum sensing. However, since the conversion process is usually treated as classical wave dynamics, it is unclear how to incorporate quantum effects such as entanglement. In this work, we formulate the photon-axion conversion in a quantum field theoretical manner. As a result, we succeed in evaluating the conversion probability from a photon quantum state to an axion quantum state. In particular, it turns out that squeezed coherent states can enhance the conversion probability.</p>

            <h2>Robust Control of High-dimensional Quantum Systems against Coherent and Incoherent Errors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yidian Fan, Re-Bing Wu</p>
            <p>Toward scalable quantum computing, the control of quantum systems needs to be robust against both coherent errors induced by parametric uncertainties and incoherent errors induced by environmental decoherence. This poses significant challenges for high-dimensional systems due to the computational intensity involved in the control design process. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework to improve the design efficiency. By employing the Taylor series expansion of uncertain parameters, the problem of robust control for an uncertain quantum system is reformulated as the optimal control problem of an augmented deterministic system. The Suzuki-Trotter expansion is then applied to accelerate the calculation of the system dynamics. Numerical simulations of quantum state preparation and quantum gate synthesis demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can successfully identify robust solutions in multi-qubit systems. The enhanced efficiency effectively extends the feasibility of high-order robust control for realistic high-dimensional quantum systems with multiple error sources.</p>

            <h2>Observing High-dimensional Bell Inequality Violations using Multi-Outcome Spectral Measurements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kiki Dekkers, Laura Serino, Nicola DAlessandro, Abhinandan Bhattacharjee, Benjamin Brecht, Armin Tavakoli, Christine Silberhorn, Jonathan Leach</p>
            <p>Violation of Bell inequalities is an essential requirement for many quantum information and communication protocols. In high-dimensional systems, Bell inequality tests face the challenge of implementing genuinely multi-outcome measurements, since the emulation of these with separate dichotomic projections opens a binarisation loophole that local hidden variable theories can exploit. Here we show that the joint spectral intensity of a two-photon entangled state contains access to the necessary multi-outcome measurements to overcome this obstacle and certify and violate a Bell inequality for high-dimensional states. This result is contrary to the belief that the joint spectral intensity is a phase-insensitive quantity and does not have sufficient information to certify entanglement or Bell-nonlocality. Using this approach, we violate the CGLMP Bell inequality up to dimension d = 8, all with negligible p-values, and for the first time close the binarisation loophole in high-dimensional Bell experiments. Guaranteeing Bell-nonlocal correlations using frequency-only measurements removes the technological hurdle of measurements in the temporal domain, thus greatly simplifying any practical implementation of future high-dimensional quantum information protocols.</p>

            <h2>Generalized tensor transforms and their applications in classical and quantum computing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alok Shukla, Prakash Vedula</p>
            <p>We introduce a novel framework for Generalized Tensor Transforms (GTTs), constructed through an $n$-fold tensor product of an arbitrary $b \times b$ unitary matrix $W$. This construction generalizes many established transforms, by providing a adaptable set of orthonormal basis functions. Our proposed fast classical algorithm for GTT achieves an exponentially lower complexity of $O(N \log_b N)$ in comparison to a naive classical implementation that has an associated computational cost of $O(N^2)$. For quantum applications, our GTT-based algorithm, implemented in the natural spectral ordering, achieves both gate complexity and circuit depth of $O(\log_b N)$, where $N = b^n$ denotes the length of the input vector. This represents a quadratic improvement over Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), which requires $O((\log_b N)^2)$ gates and depth for $n$ qudits, and an exponential advantage over classical Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) based and Fast Walsh-Hadamard Transform (FWHT) based methods, which incur a computational cost of $O(N \log_b N)$. We explore diverse applications of GTTs in quantum computing, including quantum state compression and transmission, function encoding and quantum digital signal processing. The proposed framework provides fine-grained control of the transformation through the adjustable parameters of the base matrix $W$. This versatility allows precise shaping of each basis function while preserving their effective Walsh-type structure, thus tailoring basis representations to specific quantum data and computational tasks. Our numerical results demonstrate that GTTs enable improved performance in quantum state compression and function encoding compared to fixed transforms (such as FWHT or FFT), achieving higher fidelities with fewer retained components. We also provided novel classical and quantum digital signal filtering algorithms based on our GTT framework.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kazufumi Tanji, Hikaru Shimizu, Masahiro Takeoka</p>
            <p>Entanglement generation between distant nodes is a fundamental process in distributed quantum information processing. Qudits, high-dimensional quantum states, are promising candidates for enhancing entanglement distribution capabilities. However, the success probability of qudit entanglement distribution using Bell measurements is typically lower than that of conventional qubit-based protocols. In this paper, we propose a novel entanglement swapping protocol specifically designed for qutrits (three-dimensional quantum states). Our protocol employs photon-number encoding combined with an additional mode basis, such as polarization, effectively increasing the success probability. We show that the proposed qutrit protocol can achieve higher entanglement generation rates compared to conventional two-photon detection-based qubit protocols, especially under conditions of limited photon generation probability. Furthermore, we evaluate our protocol under realistic experimental imperfections, including photon loss and threshold detection, and show that it achieves high fidelity with probabilistic photon sources.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luís Felipe Gonçalves, Teng Zhang, Georg Raithel, David A. Anderson</p>
            <p>Rydberg sensors offer a unique approach to radio frequency (RF) detection, leveraging the high sensitivity and quantum properties of highly-excited atomic states to achieve performance levels beyond classical technologies. Non-linear responses and distortion behavior in Rydberg atom receivers are critical to evaluating and establishing performance metrics and capabilities such as spur-free dynamic range and tolerance to unwanted interfering signals. We report here on the measurement and characterization of non-linear behavior and spurious response of a Rydberg atomic heterodyne receiver. Single-tone and two-tone testing procedures are developed and implemented for measurement of harmonic and inter-modulation distortion in Rydberg atomic receivers based on multi-photon Rydberg spectroscopy and radio-frequency heterodyne signal detection and demodulation in an atomic vapor. For a predetermined set of atomic receiver parameters and RF carrier wave in the SHF band near-resonant to a cesium Rydberg transition, we measure and characterize atomic receiver selectivity, bandwidth, roll-off, compression point (P1dB), second-order (IP2) and third-order (IP3) intercepts, and spur-free dynamic range. Receiver intermodulation distortion is characterized for the case of an interfering signal wave applied at two frequency offsets relative to the near-resonant reference local oscillator, $\Delta F/F= 10^{-4}$ at 6dB and $10^{-6}$ at 22dB single-tone bandwidths, respectively. We observe that under suitable operating conditions the atomic receiver can exhibit a suppression of harmonic and inter-modulation distortion relative to that of classical receiver mixer amplifiers. Finally, we describe how the non-linear behaviors of atomic receivers can provide unique, controllable RF signatures inaccessible by classical counterparts and propose their use to realize secure communication modalities and applications.</p>

            <h2>Optically Switchable Fluorescence Enhancement at Critical Interparticle Distances</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arda Gulucu, Emre Ozan Polat</p>
            <p>Plasmonic nanostructures provide electric field localization to be used as a fluorescence enhancement tool for the closely located fluorophores. However, metallic structures exhibit non-radiative energy transfer at close proximity, which suppresses the boost in the photoluminescence spectrum due to inhomogeneous medium. Compensation to non-radiative losses is fundamentally restricted, therefore defining the critical interparticle distances, where the fluorescence enhancement is detectable hold utmost importance for device applications. In this work, we numerically identified the critical interparticle distances of a metal nanoparticle (MNP) and quantum emitters (QEs) with angstrom resolution by analyzing the interplay between quantum yield and non-radiative decay. By engaging a collimated light application on silver nanoparticle (AgNP) placed at a critical distance, we simulated an active fluorescence enhancement switch yielding observable 7-fold increase in fluorescence intensity. The provided free space simulation includes the complete response of AgNP with retardation and higher order multi-polar effects for which the previous analytical works fall short. While the model bridges the absorption and emission spectra via corresponding Stokes shift values and presents a general approach for the interaction of QEs and MNPs in Rayleigh regime, it can be extended to Mie regime for larger QEs and can be modified for dielectric device environment.</p>

            <p>Local integrals of motion (LIOMs) play a key role in understanding the long-time properties of closed macroscopic systems. They were found for selected integrable systems via complex analytical calculations. The existence of LIOMs and their structure can also be studied via numerical methods, which, however, involve exact diagonalization of Hamiltonians, posing a bottleneck for such studies. We show that finding LIOMs in translationally invariant lattice models or unitary quantum circuits can be reduced to a problem for which one may numerically find an exact solution in the thermodynamic limit. We develop a simple algorithm and demonstrate its efficiency by calculating LIOMs and bounds on correlations (the Mazur bounds) for infinite integrable spin chains and unitary circuits. Finally, we demonstrate that this approach identifies slow modes in nearly integrable spin models and estimates their relaxation times.</p>

Interestingly, we find different attention heads in the NQS ansatz can directly encode correlations at different scales, making it capable of capturing long-range correlations and entanglements in strongly correlated systems. With these advances, we establish the half-filled stripe in the ground state of 2D Hubbard model with the next nearest neighboring hoppings, consistent with experimental observations in cuprates. Our work establishes NQS as a powerful tool for solving challenging many-fermions systems.</p>

            <p>Waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED) provides a powerful framework for engineering quantum interactions, traditionally relying on periodic photonic arrays with continuous energy bands. Here, we investigate waveguide QED in a fundamentally different environment: A one-dimensional photonic array whose hopping strengths are structured aperiodically according to the deterministic Fibonacci-Lucas substitution rule. These "Fibonacci waveguides" lack translational invariance and are characterized by a singular continuous energy spectrum and critical eigenstates, representing a deterministic intermediate between ordered and disordered systems. We demonstrate how to achieve decoherence-free, coherent interactions in this unique setting. We analyze two paradigmatic cases: (i) Giant emitters resonantly coupled to the simplest aperiodic version of a standard waveguide. For these, we show that atom photon bound states form only for specific coupling configurations dictated by the aperiodic sequence, leading to an effective atomic Hamiltonian, which itself inherits the Fibonacci structure; and (ii) emitters locally and off-resonantly coupled to the aperiodic version of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger waveguide. In this case the mediating bound states feature aperiodically modulated profiles, resulting in an effective Hamiltonian with multifractal properties. Our work establishes Fibonacci waveguides as a versatile platform, which is experimentally feasible, demonstrating that the deterministic complexity of aperiodic structures can be directly engineered into the interactions between quantum emitters.</p>

Quantum sensing and metrology is an emerging field that lies at the cross-roads of quantum physics, quantum technology, and the discipline in which the parameter estimation is to be performed.

The current review hopes to bring together the concepts related to quantum sensing as realized in ensemble systems, like spin ensembles, light-matter systems, and Bose-Einstein condensates, and lattice systems, like those which can be modelled by the Bose- and Fermi-Hubbard models, and quantum spin models.</p>

Here, we demonstrate controlled couplinag of a single negatively charged tin vacancy center hosted in a nanodiamond to a fully tunable Fabry-Perot microcavity. At cryogenic temperatures, we access the weak coupling regime and observe a transition from the bad-emitter to the bad-cavity regime as the optical transition of the color center narrows. At 4 K, a Purcell factor exceeding 1.7 is measured, confirming cavity-enhanced emission. The obtained results demonstrate the potential of SnV$^{-}$ centers in nanodiamonds as a coherent single-photon source for quantum networks.</p>

            <p>Quantum imaging with undetected photons (QIUP) is a promising technique for non-invasive imaging, particularly at wavelengths where detectors are inefficient or unavailable. Recent studies have investigated the role of polarization in QIUP schemes. In this work, we examine whether post-generation optical elements can recover interference when the signal photons are distinguishable in polarization at the source. Specifically, we employ a Mach-Zehnder interferometer after the photon pairs are generated from two nonlinear crystals. Our results indicate that polarization distinguishability at the time of generation leads to a loss of interference that cannot be restored by post-generation optical arrangements. This highlights the fundamental importance of indistinguishability at the source for maintaining coherence in QIUP systems.</p>

Near the mobility edge, critical states exhibit unexpectedly strong correlations between sites that share similar local structures, regardless of their spatial separation. Remarkably, by tuning the mobility edge across the Fermi level, one can induce both adiabatic transport and abrupt switching of entanglement between distant sites. These results highlight the potential of aperiodic structures for controlling nonlocal quantum correlations, opening new avenues for entanglement-based applications in quasiperiodic systems.</p>

            <p>In conventional photon blockade, the occupation of a cavity mode by more than one photon is suppressed via strong optical nonlinearity. An alternative, called unconventional photon blockade, can occur under weak nonlinearity by relying on quantum interference between fine-tuned cavities. A serious limitation is the very short antibunching time window, orders of magnitude less than the cavity lifetime. We present a method to achieve photon blockade over a large time window of several cavity lifetimes, even exceeding that of conventional photon blockade, while still requiring only weak nonlinearity. This ``long-lived photon blockade'' (LLPB) occurs when the single-photon Green's function exhibits a zero at a large cavity loss rate, which is satisfied by an exemplary configuration of four coupled cavities under weak driving. Our analytical results agree well with wavefunction Monte Carlo simulations. The LLPB phenomenon may aid the development of single-photon sources utilizing materials with weak optical nonlinearities.</p>

            <p>Light-matter interactions underpin the quantum technologies from quantum information processing to quantum sensing. When the coupling strength of light-matter interactions approaches the resonance frequencies of light and matter - the ultrastrong coupling regime - antiresonant (counter-rotating) processes, in which a photon and a matter excitation are simultaneously created or annihilated, induce non-negligible ground-state quantum entanglement between light and matter. Ultrastrong coupling thus provides a robust platform for noise-tolerant quantum entanglement, essential for reliable quantum technologies. However, the diamagnetic term typically counteracts antiresonant interactions, inhibiting intriguing phenomena such as thermal equibilium superradiant phase transitions. Here, we present an on-chip platform consisting of a superconducting resonator and thin ferromagnetic films achieving ultrastrong magnon-photon coupling system (magnon polaritons) via collective magnetic-dipole interactions, significantly circumventing the diamagnetic term. We experimentally demonstrate a pronounced Bloch-Siegert shift of about 60 MHz - direct evidence of antiresonant interactions - and observe cooperative enhancement of the effective coupling strength through increasing the number of remote magnon elements coupling with one photon mode. This scalable platform facilitates exploration of exotic quantum phenomena driven by antiresonant interactions, bridging spintronics and quantum optics, and enabling noise-tolerant quantum technological applications.</p>

            <p>Neural-network quantum states (NQS) offer a powerful and expressive ansatz for representing quantum many-body wave functions. However, their training via Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) methods remains challenging. It is well known that some scenarios - such as sharply peaked wave functions emerging in quantum chemistry - lead to high-variance gradient estimators hindering the effectiveness of variational optimizations. In this work we investigate a systematic strategy to tackle those sampling issues by means of adaptively tuned importance sampling. Our approach is explicitly designed to (i) target the gradient estimator instead of the loss function, (ii) not introduce additional hyperparameters and (iii) be computationally inexpensive. We benchmarked our approach across the ground-state search of a wide variety of hamiltonians, including frustrated spin systems and ab-initio quantum chemistry. We also show systematic improvements on the infidelity minimization in the context of neural projected quantum dynamics. Overall, our approach can reduce the computational cost of vanilla VMC considerably, up to a factor of 100x when targeting highly peaked quantum chemistry wavefunctions.</p>

In particular, we show that a conditional elastic phase shift between counter-propagating photons arises from the interplay between direction-dependent couplings, engineered through an interplay of non local interactions and molecular binding strength; and the nonlinearity of the transmon array. We analyze the conditions under which a maximal $\pi$-phase shift -- and hence a CZ gate -- is obtained, and characterize the gate fidelity as a function of key experimental parameters, including finite transmon nonlinearities, emitter spectral inhomogeneities, and limited cooperativity.

            <p>This study presents a theoretical investigation of magnomechanically induced transparency, Fano resonance, and slow/fast light phenomena within a hybrid optomagnomechanical system. The system consists of a mechanical membrane within a cavity and a ferrimagnetic crystal with a magnon squeezing mode that couples directly to a microwave cavity mode through magnetic dipole interaction and indirectly to an optical cavity through the crystal's deformation displacement. The optical cavity is influenced by the mechanical displacement, which is driven by magnetostrictive forces through radiation pressure. The interactions among photon, phonons, magnons, and microwave within the cavity give rise to optomechanically induced transparency (OMIT), magnomechanically induced transparency (MMIT) and magnon-induced transparency (MIT). We analyze how the presence of magnon squeezing modifies the absorption and dispersion properties of the optical spectrum. Additionally, the emergence of Fano resonance via photon-phonon coupling in the presence of the magnon squeezing is examined. By tuning the microwave-magnon interactions and the magnon squeezing parameters, we enhance slow/light effects.

In this work we present a quantum computational approach that utilises the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) and variations thereof to overcome these limitations. We explore a number of methods, including the use of number projection operators and simultaneous optimisation. We demonstrate the feasibility of our method on a model problem of electron scattering from the hydrogen molecule. We recover the full spectrum of the Hamiltonian within a chosen symmetry sector. Moreover, the optimal circuit parameters directly encode the R-matrix boundary amplitudes needed for subsequent scattering computations.</p>

            <h2>Theory Framework of Multiplexed Photon-Number-Resolving Detectors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaobin Zhao, Hezheng Qin, Hong X. Tang, Linran Fan, Quntao Zhuang</p>
            <p>Photon counting is a fundamental component in quantum optics and quantum information. However, implementing ideal photon-number-resolving (PNR) detectors remains experimentally challenging. Multiplexed PNR detection offers a scalable and practical alternative by distributing photons across multiple modes and detecting their presence using simple ON-OFF detectors, thereby enabling approximate photon-number resolution. In this work, we establish a theoretical model for such detectors and prove that the estimation error in terms of photon number moments decreases inverse proportionally to the number of detectors. Thanks to the enhanced PNR capability, multiplexed PNR detector provides an advantage in cat-state breeding protocols. Assuming a two-photon subtraction case, 7dB of squeezing, and an array of 20 detectors of efficiency 95%, our calculation predicts fidelity ~ 0.88 with a success probability ~ 3.8%, representing orders-of-magnitude improvement over previous works. Similar enhancement also extends to cat-state generation with the generalized photon number subtraction. With experimentally feasible parameters, our results suggest that megahertz-rate cat-state generation is achievable using an on-chip array of tens of ON-OFF detectors.</p>

            <h2>Noise-Canceling Quantum Feedback: non-Hermitian Dynamics with Applications to State Preparation and Magic State Distillation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tathagata Karmakar, Philippe Lewalle, Yipei Zhang, K. Birgitta Whaley</p>
            <p>Time-continuous quantum measurement allows for the tracking of a quantum system in real time via sequences of short, and individually weak, measurement intervals. Such measurements are necessarily invasive, imparting backaction to the system, and allowing the observer to update their state estimate based on stochastic measurement outcomes. Feedback control then involves real-time interventions by an observer, conditioned on the time-continuous measurement signal that they receive. We here consider diffusive quantum trajectories, and focus on the "noise-canceling" subset of feedback protocols that aim to minimize the degree of stochasticity in the dynamics. We derive such a class of feedback operations, showing that under the idealized assumptions of pure states, unit measurement efficiency, and zero time-delay in implementing feedback operations, perfectly noise-canceling feedback always exists. We consider the resulting noise-canceled dynamics generated by an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian; while non-Hermitian Hamiltonians from continuous monitoring generally describe rare dynamics (accessible by costly post-selection), the use of noise-canceling feedback here leads to non-Hermitian dynamics that occur deterministically. We demonstrate this via examples of entangled state preparation and stabilization. We then illustrate the potential for the application of noise-cancellation to boost success rates in magic state distillation protocols. We show that adding feedback based on noise-cancellation into a time-continuous 5-to-1 distillation protocol leads to higher probabilities of successful distillation across a range of input errors, and extends the threshold on input errors for which the protocol is effective. Our results highlight the efficacy of noise-canceling feedback-aided protocols for quantum state preparation and stabilization tasks.</p>

            <p>We report the first experimental demonstration of squeezed lasing in a reservoir-engineered optical parametric oscillator (OPO). The OPO provides a basis of squeezed states and parametric amplification in lasing emission, whose vacuum reservoir is coupled to a squeezed vacuum generated by a second OPO. With a precisely controlled squeezing angle and strong squeezing injection, the parametric interaction in the first OPO is exponentially enhanced. It successfully circumvents the decoherence in the system, and eliminates the undesired noise of spontaneous photon emission in the OPO. As a result, the amplified parametric process simultaneously reserves the coherence and quantum properties in the first OPO, and yields a -6.1 dB squeezed laser in optical domain with a narrow linewidth and high brightness. Our work sheds light on potential applications of squeezed lasing in quantum metrology and quantum optics.</p>

            <p>Light-matter interactions underpin the quantum technologies from quantum information processing to quantum sensing. When the coupling strength of light-matter interactions approaches the resonance frequencies of light and matter - the ultrastrong coupling regime - antiresonant (counter-rotating) processes, in which a photon and a matter excitation are simultaneously created or annihilated, induce non-negligible ground-state quantum entanglement between light and matter. Ultrastrong coupling thus provides a robust platform for noise-tolerant quantum entanglement, essential for reliable quantum technologies. However, the diamagnetic term typically counteracts antiresonant interactions, inhibiting intriguing phenomena such as thermal equibilium superradiant phase this http URL, we present an on-chip platform consisting of a superconducting resonator and thin ferromagnetic films achieving ultrastrong magnon-photon coupling system (magnon polaritons) via collective magnetic-dipole interactions, significantly circumventing the diamagnetic term. We experimentally demonstrate a pronounced Bloch-Siegert shift of about 60 MHz - direct evidence of antiresonant interactions - and observe cooperative enhancement of the effective coupling strength through increasing the number of remote magnon elements coupling with one photon mode. This scalable platform facilitates exploration of exotic quantum phenomena driven by antiresonant interactions, bridging spintronics and quantum optics, and enabling noise-tolerant quantum technological applications.</p>

            <h2>Quantum computational advantage of noisy boson sampling with partially distinguishable photons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Byeongseon Go, Changhun Oh, Hyunseok Jeong</p>
            <p>Boson sampling stands out as a promising approach toward experimental demonstration of quantum computational advantage. However, the presence of physical noise in near-term experiments hinders the realization of the quantum computational advantage with boson sampling. Since physical noise in near-term boson sampling devices is inevitable, precise characterization of the boundary of noise rates where the classical intractability of boson sampling is maintained is crucial for quantum computational advantage using near-term devices. In this work, we identify the level of partial distinguishability noise that upholds the classical intractability of boson sampling. We find that boson sampling with on average $O(\log N)$ number of distinguishable photons out of $N$ input photons maintains the equivalent complexity to the ideal boson sampling case. By providing strong complexity theoretical evidence for the classical intractability of noisy boson sampling, we expect that our findings will ultimately facilitate the demonstration of quantum computational advantage with noisy boson sampling experiments in the near future.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiyang He, Vinod Vaikuntanathan, Adam Wills, Rachel Yun Zhang</p>
            <p>The development of quantum codes with good error correction parameters and useful sets of transversal gates is a problem of major interest in quantum error-correction. Abundant prior works have studied transversal gates which are restricted to acting on all logical qubits simultaneously. In this work, we study codes that support transversal gates which induce $\textit{addressable}$ logical gates, i.e., the logical gates act on logical qubits of our choice. As we consider scaling to high-rate codes, the study and design of low-overhead, addressable logical operations presents an important problem for both theoretical and practical purposes. Our primary result is the construction of an explicit qubit code for which $\textit{any}$ triple of logical qubits across one, two, or three codeblocks can be addressed with a logical $\mathsf{CCZ}$ gate via a depth-one circuit of physical $\mathsf{CCZ}$ gates, and whose parameters are asymptotically good, up to polylogarithmic factors. The result naturally generalizes to other gates including the $\mathsf{C}^{\ell} Z$ gates for $\ell \neq 2$. Going beyond this, we develop a formalism for constructing quantum codes with $\textit{addressable and transversal}$ gates. Our framework, called $\textit{addressable orthogonality}$, encompasses the original triorthogonality framework of Bravyi and Haah (Phys. Rev. A 2012), and extends this and other frameworks to study addressable gates. We demonstrate the power of this framework with the construction of an asymptotically good qubit code for which $\textit{pre-designed}$, pairwise disjoint triples of logical qubits within a single codeblock may be addressed with a logical $\mathsf{CCZ}$ gate via a physical depth-one circuit of $\mathsf{Z}$, $\mathsf{CZ}$ and $\mathsf{CCZ}$ gates. In an appendix, we show that our framework extends to addressable and transversal $T$ gates, up to Clifford corrections.</p>

            <p>We investigate the possibility of engineering dissipatively long-range order that is robust against heating in strongly interacting fermionic systems, relevant for atoms in cavity QED. It was previously shown [Tindall et al. this http URL. 123, 030603 (2019)] that it is possible to stabilize long-range order in a Hubbard model by exploiting a dissipative mechanism in the Lindblad limit, this latter being valid for spectrally unstructured baths. Here, we first show that this mechanism still holds when including additional spin-exchange interactions in the model, that is for the tUJ model. Moreover, by means of a Redfield approach that goes beyond the Lindblad case, we show how the stability of the engineered state depends crucially on properties of the bath spectral density and discuss the feasibility of those properties in an experiment.</p>

Approximating arbitrary potentials in the Schrödinger equation as multistep potentials allows us to determine the reflection coefficient by means of a Riccati equation.

We study the associated QR rate in the context of Casimir--Polder atom surface interactions, revealing its strong dependence on critical parameters such as velocity and interaction duration.

            <p>Understanding multi-photon interactions in non-equilibrium quantum systems is an outstanding challenge in quantum optics. In this work, we develop an analytical and diagrammatic framework to explore three-photon interactions in atomic ensembles weakly coupled to a one-dimensional waveguide. Taking advantage of the weak coupling, we use our diagrammatic framework to perform perturbation theory and calculate the leading-order contributions to the three-photon wavefunction, which would otherwise be intractable. We then compute the outgoing photon wavefunction of a resonantly driven atomic ensemble, with photon-photon interactions truncated up to three photons. Our formulation not only captures the individual transmission of photons but also isolates the connected S-matrix elements that embody genuine photon-photon correlations. Through detailed analysis, we obtain the analytic expressions of the connected third-order correlation function and the third-order electric-field-quadrature cumulant, which reveal non-Gaussian signatures emerging from the interplay of two- and three-photon processes. We also calculate the optical depth where non-Gaussian photon states can be observed. Numerical simulations based on a cascaded master equation validate our analytical predictions on a small-scale system. These results provide a formalism to further explore non-equilibrium quantum optics in atomic ensembles and extend this to the regime of non-Gaussian photon transport.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate an experimentally feasible circuit-QED Bose-Hubbard simulator that reproduces the complex spin dynamics of Heisenberg models. Our method relies on mapping spin-1/2 systems onto bosonic states via the polynomially expanded Holstein-Primakoff (HP) transformation. The HP transformation translates the intricate behavior of spins into a representation that is compatible with bosonic devices like those in a circuit QED setup. For comparison, we also implement the Dyson-Maleev (DM) encoding for spin-1/2 and show that, in this limit, DM and HP are equivalent. We show the equivalence of the DM and the HP transformations for spin-1/2 systems. Rigorous numerical analyses confirm the effectiveness of our HP-based protocol. Specifically, we obtain the concurrence between the spin dynamics and the behavior of microwave photons within our circuit QED-based analog simulator that is designed for the Bose-Hubbard model. By utilizing the microwave photons inherent to circuit QED devices, our framework presents an accessible, scalable avenue for probing quantum spin dynamics in an experimentally viable setting.</p>

For single-photon sources, we consider two special cases: (1) two excited two-level atoms and (2) two atom-cavity setups with initially present single photons in both cavities. For both cases, we report analytic results as well as quantum jump-based Monte Carlo simulations to demonstrate the signatures of these single-photon sources on the HOME under different working conditions (for example, strong- and weak-coupling regimes of cavity quantum electrodynamics). Our results may have interesting applications in linear optics quantum computing as well as in protocols that test the indistinguishability of single-photon sources.</p>

            <p>Unlike classical algorithms, where second quantization is ubiquitous, the nature of quantum computers enables both the first- and second-quantized representations to be on somewhat equal footing. While quantum algorithms of both quantizations provide advantages over classical algorithms for ground state calculation and time-evolution, they face distinct limitations and inefficiencies in addressing real-world molecular and material simulation problems. As an example, the first-quantized representation is unsuitable for calculating electron non-conserving properties, such as dynamic correlations. Conversely, the ground-state molecular orbital wavefunction efficiently prepared in the second quantization may benefit from efficient first-quantized measurement circuits. In light of this, we propose a hybrid quantization scheme for electronic simulations that employs a conversion circuit to switch efficiently between the two quantizations, achieving a gate cost of $\mathcal{O}(N\log N \log M)$ and requiring $\mathcal{O}(N \log M)$ qubits for a system of $N$ electrons and $M$ orbitals. This way, plane-wave Hamiltonian simulations can be done efficiently in the first-quantization before converting to the second quantization to apply electron non-conserving operations.

            <p>The precise control of light-matter interaction serves as a cornerstone for diverse quantum technologies, spanning from quantum computing to advanced atom optics. Typical experiments often feature multi-mode fields and require atoms with intricate internal structures to facilitate e.g., multi-photon interactions or cooling. Moreover, the development of high-precision cold-atom sensors necessitates the use of entangled atoms. We introduce a rigorous, second-quantized framework for describing multi-$\Lambda$-atoms in a cavity, encompassing their center-of-mass motion and interaction with a two-mode electromagnetic field. A key feature of our approach is the systematic application of a Hamiltonian averaging theory to the atomic field operators, enabling the derivation of a compact and physically insightful effective Hamiltonian governing the system's time evolution. This effective Hamiltonian not only incorporates the AC-Stark and Bloch-Siegert shifts, augmented by contributions from all involved ancillary states, but also includes effects from counter-rotating terms, offering a more complete description than conventional RWA-based models. A significant finding is the emergence of a particle-particle interaction mediated by ancillary states, stemming directly from the combined quantum nature of the coupled electromagnetic field and atomic system. We illustrate the practical implications of our model through an analysis of atomic Raman diffraction, determining the time evolution for a typical initial state and demonstrating the resulting Rabi oscillations. Furthermore, our results confirm that both the atomic and optical Hong-Ou-Mandel effect can be observed within this Raman configuration, utilizing a specific two-particle input state, thereby extending the utility of Raman diffraction for quantum interference phenomena and providing a microscopic model of the effect.</p>

            <p>Resonance fluorescence of natural or artificial atoms constitutes a prime method for generating non-classical light. While most efforts have focused on producing single-photons, multi-photon emission is unavoidably present in the resonant driving of an atom. Here, we study the extent to which these processes occur: we quantify the multi-photon emission statistics in a resonantly-driven two-level artificial atom -- a semiconductor quantum dot in a micropillar cavity -- when pumped by short optical pulses. By measuring auto-correlation functions up to the fourth order, we observe up to four photons emitted after a single pumping pulse, and investigate the emission dynamics with finely resolved temporal measurements. Furthermore, we propose a method based on acquisition time gating to enhance the purity of a single-photon source while maintaining high efficiencies. Our results deepen the understanding of the photon emission processes in coherently driven atomic systems, and suggest a simple but effective technique to reduce the multi-photon components of a single-photon source.</p>

            <p>Understanding the Lie algebraic structure of a physical problem often makes it easier to find its solution. In this paper, we focus on the Lie algebra of Gaussian-conserving superoperators. We construct a Lie algebra of $n$-mode states, $\mathfrak{go}(n)$, composed of all superoperators conserving Gaussianity, and we find it isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^{2n^2+3n}\oplus_{\mathrm{S}}\mathfrak{gl}(2n,\mathbb{R})$. This allows us to solve the quadratic-order Redfield equation for any, even non-Gaussian, state. We find that the algebraic structure of Gaussian operations is the same as that of super-Poincaré algebra in three-dimensional spacetime, where the CPTP condition corresponds to the combination of causality and directionality of time flow. Additionally, we find that a bosonic density matrix satisfies both the Klein-Gordon and the Dirac equations. Finally, we expand the algebra of Gaussian superoperators even further by relaxing the CPTP condition. We find that it is isomorphic to a superconformal algebra, which represents the maximal symmetry of the field theory. This suggests a deeper connection between two seemingly unrelated fields, with the potential to transform problems from one domain into another where they may be more easily solved.</p>

            <p>In unitary circuit games, two competing parties, an "entangler" and a "disentangler", can induce an entanglement phase transition in a quantum many-body system. The transition occurs at a certain rate at which the disentangler acts. We analyze such games within the context of matchgate dynamics, which equivalently corresponds to evolutions of non-interacting fermions. We first investigate general entanglement properties of fermionic Gaussian states (FGS). We introduce a representation of FGS using a minimal matchgate circuit capable of preparing the state and derive an algorithm based on a generalized Yang-Baxter relation for updating this representation as unitary operations are applied. This representation enables us to define a natural disentangling procedure that reduces the number of gates in the circuit, thereby decreasing the entanglement contained in the system. We then explore different strategies to disentangle the systems and study the unitary circuit game in two different scenarios: with braiding gates, i.e., the intersection of Clifford gates and matchgates, and with generic matchgates. For each model, we observe qualitatively different entanglement transitions, which we characterize both numerically and analytically.</p>

These results indicate that coherent pump sources, such as lasers, are not required for SPDC-based entanglement generation.

            <p>The last decades have seen the development of quantum machine learning, stemming from the intersection of quantum computing and machine learning. This field is particularly promising for the design of alternative quantum (or quantum inspired) computation paradigms that could require fewer resources with respect to standard ones, e.g. in terms of energy consumption. In this context, we present the implementation of a data re-uploading scheme on a photonic integrated processor, achieving high accuracies in several image classification tasks. We thoroughly investigate the capabilities of this apparently simple model, which relies on the evolution of one-qubit states, by providing an analytical proof that our implementation is a universal classifier and an effective learner, capable of generalizing to new, unknown data. Hence, our results not only demonstrate data re-uploading in a potentially resource-efficient optical implementation but also provide new theoretical insight into this algorithm, its trainability, and generalizability properties. This lays the groundwork for developing more resource-efficient machine learning algorithms, leveraging our scheme as a subroutine.</p>

            <h2>Coherent Spins in van der Waals Semiconductor GeS2 at Ambient Conditions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sumukh Vaidya, Xingyu Gao, Saakshi Dikshit, Zhenyao Fang, Andres E Llacsahuanga Alcca, Yong P Chen, Qimin Yan, Tongcang Li</p>
            <p>Optically active spin defects in van der Waals (vdW) materials have recently emerged as versatile quantum sensors, enabling applications from nanoscale magnetic field detection to the exploration of novel quantum phenomena in condensed matter systems. Their ease of exfoliation and compatibility with device integration make them promising candidates for future quantum technologies. Here we report the observation and room-temperature coherent control of spin defects in the high-temperature crystalline phase of germanium disulfide ($\beta$-GeS2), a two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor with low nuclear spin density. The observed spin defects exhibit spin-1/2 behavior, and their spin dynamics can be explained by a weakly coupled spin-pair model. We implement dynamical decoupling techniques to extend the spin coherence time (T$_2$) by a factor of 20. Finally, we use density functional theory (DFT) calculations to estimate the structure and spin densities of two possible spin defect candidates. This work will help expand the field of quantum sensing with spin defects in van der Waals materials.</p>

            <h2>Optical pumping simulations and optical Rabi frequency measurements in $^{151}\mathrm{Eu}^{3+}\!:\mathrm{Y}_2\mathrm{SiO}_5$ under magnetic field</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jingjing Chen, Mikael Afzelius</p>
            <p>Europium-doped crystal $\mathrm{Y}_2\mathrm{SiO}_5$ is an interesting platform for optical quantum memories, due to its long optical and spin coherence times. In this work, we investigate $^{151}\mathrm{Eu}^{3+}\!:\mathrm{Y}_2\mathrm{SiO}_5$ under the application of magnetic field, a complex system with 36 different optical-hyperfine transitions. We present a simple numerical simulator for calculating the effect of optical pumping schemes that allow the isolation of a single frequency class of ions, applicable to any multi-level atom with inhomogeneous broadening. Experimentally, we develop methodologies for estimating the magnetic field vector, demonstrating high precision in predicting spectral features based on the known spin Hamiltonians. We measured the optical Rabi frequency of 21 transitions among the 36 possible optical-hyperfine transitions, allowing for the construction of a 6x6 branching ratio matrix of relative transition strengths. From the Rabi frequency measurements, we derive the optical dipole moment for the $^7\!F_0 \leftrightarrow {}^5\!D_0$ transition, yielding a value of $(6.94 \pm 0.09) \times 10^{-33}~\mathrm{C} \cdot \mathrm{m}$. Our results provide a critical test of the spin Hamiltonian models, demonstrating high precision in predicting energy levels and relative transition strengths, which are key abilities for quantum applications with $^{151}\mathrm{Eu}^{3+}\!:\mathrm{Y}_2\mathrm{SiO}_5$ under magnetic field.</p>

            <h2>QMoE: A Quantum Mixture of Experts Framework for Scalable Quantum Neural Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hoang-Quan Nguyen, Xuan-Bac Nguyen, Sankalp Pandey, Samee U. Khan, Ilya Safro, Khoa Luu</p>
            <p>Quantum machine learning (QML) has emerged as a promising direction in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, offering computational and memory advantages by harnessing superposition and entanglement. However, QML models often face challenges in scalability and expressiveness due to hardware constraints. In this paper, we propose quantum mixture of experts (QMoE), a novel quantum architecture that integrates the mixture of experts (MoE) paradigm into the QML setting. QMoE comprises multiple parameterized quantum circuits serving as expert models, along with a learnable quantum routing mechanism that selects and aggregates specialized quantum experts per input. The empirical results from the proposed QMoE on quantum classification tasks demonstrate that it consistently outperforms standard quantum neural networks, highlighting its effectiveness in learning complex data patterns. Our work paves the way for scalable and interpretable quantum learning frameworks.</p>

            <h2>Alternating minimization for computing doubly minimized Petz Renyi mutual information</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Laura Burri</p>
            <p>The doubly minimized Petz Renyi mutual information (PRMI) of order $\alpha$ is defined as the minimization of the Petz divergence of order $\alpha$ of a fixed bipartite quantum state $\rho_{AB}$ relative to any product state $\sigma_A\otimes \tau_B$. To date, no closed-form expression for this measure has been found, necessitating the development of numerical methods for its computation. In this work, we show that alternating minimization over $\sigma_A$ and $\tau_B$ asymptotically converges to the doubly minimized PRMI for any $\alpha\in (\frac{1}{2},1)\cup (1,2]$, by proving linear convergence of the objective function values with respect to the number of iterations for $\alpha\in (1,2]$ and sublinear convergence for $\alpha\in (\frac{1}{2},1)$. Previous studies have only addressed the specific case where $\rho_{AB}$ is a classical-classical state, while our results hold for any quantum state $\rho_{AB}$.</p>

            <h2>Towards a Comparative Framework for Compositional AI Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tiffany Duneau</p>
            <p>The DisCoCirc framework for natural language processing allows the construction of compositional models of text, by combining units for individual words together according to the grammatical structure of the text. The compositional nature of a model can give rise to two things: compositional generalisation -- the ability of a model to generalise outside its training distribution by learning compositional rules underpinning the entire data distribution -- and compositional interpretability -- making sense of how the model works by inspecting its modular components in isolation, as well as the processes through which these components are combined. We present these notions in a framework-agnostic way using the language of category theory, and adapt a series of tests for compositional generalisation to this setting. Applying this to the DisCoCirc framework, we consider how well a selection of models can learn to compositionally generalise. We compare both quantum circuit based models, as well as classical neural networks, on a dataset derived from one of the bAbI tasks, extended to test a series of aspects of compositionality. Both architectures score within 5% of one another on the productivity and substitutivity tasks, but differ by at least 10% for the systematicity task, and exhibit different trends on the overgeneralisation tasks. Overall, we find the neural models are more prone to overfitting the Train data. Additionally, we demonstrate how to interpret a compositional model on one of the trained models. By considering how the model components interact with one another, we explain how the model behaves.</p>

            <h2>Quasiconservation Laws and Suppressed Transport in Weakly Interacting Localized Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jessica Kaijia Jiang, Federica Maria Surace, Olexei I. Motrunich</p>
            <p>The stability of localization in the presence of interactions remains an open problem, with finite-size effects posing significant challenges to numerical studies. In this work, we investigate the perturbative stability of noninteracting localization under weak interactions, which allows us to analyze much larger system sizes. Focusing on disordered Anderson and quasiperiodic Aubry-André models in one dimension, and using the adiabatic gauge potential (AGP) at first order in perturbation theory, we compute first-order corrections to noninteracting local integrals of motion (LIOMs). We find that for at least an $O(1)$ fraction of the LIOMs, the corrections are well-controlled and converge at large system sizes, while others suffer from resonances. Additionally, we introduce and study the charge-transport capacity of this weakly interacting model. To first order, we find that the charge transport capacity remains bounded in the presence of interactions. Taken together, these results demonstrate that localization is perturbatively stable to weak interactions at first order, implying that, at the very least, localization persists for parametrically long times in the inverse interaction strength. We expect this perturbative stability to extend to all orders at sufficiently strong disorder, where the localization length is short, representing the true localized phase. Conversely, our findings suggest that the previously proposed interaction-induced avalanche instability, namely in the weakly localized regime of the Anderson and Aubry-André models, is a more subtle phenomenon arising only at higher orders in perturbation theory or through nonperturbative effects.</p>

            <h2>Can slow recombination in ordered superconductors explain the excess quasiparticle population?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eva Gurra, Douglas A. Bennett, Shannon M. Duff, Michael R. Vissers, Joel N. Ullom</p>
            <p>An excess density of quasiparticles is widely observed in superconducting films. This excess causes performance degradation in a variety of superconducting devices, including decoherence in qubits. In this Letter, we evaluate the hypothesis of [1] that the quasiparticle excess is caused by anomalously slow recombination at low quasiparticle densities due to localization in sub-gap states. We probe the density of states in aluminum and niobium films using current-voltage measurements of tunnel junctions and extract upper bounds on the energy scales of the sub-gap states and gap smearing. With these parameters, we evaluate the recombination times predicted by [1] and find that slow recombination is not predicted to occur at observed quasiparticle densities in aluminumand niobium-based superconducting devices. These results suggest that the quasiparticle excess in ordered superconductors is primarily due to non-thermal sources of quasiparticle generation and not slow recombination.</p>

            <h2>Lieb-Robinson bounds, automorphic equivalence and LPPL for long-range interacting fermions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stefan Teufel, Tom Wessel</p>
            <p>We prove a Lieb-Robinson bound for lattice fermion models with polynomially decaying interactions, which can be used to show the locality of the quasi-local inverse Liouvillian. This allows us to prove automorphic equivalence and the local perturbations perturb locally (LPPL) principle for these systems. The proof of the Lieb-Robinson bound is based on the work of Else et al. (2020), and our results also apply to spin systems. We explain why some newer Lieb-Robinson bounds for long-range spin systems cannot be used to prove the locality of the quasi-local inverse Liouvillian, and in some cases may not even hold for fermionic systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Athanasios Paralikis, Pawel Wyborski, Pietro Metuh, Niels Gregersen, Battulga Munkhbat</p>
            <p>Low-noise and tunable single-photon sources are essential components of photonic quantum technologies. However, in WSe$_2$ quantum emitters, charge noise from fluctuations in their local electrostatic environment remains a major obstacle to achieving transform-limited single-photon emission and high photon indistinguishability. Here, we systematically investigate two noise mitigation strategies in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) encapsulation and electrostatic biasing. We demonstrate that hBN encapsulation alone suppresses spectral wandering (from $\sim$170 $\mu$eV to $\sim$40 $\mu$eV) and narrows emission linewidths (from $\sim$500 $\mu$eV to $\sim$150 $\mu$eV), while applied bias enables stable Stark tuning over a 280 $\mu$eV range and further linewidth narrowing down to $\sim$100 $\mu$eV reaching the resolution-limited regime. Time-resolved and second-order correlation measurements confirm stable mono-exponential decay and high single-photon purity ($g^{(2)}(0) \approx 0.01$) with no observable blinking. To quantify progress toward the transform limit, we define two figures of merit: the linewidth ratio $R = W_{\text{exp}} / W_{\text{rad}}$ and total broadening $\Delta W = W_{\text{exp}} - W_{\text{rad}}$, with both being reduced more than five-fold in optimized devices. These results provide a robust framework for developing and evaluating low-noise, tunable WSe$_2$ quantum emitters, potentially realizing electrically controllable sources of indistinguishable single-photons for future photonic quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Index Theorem and Vortex Kinetics in Bose-Einstein Condensates on a Haldane Sphere with a Magnetic Monopole</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xi-Yu Chen, Lijia Jiang, Tao Yang, Jun-Hui Zheng</p>
            <p>The geometry-gauge interplay constitutes a fundamental issue in quantum physics, with profound implications spanning from quantum gravity to topological matter. Here, we investigate the dynamic effects of geometry-gauge interplay in Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) on a Haldane sphere with a magnetic monopole. We reveal an index theorem that establishes a correspondence between BEC vortices and the topology of the gauge field, enabling the construction of vortex-monopole composites. Furthermore, we derive the universal logarithmic interaction between composites, which governs the structure of the ground-state vortex lattice. By developing a kinetic theory, we predict scale-invariant vortex dynamics and an emergent duality. Both are confirmed through numerical simulations. This work first presents the dynamical coupling mechanism between spatial geometry and gauge fields, providing deep insights into superfluid systems with topological gauge structures in curved space.</p>

            <h2>An infinite family of Dunkl type superintegrable curved Hamiltonians through coalgebra symmetry: Oscillator and Kepler-Coulomb models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francisco J. Herranz, Danilo Latini</p>
            <p>This work aims to bridge the gap between Dunkl superintegrable systems and the coalgebra symmetry approach to superintegrability, and subsequently to recover known models and construct new ones. In particular, an infinite family of $N$-dimensional quasi-maximally superintegrable quantum systems with reflections, sharing the same set of $2N-3$ quantum integrals, is introduced. The result is achieved by introducing a novel differential-difference realization of $\mathfrak{sl}(2, \mathbb{R})$ and then applying the coalgebra formalism. Several well-known maximally superintegrable models with reflections appear as particular cases of this general family, among them, the celebrated Dunkl oscillator and the Dunkl-Kepler-Coulomb system. Furthermore, restricting to the case of "hidden" quantum quadratic symmetries, maximally superintegrable curved oscillator and Kepler-Coulomb Hamiltonians of Dunkl type, sharing the same underlying $\mathfrak{sl}(2, \mathbb{R})$ coalgebra symmetry, are presented. Namely, the Dunkl oscillator and the Dunkl-Kepler-Coulomb system on the $N$-sphere and hyperbolic space together with two models which can be interpreted as a one-parameter superintegrable deformation of the Dunkl oscillator and the Dunkl-Kepler-Coulomb system on non-constant curvature spaces. In addition, maximally superintegrable generalizations of these models, involving non-central potentials, are also derived on flat and curved spaces. For all specific systems, at least an additional quantum integral is explicitly provided, which is related to the Dunkl version of a (curved) Demkov-Fradkin tensor or a Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector.</p>

            <p>Quantum computers use quantum mechanical phenomena to perform conventionally intractable calculations for specific problems. Despite being universal machines, quantum computers are not expected to replace classical computers, but rather, to complement them and form hybrid systems. This makes integrating quantum computers into high performance computing (HPC) systems an increasingly relevant topic. We present a structured literature review on the integration aspect. We methodologically search literature databases and manually evaluate 107 publications. These publications are divided into seven categories that describe the state of the art in each category. After a brief quantitative analysis of the literature, this survey deals with the hardware architecture of hybrid quantum-classical systems, as well as the software stack. We observe the development of a wide range of tools enabling hybrid systems and emphasize the need for future standardization of interfaces and methods to foster synergy.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chon Man Sou, Yi Wang, Xingkai Zhang</p>
            <p>The amount of information propagated by intermediate heavy particles exhibits characteristic features in inelastic scatterings with $n\geq 3$ final particles. As the total energy increases, the entanglement entropy, between its decay products and other final particles, exhibits a universal sharp dip, suppressed by its small decay rate. This indicates an entanglement suppression from a low-energy effective theory to a channel dominated by an on-shell heavy particle. As demonstrations of these entanglement features, we study concrete models of $2\to 3$ and $2\to 4$ scatterings, which shed light on the entanglement structure beyond the area law derived for $2\to 2$ scattering. In practice, these features may be probed by suitably marginalizing the phase-space distribution of final particles.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Miloschewsky, Supartha Podder</p>
            <p>In 2004, Aaronson introduced the complexity class $\mathsf{PostBQP}$ ($\mathsf{BQP}$ with postselection) and showed that it is equal to $\mathsf{PP}$. In this paper, we define a new complexity class, $\mathsf{CorrBQP}$, a modification of $\mathsf{BQP}$ which has the power to perform correlated measurements, i.e. measurements that output the same value across a partition of registers. We show that $\mathsf{CorrBQP}$ is exactly equal to $\mathsf{BPP}^{\mathsf{PP}}$, placing it "just above" $\mathsf{PP}$. In fact, we show that other metaphysical modifications of $\mathsf{BQP}$, such as $\mathsf{CBQP}$ (i.e. $\mathsf{BQP}$ with the ability to clone arbitrary quantum states), are also equal to $\mathsf{BPP}^{\mathsf{PP}}$. Furthermore, we show that $\mathsf{CorrBQP}$ is self-low with respect to classical queries. In contrast, if it were self-low under quantum queries, the counting hierarchy ($\mathsf{CH}$) would collapse to $\mathsf{BPP}^{\mathsf{PP}}$. Finally, we introduce a variant of rational degree that lower-bounds the query complexity of $\mathsf{BPP}^{\mathsf{PP}}$.</p>

It is shown that the entanglement grows logarithmically in time, and the prefactor is proportional to the number of filled bands in the initial state. For a dimerized chain the particle density and current are found to have the same expressions as in the homogeneous case, up to a rescaling of the velocity. The universal contribution to the entropy profile is then doubled, while the non-universal part can be extracted numerically from block-Toeplitz matrices.</p>
