            <h2>Compact cavity-dressed Hamiltonian framework at arbitrarily strong light-matter coupling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jakub Garwoła, Dvira Segal</p>
            <p>We present a non-perturbative Hamiltonian mapping method for quantum systems strongly coupled to a quantized field mode (cavity), yielding compact closed-form representations of hybrid light-matter systems. The mapping method builds on an entangling transformation of photonic and atomic degrees of freedom. By truncating the resulting cavity-dressed Hamiltonian (CDH) to successively larger excitation sectors, we construct a series of compact models that converge to the exact limit, outpacing conventional approaches even in the challenging resonant and ultrastrong light-matter regime. The mapping principle also applies to multimode cavities coupled to matter through noncommuting operators and to leaky cavities. We benchmark the CDH framework on the quantum Rabi model, demonstrating accurate spectral predictions in both weak and strong coupling regimes, together with converging ground-state and thermal observables. We study the Dicke-Heisenberg lattice model and determine its phase diagram under resonant and strong light-matter coupling, achieving significant computational savings over brute-force simulations and identifying cavity-mediated spin correlations both analytically and numerically. The closed-form and compactness of the CDH provide both physical insight and enhanced computational efficiency, facilitating studies of strongly coupled hybrid light-matter systems.</p>

            <h2>Error-Mitigation Enabled Multicomponent Quantum Simulations Beyond the Born-Oppenheimer Approximation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Delmar G. A. Cabral, Brandon Allen, Fabijan Pavošević, Sharon Hammes-Schiffer, Pablo Díez-Valle, Jack S. Baker, Gaurav Saxena, Thi Ha Kyaw, Victor S. Batista</p>
            <p>We introduce a multicomponent unitary coupled cluster framework for quantum simulations of molecular systems that incorporate both electronic and nuclear quantum effects beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Using the nuclear-electronic orbital formalism, we construct mcUCC ansätze for positronium hydride and molecular hydrogen with a quantum proton, and analyze hardware requirements for different excitation truncations. To further reduce resource costs effectively, we employ the local unitary cluster Jastrow ansatz and implement it experimentally on IBM Q's Heron superconducting hardware. With the Physics-Inspired Extrapolation error mitigation protocol, the computed ground-state energies remain within chemical accuracy, consistent with the stated uncertainty level. These results provide the first demonstration of error-mitigated multicomponent correlated simulations on quantum hardware and outline a path toward scalable algorithms unifying electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom.</p>

            <h2>Application of optical squeezing to microresonator based optical sensors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dariya Salykina, Daniil Shakhbaziants, Igor Bilenko, Farid Khalili</p>
            <p>High-Q optical microresonators combine low losses and high optical energy concentration in a small effective mode volume, making them an attractive platform for optical sensors. While light is confined in the microresonator by total internal reflection, a portion of the optical field, known as the evanescent field, extends outside. This makes the mode's resonant frequency sensitive to changes in the surrounding environment. In this work, we explore the quantum sensitivity limits of this type of sensors. We demonstrate that by preparing the probe light in a squeezed quantum state, it is possible to surpass the shot-noise limit. The resulting sensitivity is constrained only by optical losses and the available degree of squeezing. The influence of the losses can be reduced using additional squeezing of the light inside the microresonator.</p>

            <h2>Stimulated Hawking effect and quasinormal mode resonance in a polariton simulator of field theory on curved spacetime</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mattheus Burkhard, Malte Kroj, Kévin Falque, Alberto Bramati, Iacopo Carusotto, Maxime J Jacquet</p>
            <p>The Hawking effect amplifies fluctuations in the vicinity of horizons, both in black holes and in analogue platforms. Here, we consider a polariton simulator and numerically examine the \emph{stimulated} Hawking effect using a coherent probe incident on the horizon from the exterior. We implement an experimentally realistic effective spacetime that supports a quasinormal mode (QNM) in the vicinity of the horizon. We find that the stimulated Hawking effect manifests as transmission into a negative-energy Bogoliubov channel inside the horizon, consistent with pseudo-unitary Bogoliubov scattering. Moreover, transmission across the horizon peaks at the QNM frequency. The computed spectral signatures provide a practical guide for future experimental investigations of the Hawking effect and its interplay with QNMs, an open question in quantum field theory in curved spacetime.</p>

            <h2>Optimal Multiparameter Quantum Estimation of Magnonic Couplings in a Magnomechanical Cavity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adnan Naimy, Abdallah Slaoui, Abderrahim Lakhfif, Rachid Ahl Laamara</p>
            <p>In this work, we introduce an experimentally viable scheme to enhance the simultaneous estimation precision of the couplings $G_{mc}$ and $G_{mb}$, with a particular focus on the performance of heterodyne detection. By comparing simultaneous and individual estimation strategies, we demonstrate that the simultaneous approach offers a notable advantage in our system. To support this, we compute the quantum Fisher information matrices (QFIMs) based on the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD) and the right logarithmic derivative (RLD). Our results show that the quantum Cramér Rao bound (QCRB) associated with the RLD is consistently lower than that of the SLD, indicating superior estimation precision. From a physical standpoint, this improvement reflects the system's enhanced capacity to encode, transfer, and extract quantum information while allowing optimal control of fundamental interactions. We show that increasing the Rabi frequency, cavity loss rate, and the average number of photons and phonons, combined with reduced mechanical damping and temperature, enhances the system's sensitivity to the coupling parameters. These mechanisms act on the available quantum resources, such as entanglement, squeezing, and state purity, leading to more precise estimations. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that under certain conditions, heterodyne detection can closely approach the ultimate precision set by the QFIM. This suggests that a measurement strategy based on heterodyne detection can offer an efficient and practical route for estimating the couplings $G_{mc}$ and $G_{mb}$, paving the way for high precision hybrid quantum sensors.</p>

            <h2>Enhancing Chemistry on Quantum Computers with Fermionic Linear Optical Simulation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zack Hassman, Oliver Reardon-Smith, Gokul Subramanian Ravi, Frederic T. Chong, Kevin J. Sung</p>
            <p>We present and open source a simulator for circuits composed of passive fermionic linear optical elements and controlled-phase gates. Given such a circuit, our simulator can compute Born-rule probabilities for samples drawn from it. Our simulator supports both exact and approximate probability calculation, allowing users to trade accuracy for efficiency as needed. For approximate Born-rule probability calculation, our simulator's runtime is exponential only in the magnitudes of the angles of the circuit's controlled-phase gates. This makes our simulator useful for simulating certain systems that are beyond the reach of conventional state vector methods. We demonstrate our simulator's utility by simulating the local unitary cluster Jastrow (LUCJ) ansatz and integrating it with sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD) to improve the accuracy of molecular ground-state energy estimates. Applied to a 52-qubit $N_2$ system, we observe accuracy improvements of up to $46\%$ over the baseline SQD implementation with negligible computational overhead. As an efficient and flexible tool for simulating fermionic circuits, our simulator enables new opportunities for enhancing near-term quantum algorithms in chemistry and related domains.</p>

            <h2>Above-Unity Coherent Cooperativity of Tin-Vacancy Centers in Diamond Photonic Crystal Cavities</h2>

            <p>The tin-vacancy center in diamond (SnV) has emerged as a compelling building block for realizing next-generation quantum networks thanks to its excellent optical and spin properties. Coupling to photonic crystal cavities (PCCs) promises to further enhance the SnV light-matter interface and unlock a diverse range of entanglement generation protocols. Recent pioneering experiments showing Purcell enhancement of SnV centers in PCCs underscore this potential. However, optical coupling that is coherent - the key ingredient for use in quantum protocols - has so far remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate above-unity coherent cooperativity of SnV centers embedded in photonic crystal cavities. We fabricate free-standing PCCs using a quasi-isotropic undercut. Across two samples, we conduct room-temperature characterizations, measuring resonances for 327 cavities, with an average quality factor exceeding $Q = 1.0(3) \times 10^4$. Two cavity-coupled emitters are examined in detail, exhibiting quality factors up to $Q = 25.4(4) \times 10^3$ and Purcell-reduced lifetimes corresponding to cooperativities up to $C = 20.6(11)$. Furthermore, the single SnVs are observed to strongly modulate the cavity transmission with an extinction contrast up to $98.8(4) \%$ on resonance. Finally, SnV linewidth measurements reveal above-unity coherent cooperativities in both devices, with the highest value being $C_\mathrm{coh} = 8.3(12)$. These results open the door to using cavity-coupled SnV centers as efficient, coherent light-matter interfaces for future quantum networks.</p>

            <h2>Efficient algorithm for fidelity estimation of two quantum states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anumita Mukhopadhyay, Shibdas Roy, Arun Kumar Pati</p>
            <p>The fidelity estimation between two quantum states is crucial for quantum computation and information science. However, an efficacious method for this, especially for mixed states and higher-dimensional density matrices, remains elusive. While there are many existing algorithms on computing the fidelity between two pure states, there is not much work on how to obtain the fidelity between two mixed states. Here, we propose an efficient quantum algorithm for the fidelity estimation, based primarily on the density matrix exponentiation and interferometeric scheme for mixed states, with a time complexity of $O(N^2/\epsilon^7)$, where $N$ is the system size and $\epsilon$ is a precision error. Our algorithm may serve as a resource-efficient technique to deduce fidelity of any two (pure or mixed) unknown or known quantum states, when the density matrices of the quantum states commute with each other.</p>

            <h2>Probing parameters estimation with Gaussian non-commutative measurements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alice P. G. Hall, Carlos H. S. Vieira, Jonas F. G. Santos</p>
            <p>Gaussian quantum states and channels are pivotal across many branches of quantum science and their applications, including the processing and storage of quantum information, the investigation of thermodynamics in the quantum regime, and quantum computation. The great advantage is that Gaussian states are experimentally accessible via their first and second statistical moments. In this work, we investigate parameter estimation for Gaussian states, in which the probe-state preparation stage involves two noncommutative Gaussian measurements on the position and momentum observables, introducing tunable parameters. The influence of these noncommutative Gaussian measurements is investigated through the quantum Fisher information (QFI). We showed that the QFI for characterizing Gaussian channels can be increased by adjusting the uncertainty parameters in the preparation of the probe state. Furthermore, if the probe is initially in a thermal state, probe-state preparation may generate quantum coherence in its energy basis. We showed that not only does the amount of coherence affect the improvement of the QFI, but also the rate of change of the coherence with respect to the parameter to be estimated. The proposed probe-state protocol is applied to two paradigmatic single-mode Gaussian channels, the attenuator and amplification channels, which are building blocks of Gaussian quantum information. Our results contribute to the use of coherence in quantum metrology and are experimentally feasible in quantum-optical devices.</p>

            <h2>Sequences of Bivariate Bicycle Codes from Covering Graphs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benjamin C. B. Symons, Abhishek Rajput, Dan E. Browne</p>
            <p>We show that given an instance of a bivariate bicycle (BB) code, it is possible to generate an infinite sequence of new BB codes using increasingly large covering graphs of the original code's Tanner graph. When a BB code has a Tanner graph that is a $h$-fold covering of the base BB code's Tanner graph, we refer to it as a $h$-cover code. We show that for a BB code to be a $h$-cover code, its lattice parameters and defining polynomials must satisfy simple algebraic conditions relative to those of the base code. By extending the graph covering map to a chain map, we show there are induced projection and lifting maps on (co)homology that enable the projection and lifting of logical operators and, in certain cases, automorphisms between the base and the cover code. The search space of cover codes is considerably reduced compared to the full space of possible polynomials and we find that many interesting examples of BB codes, such as the $[[144,12,12]]$ gross code, can be viewed as cover codes. We also apply our method to search for BB codes with weight 8 checks and find many codes, including a $[[64,14,8]]$ and $[[144,14,14]]$ code. For an $h$-cover code of an $[[n,k,d]]$ BB code with parameters $[[n_h = hn, k_h, d_h]]$, we prove that $k_h \geq k$ and $d_h \leq hd$ when $h$ is odd. Furthermore if $h$ is odd and $k_h = k$, we prove the lower bound $d \leq d_h$. We conjecture it is always true that an $h$-cover BB code of a base $[[n,k,d]]$ BB code has parameters $[[n_h = hn, k_h \geq k, d \leq d_h \leq hd]]$. While the focus of this work is on bivariate bicycle codes, we expect these methods to generalise readily to many group algebra codes and to certain code constructions involving hypergraph, lifted, and balanced products.</p>

            <h2>Long-range entanglement and quantum correlations in a multi-frequency comb system</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sahil Pontula, Debasmita Banerjee, Marin Soljacic, Yannick Salamin</p>
            <p>Frequency combs are multimode photonic systems that underlie countless precision sensing and metrology applications. Since their invention over two decades ago, numerous efforts have pushed frequency combs to broader bandwidths and more stable operation. More recently, quantum squeezing and entanglement have been explored in single frequency comb systems for quantum advantages in sensing and signal multiplexing. However, the production of quantum light across multiple frequency combs remains unexplored. In this work, we theoretically explore a mechanism that generates a series of nonlinearly coupled frequency combs through cascaded three-wave upconversion and downconversion processes mediated by a single idler comb. We show how this system generates inter- and intracomb two-mode squeezing and entanglement spanning a very large spectral range, from ultraviolet to mid-IR frequencies. Finally, we show how this system can be engineered to produce on-demand multimode quantum light through covariance matrix optimization. Our findings could enable tunable broadband ghost spectroscopy protocols, squeezing-enhanced pump-probe measurements, and broadband entanglement between spectrally-multiplexed quanta of information.</p>

            <h2>Modeling Quantum Noise in Nanolasers using Markov Chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matias Bundgaard-Nielsen, Gian Luca Lippi, Jesper Mørk</p>
            <p>The random nature of spontaneous emission leads to unavoidable fluctuations in a laser's output. This is often included through random Langevin forces in laser rate equations, but this approach falls short for nanolasers. In this paper, we show that the laser quantum noise can be quantitatively computed for a very broad class of lasers by starting from simple and intuitive rate equations and merely assuming that the number of photons and excited electrons only takes discrete values. The success of the model is explained by showing that it constitutes a Markov chain, which can be derived from the full master equations. We show that in the many-photon limit, the model simplifies to Langevin equations. We perform an extensive comparison of different approaches for computing quantum noise in lasers, identifying the best approach for different system sizes, ranging from nanolasers to macroscopic lasers, and different levels of excitation, i.e., cavity photon number. In particular, we find that the numerical solution to the Langevin equations is inaccurate below the laser threshold, while the laser Markov chain model, on the other hand, is accurate for all pump values and laser sizes when collective emitter effects are excluded.</p>

            <h2>Photonic spin Hall effect in $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric non-Hermitian cavity magnomechanics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shah Fahad, Muzamil Shah, Gao Xianlong</p>
            <p>Non-Hermitian cavity magnomechanics (CMM), which incorporates the magnon-photon and magnon-phonon interactions simultaneously, enables rich physical phenomena, including exceptional-point-enhanced sensing, and offers pathways toward topological transitions and nonreciprocal quantum transformation. These interactions exert a pivotal influence on the optical response of a weak probe field and pave the way for novel applications in quantum technologies. In this work, we consider a yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) sphere coupled to a microwave cavity. The magnon mode of the YIG sphere is directly excited through microwave field coupling, whereas the cavity mode is probed via a weak-field interrogation scheme. The direct interaction of a traveling field with the magnon mode induces gain in the system, thereby establishing non-Hermitian dynamics. The parity-time (PT)-symmetric behavior of a hybrid non-Hermitian CMM is designed and investigated. Eigenvalue spectrum analysis demonstrates that a third-order exceptional point (EP_3) emerges under tunable effective magnon-photon coupling when the traveling field is oriented at an angle of \pi/2 relative to the cavity's x-axis. The photonic spin Hall effect (PSHE) in a reflected probe field is subsequently examined in such a system. Under balanced gain and loss conditions and in the presence of effective magnon-phonon coupling, tunable effective magnon-photon coupling enables coherent control of the PSHE across the broken PT-symmetric phase, at the EP_3, and in the PT-symmetric phase. Investigation reveals that the PSHE can be significantly enhanced or suppressed via effective magnon-photon coupling. The influence of intracavity length on the PSHE is further explored, providing an additional parameter for fine-tuning the transverse shift. These findings establish a direct correspondence between the PSHE and the underlying non-Hermitian eigenvalue spectrum.</p>

            <p>We introduce an all-optical quantum-enhanced diagnostic for electric fields in low-temperature plasmas. Trace amounts of rubidium vapor, added to argon plasma, allow us to produce spectrally narrow electric field-sensitive optical resonances via quantum optical effect of Rydberg electromagnetically induced transparency, and to non-invasively measure electric field in plasma with sensitivity exceeding 1 V/cm. By collecting fluorescence from the illuminated region of interest, we reconstruct a 2D spatial profile of the electric field magnitude with $30~\mu$m resolution. As a proof-of-principle demonstration, we measured the changes in electric field within the plasma sheath surrounding a biased Langmuir probe tip. This method holds significant potential for studying sheath structures in low-temperature plasmas.</p>

            <h2>Dyadic-Chaotic Lifting S-Boxes for Enhanced Physical-Layer Security within 6G Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ilias Cherkaoui, Indrakshi Dey</p>
            <p>Sixth-Generation (6G) wireless networks will interconnect billions of resource-constrained devices and time-critical services, where classical, fixed, and heavy cryptography strains latency and energy budgets and struggles against large-scale, pre-computation attacks. Physical-Layer Security (PLS) is therefore pivotal to deliver lightweight, information-theoretic protection, but still requires strong, reconfigurable confusion components that can be diversified per slice, session, or device to blunt large-scale precomputation and side-channel attacks. In order to address the above requirement, we introduce the first-ever chaos-lifted substitution box (S-box) for PLS that couples a $\beta$-transformation-driven dynamical system with dyadic conditional sampling to generate time-varying, seedable 8-bit permutations on demand. This construction preserves uniformity via ergodicity, yields full 8-bit bijections, and supports on-the-fly diversification across sessions. The resulting S-box attains optimal algebraic degree 7 on every output bit and high average nonlinearity 102.5 (85% of the 8-bit bound), strengthening resistance to algebraic and linear cryptanalysis. Differential and linear profiling report max DDT entry 10 (probability 0.039) and max linear probability 0.648, motivating deployment within a multi-round cipher with a strong diffusion layer, where the security-to-efficiency trade-off is compelling. Our proposed reconfigurable, lightweight S-box directly fulfills key PLS requirements of 6G networks by delivering fast, hardware-amenable confusion components with built-in agility against evolving threats.</p>

            <h2>Small clusters of He atoms in finite-cutoff EFT</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Betzalel Bazak</p>
            <p>Small clusters of $^4$He atoms provide a paradigmatic setting for exploring universal phenomena in few-body quantum systems with large scattering length. Their weakly bound states serve as ideal test cases for studying Efimov physics and the emergence of universality beyond the three-body sector. In this work, we investigate few-$^4$He systems within a finite-cutoff effective field theory (EFT) framework. The EFT interactions are calibrated to reproduce low-energy observables obtained from the realistic LM2M2 potential, enabling a direct and systematic comparison between the two approaches. We demonstrate that, for suitably chosen finite cutoffs, the empirical effective range is accurately reproduced already at leading order, achieving next-to-leading-order precision without explicit higher-order corrections. Using these interactions, we solve the Schrödinger equation for systems of a few atoms, obtaining binding energies and scattering observables in excellent agreement with results derived from realistic interatomic potentials. In particular, we compute atom--tetramer scattering parameters and binding energies of clusters up to eight atoms, thereby extending the EFT description to larger helium systems. Our findings establish a quantitative bridge between realistic helium potentials and finite-cutoff EFT, showing that the latter provides an efficient and predictive framework for describing few-body universality in weakly bound quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>Electron Tunneling Enhances Thermal Conductance through Metal-Insulator-Semiconductor Junctions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yizhe Liu, Bo Sun</p>
            <p>The presence of interfaces in semiconductor devices substantially hinders thermal transport, contributing disproportionately to the overall thermal resistance. However, approaches to enhance interfacial thermal transport remain scarce without changing the interface structure, as the intrinsic electron and phonon properties of constituent materials set an upper limit. Here, we find a new thermal transport pathway, electronic heat tunneling, to enhance interfacial thermal conductance through metal-insulator-semiconductor junctions. By applying photoexcitation or bias voltage, we observe remarkable thermal conductance increases in operando, opening a new channel for efficient interfacial heat dissipation. The electron quantum tunneling pathway is parallel to conventional phonon-mediated interfacial thermal transport, and violates the Wiedemann-Franz law since this pathway deviates from the paradigm of diffusive transport. Moreover, we develop a tunneling mismatch model to describe the enhanced thermal conductance, originating from tunneling heat flux. Our Letter demonstrates a previously unexplored heat transport mechanism to enhance thermal conductance, bypassing the need for interface engineering. These findings emphasize the essential need to understand semiconductor thermal properties under realistic operating conditions.</p>

            <h2>The role of interaction in matter wave optics with motional states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> RuGway Wu, Maximilian Prüfer, Jörg Schmiedmayer</p>
            <p>Matter-wave optics is often viewed as a linear analogue of photonics, where noninteracting particles are coherently split, diffracted, and recombined, and interference arises from single-particle coherence. In ultracold quantum gases, however, interactions are intrinsic and can rival or exceed kinetic and optical energy scales. This drives matter-wave optics into a nonlinear regime: diffraction and momentum distributions become interaction-dependent, interference contrast degrades or collapses, and revival dynamics appear. In the mean time, interactions can generate squeezing and entanglement, enabling sensitivities beyond the standard quantum limit. We showcase representative examples - covering diffraction, splitting, and interferometry - that illustrate how interactions reshape the basic elements of matter-wave optics and open new opportunities for nonlinear quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Topological Phases in Non-Hermitian Nonlinear-Eigenvalue Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Peng Ma, Ming-Jian Gao, Jun-Hong An</p>
            <p>The discovery of topological phases has ushered in a new era of condensed matter physics and revealed a variety of natural and artificial materials. They obey the bulk-boundary correspondence (BBC), which guarantees the emergence of boundary states with non-zero topological invariants in the bulk. A wide attention has been paid to extending topological phases to nonlinear and non-Hermitian systems. However, the BBC and topological invariants of non-Hermitian nonlinear systems remain largely unexplored. Here, we establish a complete BBC and topological characterization of the topological phases in a class of non-Hermitian nonlinear-eigenvalue systems by introducing an auxiliary system. We restore the BBC broken by non-Hermiticity via employing the generalized Brillouin zone on the auxiliary system. Remarkably, we discover that the interplay between non-Hermiticity and nonlinearity creates an exotic complex-band topological phase that coexists with the real-band topological phase. Our results enrich the family of nonlinear topological phases and lay a foundation for exploring novel topological physics in metamaterial systems.</p>

            <p>Lattice spin models featuring kinetic constraints constitute a paradigmatic setting for the investigation of glassiness and localization phenomena. The intricate dynamical behavior of these systems is a result of the dramatically reduced connectivity between many-body configurations. This truncation of transition pathways often leads to a fragmentation of the Hilbert space, yielding highly collective and therefore often slow dynamics. Moreover, this mechanism supports the formation of characteristic elementary excitations, which we investigate here theoretically in a two-dimensional Rydberg lattice gas. We explore their properties as a function of interaction strength and range, and illustrate how they can be experimentally probed via sideband spectroscopy. Here, we show that the transition rate to certain delocalized superposition states of elementary excitations displays collective many-body enhancement.</p>

            <h2>Thermodynamics of the Fermi-Hubbard Model through Stochastic Calculus and Girsanov Transformation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Detlef Lehmann</p>
            <p>We apply the methodology of our recent paper 'The Dynamics of the Hubbard Model through Stochastic Calculus and Girsanov Transformation' [1] to thermodynamic correlation functions in the Fermi-Hubbard model. They can be obtained from a stochastic differential equation (SDE) system. To this SDE system, a Girsanov transformation can be applied. This has the effect that the usual determinant or pfaffian which shows up in a pfaffian quantum Monte Carlo (PfQMC) representation [2] basically gets absorbed into the new integration variables and information from that pfaffian moves into the drift part of the transformed SDE system. While the PfQMC representation depends heavily on the choice of how the quartic interaction has been factorized into quadratic quantities in the beginning, the Girsanov transformed formula has the very remarkable property that it is nearly independent of that choice, the drift part of the transformed SDE system as well as a remaining exponential which has the obvious meaning of energy are always the same and do not depend on the Hubbard-Stratonovich details. The resulting formula may serve as a starting point for further theoretical or numerical investigations. Here we consider the spin-spin correlation at half-filling on a bipartite lattice and obtain an analytical proof that the signs of these correlations have to be of antiferromagnetic type, at arbitrary temperatures. Also, by checking against available benchmark data [3], we find that approximate ground state energies can be obtained from an ODE system. This may even hold for exact ground state energies, but future work would be required to prove or disprove this. As in [1], the methodology is generic and can be applied to arbitrary quantum many body or quantum field theoretical models.</p>

            <h2>A High-Efficiency Three-Stroke Quantum Isochoric Heat Engine: From Infinite Potential Wells to Magic Angle Twisted Bilayer Graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hadi Mohammed Soufy, Colin Benjamin</p>
            <p>We introduce a three-stroke quantum isochoric cycle that functions as a heat engine operating between two thermal reservoirs. Implemented for a particle confined in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, the cycle's performance is benchmarked against the classical three-stroke triangular and isochoric engines. We find that the quantum isochoric cycle achieves a higher efficiency than both classical counterparts and also surpasses the efficiency of the recently proposed three-stroke quantum isoenergetic cycle. Owing to its reduced number of strokes, the design substantially lowers control complexity in nanoscale thermodynamic devices, offering a more feasible route to experimental realization compared to conventional four-stroke architectures. We further evaluate the cycle in graphene-based systems under an external magnetic field, including monolayer graphene (MLG), AB-stacked bilayer graphene (BLG), and twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) at both magic and non-magic twist angles. Among these platforms, magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) attains the highest efficiency at fixed work output, highlighting its promise for quantum thermodynamic applications.</p>

            <p>We introduce a new scheme for quantum circuit design called controlled gate networks. Rather than trying to reduce the complexity of individual unitary operations, the new strategy is to toggle between all of the unitary operations needed with the fewest number of gates. We present the general theory of controlled gate networks and show that, under quite general conditions, it can significantly reduce the number of two-qubit gates needed to produce linear combinations of unitary operators. The first example we consider is a variational subspace calculation for a two-qubit system. The second example is estimating the eigenvalues of a two-qubit Hamiltonian via the rodeo algorithm using operators that we call controlled reversal gates. We use the Quantinuum H1-2 and IBM Perth devices to realize the quantum circuits. The third example is the application of controlled gate networks to the controlled time evolution of a free nucleon on a three-dimensional lattice. For all of the examples, we show very substantial reductions in the number of two-qubit gates required. Our work demonstrates that controlled gate networks are a useful tool for reducing gate complexity in quantum algorithms for quantum many-body problems such as those relevant to nuclear physics.</p>

            <h2>Efficient Photonic Graph State Generation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seungbeom Chin, William John Munro</p>
            <p>Graph states are central resources for quantum information processing, supporting applications in computation, communication, and error correction. In photonic systems, they are typically assembled from smaller entangled states using probabilistic fusion gates, which demand many photons and suffer from low success rates. We present an optimized scheme for directly generating caterpillar graph states (CGSs) -- essential resource states for constructing high-dimensional lattice graph states -- using only single-photon sources, linear optics, and heralded measurements. Based on the linear quantum graph (LQG) picture, our method produces CGSs efficiently and scalably. For CGSs of length $l\ge 3$, it requires $l-2$ fewer photons and achieves a success rate $2^{l-2}$ times higher than fusion-based approaches. These results demonstrate that the LQG picture provides a powerful and flexible route for realizing complex photonic graph states with minimal resources.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mirjam Weilenmann</p>
            <p>Non-signalling conditions encode minimal requirements that any (quantum) systems must satisfy in order to be consistent with special relativity. Recent works have argued that in scenarios involving more that two parties, correlations compatible with relativistic causality do not have to satisfy all possible non-signalling conditions but only a subset of them. Here we show that correlations satisfying only this subset of constraints have to satisfy highly non-local monogamy relations between the effects of space-like separated random variables. These monogamy relations take the form of entropic inequalities between the various systems and we give a general method to derive them. Using these monogamy relations we refute previous suggestions for physical mechanisms that could lead to relativistically causal correlations, demonstrating that such mechanisms would lead to superluminal signalling.</p>

            <p>At continuous phase transitions, quantum many-body systems exhibit scale-invariance and complex, emergent universal behavior. Most strikingly, at a quantum critical point, correlations decay as a power law, with exponents determined by a set of universal scaling dimensions. Experimentally probing such power-law correlations is extremely challenging, owing to the complex interplay between decoherence, the vanishing energy gap, and boundary effects. Here, we employ a Rydberg quantum simulator to adiabatically prepare critical ground states of both a one-dimensional ring and a two-dimensional square lattice. By accounting for and tuning the openness of our quantum system, which is well-captured by the introduction of a single phenomenological length scale, we are able to directly observe power-law correlations and extract the corresponding scaling dimensions. Moreover, in two dimensions, we observe a decoupling between phase transitions in the bulk and on the boundary, allowing us to identify two distinct boundary universality classes. Our work demonstrates that direct adiabatic preparation of critical states in quantum simulators can complement recent approaches to studying quantum criticality using the Kibble-Zurek mechanism or digital quantum circuits.</p>

            <h2>Quantum State Evolution and Berry Potentials at Exceptional Points and Quantum Phase Transitions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chia-Yi Ju, Fu-Hsiang Huang</p>
            <p>The behavior of quantum states at exceptional points and at critical points associated with quantum phase transitions is intriguing yet puzzling. In this study, we present an alternative method for obtaining the Berry potentials using the evolution generator along the parameter induced dimension and demonstrate that they are singular at these critical points. Although these singularities may appear to indicate a breakdown in quantum state evolution, we show that the information carried by quantum states evolving across these critical points is not destroyed. Specifically, when the evolution generator of the full Hilbert space bundle is taken into account, the quantum states remain insensitive to the critical points. In physical terms, it's similar to the classical image of an object smoothly passing through a black hole's event horizon. Further similarities between exceptional points and quantum phase transitions are explored in this work.</p>

            <p>Measurement-induced quantum computation with continuous-variable cluster states utilizes teleportation propagating the states through the cluster accompanied by non-Gaussian measurements and feedforward control. We analyze such propagation of a quantum non-Gaussian state with nonlinear squeezing through a small cluster state and show that when a nonlinear feedforward is involved in the teleportation protocol, higher nonlinear squeezing can be transferred. In a probabilistic regime, the improvement can be manifested even with current experimental resources. Better processing of non-Gaussian states can bring us closer to the necessary interplay between cluster states and non-Gaussianity required by quantum computing.</p>

            <p>In the rapidly evolving interdisciplinary field of quantum information science and technology, a major obstacle is the need to understand advanced mathematics to solve complex problems. Current findings in educational research suggest that incorporating visualizations into problem-solving settings can have beneficial effects on students' performance and cognitive load compared to relying solely on symbolic problem-solving content. Visualizations like the (dimensional) circle notation enable us to represent not only single-qubit but also more complex multi-qubit states, entanglement, and quantum algorithms. In this pilot study, we aim to take an initial step toward identifying the contexts in which students benefit from the presentation of visualizations of single- and multi-qubit systems in addition to mathematical formalism. For this purpose, we propose a set of test items and a comprehensive methodology to assess students' performance and cognitive load when solving problems. This is a pilot investigation with a large breadth of questions intended to generate hypotheses and guide larger-scale, more focused studies in the future. Specifically, we compare two approaches: using the mathematical-symbolic Dirac Notation alone and using it in combination with the (dimensional) circle notation. In surveys in one-, two- and three-qubit systems, we gather qualitative data from five, five and two think-aloud interviews, identifying problems that students encounter and their problem-solving strategies. In addition, we analyze quantitative data (performance and cognitive load) from 23, 27 and 17 participants in surveys on one-, two- and three-qubit systems recruited mainly from our quantum computing lectures. We find that most of the test items are appropriate for a heterogeneous target group, as they can differentiate between participants in terms of performance and time taken...</p>

            <p>In Phys. Rev. A 108, L060402 (2023), we introduced a Bayesian measurement error mitigation algorithm, which leveraged complete information from the readout signal, and validated the protocol on a quantum device with five superconducting qubits. Here, we present an improved algorithm's implementation, tailored for multiqubit experiments on near-term superconducting qubit quantum devices. In particular, we provide a detailed algorithm workflow, from calibrating the detector response functions to the postprocessing of measurement outcomes, offering a computationally efficient solution for the output size typical of current quantum computing devices. We show how the numerical representation of the noise function affects the performance of the error mitigation algorithm and test the convergence criteria. We benchmark our protocol on actual quantum computers with superconducting qubits, where the readout signal encodes the measurement information as unprocessed analog data before qubit state assignment. Finally, we compare the performance of our algorithm against other measurement error mitigation methods, such as iterative Bayesian unfolding and the Mthree method, and show how our method can be integrated on top of other readout error mitigation protocols.</p>

            <p>Spin amplification is the process that ideally increases the number of excited spins when one of them is excited initially. We show that by applying optimal control techniques to design classical drive pulse shapes, spin amplification can be achieved in a previously unexplored fast regime, with amplification times comparable to the intrinsic interaction timescale. This is an order of magnitude faster than the previous protocols and makes spin amplification possible even with significant decoherence and inhomogeneity in the spin system. The initial spin excitation can be delocalized over the entire ensemble, which is a more typical situation when a photon is collectively absorbed by the spins. We focus on the superconducting persistent-current artificial atoms and the Rydberg atoms as spins.</p>

            <p>Understanding and optimizing the relaxation dynamics of many-body systems is essential both for foundational studies in quantum thermodynamics and for applications such as quantum simulation and quantum computing. Efficient preparation of thermal states of a many-body Hamiltonian is governed by the spectral properties of the associated Lindbladian, in particular its spectral gap, which determines the slowest relaxation rate. In this work, we develop a systematic framework for constructing Lindbladians that prepare thermal states. Our approach reveals a simple relation between the relaxation dynamics at finite and infinite temperatures. The framework is scalable to larger system sizes when implemented using tensor-network methods. We find that efficient thermalization requires that the relaxation dynamics respect the symmetries of the thermal state, which reduces the number of free parameters. By applying gradient-based optimization to the Lindbladians, we enhance the spectral gap and thereby boost thermalization. When applied to both classical and quantum spin models, our method demonstrates a substantial enhancement of the spectral gap. For larger system sizes, our approach provides a variational upper bound and enables a certified lower bound on the minimum relaxation rate.</p>

As warm-up examples, we also consider simple models, including scalar field theory and the Yang--Mills matrix model, to illustrate the universality of our formulation, which shows up in the fact that the truncated Hamiltonian can be expressed in the same simple form for any N, any dimension, and any lattice size, in stark contrast to the popular approach based on the Kogut--Susskind formulation. In all these cases, the truncated Hamiltonian can be programmed on a quantum computer using only standard tools well-established in the field of quantum computation. As a concrete application of this universal framework, we consider Hamiltonian time evolution by Suzuki--Trotter decomposition. This turns out to be a straightforward task due to the simplicity of the truncated Hamiltonian. We also provide a simple circuit structure that contains only CNOT and one-qubit gates, independent of the details of the theory investigated.</p>

            <p>We compare the performance of randomized classical and quantum neural networks (NNs) as well as classical and quantum-classical hybrid convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the task of supervised binary image classification. We keep the employed quantum circuits compatible with near-term quantum devices and use two distinct methodologies: applying randomized NNs on dimensionality-reduced data and applying CNNs to full image data. We evaluate these approaches on three fully-classical data sets of increasing complexity: an artificial hypercube data set, MNIST handwritten digits and industrial images. Our central goal is to shed more light on how quantum and classical models perform for various binary classification tasks and on what defines a good quantum model. Our study involves a correlation analysis between classification accuracy and quantum model hyperparameters, and an analysis on the role of entanglement in quantum models, as well as on the impact of initial training parameters. We find classical and quantum-classical hybrid models achieve statistically-equivalent classification accuracies across most data sets with no approach consistently outperforming the other. Interestingly, we observe that quantum NNs show lower variance with respect to initial training parameters and that the role of entanglement is nuanced. While incorporating entangling gates seems advantageous, we also observe the (optimizable) entangling power not to be correlated with model performance. We also observe an inverse proportionality between the number of entangling gates and the average gate entangling power. Our study provides an industry perspective on quantum machine learning for binary image classification tasks, highlighting both limitations and potential avenues for further research in quantum circuit design, entanglement utilization, and model transferability across varied applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Min Namkung, Changhyoup Lee, Hyang-Tag Lim</p>
            <p>In quantum multi-parameter estimation, the precision of estimating unknown parameters is bounded by the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB), defined via the inverse of the Fisher information matrix (FIM). However, in certain scenarios such as distributed quantum sensing the FIM becomes non-invertible due to parameter redundancy, which depends on the probe state and measurement. This issue is often handled using a weaker form of the CRB, potentially overestimating the uncertainty and underrepresenting achievable precision. Here, we propose an alternative approach by introducing equality constraints to remove redundancy and define the CRB via the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of the FIM. This framework enables systematic treatment of both simultaneous estimation and distributed sensing cases. We demonstrate its utility by reanalyzing several known examples within this unified perspective, highlighting improved interpretability and practical relevance. Our results offer a concrete guideline for addressing non-invertible FIMs and enhancing the precision of quantum multi-parameter estimation in realistic scenarios.</p>

To this end, we introduce a measurement-free deformation protocol of the Bacon-Shor code to realize a logical $\mathit{CCZ}$ gate. Combined with a fold-transversal logical Hadamard gate, this enables a universal set of fault-tolerant operations using only transversal gates and qubit permutations. For the purpose of benchmarking under circuit-level noise, we develop an efficient method to simulate non-Clifford circuits with a small number of Hadamard gates. Separately, we demonstrate that certain CSS codes can be concatenated without measurements or having to rely on a universal logical gate set. This is made possible by means of a resource-efficient gadget -- termed the ``disposable Toffoli gadget'' -- that realizes the error-correcting feedback. Then, under concatenation of the Bacon-Shor code, we observe a fault-tolerance threshold at a circuit-level depolarizing noise rate of approximately $0.12\,\%$. Together, the deformation and concatenation protocols outline a blueprint for a fully fault-tolerant architecture without any feed-forward operation, particularly suited to state-of-the-art neutral-atom platforms.</p>

            <p>Quantum compiling, which aims to approximate target qubit gates by finding optimal sequences (braidwords) of basic braid operations, constitutes a fundamental challenge in quantum computing. We develop a genetic algorithm (GA)-enhanced Solovay-Kitaev algorithm (SKA) for approximating single-qubit gates using four elementary braiding matrices (EBMs) derived from Fibonacci anyons. The GA-enhanced SKA demonstrates robust performance, efficiently identifying optimal braidwords within exponentially large search spaces. Notably, the approximation precision achieved by our method surpasses that of Monte Carlo (MC)-enhanced SKA and becomes comparable to deep reinforcement learning (RL) approaches when braidword lengths exceed 25. Implementing 2- and 3-order approximations with the GA-enhanced SKA yields optimal braidword (initial braiding lengths l0=50 and 30 respectively) achieving gate distances of 5.9*10-7 - sufficient precision for most quantum computing applications. This work develops an optimized compilation framework for non-Abelian anyon gates, providing an essential methodology for enhancing future topological quantum computation architectures through gate optimization.</p>

            <p>We experimentally realize a quantum clock by using a charge sensor to count charges tunneling through a double quantum dot (DQD). Individual tunneling events are used as the clock's ticks. We quantify the clock's precision while measuring the power dissipated by the DQD and, separately, the charge sensor in both direct-current and radio-frequency readout modes. This allows us to probe the thermodynamic cost of creating ticks microscopically and recording them macroscopically. Our experiment is the first to explore the interplay between the entropy produced by a microscopic clockwork and its macroscopic measurement apparatus. We show that the latter contribution not only dwarfs the former but also unlocks greatly increased precision, because the measurement record can be exploited to optimally estimate time even when the DQD is at equilibrium. Our results suggest that the entropy produced by the amplification and measurement of a clock's ticks, which has often been ignored in the literature, is the most important and fundamental thermodynamic cost of timekeeping at the quantum scale.</p>

Moreover, we enhance the DMRG algorithm by introducing an adaptive protocol, which analyzes the entanglement distribution within each circuit section to be contracted, dynamically adjusting the qubit grouping at each iteration. We analyze the performances of these enhanced algorithms in simulating both stabilizer and nonstabilizer random-structured quantum circuits, with up to 1000 qubits and 100 layers of Clifford and non-Clifford gates, and in simulating Shor's quantum algorithm with up to hundreds of thousands of layers. Our findings show that, even with reasonable computational resources per task, cluster-based approaches can significantly speed up simulations of large-sized quantum circuits and improve the fidelity of the final states.</p>

            <p>We introduce new families of quantum Tanner codes, a class of quantum codes that first appeared in the work of Leverrier and Zémor (FOCS 2022). These codes are built from two classical Tanner codes, for which the underlying graphs are extracted from coverings of 2D geometrical complexes, and the local linear codes are tensor-products of cyclic or double-circulant linear codes. The advantage of code lifting is that, for any lift of odd index $t$ of an $[[n,k,d]]$-code, we can adapt the study of the transfer homomorphism arising in cellular homology to describe symmetries of its logical operators and to establish that its dimension is lower bounded by $k$, and its distance is upper bounded by $t\cdot d$. Moreover, when the dimension of the lifted code is equal to $k$, its distance is lower bounded by $d$. These parameter bounds also apply to the previous methods of code lifting of Guémard (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, 2025). Finally, We present several explicit families, and identify instances of moderate length quantum codes which are degenerate, have low check weight, and whose distance surpasses the square root of the code length. Among them, we report the existence of a $[[96,2,12]]$-code whose distance growth saturates our bound, and for which half of the checks are of weight 8 and the other half of weight 4.</p>

By synergistically combining these two types of squeezing and carefully aligning their squeezing quadratures, we have achieved a metrologically relevant spin squeezing of $-6.21\pm0.84$ dB, significantly outperforming the results obtained by utilizing either type of squeezing alone.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robert L. Cook, Liwen Ko, K. Birgitta Whaley</p>
            <p>We study the connection between exceptional points (EPs) and optimal parameter estimation, in a simple system consisting of two counter-propagating traveling wave modes in a microring resonator. The unknown parameter to be estimated is the strength of a perturbing cross-coupling between the two modes. Partially reflecting the output of one mode into the other creates a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian which exhibits a family of EPs, creating an exceptional surface (ES). We use a fully quantum treatment of field inputs and noise sources to obtain a quantitative bound on the estimation error by calculating the quantum Fisher information (QFI) in the output fields, whose inverse gives the Cramér-Rao lower bound on the mean-squared-error of any unbiased estimator. We determine the bounds for two input states, namely, a semiclassical coherent state and a highly nonclassical NOON state. We find that the QFI is enhanced in the presence of an EP for both of these input states and that both states can saturate the Cramér-Rao bound. We then identify idealized yet experimentally feasible measurements that achieve the minimum bound for these two input states. We also investigate how the QFI changes for parameter values that do not lie on the ES, finding that these can have a larger QFI, suggesting alternative routes to optimize the parameter estimation for this problem.</p>

            <h2>Sacalable architecture for measurement induced squeezed light interferometers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhinav Verma, Jacob Hastrup, Jonas S. Neergaard-Nielsen, Ulrik L. Andersen</p>
            <p>Scalable interferometers lie at the heart of photonic quantum technologies, but their expansion has been fundamentally limited by optical losses that grow with circuit depth. Here, we introduce and experimentally demonstrate a measurement-induced architecture for multimode squeezed-light interferometers that overcomes this barrier. By shifting complexity from deep optical networks to programmable homodyne measurements, we realize effective transformations within a shallow, low-loss platform. We validate the principle with a six-mode device and extend it to a 400-mode interferometer, marking a leap in scale beyond conventional designs. Crucially, this strategy not only enables scalable squeezed light interferometry but also provides a powerful route to the generation of large-scale entangled states - a key requirement for quantum computing, simulation, and communication. Our results establish measurement-induced circuits as a practical pathway toward noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) applications, and future demonstrations of quantum advantage.</p>

            <h2>Absolutely Maximal Entanglement in Continuous Variables</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> James I. Kwon, Anthony J. Brady, Victor V. Albert</p>
            <p>We explore absolutely maximal entanglement (AME) and k-uniformity in continuous-variable (CV) quantum systems, and show that-unlike in qudit systems-such entanglement is readily realizable in both Gaussian and non-Gaussian quantum states of multiple modes. We demonstrate that Gaussian CV cluster states are generically AME, rederiving the results of [Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 070501 (2009)] from a generalized stabilizer formalism, and provide explicit constructions based on Cauchy, Vandermonde, totally positive, and real-block-code generator matrices. We further extend AME properties to a family of non-Gaussian states constructed from discrete Zak basis states that incorporate grid states (a.k.a., Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill states) as non-Gaussian resources. Realizations of CV AME states enable open-destination multi-party CV teleportation, CV quantum secret sharing, CV majority-agreed key distribution, perfect-tensor networks on arbitrary geometries, and multi-unitary circuits. Our extension to non-Gaussian AME states may further provide robustness to Gaussian noise and benefits to quantum CV information processing.</p>

            <p>Understanding the optical response of a high-kinetic-inductance microwave resonator is crucial for applications ranging from single-photon detection to quantum transduction between microwave and optical domains, which is gaining significant attention for scaling up quantum computers. However, interactions between the pump light and the superconducting resonator often induce unintended resonance frequency shifts and linewidth broadening. In this study, we measure the local optical response of a NbTiN nanowire resonator using a laser-scanning microwave spectroscopy system integrated with a dilution refrigerator. The optical response of the resonator shows correlation with the resonance modes and position, which is attributed to the two-level system around the resonator. These findings not only contribute to the design and understanding of quantum transducers and single-photon detectors, but also to the understandings of catastrophic high-energy particle irradiation events that generate unintended phonons in quantum devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jie Ren, Andrew Hallam, Lei Ying, Zlatko Papić</p>
            <p>Mechanisms that give rise to coherent quantum dynamics, such as quantum many-body scars, have recently attracted much interest as a way of controlling quantum chaos. However, identifying the presence of quantum scars in general many-body Hamiltonians remains an outstanding challenge. Here we introduce ScarFinder, a variational framework that reveals possible scar-like dynamics without prior knowledge of scar states or their algebraic structure. By iteratively evolving and projecting states within a low-entanglement variational manifold, ScarFinder isolates scarred trajectories by suppressing thermal contributions. We validate the method on the analytically tractable spin-1 XY model, recovering the known scar dynamics, as well as the mixed field Ising model, where we capture and generalize the initial conditions previously associated with ``weak thermalization''. We then apply the method to the PXP model of Rydberg atom arrays, efficiently characterizing its mixed phase space and finding a previously unknown trajectory with nearly-perfect revival dynamics in the thermodynamic limit. Our results establish ScarFinder as a powerful, model-agnostic tool for identifying and optimizing coherent dynamics in quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <p>We study the classical compilation of quantum circuits for the preparation of matrix product states (MPS), which are quantum states of low entanglement with an efficient classical description. Our algorithm represents a near-term alternative to previous sequential approaches by reverse application of a disentangler, which can be found by minimizing bipartite entanglement measures after the application of a layer of parameterized disentangling gates. Since a successful disentangler is expected to decrease the bond dimension on average, such a layer-by-layer optimization remains classically efficient even for deep circuits. Additionally, as the Schmidt coefficients of all bonds are locally accessible through the canonical $\Gamma$-$\Lambda$ form of an MPS, the optimization algorithm can be heavily parallelized. We discuss guarantees and limitations to trainability and show numerical results for ground states of one-dimensional, local Hamiltonians as well as artificially spread out entanglement among multiple qubits using error correcting codes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiangwei Long, Yizhi Li, Jianxin Zhong, Lijun Meng</p>
            <p>We study systematically numerical method into constructing a universal quantum gate set for topological quantum computation (TQC) using SU(2)k anyon models. The F-matrices and R-symbol were computed through the q-deformed representation theory of SU(2), enabling precise determination of elementary braiding matrices (EBMs) for SU(2)k anyon systems. Quantum gates were derived from these EBMs. One-qubit gates were synthesized using a genetic algorithm-enhanced Solovay-Kitaev algorithm (GA-enhanced SKA), while two-qubit gates were constructed through brute-force search or GA optimization to approximate local equivalence classes [CNOT]. Implementing this framework for SU(2)5, SU(2)6, and SU(2)7 models successfully generated the canonical universal gate set {H-gate, T-gate, CNOT-gate}. These numerical results provide conclusive verification of the universal quantum computation capabilities inherent in SU(2)k anyon models. Furthermore, we get exact implementations of the local equivalence class [SWAP] using nine EBMs in each model.</p>

            <p>We investigate parametric excitation and pattern formation in a harmonically trapped two-component Bose-Einstein condensate. We assume the condensate to be in the miscible phase, but near the miscible-immiscible phase transition, where total density and spin density excitations are decoupled. By periodically modulating the atomic scattering lengths, Faraday patterns can be generated in both density and spin channels. In an elongated condensate, the pattern in the spin channel corresponds to a one-dimensional standing wave with the two components exhibiting an out-of-phase density oscillation, where the modulation frequency and the oscillation period are related to the velocity of the spin sound. After the spin pattern is fully developed, the system quickly enters a nonlinear destabilization regime. For a pancake-shaped condensate, a two-dimensional Faraday pattern is generated with an interesting l-fold rotational symmetry. The number of nodes along the radial and angular directions increases with larger modulation frequencies. We also compare the growth rates of spin Faraday patterns generated with different modulation protocols, which are accessible to current experiments.</p>

First, we verify continuous-variable entanglement by measuring an Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen entanglement parameter of 0.0132(7), which is below the threshold of 0.25 for Reid's EPR criterion. Second, we perform a continuous-variable Bell test and find a violation of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality, measuring 2.26(3), which is above the entanglement threshold of 2. We also demonstrate the flexibility of our method by preparing a non-Gaussian entangled oscillator state--a superposition of TMSV states.</p>

            <h2>On Quantum Entanglement and Nonlocality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mafiz Uddin</p>
            <p>Bell inequalities on local hidden variables were used to test particle entanglement given by the quantum mechanics wavefunction. The experiments on correlated photon pairs showed a clear violation of Bell inequalities and agreement with quantum mechanics. This study revealed that the Bell inequalities on normalized density function is true only for photon polarization at individual instances but it does not hold over the entire population in a given system. The Bell inequalities is not an incompatibility criterion for local hidden variables vs quantum mechanics rather it is a criterion for an individual nature vs population dynamics. The study found that the local variables (photon polarization) described each quantity in Bell test and a complete agreement with the experiments where quantum mechanics was incapable to provide as it is a unified system. The paper concludes with great satisfaction that the simultaneous measurement of two correlated photons at a distance was a local cause (photon-filter interaction did not violate the special theory of relativity) and the nonlocality description given by the wavefunction was not physical.</p>

We demonstrate that the deformation of energy-momentum composition induces a momentum-dependent interaction that counteracts the decoherence effects described by the Lindblad equation in quantum spacetime. This interplay leads to the formation of coherence, entanglement and other correlations, which we quantify using concurrence, the $l_1$-norm of coherence, quantum mutual information and Local Quantum Fisher Information. Our analysis reveals that while the openness of quantum spacetime ultimately degrades entanglement, it also facilitates the creation and preservation of both classical and quantum correlations.</p>

These channels are degradable for all noise parameters and in arbitrary dimensions, yielding closed-form, single-letter capacity formulas. Our analysis includes fully decohering, block-decohering, and weakly decohering channels, the latter involving coherence preservation within overlapping subspaces. Surprisingly, even under maximal decoherence, the channel may retain nonzero capacity due to residual coherence structure. These results provide quantitative role for decoherence-free and partially coherent subspaces in preserving quantum information, offering guidance for encoding strategies in quantum memories and fault-tolerant quantum communication systems.</p>

            <p>Quantum battery has become one of the hot issues at the research frontiers of quantum physics recently. Charging power, extractable work and wireless charging over long-distance are three important aspects of interest. Non-contact electromagnetic interaction provides an important avenue for wireless charging. In this paper, we design a wireless and remote charging scheme based on the quantized Hamiltonian of two coupled LC circuits, and focus on the charging dynamics of a continuous variable quantum battery. It is found that the quantum entanglement, which is regarded as a significant quantum resource, is not a prerequisite for charging the battery and extracting useful work. On the contrary, all of the energy in the battery could be converted into useful work in the absence of the entanglement for our model. The often overlooked counter-rotating wave coupling in the interacting Hamiltonian is helpful for extracting more useful work from the charger. If the coupling between the battery and the charger is designed to contain both the rotating and counter-rotating wave couplings, the extractable work can be obtained even if the charger is prepared in thermal states, while such effect cannot be achieved in the presence of a rotating or counter-rotating wave coupling alone. Finally, the effect of the system's parameters on the extractable work is discussed, which will provide a reference for full use of the thermal state energy.</p>

            <p>Any amplifier requires coupling to its internal degrees of freedom for energy gain. This coupling introduces extra quantum noise to the output. On the other hand, if the internal degree of the amplifier can be accessed and manipulated, we can manage and even reduce the quantum noise of the amplifier's output. In this paper, we present an experiment to reduce the quantum noise of a Raman amplifier by preparing the atomic medium in a correlated state with the Stokes light field. We report an observation of quantum noise reduction of more than 3.5 dB in the atomic Raman amplification process. From another perspective, the Raman amplifier at high gain in turn serves as a measurement tool for the quantum correlation between the atom and light. Furthermore, such a scheme, when viewed as a whole, also forms a quantum-entangled atom-light hybrid interferometer that can lead to quantum-enhanced sensors.</p>

            <p>Quantum machine learning (QML) has great potential for the analysis of chemical datasets. However, conventional quantum data-encoding schemes, such as fingerprint encoding, are generally unfeasible for the accurate representation of chemical moieties in such datasets. In this contribution, we introduce the quantum molecular structure encoding (QMSE) scheme, which encodes the molecular bond orders and interatomic couplings expressed as a hybrid Coulomb-adjacency matrix, directly as one- and two-qubit rotations within parameterised circuits. We show that this strategy provides an efficient and interpretable method in improving state separability between encoded molecules compared to other fingerprint encoding methods, which is especially crucial for the success in preparing feature maps in QML workflows. To benchmark our method, we train a parameterised ansatz on molecular datasets to perform classification of state phases and regression on boiling points, demonstrating the competitive trainability and generalisation capabilities of QMSE. We further prove a fidelity-preserving chain-contraction theorem that reuses common substructures to cut qubit counts, with an application to long-chain fatty acids. We expect this scalable and interpretable encoding framework to greatly pave the way for practical QML applications of molecular datasets.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alok Shukla, Prakash Vedula</p>
            <p>Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) is a cornerstone algorithm in quantum computing, with applications ranging from integer factorization to quantum chemistry simulations. However, the resource demands of standard QPE, which require a large number of coherent qubits and deep circuits, pose significant challenges for current Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. In this work, we introduce the Adaptive Windowed Quantum Phase Estimation (AWQPE) algorithm, a novel method designed to address the limitations of standard QPE. AWQPE utilizes small, independent blocks of $m > 1$ control qubits to estimate multiple phase bits simultaneously within a "window,'' thereby significantly reducing the number of iterations required to achieve a desired precision. These independent blocks are amenable to parallelization and, when combined with a robust least-significant-bit (LSB) to most-significant-bit (MSB) ambiguity resolution mechanism, enhance the algorithm's accuracy while mitigating the risk of error propagation. Our numerical simulations demonstrate AWQPE's accuracy and robustness, showcasing a distinct balance between resource efficiency and computational speed. This makes AWQPE particularly well-suited for near-term quantum platforms.</p>

            <p>We consider the task of distinguishing whether a quantum system is prepared in a state from one of several sets of quantum states. Assuming their convexity and stability under tensor product, we prove that the optimal error exponent for discrimination is precisely given by the regularized quantum Chernoff divergence between the sets, thereby establishing a generalized quantum Chernoff bound for the discrimination of multiple sets of quantum states. This extends the classical and quantum Chernoff bounds to the general setting of composite and correlated quantum hypotheses. Furthermore, leveraging minimax theorems, we show that discriminating between sets of quantum states is no harder than discriminating between their worst-case elements in terms of error probability. This implies the existence of an optimal state-agnostic test that achieves the minimum error probability for all states in the sets, matching the performance of the optimal state-dependent test for the most difficult pair of states. We provide explicit characterizations of the optimal state-agnostic test in the binary composite case. Finally, we show that the maximum overlap between a pure state and a set of free states, a quantity that frequently arises in quantum resource theories, is equal to the quantum Chernoff divergence between the sets, thereby providing an operational interpretation of this quantity in the context of symmetric hypothesis testing.</p>

            <p>This work introduces and systematically studies a new convex cone of PCOP (pairwise copositive). We establish that this cone is dual to the cone of PCP (pairwise completely positive) and, critically, provides a complete characterization for the positivity of the broad class of covariant maps. We provide a way to lift matrices from the cone of COP to PCOP, thereby creating a powerful bridge between the theory of copositive forms and the positive maps. We develop an analogous framework for decomposable maps, introducing the cone PDEC. As a primary application of this framework, we define a novel family of linear maps $\Phi_t^G$ parameterized by a graph $G$ and a real parameter $t$. We derive exact thresholds on $t$ that determine when these maps are positive or decomposable, linking these properties to fundamental graph-theoretic parameters. This construction yields vast new families of positive indecomposable maps, for which we provide explicit examples derived from infinite classes of graphs, most notably rank 3 strongly regular graphs such as Paley graphs. On the dual side, we investigate the entanglement properties of large classes of (symmetric) states. We prove that the SOS hierarchies used in polynomial optimization to approximate the cone of copositive matrices correspond precisely to dual cones of witnesses for different levels of the PPT bosonic extendibility hierarchy}-. In the setting of the DPS hierarchy for separability, we construct a large family of optimal entanglement witnesses that are not certifiable by any level of the PPT bosonic extendibility hierarchy, answering a long standing open question from [DPS04]. Leveraging the duality, we also provide an explicit construction of (mixture of) bipartite Dicke states that are simultaneously entangled and $K_r$-PPT bosonic extendible for any desired hierarchy level $r \geq 2$ and local dimension $n \geq 5$.</p>

We show that local homodyne detection achieves a quadratic scaling of precision with the total number of photons. We further analyze the impact of thermal noise in the preparation stage on both privacy and estimation precision.

            <p>Joint spectral measurements are a powerful tool for characterising biphoton spectral correlation, which is crucial for quantum information and communication technologies. In these applications, highly pure biphoton states are essential in any time- and frequency-mode, often obviating the need for time-resolved measurements. Conversely, spectroscopy utilising entangled photon pairs is gaining significant attention for its ability to unveil molecular dynamics, a field that critically demands time-resolved capabilities. Here, we introduce a novel methodology for capturing a biphoton spectrum that comprises visible and near-infrared photons, resulting in a three-fold non-degenerate joint spectrum. Our system employs two non-scanning spectrographs: a fibre spectrograph for near-infrared photons and a delay-line-anode single-photon imager for visible photons. We successfully measure the joint spectral intensity by leveraging a time-tagging acquisition strategy. Furthermore, our approach uniquely enables time-resolved joint spectral measurements with a temporal resolution of approximately 150 ps. This methodology bridges the gap between the requirements for pure biphoton states and the need for dynamic insights in quantum spectroscopy.</p>

However, the use of the strong nonlinearities in circuit quantum electrodynamics has recently enabled the observation of Three-Photon SPDC (3P-SPDC). Despite great interest in the entanglement structure of the resultant states, entanglement between photon triplets produced by a 3P-SPDC source has still has not been confirmed. Here, we report on the observation of genuine tripartite non-Gaussian entanglement in the steady-state output field of a 3P-SPDC source consisting of a superconducting parametric cavity coupled to a transmission line. We study this non-Gaussian tripartite entanglement using an entanglement witness built from three-mode correlation functions, and observe a maximum violation of the bound by 23 standard deviations of the statistical noise. Furthermore, we find strong agreement between the observed and the analytically predicted scaling of the entanglement witness. We then explore the impact of the temporal function used to define the photon mode on the observed value of the entanglement witness.</p>

            <h2>Fast-forwardable Lindbladians imply quantum phase estimation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhong-Xia Shang, Naixu Guo, Patrick Rebentrost, Alán Aspuru-Guzik, Tongyang Li, Qi Zhao</p>
            <p>Quantum phase estimation (QPE) and Lindbladian dynamics are both foundational in quantum information science and central to quantum algorithm design. In this work, we bridge these two concepts: certain simple Lindbladian processes can be adapted to perform QPE-type tasks. However, unlike QPE, which achieves Heisenberg-limit scaling, these Lindbladian evolutions are restricted to standard quantum limit complexity. This indicates that, different from Hamiltonian dynamics, the natural dissipative evolution speed of such Lindbladians does not saturate the fundamental quantum limit, thereby suggesting the potential for quadratic fast-forwarding. We confirm this by presenting a quantum algorithm that simulates these Lindbladians for time $t$ within an error $\varepsilon$ using $\mathcal{O}\left(\sqrt{t\log(\varepsilon^{-1})}\right)$ cost, whose mechanism is fundamentally different from the fast-forwarding examples of Hamiltonian dynamics. As a bonus, this fast-forwarded simulation naturally serves as a new Heisenberg-limit QPE algorithm. Therefore, our work explicitly bridges the standard quantum limit-Heisenberg limit transition to the fast-forwarding of dissipative dynamics. We also adopt our fast-forwarding algorithm for efficient Gibbs state preparation and demonstrate the counter-intuitive implication: the allowance of a quadratically accelerated decoherence effect under arbitrary Pauli noise.</p>

            <p>Topology optimization is a key methodology in engineering design for finding efficient and robust structures. Due to the enormous size of the design space, evaluating all possible configurations is typically infeasible. In this work, we present an end-to-end, fault-tolerant quantum algorithm for topology optimization that operates on the exponential Hilbert space representing the design space. We demonstrate the algorithm on the two-dimensional Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm (MBB) beam problem. By restricting design variables to binary values, we reformulate the compliance minimization task as a combinatorial satisfiability problem solved using Grover's algorithm. Within Grover's oracle, the compliance is computed through the finite-element method (FEM) using established quantum algorithms, including block-encoding of the stiffness matrix, Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) for matrix inversion, Hadamard test, and Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE). The complete algorithm is implemented and validated using classical quantum-circuit simulations. A detailed complexity analysis shows that the method evaluates the compliance of exponentially many structures in quantum superposition in polynomial time. In the global search, our approach maintains Grover's quadratic speedup compared to classical unstructured search. Overall, the proposed quantum workflow demonstrates how quantum algorithms can advance the field of computational science and engineering.</p>

Although superseded by the Dirac equation and modern quantum electrodynamics, the semiclassical approach offers a historically and pedagogically valuable perspective. Using the Sommerfeld fine structure formula and computer algebra methods, we demonstrate the appearance of self-intersecting orbits in super strong Coulomb fields, beginning with Oganesson and hypothetical elements up to $Z\le137$. These orbits can be classified by their `winding' numbers, providing a simple topological description of Coulomb field strength in this framework.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vanessa Brzić, Satoshi Yoshida, Mio Murao, Marco Túlio Quintino</p>
            <p>In higher-order quantum computing (HOQC), one typically considers the universal transformation of unknown quantum operations, treated as blackboxes. It is also implicitly assumed that the resulting operation must act on arbitrary, and thus unknown, input states. In this work, we explore a variant of this framework in which the operation remains unknown, but the input state is fixed and known. We argue that this assumption is well-motivated in certain practical contexts, such as unitary programming, and show that classical knowledge of the input state can significantly enhance performance. We demonstrate that in the SAR protocol, this knowledge leads to an exponential advantage through a repeat-until-success strategy, highlighting the operational power of known-state higher-order transformations. Moreover, this assumption allows us to distinguish between protocols designed for pure, bipartite, and mixed states, which enables us to identify the class of mixed states for which deterministic and exact implementation becomes possible.</p>

            <p>Clustering on NISQ hardware is constrained by data loading and limited qubits. We present \textbf{qc-kmeans}, a hybrid compressive $k$-means that summarizes a dataset with a constant-size Fourier-feature sketch and selects centroids by solving small per-group QUBOs with shallow QAOA circuits. The QFF sketch estimator is unbiased with mean-squared error $O(\varepsilon^2)$ for $B,S=\Theta(\varepsilon^{-2})$, and the peak-qubit requirement $q_{\text{peak}}=\max\{D,\lceil \log_2 B\rceil + 1\}$ does not scale with the number of samples. A refinement step with elitist retention ensures non-increasing surrogate cost. In Qiskit Aer simulations (depth $p{=}1$), the method ran with $\le 9$ qubits on low-dimensional synthetic benchmarks and achieved competitive sum-of-squared errors relative to quantum baselines; runtimes are not directly comparable. On nine real datasets (up to $4.3\times 10^5$ points), the pipeline maintained constant peak-qubit usage in simulation. Under IBM noise models, accuracy was similar to the idealized setting. Overall, qc-kmeans offers a NISQ-oriented formulation with shallow, bounded-width circuits and competitive clustering quality in simulation.</p>

In particular, we show how the Binomial, Poisson, and Gaussian distributions naturally emerge from entangled system--environment states. Furthermore, we resolve the Gibbs paradox using entanglement entropy, obtaining the Sackur--Tetrode equation with quantum corrections. Extending this framework, we derive a modified Saha equation for ionization equilibrium and recover Bose--Einstein and Fermi--Dirac statistics from quantum symmetries. Our results reinforce and extend the view that statistical mechanics arises as a direct consequence of quantum information dynamics, rather than being founded on phenomenological postulates.</p>

            <p>We propose and analyze a hybrid quantum repeater architecture that combines two leading hardware platforms: quantum dots (QDs) as bright, deterministic sources of entangled photon pairs and group-IV-vacancy centers in diamond as efficient, heralded quantum memories. This combination leverages high-rate entanglement generation together with long-lived storage, enabling scalable entanglement distribution over long distances. A key challenge is the large bandwidth mismatch between QD photons and the narrow optical transitions of the memories. We combine a comprehensive model of the spin-photon interface, including full spin-photon coupling dynamics, and explore mitigation strategies such as frequency filtering and optimized magnetic-field orientation. Our results show that with optimized designs, photon-to-memory transfer can be achieved with high efficiency and fidelity, supporting the feasibility of such hybrid systems. Finally, we analyze a full repeater chain using experimentally achievable parameters and find that a network with thousands of memories across several repeater nodes could achieve a secret-key rate of 500 bit/s over 1,000 km, demonstrating the strong potential of this approach for next-generation quantum networks.</p>

            <p>We introduce shallow instantaneous quantum polynomial-time (IQP) circuits as generative graph models, using an edge-qubit encoding to map graphs onto quantum states. Focusing on bipartite and Erdős-Rényi distributions, we study their expressivity and robustness through simulations and large-scale experiments. Noiseless simulations of $28$ qubits ($8$-node graphs) reveal that shallow IQP models can learn key structural features, such as the edge density and bipartite partitioning. On IBM's Aachen QPU, we scale experiments from $28$ to $153$ qubits ($8$-$18$ nodes) in order to characterize performance on real quantum hardware. Local statistics, such as the degree distributions, remain accurate across scales with total variation distances ranging from $0.04$ to $0.20$, while global properties like strict bipartiteness degrade at the largest system sizes ($91$ and $153$ qubits). Notably, spectral bipartivity, a relaxation of strict bipartiteness, remains comparatively robust at higher qubit counts. These results establish practical baselines for the performance of shallow IQP circuits on current quantum hardware and demonstrate that, even without error mitigation, such circuits can learn and reproduce meaningful structural patterns in graph data, guiding future developments in quantum generative modeling for the NISQ era and beyond.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuan Gong, Yan-Xue Cheng, Wei Xiong, Jiaojiao Chen</p>
            <p>Cavity magnonics, owing to its strong magnon-photon coupling and excellent tunability, has attracted significant interest in quantum information science. However, achieving strong and robust macroscopic entanglement remains a long-standing challenge due to the inherently linear nature of the beam-splitter interaction. Here, we propose an experimentally feasible scheme to generate and enhance macroscopic entanglement between two remote magnon modes by injecting squeezed vacuum fields (SVFs) into coupled microwave cavities. We demonstrate that even a single SVF applied to one cavity can induce steady magnon-magnon entanglement, while applying two SVFs (the double-squeezed configuration) enables selective activation of two independent entanglement channels associated with the cavity supermodes. Remarkably, quantum interference between the two SVFs allows for phase-controlled enhancement of entanglement, resulting in significantly improved robustness against cavity dissipation and thermal noise. Under realistic parameters, the survival temperature of quantum entanglement increases from approximately $260$ mK to $450$ mK. Our results establish a versatile and controllable approach to generating and enhancing quantum entanglement through double-squeezed-field interference, opening new avenues to study and enhance macroscopic quantum physics in cavity-magnon systems with only beam-splitter interactions.</p>

            <p>Massive quantum systems have emerged as compelling tabletop interface-systems for testing the quantum nature of gravity. However, conventional schemes that focus on directly using gravity to induce entanglement suffer from overwhelming environmental decoherence: maintaining entanglement between two oscillators requires an impractically high mechanical quality factor. In this work, we put forward an alternative reservoir-engineered scheme, whose core function is to quantify how gravity modifies (rather than prepares) the steady-state entanglement. Compared to quantum gravity, classical gravity introduces additional dissipative channels, which in turn give rise to distinct entanglement characteristics and thus enable the discrimination between the two types of gravity. Notably, this entanglement difference can still be maintained even when the mechanical quality factor is far below the threshold required by conventional schemes. Moreover, it demonstrates significant robustness against non-gravitational couplings, specifically, those like Casimir and Coulomb forces that are inherent in experimental setups. Our scheme relaxes the experimental requirements for verifying quantum gravity, thereby paving a new path toward its near-term realization.</p>

In the paper we propose to enhance classical shadow methods using bootstrap resampling methods. We apply nonparametric bootstrapping to assess the variability and accuracy of estimators by repeatedly sampling with replacement from the observed data, i.e. in our case the classical shadow measurements. We show that the bootstrap distributions are very different from the Gaussian approximations. Likewise, the theoretical error bounds are not tight compared to the bootstrap percentiles. Finally, we suggest using resampling tools to make risk assessments.</p>

            <p>We gain quantitative insights on effects of light-matter interactions on correlated quantum matter by quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We introduce a wormhole algorithm for the paradigmatic Dicke-Ising model which combines the light-matter interaction of the Dicke model with Ising interactions. The quantum phase diagram for ferro- and antiferromagnetic interactions on the chain and the square lattice is determined. The occurring superradiant phase transitions are in the same universality class as the Dicke model leading to a well-known peculiar finite-size scaling that we elucidate in terms of scaling above the upper critical dimension. For the ferromagnetic case, the transition between the normal and the superradiant phase is of second order with Dicke criticality (first order) for large (small) longitudinal fields separated by a multicritical point. For antiferromagnetic interactions, we establish the light-matter analogue of a lattice supersolid with off-diagonal superradiant and diagonal magnetic order and determine the nature of all transition lines.</p>

In quantum many-body systems and quantum field theory (QFT), we discuss a geometric definition of complexity in terms of geodesics on the unitary group. In dynamical systems, we explore a definition of complexity in terms of state or operator spreading, as well as concepts from tensor-networks. We also outline applications to simple quantum systems, quantum many-body models, and QFTs including conformal field theories (CFTs).

Recently, it has been demonstrated that the recursion method, when supplemented by the universal operator growth hypothesis, can effectively compute autocorrelation functions and transport coefficients at infinite temperature. We extend the scope of the recursion method to far-from-equilibrium quench dynamics. We apply the method to spin systems in one, two, and three spatial dimensions. In one dimension its usefulness is limited: although it remains accurate at moderate times, it eventually experiences an abrupt breakdown and subsequently yields results that deviate strongly from the true dynamics. In contrast, in two and three dimensions the method proves far more effective, providing a reasonably accurate description of the evolution across all time scales -- from the initial transient regime to thermalization.</p>

            <p>This work analyses the extent to which the "blurred orbits" of the current model for the atom, drafted by Heisenberg in 1926, fits the image of a bunch of wandering electrons around a nucleus. We will deal with early appearances of the concept of indistinguishable particles within the frame of quantum mechanics. There are few studies on the use of this concept in Heisenberg's 1926 papers on helium, in contrast with the large number of them on its use in Bose--Einstein's 1924 papers. We will discuss to what extent Heisenberg's approach leads to a purely statistical interpretation of this concept. We will also study the viewpoint of Dirac, who dealt with the same topic few months later. Although the indistinguishability of the electrons and indeterminacy are common explanations for the blurring of electron orbits, we argue that such an image is an oversimplification which masks interesting aspects of: a) the dynamics of bound electrons and b) the deeper implications of indistinguishability in quantum mechanics.</p>

            <p>The atom-cavity system is a versatile platform for emulating light-matter systems and realizing dissipation-induced phases, such as limit cycles (LCs) and time crystals. Here, we study the dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) inside an optical cavity with transverse pumping and an additional intracavity optical lattice along the cavity axis. Specifically, we explore the theoretical predictions obtained from expanding the atomic field operators of the second-quantized Hamiltonian in two ways: (i) position basis and (ii) single-band Wannier basis. Both bases agree on the existence of most types of static and dynamical phases. However, the large sea of irregular dynamical phase, captured within the position basis, is absent in the Wannier basis. Moreover, we show that they predict different types of LCs due to the inherent limitation of the single-band Wannier expansion, highlighting the importance of including higher energy bands to correctly capture certain phenomena. Using truncated Wigner approximation, we investigate the fragmentation dynamics of the BEC. We demonstrate that both position and Wannier bases qualitatively agree on the photon-mediated fragmentation dynamics of the BEC in the density-wave phase, despite the absence of interatomic interactions. The presence of interatomic interaction leads to further fragmentation, which can only be observed in larger system sizes. Finally, we predict a sudden increase in the fragmentation behavior for larger pump intensities.</p>

As an alternative to the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), the Lanczos algorithm avoids local minima and can directly find multiple low-lying eigenstates.

In this work, we propose the modified thick-block Lanczos method to enhance the convergence of the Lanczos algorithm with MPS representation. We benchmark our method on one-dimensional instances of the Fermi-Hubbard model and the Heisenberg model in an external field, using numerical experiments targeting the first five lowest eigenstates. Across these tests, our approach attains the best possible accuracy permitted by the given bond dimension.

            <p>Systems exhibiting the Hilbert-space fragmentation are nonergodic, and their Hamiltonians decompose into exponentially many blocks in the computational basis. In many cases, these blocks can be labeled by eigenvalues of statistically localized integrals of motion (SLIOM), which play a similar role in fragmented systems as local integrals of motion in integrable systems. While a nonzero perturbation eliminates all nontrivial conserved quantities from integrable models, we demonstrate for the $t$-$J_z$ chain that an appropriately chosen perturbation may gradually eliminate SLIOMs (one by one) by progressively merging the fragmented subspaces. This gradual recovery of ergodicity manifests as an extended critical regime characterized by multiple peaks of the fidelity susceptibility. Each peak signals a change in the number of SLIOMs and blocks, as well as an ultra-slow relaxation of local observables.</p>

In such a system, a photonic band gap opens up, yielding an efficient Bragg reflection for an incident field incoming with the right angle and detuning. Here, we report two new effects appearing in the Bragg reflection. First, for some detunings, there is a ``flash'', i.e., a transient increase of the reflected intensity when the incident field is switched off. Second, the subsequent extinction of the reflected field is clearly superradiant, with decay rates up to height times the natural decay rate of the atomic excited state. Numerical simulations are in qualitative agreement with the observations, which can be explained by a classical photonic model. Our results are a step towards exploiting this photonic band gap in atomic systems for quantum-optical applications.</p>

            <p>We present MetaTT, a Tensor Train (TT) adapter framework for fine-tuning of pre-trained transformers. MetaTT enables flexible and parameter-efficient model adaptation by using a single shared TT to factorize transformer sub-modules. This factorization indexes key structural dimensions, including layer and matrix type, and can optionally incorporate heads and tasks. This design allows MetaTT's parameter count to scale with the sum, rather than the product, of the modes, resulting in a substantially more compact adapter. Our benchmarks compare MetaTT with LoRA along with recent state-of-the-art matrix and tensor decomposition based fine-tuning methods. We observe that when tested on single-task standard language modeling benchmarks, MetaTT achieves competitive parameter efficiency to accuracy tradeoff. We further demonstrate that MetaTT performs competitively when compared to state-of-the-art methods on multi-task learning. Finally, we leverage the TT-ansatz to design a rank adaptive optimizer inspired by the DMRG method from many-body physics. Our results demonstrate that integrating this approach with AdamW enhances optimization performance for a specified target rank.</p>

            <p>The one-dimensional (1D) $J_1-J_2$ quantum spin model can be viewed as a strong-coupling analogue of the Schrieffer-Su-Heeger model with two inequivalent alternating Ising couplings along the wire, associated to the physics of resonating valence bonds. Similar to the quantum Ising model, which differently presents a long-range N\' eel ordered phase, this model also maps onto a p-wave superconducting wire which shows a topological phase transition with the emergence of low-energy Majorana fermions. We show how signatures of the topological phase transition for the p-wave superconducting wire, i.e. a half Skyrmion, are revealed through local (short-range) spin observables and their derivatives related to the capacitance of the pairing fermion model. Then, we present an edge correspondence through the edge spin susceptibility in the $J_1-J_2$ model revealing that the topological phase transition is a metal of Majorana fermions. We justify that the spin magnetization at an edge at very small transverse magnetic field is a good marker of the topological invariant and of Majorana zero modes. We identify a correspondence between the quantum information of resonating valence bonds and the charge fluctuations in a p-wave superconductor through our method "the bipartite fluctuations". Physical properties of this 1D model are in fact robust when including additional interactions, which is optimistic for practical applications e.g. in quantum circuits.</p>

            <h2>Nitrogen-Vacancy Emission from Nanodiamond: Size, Depth, and Surroundings</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Harini Hapuarachchi, Francesco Campaioli, Jared H Cole, Andrew D Greentree, Qiang Sun</p>
            <p>The negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is a leading solid-state quantum emitter, offering spin-photon interfaces over a wide temperature range with applications from electromagnetic sensing to bioimaging. While NV centers in bulk diamond are well understood, embedding them in nanodiamond (ND) introduces complexities from size, NV location, and NV polarizations. NVs in ND show altered fluorescence properties including longer lifetimes, lower quantum efficiency, and higher sensitivity to dielectric surroundings, which arise from radiative suppression, surface-induced non-radiative decay, and escape inefficiency at the diamond-background interface. Prior models typically addressed isolated aspects, such as dielectric contrast or surface quenching, without integrating full quantum-optical NV behavior with classical electrodynamics. We present a hybrid framework coupling rigorous electromagnetic simulations with a quantum-optical NV model including phonon sideband dynamics. NV emission is found to depend strongly on ND size, NV position, and surrounding refractive index. Our results explain observations such as shallow NVs in water-coated ND appearing brighter than deeper ones in air. This integrated model provide a unified framework for realistic NV in ND emission scenarios and informs the design of efficient NV-based sensors and quantum devices, advancing understanding of quantum emitter photophysics in nanoscale crystals.</p>

            <p>Magnon spintronics aims to harness spin waves in magnetic films for information technologies. Color center magnetometry is a promising tool for imaging spin waves, using electronic spins associated with atomic defects in solid-state materials as sensors. However, two main limitations persist: the magnetic fields required for spin-wave control detune the sensor-spin detection frequency, and this frequency is further restricted by the color center nature. Here, we overcome these limitations by decoupling the sensor spins from the spin-wave control fields -selecting color centers with intrinsic anisotropy axes orthogonal to the film magnetization- and by using color centers in diamond and hexagonal boron nitride to operate at complementary frequencies. We demonstrate isofrequency imaging of field-controlled spin waves in a magnetic half-plane and show how intrinsic magnetic anisotropies trigger bistable spin textures that govern spin-wave transport at device edges. Our results establish color center magnetometry as a versatile tool for advancing spin-wave technologies.</p>

            <h2>Optical field characterization at the fundamental limit of spatial resolution with a trapped ion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nikhil Kotibhaskar, Sainath Motlakunta, Anthony Vogliano, Lewis Hahn, Rajibul Islam</p>
            <p>Optical systems capable of generating fields with sub-wavelength spatial features have become standard in science and engineering research and industry. Pertinent examples include atom- and ion-based quantum computers and optical lithography setups. So far, no tools exist to characterize such fields - both intensity and polarization - at sub-wavelength length scales. We use a single trapped atomic ion, confined to approximately 40 nm X 40 nm X 180 nm to sense a laser light field at a wavelength of 370 nm. With its spatial extent smaller than the absorption cross-section of a resonant detector, the ion-sensor operates at the fundamental limit of spatial resolution. Our technique relies on developing an analytical model of the ion-light interaction and using the model to extract the intensity and polarization. An important insight provided in this work is also that the inverse of this model can be learned, in a restricted sense, on a deep neural network, speeding up the intensity and polarization readout by five orders of magnitude. This speed-up makes the technique field-deployable to characterize optical instruments by probing light at the sub-wavelength scale.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zheng-Han Huang, Jing-Yuan Lai, Yu-Shu G. Wu</p>
            <p>For nanoscale single-layer graphene-based devices, valley-dependent topological physics may be exploited in device design. To demonstrate the point, we investigate an electrical bias-controlled, topological kind discontinuity in valley polarization, in a two-segment armchair nanoribbon of single-layer graphene, where the discontinuity is created at the interface by applying opposite in-plane, transverse electrical biases to the two segments. In particular, using an efficient tight-binding theoretical formulation, we explicitly obtain energy eigenvalues and probability distributions of discontinuity-induced, interface-confined electron eigenstates, in a reference configuration. Moreover, implications of the confinement for electron transport are explored. A configurational variation is introduced to transform the eigenstates into transport-active, quasi-localized ones. Such states are shown to result in Fano "anti-resonances" in transmission spectra. The resilience of the quasi-localized states and their associated Fano fingerprints is presented with respect to configurational fluctuations. Last, a proof-of-concept electron energy band-stop filter is illustrated, highlighting the potential of the foregoing confinement and, more broadly, valley-dependent topological physics in designing nanoscale single-layer graphene devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jui-Yin Lin, Tomoyuki Tani, Mikhail Belianchikov, Denis Konstantinov</p>
            <p>Radio-frequency reflectometry, which probes small changes in the electrical impedance of a device, provides a useful method for sensitive and fast detection of dynamic processes in quantum systems. We use this method to detect excitation of the quantized motional (Rydberg) states of trapped electrons on liquid helium. The Rydberg transition in an ensemble of electrons is detected by a change in the impedance of an rf circuit coupled to the microwave-excited electrons. To elucidate the origin of the observed response, the result is compared with an independent impedance measurement on the same electron system modulated by an electrostatic potential and with a numerical simulation using the Green's function method. Additionally, it is found that the rf response to the Rydberg resonance can be strongly enhanced by a resonant mode of the electron collective motion. Our results suggest that the observed response to the Rydberg resonance must be attributed to the lateral motion of the many-electron system rather than the vertical displacement of the individually excited electrons, as was explicate earlier. A theoretical analysis of the expected response due to the vertical displacement is given.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Bayer, M. Vieweg, K.P. Schmidt</p>
            <p>We present a solvable one-dimensional spin-1/2 model on the diamond chain featuring three-spin interactions, which displays both, mobile excitations driving a second-order phase transition between an ordered and a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetry broken phase, as well as non-trivial fully immobile excitations. The model is motivated by the physics of fracton excitations, which only possess mobility in a reduced dimension compared to the full model. We provide an exact mapping of this model to an arbitrary number of independent transverse-field Ising chain segments with open boundary conditions. The number and lengths of these segments correspond directly to the number of immobile excitations and their respective distances from one another. Furthermore, we demonstrate that multiple immobile excitations exhibit Casimir-like forces between them, resulting in a non-trivial spectrum.</p>

Here we report a procedure for fabricating low-damage nanostructured diamond membranes, and we show that this fabrication scheme preserves the optical and spin properties of state-of-the-art shallow NV center quantum sensors, within nanometers of the diamond surface, while providing significant photonic enhancement.

            <p>Quantum phase imaging enables the analysis of transparent samples with thickness and refractive index variations in scenarios requiring precise measurements under low-light conditions. Recent advances in nonlinear metasurfaces offer compact solutions for quantum light generation and manipulation. Here, we present a compact quantum phase imaging system integrating a lithium niobate (LiNbO3) metasurface for generating spatially entangled photon pairs and a silicon (Si) metasurface for phase gradient extraction. The LiNbO3 metasurface enables efficient spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) with angularly dispersed, tunable emission, while the Si metasurface employs a nearly linear optical transfer function (OTF) to differentiate phase and extract phase gradients via spatial quantum correlations. This dual-metasurface enabled combined ghost imaging and all-optical scanning protocols with quantum light achieves phase gradient reconstruction without mechanical tuning. Experimental results demonstrate the system's ability to resolve phase gradients up to 25 rad/mm with 88% fidelity using a 6x3-pixel proof-of-concept setup. In addition, theoretically, it is confirmed that the resolution of the system is primarily limited by the quality factor of the compact design, leveraging nonlocal resonances and quantum correlations, establishes a new paradigm for portable quantum phase-gradient imaging, with potential applications in sensing, microscopy, and LiDAR. This work highlights the application of metasurface in both generating and detecting quantum states.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aqsa Mushtaq, Chaimae Banouni, Mahboob Ul Haq, S. M. Zangi</p>
            <p>We investigate the dynamics of key quantum correlations - Negativity (NG), Quantum Discord (QD), and Quantum-Memory-Assisted Entropic Uncertainty (QM-EUR) - in a bipartite two-qubit system under the influence of external pulses and various decoherence channels, including amplitude damping (gamma_amp), pure dephasing (gamma_deph), and pulse-induced dephasing (G), while different regimes of inter-qubit coupling (Jzz, Jxx), qubit energy splitting (epsilon), and pulse parameters (A_pulse, beta_pulse) are explored. Our results show that inter-qubit coupling and energy splitting epsilon significantly influence the dynamics, producing pronounced oscillations in the weak-coupling regime and protecting pre-existing entanglement in the strong-coupling regime. NG is the most sensitive, QD persists longer revealing nonclassical correlations independent of entanglement, and QM-EUR reflects residual quantum memory and entropic uncertainty, showing that quantum signatures survive even when NG and QD are weak. Pulse amplitude and width effectively control the generation and dissipation of correlations, while the intensity of pulse-induced dephasing modulates the balance between sustained oscillations and rapid decoherence. The initial state also plays a crucial role: a partially entangled initial state is more resilient to perturbations, preserving correlations over time, whereas a separable state exhibits cycles of entanglement creation and destruction. Thus, by adjusting system parameters, it is possible to control the stability and lifetime of correlations and coherence, providing a framework to optimize quantum systems for applications requiring both strong entanglement and long-lasting coherence, such as quantum computing and secure communication.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement boosting: Low-volume logical Bell pair preparation for distributed fault-tolerant quantum computation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shinichi Sunami, Yutaka Hirano, Toshihide Hinokuma, Hayata Yamasaki</p>
            <p>Distributed architecture is a promising route to scaling fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) beyond the inherent limitations of single processors. For practical implementation of distributed FTQC, logical Bell pair preparation must be designed not only for efficient Bell pair consumption but also for the spacetime volume of the protocol; however, entanglement distillation protocols have primarily focused on minimizing the consumption of Bell pairs, often resulting in protocols that require a substantial number of local operations. To resolve this issue, we introduce a metric for characterizing the practical cost of preparing high-fidelity logical Bell pairs, link-limited volume (LLV), which is a circuit-volume metric incorporating both the cost of physical Bell pair consumption and the volume associated with local operations. Guided by this metric, we propose entanglement boosting protocol, which achieves efficient preparation of logical Bell pairs encoded in rotated surface code with LLV reduced by orders of magnitude compared to prior state-of-the-art methods. In this protocol, paralleling recent advances in magic state cultivation, we employ soft-information decoders and postselection to suppress the logical error rates of Bell pairs to practical levels in the order of $10^{-10}$ from fewer than 100 noisy physical Bell pairs while all local operations are implementable within a spatial region of a single surface code patch. We also present a pipelined implementation of entanglement distillation using high-rate quantum error-correcting codes, enabling arbitrarily low logical error rates while also maintaining physically efficient implementations. These results pave the way for the practical implementation of distributed FTQC, reinforcing the benefits of fast interconnect technologies and serving as a guiding principle for the efficient design of protocols and devices.</p>

            <p>Understanding the influence of atmospheric turbulence on the propagation of entangled biphoton states is essential for free-space quantum communication protocols. Using the extended Huygens-Fresnel principle and the Kolmogorov turbulence model, we derive an analytical expression for the combined density operator of the signal and idler fields generated via SPDC, following propagation through separate turbulent channels. By expressing this density operator in the continuous position basis, we show how the spatial correlations between signal and idler persist through turbulence despite the loss of state purity, as they transition from being quantum to classical in nature. We further identify a finite range of propagation distances over which the angle-OAM entanglement is maximized, which provides valuable insights for designing free-space quantum communication links operating over several kilometers through the turbulent atmosphere.</p>

            <p>High-precision clock synchronization is essential for a wide range of network-distributed applications. In the quantum space, these applications include communication, sensing, and positioning. However, current synchronization techniques are vulnerable to attacks, such as intercept-resend attacks, spoofing, and delay attacks. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a new quantum secure time transfer (QSTT) system, subsequently used for clock synchronization, that largely negates such attacks. Novel to our system is the optimal use of self-generated quantum keys within the QSTT to information-theoretically secure the maximum amount of timing data; as well as the introduction, within a hybrid quantum/post-quantum architecture, of an information-theoretic secure obfuscated encryption sequence of the remaining timing data. With these enhancements, we argue that our new system represents the most robust implementation of QSTT to date.</p>

To illuminate this phenomenon, we study an ensemble of two-level systems (TLS) and establish its associated nonlinear quantum master equation, for which self-consistent analytical solutions of quantum synchronization can be obtained. The trajectories on the Bloch sphere vividly illustrate how dissipation and interaction drive the system toward a synchronized state. We present a phase diagram for macroscopic synchronization as a function of interaction strength and the gain-to-damping ratio. Furthermore, we demonstrate full synchronization and partial synchronization between two groups of TLS with different natural frequencies. This work establishes ensemble of TLS as a remarkable system for understanding spontaneous quantum synchronization.</p>

            <p>Quantum error correction (QEC) requires non-invasive measurements for fault tolerant quantum computing. Deviations from ideal quantum non-demolition (QND) measurements can disturb the encoded information. To address this challenge, we develop a readout protocol for a $D-$dimensional system that, after a single positive outcome, switches to probing only the $D{-}1$ remaining subspace. This adaptive switching strategy minimizes measurement-induced errors by relying on negative-result measurement results that do not perturb the Hamiltonian. We apply the protocol on an 8-dimensional $^{123}{\rm Sb}$ nuclear qudit in silicon, and achieve an increase in the readout fidelity from $(98.93\pm0.07)\%$ to $(99.61\pm0.04)\%$, while reducing threefold the overall readout time. To highlight the broader relevance of measurement-induced errors, we study a 10-dimensional $^{73}{\rm Ge}$ nuclear spin read out through Pauli spin blockade, revealing nuclear spin flips arising from hyperfine and quadrupole interactions. These results unveil the effect of non-ideal QND readout across diverse platforms, and introduce an efficient readout protocol that can be implemented with minimal FPGA logic on existing hardware.</p>

            <p>The Riemann Hypothesis (RH), one of the most profound unsolved problems in mathematics, concerns the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function. Establishing connections between the RH and physical phenomena could offer new perspectives on its physical origin and verification. Here, we establish a direct correspondence between the nontrivial zeros of the zeta function and dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) in two realizable quantum systems, characterized by the averaged accumulated phase factor and the Loschmidt amplitude, respectively. This precise correspondence reveals that the RH can be viewed as the emergence of DQPTs at a specific temperature. We experimentally demonstrate this correspondence on a five-qubit spin-based system and further propose an universal quantum simulation framework for efficiently realizing both systems with polynomial resources, offering a quantum advantage for numerical verification of the RH. These findings uncover an intrinsic link between nonequilibrium critical dynamics and the RH, positioning quantum computing as a powerful platform for exploring one of mathematics' most enduring conjectures and beyond.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lijuan Dong, Aanal Jayesh Shah, Peter Kirton, Hadiseh Alaeian, Simone Felicetti</p>
            <p>Analogous to Coulomb blockade for electrons, photon blockade is a key quantum optical effect in which the presence of one photon prevents the transmission of subsequent ones through a nonlinear medium. Beyond its fundamental interest, photon and multi-photon blockade are actively studied as mechanisms for generating technologically-relevant quantum states of light. Although photon blockade typically requires achieving strong light-matter coupling, increasing the number of atoms fails to enhance antibunching. Here, we analyze the optical transmission properties of a quantum resonator that embeds a two-photon-coupled ensemble of emitters, combining an approximate analytical approach with full quantum numerical simulations. We show that when light and matter are coupled via a two-photon interaction, both single- and multi-photon blockade can benefit from a collective enhancement. We propose different driving schemes in which the second or third-order correlation functions are strongly suppressed with increasing atom number. Differently from established methods, this collective enhancement of non-classical properties occurs with unitary transmission and is ultimately constrained only by decoherence. This demonstrates that collective two-photon couplings are a powerful mechanism for realizing photon blockade even in platforms where individual strong coupling is not achievable.</p>

An applied AC bias magnetic field lifts the zero-field degeneracy of the four crystallographic NV orientations, allowing each orientation to be individually addressed and used for vector reconstruction of the magnetic field. The resulting magnetometer has a 40\% contrast (20x higher than typical for optical spin-ensemble readout) and achieves a single-axis sensitivity of 250 pT/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ which is flat from DC to 1 kHz. Noise models of the composite spin-cavity system establish MW amplitude noise as the dominant noise source and predict a thermal noise limit of 2 pT/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$.</p>

            <p>The use of quantum light to probe exciton properties in semiconductor and molecular nanostructures typically occurs in the low-intensity regime. A substantial enhancement of exciton-photon coupling can be achieved with photonic cavities, where excitons hybridize with cavity modes to form polariton states. To provide a theoretical framework for interpreting experimental efforts in this direction, we develop a scattering theory describing the interaction of frequency-entangled photon pairs with cavity polariton and bipolariton states under various coupling regimes. Employing the Tavis-Cummings model in combination with our scattering approach, we present a quantitative analysis of how the interaction of the entangled photon pair with the polariton/bipolariton modifies its joint spectral amplitude (JSA). Specifically, we examine the effects of the cavity-mode steady-state population, exciton-cavity coupling strength, and different forms of the input photon JSA. Our results show that the entanglement entropy of the scattered photons is highly sensitive to the interplay between the input JSA and the spectral line shapes of the polariton resonances, emphasizing the cavity filtering effects. We suggest that biphoton scattering quantum light spectroscopy best serves as a sensitive probe of polariton and bipolariton states in the photon-vacuum cavity state.</p>

            <p>We analyze a simple and efficient experimental protocol to cool the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model to low temperatures. The protocol utilizes local couplings between two copies of an SYK model to create a gapped adiabatic path, between a high temperature product state and a low temperature thermofield double state. By smoothly varying the coupling strength between these two limits, one efficiently cools the SYK model. We support these predictions-and demonstrate fast cooling to the low-temperature gravitational regime-via exact numerical solutions to the large-N equations of motion that govern the ground state and dynamical properties of the coupled system. Finally, we present a theoretical framework based upon eigenstate thermalization that provides a microscopic explanation for the efficacy of the cooling protocol; intriguingly, this suggests that the protocol may be applicable for cooling strongly-interacting quantum Hamiltonians more broadly.</p>

            <h2>Temporal quantum interference in many-body programmable atom arrays</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Madhumita Sarkar, Ben Zindorf, Bhaskar Mukherjee, Sougato Bose, Roopayan Ghosh</p>
            <p>Quantum superposition famously manifests as spatial interference, epitomized by the double-slit experiment. Its less explored temporal analogue, Stückelberg interference, arises in driven systems where phases accumulated along distinct time-domain pathways recombine. Extending this phenomenon to large interacting systems introduces a new complexity as delicate phase relationships are disrupted by many-body interactions. Here we experimentally achieve controllable vacuum-state freezing in programmable Rydberg arrays of up to 100 atoms through many-body Stückelberg interference, with visibility exceeding $70\%$ and excitation suppression to $1\%$ despite periodic driving that would typically induce heating. Comparing single and dual-frequency protocols across multiple geometries, we show that simultaneous modulation of detuning and Rabi frequency dramatically enhances interference-driven freezing. Finite-range interaction tails play a decisive role, producing interference patterns which constrained $PXP$ models cannot capture. Our results establish temporal interference as a scalable microscopic mechanism for Floquet control, enabling predictive many-body state engineering in large-scale platforms.</p>

            <h2>A measurement-driven quantum algorithm for SAT: Performance guarantees via spectral gaps and measurement parallelization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Franz J. Schreiber, Maximilian J. Kramer, Alexander Nietner, Jens Eisert</p>
            <p>The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is of central importance in both theory and practice. Yet, most provable guarantees for quantum algorithms rely exclusively on Grover-type methods that cap the possible advantage at only quadratic speed-ups, making the search for approaches that surpass this quadratic barrier a key challenge. In this light, this work presents a rigorous worst-case runtime analysis of a recently introduced measurement-driven quantum SAT solver. Importantly, this quantum algorithm does not exclusively rely on Grover-type methods and shows promising numerical performance. Our analysis establishes that the algorithm's runtime depends on an exponential trade-off between two key properties: the spectral gap of the associated Hamiltonian and the success probability of the driving measurements. We show that this trade-off can be systematically controlled by a tunable rotation angle. Beyond establishing a worst-case runtime expression, this work contributes significant algorithmic improvements. First, we develop a new readout routine that efficiently finds a solution even for instances with multiple satisfying assignments. Second, a measurement parallelization scheme, based on perfect hash families, is introduced. Third, we establish an amplitude-amplified version of the measurement-driven algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility of our framework: By suitably scheduling the algorithm's parameters, we show that its runtime collapses from exponential to polynomial on a special class of SAT instances, consistent with their known classical tractability. A problem we leave open is to establish a non-trivial lower bound on the spectral gap as a function of the rotation angle. Resolving this directly translates into an improved worst-case runtime, potentially realizing a super-quadratic quantum advantage.</p>

            <h2>Non-abelian Geometric Quantum Energy Pump</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang Peng</p>
            <p>We introduce a non-abelian geometric quantum energy pump realized by a transitionless geometric quantum drive--a time-dependent Hamiltonian supplemented by a counterdiabatic term generated by a prescribed trajectory on a smooth control manifold--that coherently transports states within a degenerate subspace. When the coordinates of the trajectory are independently addressable by external drives, the net energy transferred between drives is set by the non-abelian Berry-curvature tensor. The trajectory-averaged pumping power is separately controlled by the initial state and by the Hamiltonian topology through the Euler class. We outline an implementation with artificial atoms, which are realizable on various platforms including trapped atoms/ions, superconducting circuits, and semiconductor quantum dots. The resulting energy pump can serve as a quantum transducer or charger, and as a metrological tool for measuring phase coherences in quantum states.</p>

            <h2>Two-Mode Janus States: non-Gaussian generalizations of thermofield double</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arash Azizi</p>
            <p>We introduce the Two-Mode Janus State (TMJS), a non-Gaussian quantum state defined as a coherent superposition of two distinct Two-Mode Squeezed States (TMSS). This construction serves as a direct, non-Gaussian generalization of the canonical thermofield double (TFD) state, which is itself a single, Gaussian TMSS. We develop a complete analytical framework for the TMJS's arbitrary $k$-th order photon statistics, identifying a new family of "squeezing polynomials" that govern all diagonal and off-diagonal moments. Our central result is that the state's non-Gaussianity is dynamically steerable via an external "Janus phase." This phase acts as a switch, allowing the higher-order coherences ($g^{(k)}$) to be tuned from perfectly thermal (matching the TFD marginal) to deeply sub-Poissonian, a regime marked by strong Wigner negativity. We further establish a physical realization for the TMJS, proposing its generation via coherently superposed Dynamical Casimir Effect (DCE) trajectories, distinguishing it from the static, observer-dependent Unruh effect. The TMJS provides a versatile, interference-enhanced platform for engineering Unruh-DeWitt detector responses and probing non-Gaussian physics in relativistic settings.</p>

            <p>Quantum state tomography is a fundamental task in quantum information science, enabling detailed characterization of correlations, entanglement, and electronic structure in quantum systems. However, its exponential measurement and computational demands limit scalability, motivating efficient alternatives such as classical shadows, which enable accurate prediction of many observables from randomized measurements. In this work, we introduce a bi-objective semidefinite programming approach for constrained shadow tomography, designed to reconstruct the two-particle reduced density matrix (2-RDM) from noisy or incomplete shadow data. By integrating $N$-representability constraints and nuclear-norm regularization into the optimization, the method builds an $N$-representable 2-RDM that balances fidelity to the shadow measurements with energy minimization. This unified framework mitigates noise and sampling errors while enforcing physical consistency in the reconstructed states. Numerical and hardware results demonstrate that the approach significantly improves accuracy, noise resilience, and scalability, providing a robust foundation for physically consistent fermionic state reconstruction in realistic quantum simulations.</p>

            <p>Quantum computers have long been expected to efficiently solve complex classical differential equations. Most digital, fault-tolerant approaches use Carleman linearization to map nonlinear systems to linear ones and then apply quantum linear-system solvers. However, provable speedups typically require digital truncation and full fault tolerance, rendering such linearization approaches challenging to implement on current hardware. Here we present an analog, continuous-variable algorithm based on coupled bosonic modes with qubit-based adaptive measurements that avoids Hilbert-space digitization. This method encodes classical fields as coherent states and, via Kraus-channel composition derived from the Koopman-von Neumann (KvN) formalism, maps nonlinear evolution to linear dynamics. Unlike many analog schemes, the algorithm is provably efficient: advancing a first-order, $L$-grid point, $d$-dimensional, order-$K$ spatial-derivative, degree-$r$ polynomial-nonlinearity, strongly dissipative partial differential equations (PDEs) for $T$ time steps costs $\mathcal{O}\left(T(\log L + d r \log K)\right)$. The capability of the scheme is demonstrated by using it to simulate the one-dimensional Burgers' equation and two-dimensional Fisher-KPP equation. The resilience of the method to photon loss is shown under strong-dissipation conditions and an analytic counterterm is derived that systematically cancels the dominant, experimentally calibrated noise. This work establishes a continuous-variable framework for simulating nonlinear systems and identifies a viable pathway toward practical quantum speedup on near-term analog hardware.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Duttatreya, Ipsika Mohanty, Sanjib Dey</p>
            <p>Quantum computing's potential for exponential speedup is fundamentally limited by decoherence, a phenomenon arising from environmental interactions. Non-Hermitian quantum mechanics, particularly $PT$-symmetric systems, offers a novel framework for extending coherence times. This study examines a qubit's coherence under non-Hermitian $PT$-symmetric dynamics, highlighting significantly enhanced coherence times compared to Hermitian setups. The effect is especially pronounced when both the system and environment exhibit $PT$-symmetry. Interestingly, greater environmental non-Hermiticity correlates with extended coherence, contrary to traditional expectations. These findings point to promising strategies for managing decoherence, which could significantly advance approaches to quantum information processing.</p>

Our scheme exploits the intrinsic global $\pi$-phase difference between opposite enantiomers to engineer destructive and/or constructive interference pathways, enabling a direct readout of enantiomeric excess with an error below $5\%$. To capture mesoscopic many-molecule effects beyond mean field while avoiding brute-force master-equation simulations, we employ a generalized discrete truncated Wigner approximation, which is well suited for systems with many yet finite molecules.

            <p>We investigate photon transport and blockade based on the architecture where a waveguide is coupled to a microring resonator at two distinct points. This two-point coupling configuration between the waveguide and resonator gives rise to non-Markovian dynamics, which is induced by the photon transmission delay in the waveguide between the two coupled points. On one hand, by designing the non-Markovian coupling parameters between the waveguide and resonator, single or two-photon transport and the resulting photon blockade effect can be manipulated according to the output photonic states at the end of waveguide. This non-Markovian process can be evaluated by scattering matrices and second order correlation functions related to the distance between two coupled points. On the other hand, when classical driving fields are applied upon the resonator with interactions between its clockwise and counterclockwise modes, the blockade effect of the output field can be determined by the intracavtiy eigenstates. Then the correlations of the output field as well as the intracavity states can be modulated by the non-Markovian coupling between the microring resonator and waveguide.</p>

Through numerical simulations incorporating realistic noises, including laser heating, propagation losses, and detection inefficiency, we demonstrate raw entangled bit fidelities of F~0.8 at kHz-level rates over 30 km using the Duan-Lukin-Cirac-Zoller (DLCZ) protocol. Implementing asymmetric entanglement pumping tailored to amplitude damping errors, we achieve purified fidelities F~0.94 at 0.2 kHz rates.

            <h2>Entanglement Phase Transition in Chaotic non-Hermitian Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhen-Tao Zhang, Feng Mei</p>
            <p>We have studied entanglement phase transition in a class of chaotic non-Hermitian spin chain in which its spin-spin coupling term commutes with the non-Hermitian term. Two models are investigated: transverse field Ising model with a complex longitudinal field and non-Hermitian XX model with a transverse field. Through calculating their complex spectra, we find these models are subject to a gapless-gapped phase transition with dissipation rate if the transverse field is larger than a model-dependent value. Interestingly, the variation of the complex gap with the dissipation rate is not monotonous, instead it manifest oscillations before entering the gapped phase. By simulating their non-unitary evolution, we show that the entanglement entropy of the steady state would transition from a volume-law to an area-law scaling with the increase of the dissipation rate. Meanwhile, some unexpected results about the entanglement entropy appear in the volume-law phase. These unusual features of the complex gap and the steady-state entanglement can be attributed to level crossings between the maximal imagine level and other levels. Our work reveals a novel entanglement transition in chaotic non-Hermitian systems.</p>

            <p>Nonlocal interactions are known to generate volume-law entanglement entropy. However, their deeper impact on the fine structure of quantum correlations remains a key open question. In this work, we explore a bosonic nonlocal field theory, examining correlation measures beyond entanglement entropy, namely, mutual information and tripartite information. Using numerical lattice simulations, we show that the nonlocality scale, \(A\), not only determines the onset of volume-law behavior but also leads to striking features: notably, extremely long-range mutual information and an unusual monogamy structure. In this regime, increasing the separation between large regions can paradoxically enhance their multipartite entanglement. Through holographic duality, we verify that the Ryu-Takayanagi formula correctly captures the volume-law scaling of entropy. Yet, a significant tension emerges: while the field theory reveals rich spatial correlations, the holographic model predicts a complete suppression of both mutual and tripartite information in the volume-law phase. This non-monogamous behavior in the holographic description stands in sharp contrast to the monogamous and highly structured entanglement observed in the field theory. Our results demonstrate that nonlocality gives rise to quantum states of such complexity that conventional geometric models of spacetime fall short. This points to the need for a new framework that goes beyond geometry to fully capture the nature of these correlations.</p>

Further, for any $N$, all 2-2 scattering channels are shown to emerge from the span of a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ algebra, suggesting that scattering in this context is fundamentally governed by the action of ``bit flips'' on the internal quantum numbers.

            <p>The speed of a fault-tolerant quantum computer is dictated by the reaction time of its classical electronics, that is, the total time required by decoders and controllers to determine the outcome of a logical measurement and execute subsequent conditional logical operations. Despite its importance, the reaction time and its impact on the design of the logical microarchitecture of a quantum computer are not well understood. In this work, we build, for a surface code based architecture, a model for the reaction time in which the decoder latency is based on parallel space- and time-window decoding methods, and communication latencies are drawn from our envisioned quantum execution environment comprising a high-speed network of quantum processing units, controllers, decoders, and high-performance computing nodes. We use this model to estimate the increase in the logical error rate of magic state injections as a function of the reaction time. Next, we show how the logical microarchitecture can be optimized with respect to the reaction time, and then present detailed full-system quantum and classical resource estimates for executing utility-scale quantum circuits based on realistic hardware noise parameters and state-of-the-art decoding times. For circuits with $10^{6}$--$10^{11}$ $T$ gates involving 200--2000 logical qubits, under a $\Lambda=9.3$ hardware model representative of a realistic target for superconducting quantum processors operating at a 2.86 MHz stabilization frequency, we show that even decoding at a sub-microsecond per stabilization round speed introduces substantial resource overheads: approximately 100k--250k additional physical qubits for correction qubit storage in the magic state factory; 300k--1.75M extra physical qubits in the core processor due to the code distance increase of $d$ to $d+4$ for extra memory protection; and a longer runtime by roughly a factor of 100.</p>

            <p>Spontaneous collective decay in driven atomic ensembles can generate coherence far from equilibrium, as illustrated by superradiant lasers where decay into a single-mode cavity synchronizes atomic phases into a macroscopic dipole and yields superradiant emission of light with an ultranarrow spectrum. Whether similar ordering persists in multimode reservoirs with propagation and competing collective decay channels remains an open question. We address this problem by analyzing atoms coupled to one-dimensional electromagnetic baths through two models. The first is a ring cavity supporting two bright collective decay channels, and the second is a bidirectional waveguide where, in addition to competition between channels, propagation induces coherent dipole-dipole interactions. For suitable incoherent pumping strengths, the dynamics enters a synchronization window in which collective decay overcomes disordering processes, leading to spontaneous steady-state phase ordering and superradiant emission. We extract the thresholds marking the onset of synchronization and show that the maximum intensity scales quadratically in both models. The resulting order is not described by a single macroscopic dipole: in the ring cavity spontaneous chirality emerges at the level of individual trajectories, while the waveguide develops a local chirality with different orders dominating opposite ends of the atomic array. The analysis of the emitted light spectrum reveals a linewidth that seems to narrow with increased system size in the ring cavity, while narrowing in the waveguide remains inconclusive within accessible numerics. These results clarify how competition and propagation shape emergent order in one-dimensional reservoirs and identify regimes where steady-state superradiance may arise beyond the Dicke limit.</p>

We demonstrate the scheme by resolving the phase along the Dirac electronic band of a prototypical topological insulator and observe a resonance-associated phase jump as well as a momentum and phase synchronized inversion revealing the helicity of the Dirac cone. We show the interferometer can be optically controlled by the polarization of the absorbed light, allowing a differential measurement of the phase - a crucial component for extracting phase information from an interferogram.

            <p>Renormalization is an essential technique in field-theoretic descriptions of natural phenomena, where the absence of a UV-complete description yields an abundance of divergent quantities. While the renormalization prescription has been thoroughly refined for equilibrium systems, consistently extending it to out-of-equilibrium systems is an active area of research. In this paper, we identify a mutual information-based measure of renormalizability that applies to quantum field theories both in and out of equilibrium. Specifically, we use mutual information to characterize correlations between infinitesimal shells in momentum space and show that the logarithmic derivative of mutual information with mode separation, at large mode separation, is a measure of renormalizability. We first consider Minkowski spacetime, where we introduce dynamics by performing an interaction quench, initializing the field in the free theory vacuum and then turning on the interaction. We show that the late-time mutual information relaxes to that for the interacting vacuum and the logarithmic derivative at large mode separation is negative for super-renormalizable theories, zero for renormalizable (marginal) theories, and positive for non-renormalizable theories. We then consider a conformally-coupled scalar field on the Poincaré patch of de Sitter spacetime, initializing the field in the Bunch-Davies vacuum in the asymptotic past. For different self-interactions and at any finite time, we find that the resulting mutual information has the same qualitative behavior as a function of mode separation, demonstrating that it can be used as a reliable indicator of renormalizability.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shaofeng Huang, Yu-Peng Wang, Jie Ren, Chen Fang</p>
            <p>Superdiffusion is an anomalous transport behavior. Recently, a new mechanism, termed the ``nodal mechanism," has been proposed to induce superdiffusion in quantum models. However, existing realizations of the nodal mechanism have so far been proposed on fine-tuned, artificial Hamiltonians, posing a significant challenge for experimental observation. In this work, we propose a broad class of models for generating superdiffusion potentially realizable in condensed matter systems across different spatial dimensions. A robust nodal structure emerges from the hybridization between the itinerant electrons and the local impurity orbitals, protected by the intrinsic symmetry and topology of the electronic band. We derive a universal scaling law for the conductance, $G \sim L^{-\gamma}$, revealing how the exponent is dictated by the dimensionality of the nodal structure ($D_{\text{node}}$) and its order $n$, and the dimensionality of the system $(D)$ at high temperatures or that of the Fermi surface ($D^F$) at low temperatures. Through numerical simulations, we validate these scaling relations at zero temperature for various models, including those based on graphene and multi-Weyl semimetals, finding excellent agreement between our theory and the computed exponents. Beyond the scaling of conductance, our framework predicts a suite of experimentally verifiable signatures, notably a new mechanism for linear-in-temperature resistivity ($\rho \sim T$) and a divergent low-frequency optical conductivity ($\sigma(\omega) \sim \omega^{\gamma -1}$), establishing a practical route to discovering and engineering anomalous transport in quantum materials.</p>

            <p>Much of our understanding of gapless many-body quantum systems stems from their low-energy descriptions as conformal field theories. This is especially true in 1+1 dimensions, where such theories have an infinite-dimensional parameter space induced by their conformal symmetry. We reveal the associated quantum geometry by considering finite systems driven by time-dependent conformal transformations. For small deformations, perturbation theory predicts absorption rates and linear responses that are intrinsically related to components of the quantum geometric tensor. For arbitrarily large but adiabatic deformations, we show that periodic drives give rise to nontrivial return amplitudes involving the quantum metric, beyond the familiar leading order that only features a Berry phase. Our field-theoretic findings are universal, comprising general relations between measurable quantities and quantum geometry that only depend on the central charge of the conformal symmetry.

            <h2>Probing Topological Stability with Nonlocal Quantum Geometric Markers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Quentin Marsal, Hui Liu, Emil J. Bergholtz, Annica M. Black-Schaffer</p>
            <p>Spatially resolved local quantum geometric markers play a crucial role in the diagnosis of topological phases without long-range translational symmetry, including amorphous systems. Here, we focus on the nonlocality of such markers. We demonstrate that they behave as correlation functions independently of the material's structure, showing sharp variations in the vicinity of topological transitions and exhibiting a unique pattern in real space for each transition. Notably, we find that, even within the same Altland-Zirnbauer class, distinct topological transitions generate qualitatively different spatial signatures, enabling a refined, class-internal probe of topological stability. As such, nonlocal quantum geometric indicators provide a more efficient and versatile tool to understand and predict the stability of topological phase transitions.</p>

            <h2>Geometry Induced Chiral Transport and Entanglement in $AdS_2$ Background</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kazuki Ikeda, Yaron Oz</p>
            <p>We study the real-time chiral dynamics of Dirac fermions in AdS$_2$ and AdS$_2$ black hole backgrounds. The spacetime curvature generates a spin connection term, acting as an effective magnetic field and a position-dependent chiral chemical potential. This leads to strongly asymmetric wave propagation, confined within an inhomogeneous Lieb-Robinson cone. The front velocities decrease with increasing fermion mass and horizon radius. Entanglement growth occurs inside the causal cone, and saturates through a string-breaking mechanism driven by screening excitations. In dipole-dipole scattering, the central bipartite entropy rises when the inward Lieb-Robinson fronts intersect, forming a bright ridge in the local entanglement profile. Charge and current correlators peak at the front arrival, providing a real-time diagnostic of chiral transport. These results establish a causality-respecting framework, linking curvature and horizons to transport and entanglement in (1+1)-dimensional fermionic matter.</p>

            <p>We present a quantum linear response (qLR) approach within an active-space framework for computing indirect nuclear spin-spin coupling constants, a key ingredient in NMR spectra predictions. The method employs the unitary coupled cluster (UCC) ansatz and its orbital-optimized variant (ooUCC), both suitable for quantum computing implementations, to evaluate spin-spin coupling constants via qLR. Test calculations on five small molecules are compared with CASCI, CASSCF, and conventional CCSD results. qLR with UCC/ooUCC yields spin-spin coupling constants comparable to classical methods. We further examine the role of orbital optimization and find that ooUCC markedly affects the computed couplings; orbital-optimized results show better agreement with CCSD. These findings indicate that orbital optimization is important for accurate NMR coupling predictions within quantum-computing-friendly correlated methods.</p>

            <p>Recovering microscopic couplings directly from data provides a route to solving the inverse problem in statistical field theories, one that complements the traditional-often computationally intractable-forward approach of predicting observables from an action or Hamiltonian. Here, we propose an approach for the inverse problem that uniformly accommodates systems with discrete, continuous, and hybrid variables. We demonstrate accurate parameter recovery in several benchmark systems-including Wegner's Ising gauge theory, $\phi^4$ theory, Schwinger and Sine-Gordon models, and mixed spin-gauge systems, and show how iterating the procedure under coarse-graining reconstructs full non-perturbative renormalization-group flows. This gives direct access to phase boundaries, fixed points, and emergent interactions without relying on perturbation theory. We also address a realistic setting where full gauge configurations may be unavailable, and reformulate learning algorithms for multiple field theories so that they are recovered directly using observables such as correlations from scattering data or quantum simulators. We anticipate that our methodology will find widespread use in practical learning of field theories in strongly coupled regimes where analytical tools might fail.</p>

            <p>Quantum phase imaging enables the analysis of transparent samples with thickness and refractive index variations in scenarios requiring precise measurements under low-light conditions. Recent advances in nonlinear metasurfaces offer compact solutions for quantum light generation and manipulation. Here, we present a compact quantum phase imaging system integrating a lithium niobate (LiNbO3) metasurface for generating spatially entangled photon pairs and a silicon (Si) metasurface for phase gradient extraction. The LiNbO3 metasurface enables efficient spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) with angularly dispersed, tunable emission, while the Si metasurface employs a nearly linear optical transfer function (OTF) to differentiate phase and extract phase gradients via spatial quantum correlations. This dual-metasurface enabled combined ghost imaging and all-optical scanning protocols with quantum light achieves phase gradient reconstruction without mechanical tuning. Experimental results demonstrate the system's ability to resolve phase gradients up to 25 rad/mm with 88% fidelity using a 6x3-pixel proof-of-concept setup. In addition, theoretically, it is confirmed that the resolution of the system is primarily limited by the quality factor of the compact design, leveraging nonlocal resonances and quantum correlations, establishes a new paradigm for portable quantum phase-gradient imaging, with potential applications in sensing, microscopy, and LiDAR. This work highlights the application of metasurface in both generating and detecting quantum states.</p>

            <p>SeQuant is an open-source library for symbolic algebra of tensors over commutative (scalar) and non-commutative (operator) rings. The key innovation supporting most of its functionality is a graph-theoretic tensor network (TN) canonicalizer that can handle tensor networks with symmetries faster than their standard group-theoretic counterparts. The TN canonicalizer is used for routine simplification of conventional tensor expressions, for optimizing application of Wick's theorem (used to canonicalize products of tensors over operator fields), and for manipulation of the intermediate representation leading to the numerical evaluation. Notable features of SeQuant include support for noncovariant tensor networks (which often arise from tensor decompositions) and for tensors with modes that depend parametrically on indices of other tensor modes (such dependencies between degrees of freedom are naturally viewed as nesting of tensors, "tensors of tensors" arising in block-wise data compressions in data science and modern quantum simulation). SeQuant blurs the line between pure symbolic manipulation/code generation and numerical evaluation by including compiler-like components to optimize and directly interpret tensor expressions using external numerical tensor algebra frameworks.

            <h2>Interaction as Interference: A Quantum-Inspired Aggregation Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pilsung Kang</p>
            <p>Classical approaches often treat interaction as engineered product terms or as emergent patterns in flexible models, offering little control over how synergy or antagonism arises. We take a quantum-inspired view: following the Born rule (probability as squared amplitude), \emph{coherent} aggregation sums complex amplitudes before squaring, creating an interference cross-term, whereas an \emph{incoherent} proxy sums squared magnitudes and removes it. In a minimal linear-amplitude model, this cross-term equals the standard potential-outcome interaction contrast \(\Delta_{\mathrm{INT}}\) in a \(2\times 2\) factorial design, giving relative phase a direct, mechanism-level control over synergy versus antagonism. We instantiate this idea in a lightweight \emph{Interference Kernel Classifier} (IKC) and introduce two diagnostics: \emph{Coherent Gain} (log-likelihood gain of coherent over the incoherent proxy) and \emph{Interference Information} (the induced Kullback-Leibler gap). A controlled phase sweep recovers the identity. On a high-interaction synthetic task (XOR), IKC outperforms strong baselines under paired, budget-matched comparisons; on real tabular data (\emph{Adult} and \emph{Bank Marketing}) it is competitive overall but typically trails the most capacity-rich baseline in paired differences. Holding learned parameters fixed, toggling aggregation from incoherent to coherent consistently improves negative log-likelihood, Brier score, and expected calibration error, with positive Coherent Gain on both datasets.</p>

            <h2>Geometric foundations of thermodynamics in the quantum regime</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Álvaro Tejero, Martín de la Rosa</p>
            <p>In this work, we present a comprehensive geometrical formulation of quantum thermodynamics based on contact geometry and principal fiber bundles. The quantum thermodynamic state space is modeled as a contact manifold, with equilibrium Gibbs states forming a Legendrian submanifold that encodes the fundamental thermodynamic relations. A principal fiber bundle over the manifold of density operators distinguishes the quantum state structure from thermodynamic labels: its fibers represent non-equilibrium configurations, and their unique intersections with the equilibrium submanifold enforce thermodynamic consistency. Quasistatic processes correspond to minimizing geodesics under the Bures-Wasserstein metric, leading to minimal dissipation, while the divergence of geodesic length toward rank-deficient states geometrically derives the third law. Non-equilibrium extensions, formulated through pseudo-Riemannian metrics and connections on the principal bundle, introduce curvature-induced holonomy that quantifies irreversibility in cyclic processes. In this framework, the thermodynamic laws in the quantum regime emerge naturally as geometric consequences.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S Rahul, A Harshitha</p>
            <p>Phase transitions in one-dimensional lattice systems are well established and have been extensively studied within both Hermitian and non-Hermitian frameworks. In this work, we extend this understanding to a more general setting by investigating localization and delocalization transitions and the behavior of the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) using a tight binding model on a generalized random graph lattice. Our model incorporates three key parameters, asymmetric hopping $\Delta$, on site disorder $W$, and a random long-range coupling $p$ that render the underlying nature of random graph. By varying $p,$ $\Delta$ and the disorder, we explore the interplay between topology, randomness, and non-Hermiticity in determining localization properties. Our results show the competition between skin effect driven and Anderson driven localizations in the parameter regimes. Despite the presence of large disorder, the skin effect driven localization coexists with Anderson driven localization.</p>

            <h2>Improved Offline Reinforcement Learning via Quantum Metric Encoding</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Outongyi Lv, Yewei Yuan, Nana Liu</p>
            <p>Reinforcement learning (RL) with limited samples is common in real-world applications. However, offline RL performance under this constraint is often suboptimal. We consider an alternative approach to dealing with limited samples by introducing the Quantum Metric Encoder (QME). In this methodology, instead of applying the RL framework directly on the original states and rewards, we embed the states into a more compact and meaningful representation, where the structure of the encoding is inspired by quantum circuits. For classical data, QME is a classically simulable, trainable unitary embedding and thus serves as a quantum-inspired module, on a classical device. For quantum data in the form of quantum states, QME can be implemented directly on quantum hardware, allowing for training without measurement or re-encoding. We evaluated QME on three datasets, each limited to 100 samples. We use Soft-Actor-Critic (SAC) and Implicit-Q-Learning (IQL), two well-known RL algorithms, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. From the experimental results, we find that training offline RL agents on QME-embedded states with decoded rewards yields significantly better performance than training on the original states and rewards. On average across the three datasets, for maximum reward performance, we achieve a 116.2% improvement for SAC and 117.6% for IQL. We further investigate the $\Delta$-hyperbolicity of our framework, a geometric property of the state space known to be important for the RL training efficacy. The QME-embedded states exhibit low $\Delta$-hyperbolicity, suggesting that the improvement after embedding arises from the modified geometry of the state space induced by QME. Thus, the low $\Delta$-hyperbolicity and the corresponding effectiveness of QME could provide valuable information for developing efficient offline RL methods under limited-sample conditions.</p>

            <p>The quantum geometric tensor (QGT) unifies the Berry curvature (its imaginary part) and the quantum metric (its real part), yet Raman studies of chiral phonons have so far accessed only the former. We perform circularly polarized Raman spectroscopy on the quantum magnet K2Co(SeO3)2, where the field-odd chiral splitting and the field-even center-frequency shift collapse onto a single curve across temperature and magnetic field, revealing a common microscopic origin for both observables. Since the chiral splitting reflects the Berry curvature, the concomitant even component, arising from the same microscopic origin, captures the field-induced change of the quantum metric, corresponding to the diagonal Born-Oppenheimer correction. Across two resolvable Eg modes, the unified data are well captured by a simple empirical quadratic relation. These results establish Raman spectroscopy as a direct probe of the quantum metric and an operational decomposition of quantum geometry within a single measurement.</p>

            <p>Harnessing a beam of slow free electrons in artificial photonic structures offers a powerful, tunable platform for generating nonclassical light without the need for heavy physical equipment. Here we present a theory of nonclassical lasing, demonstrating how incoherent electrons in photonic crystal cavities can coherently emit photons through collective dynamics. When photon emission rate exceeds cavity losses, nonclassical lasing with sub-Poissonian photon statistics emerges, driven by multi-photon Rabi oscillations. At specific coupling strengths, quantum state trapping effect emerges, producing high-fidelity Fock states at room temperature (e.g. nearly 90%-fidelity of four photon Fock state). Notably, the frequency of the emitted photons can be readily tuned via the velocity of the injected electrons to match cavity modes. This approach supports photonic integration and offers a scalable, energy-efficient platform for room-temperature quantum light sources and advanced studies in quantum electrodynamics.</p>

In particular, we recast scattering amplitudes of fixed helicity as quantum operations on the Hilbert space of internal quantum numbers, where the external states play the role of qudits. The entire space of $SU(N)$-invariant scattering operators between qudits is spanned by a minimal set of three quantum gates. Recoupling relations among quantum gates are shown to follow directly from the crossing properties of the underlying amplitudes and reveal that entanglement generated from separable states in one channel is necessarily intertwined with another. Consequently, we argue any interacting quantum field theory that realizes an $SU(N)$ global symmetry must generate entanglement in at least one scattering channel.</p>

            <p>Quantum theory of geometrically frustrated systems is usually approached as a gauge theory where the local conservation law becomes the Gauss law. Here we show that it can do something fundamentally different: enforce a global conserved quantity via a non-perturbative tiling invariant, rigorously linking microscopic geometry to a new macroscopically phase-coherent state. In a frustrated bosonic model on the honeycomb lattice in the cluster-charging regime at fractional filling, this mechanism protects a conserved global quantum number, the sublattice polarization $\tilde{N} = N_A - N_B$. Quantum fluctuation drives the spontaneous symmetry breaking of this global U(1) symmetry to result in a supernematic (SN) phase -- an incompressible yet phase-coherent quantum state that breaks rotational symmetry without forming a superfluid or realizing topological order. This establishes a route to a novel quantum many-body state driven by combinatorial constraints.</p>

            <p>In addition to topological lattice defects such as dislocations and disclinations, crystals are also accompanied by unavoidable ordinary defects, devoid of any non-trivial geometry or topology, among which vacancies, Schottky defects, substitutions, interstitials, and Frenkel pairs are the most common. In this work, we demonstrate that these ubiquitous ordinary lattice defects, though topologically trivial, can nonetheless serve as universal probes of the non-trivial topology of electronic Bloch bands, and any change in the local topological environment in an otherwise normal insulator in terms of mid-gap bound states in their vicinity. We theoretically establish these generic findings by implementing a minimal model Hamiltonian describing time-reversal symmetry breaking topological and normal insulators on a square lattice, fostering such point defects. The defect-bound mid-gap modes are also shown to be robust against weak point-like charge impurities. Furthermore, we showcase experimental observation of such bound states by embedding ordinary crystal defects in two-dimensional acoustic Chern lattices, where precision-controlled hopping amplitudes are implemented via active meta-atoms and Green's-function-based spectroscopy is used to reconstruct spectra and eigenstates. Our combined theory-experiment study establishes ordinary lattice defects as probes of topology that should be germane in crystals of any symmetry and dimension, raising the possibility of arresting localized Majorana modes near such defects in the bulk of topological superconductors and to emulate ordinary-defect-engineered topological devices.</p>

For two embedded models that introduce auxiliary variables, numerical simulations of Schrödinger evolution revealed that fairness varies significantly depending on the embedding, and the chain strength is related to ground-state fairness. Using perturbation theory, we found that chain strength determines the energy landscape around ground states, with flatter landscapes having higher probabilities of being obtained.</p>

            <p>To better understand quantum computation we can search for its limits or no-gos, especially if analogous limits do not appear in classical computation. Classical computation easily implements and extensively employs the addition of two bit strings, so here we study 'quantum addition': the superposition of two quantum states. We prove the impossibility of superposing two unknown states, no matter how many samples of each state are available. The proof uses topology; a quantum algorithm of any sample complexity corresponds to a continuous function, but the function required by the superposition task cannot be continuous by topological arguments. Our result for the first time quantifies the approximation error and the sample complexity $N$ of the superposition task, and it is tight. We present a trivial algorithm with a large approximation error and $N=1$, and the matching impossibility of any smaller approximation error for any $N$. Consequently, our results limit state tomography as a useful subroutine for the superposition. State tomography is useful only in a model that tolerates randomness in the superposed state. The optimal protocol in this random model remains open.</p>

These protocols rely on optical CNOT gates and we vary the probability with which they can be successfully performed. Encoding our entangled states in photon polarization, we analyse the effect of depolarizing noise on the photonic states as the carrier passes through the fibers. Building a robust model of photon loss and calculating the distillable entanglement of the noisy states, we find the entanglement distribution rate. We discover that methods involving a separable carrier can reach a higher rate than the standard entanglement distribution protocol, provided that the success probability of the optical CNOT gates is sufficiently high.</p>

            <p>Quantum networks aim to facilitate the fault-tolerant and secure transmission of quantum states across distant devices. The widely adopted quantum teleportation scheme requires multiple rounds of entanglement swapping and purification, leading to significant resource overhead and operational complexity. In this study, we propose a novel fault-tolerant and secure quantum communication scheme based on uncorrectable error injection. Our method exploits a quantum state encoding scheme based on quantum error correction codes, which strategically introduces uncorrectable errors to enhance security. It eliminates the need for entanglement distribution while reducing resource requirements. The injected errors protect against eavesdropping by preventing unauthorized parties from retrieving meaningful information. Security analysis shows that as the data length and encoded message size increase, information leakage becomes negligible relative to the size of the total message. Comparative performance analysis with existing approaches indicates that our method reduces transmission overhead while maintaining comparable fidelity in low-error regimes. These findings suggest that the proposed method offers a scalable and practical alternative for secure long-distance quantum communication, distributed quantum computing, and future quantum internet applications.</p>

            <h2>Bargmann-invariant framework for local unitary equivalence and entanglement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lin Zhang, Bing Xie, Yuanhong Tao</p>
            <p>Research on quantum states often focuses on the correlation between nonlocal effects and local unitary invariants, among which local unitary equivalence plays a significant role in quantum state classification and resource theories. This paper focuses on the local unitary equivalence of multipartite quantum states in quantum information theory, aiming to determine a complete set of invariants that identify their local unitary orbits; these invariants are crucial for deriving polynomial invariants and describing the physical properties preserved under local unitary this http URL study deeply explores the characterization of local unitary equivalence and the method of detecting entanglement using local unitary Bargmann invariants. Taking two-qubit systems as an example, it verifies the measurability of invariants that determine equivalence and establishes a connection between Makhlin fundamental invariants (a complete set of 18 local unitary invariants for two-qubit states) and local unitary Bargmann invariants. These Bargmann invariants, related to the traces of products of density operators and marginal states, can be measured through cycle tests (an extended form of SWAP tests).</p>

            <h2>Relativistic model of spontaneous wave-function localization induced by nonHermitian colored noise</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pei Wang</p>
            <p>We develop a quantum field theory based on random nonHermitian actions, which upon quantization lead to stochastic nonlinear Schrödinger dynamics for the state vector. In this framework, Lorentz and spacetime translation symmetries are preserved only in a statistical sense: the probability distribution of the action remains invariant under these transformations. As a result, the theory describes ensembles of quantum-state trajectories whose probability distributions remain invariant under changes of reference frame. As a concrete example, we augment the Dirac action with a purely imaginary term coupling the fermion density operator to a universal colored noise. This noise is constructed by solving the d'Alembert equation with white noise as its source, using a generalized stochastic calculus in 1+3 dimensions. We demonstrate that the colored noise drives stochastic localization of wave packets and derive the localization length analytically. Remarkably, the localization length decreases as the size of the observable universe increases. Our model thus provides a potential framework for relativistic spontaneous wave-function collapse. While establishing consistency with Born's law remains an open challenge, the present work constitutes a step toward embedding collapse models into a Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory.</p>

            <p>Quantum computing with superconducting circuits relies on high-fidelity driven nonlinear processes. An ideal quantum nonlinearity would selectively activate desired coherent processes at high strength, without activating parasitic mixing products or introducing additional decoherence. The wide bandwidth of the Josephson nonlinearity makes this difficult, with undesired drive-induced transitions and decoherence limiting qubit readout, gates, couplers, and amplifiers. Significant strides have been recently made into building better `quantum mixers', with promise being shown by Kerr-free three-wave mixers that suppress driven frequency shifts, and balanced quantum mixers that explicitly forbid a significant fraction of parasitic processes. We propose a novel mixer that combines both these strengths, with engineered selection rules that make it essentially linear (not just Kerr-free) when idle, and activate clean parametric processes even when driven at high strength. Further, its ideal Hamiltonian is simple to analyze analytically, and we show that this ideal behavior is first-order insensitive to dominant experimental imperfections. We expect this mixer to allow significant advances in high-Q control, readout, and amplification.</p>

            <h2>Strong Local Passivity in Unconventional Scenarios: A New Protocol for Amplified Quantum Energy Teleportation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Songbo Xie, Manas Sajjan, Sabre Kais</p>
            <p>Quantum energy teleportation (QET) has been proposed to overcome the restrictions of strong local passivity (SLP) and to facilitate energy transfer in quantum systems. Traditionally, QET has only been considered under strict constraints, including the requirements that the initial state be the ground state of an interacting Hamiltonian, that Alice's measurement commute with the interaction terms, and that entanglement be present. These constraints have significantly limited the broader applicability of QET protocols. In this work, we demonstrate that SLP can arise beyond these conventional constraints, establishing the necessity of QET in a wider range of scenarios for local energy extraction. This leads to a more flexible and generalized framework for QET. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of a ``local effective Hamiltonian,'' which eliminates the need for optimization techniques in determining Bob's optimal energy extraction in QET protocols. As an additional advantage, the amount of energy that can be extracted using our new protocol is amplified to be 7.2 times higher than that of the original protocol. These advancements enhance our understanding of QET and extend its broader applications to quantum technologies. To support our findings, we implement the protocol on quantum hardware, confirming its theoretical validity and experimental feasibility.</p>

            <h2>Quantum dual extended Hamming code immune to collective coherent errors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> En-Jui Chang</p>
            <p>Collective coherent (CC) errors are inevitable, as every physical qubit undergoes free evolution under its kinetic Hamiltonian. These errors can be more damaging than stochastic Pauli errors because they affect all qubits coherently, resulting in high-weight errors that standard quantum error-correcting (QEC) codes struggle to correct. In quantum memories and communication systems, especially when storage durations are long, CC errors often dominate over stochastic noise. Trapped-ion platforms, for example, exhibit strong CC errors with minimal stochastic Pauli components. In this work, we address the regime where immunity to CC errors, high code rate (due to limited qubit availability), and moderate distance (sufficient for correcting low-weight errors) are all essential. We construct a family of constant-excitation (CE) stabilizer codes with parameters $[[2^{r+1}, 2^r - (r+1), 3]]$. The smallest instance, the $[[8,1,3]]$ code, improves the code rate and error threshold of the best previously known CE code by factors of approximately two and four, respectively.</p>

            <h2>Automated Quantum Algorithm Design using a Domain-Specific Language</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amy Rouillard, Matt Lourens, Francesco Petruccione</p>
            <p>We present a computational method to automatically design the n-qubit realisations of quantum algorithms. Our approach leverages a domain-specific language (DSL) that enables the construction of quantum circuits via modular building blocks, making it well-suited for evolutionary search. In this DSL quantum circuits are abstracted beyond the usual gate-sequence description and scale automatically to any problem size. This enables us to learn the algorithm structure rather than a specific unitary implementation. We demonstrate our method by automatically designing three known quantum algorithms-the Quantum Fourier Transform, the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, and Grover's search. Remarkably, we were able to learn the general implementation of each algorithm by considering examples of circuits containing at most 5-qubits. Our method proves robust, as it maintains performance across increasingly large search spaces. Convergence to the relevant algorithm is achieved with high probability and with moderate computational resources.</p>

            <p>In the ever-evolving landscape of quantum cryptography, Device-independent Quantum Key Distribution (DI-QKD) stands out for its unique approach to ensuring security based not on the trustworthiness of the devices but on nonlocal correlations. Beginning with a contextual understanding of modern cryptographic security and the limitations of standard quantum key distribution methods, this review explores the pivotal role of nonclassicality and the challenges posed by various experimental loopholes for DI-QKD. Various protocols, security against individual, collective and coherent attacks, and the concept of self-testing are also examined, as well as the entropy accumulation theorem, and additional mathematical methods in formulating advanced security proofs. In addition, the burgeoning field of semi-device-independent models (measurement DI--QKD, Receiver DI--QKD, and One--sided DI--QKD) is also analyzed. The practical aspects are discussed through a detailed overview of experimental progress and the open challenges toward the commercial deployment in the future of secure communications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raphael Holzinger, Susanne F. Yelin</p>
            <p>Determining the peak photon emission time and rate for an ensemble of $N$ quantum systems undergoing collective superradiant decay typically requires tracking the time evolution of the density operator. Generally, the dimension of the density operator grows exponentially ($\sim \! 2^N$) with the number of emitters, in the absence of any symmetries such as in Dicke superradiance with full or partial permutational symmetry. We present a detailed study of the superradiant peak emission rate and time for initially fully excited quantum emitter ensembles, for one-, two- and three-dimensional arrays in free-space and emitter chains coupled to waveguide reservoirs. For few emitters ($N\lesssim 14$) we utilize the full quantum master equation, and for mesoscopic emitter numbers ($N\lesssim 400$) we use a second- and third-order cumulant expansion of the operator averages to track the time evolution of the system.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Teruaki Nagasawa, Eyuri Wakakuwa, Kohtaro Kato, Francesco Buscemi</p>
            <p>To understand the emergence of macroscopic irreversibility from microscopic reversible dynamics, the idea of coarse-graining plays a fundamental role. In this work, we develop a unified inferential framework for macroscopic states, that is, coarse descriptions of microscopic quantum systems that can be inferred from macroscopic measurements. Building on quantum statistical sufficiency and Bayesian retrodiction, we characterize macroscopic states through equivalent abstract (algebraic) and explicit (constructive) formulations. Central to our approach is the notion of observational deficit, which quantifies the degree of irretrodictability of a state relative to a prior and a measurement. This leads to a general definition of macroscopic entropy as an inferentially grounded measure of asymmetry under Bayesian inversion. We formalize this structure in terms of inferential reference frames, defined by the pair consisting of a prior and a measurement, which encapsulate the observer's informational perspective. We then formulate a resource theory of microscopicity, treating macroscopic states as free states and introducing a hierarchy of macroscopicity-non-generating operations. This theory unifies and extends existing resource theories of coherence, athermality, and asymmetry. Finally, we apply the framework to study quantum correlations under observational constraints, introducing the notion of observational discord and deriving necessary and sufficient conditions for their vanishing in terms of information recoverability. This work is dedicated to Professor Ryszard Horodecki on the occasion of his 80th birthday, in deep admiration and gratitude for his pioneering contributions to quantum information theory.</p>

            <p>Sequential methods for quantum hypothesis testing offer significant advantages over fixed-length approaches, which rely on a predefined number of state copies. Despite their potential, these methods remain underexplored for unambiguous discrimination. In this work, we derive performance bounds for such methods when applied to the discrimination of a set of pure states. The performance is evaluated based on the expected number of copies required. We establish a lower bound applicable to any sequential method and an upper bound on the optimal sequential method. The upper bound is derived using a novel and simple non-adaptive method. Importantly, the gap between these bounds is minimal, scaling logarithmically with the number of distinct states.</p>

            <p>In the last decade, the microwave quantum electronics toolbox has been enriched with quantum-limited detection devices such as Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifiers (TWPAs). The extreme sensitivity they provide is not only mandatory for some physics applications within quantum information processing, but is also the key element that will determine the detection limit of quantum sensing setups. In the framework of microwave optomechanical systems, an unprecedented range of small motions and forces is accessible, for which a specific quantitative calibration becomes necessary. We report on near quantum-limited measurements performed with an aluminum drumhead mechanical device within the temperature range 4 mK - 400 mK. The whole setup is carefully calibrated, especially taking into account the power-dependence of microwave absorption in the superconducting optomechanical cavity. This effect is commonly attributed to Two-Level-Systems (TLSs) present in the metal oxide. We demonstrate that a similar feature exists in the TWPA, and can be phenomenologically fit with adapted expressions. If not taken into account, the error on the signal strength can be as large as a factor of about 2, which is unacceptable for quantitative experiments. The power and temperature dependence is studied over the full parameter range, leading to an absolute definition of phonon population (i.e. Brownian motion amplitude), with an uncertainty +- 20 % limited by sources of noise internal to the optomechanical element.</p>

            <p>Efficient quantum state preparation remains a central challenge in first-principles quantum simulations of dynamics in quantum field theories, where the Hilbert space is intrinsically infinite-dimensional. Here, we introduce a large language model (LLM)-assisted framework for quantum-circuit design that systematically scales state-preparation circuits to large lattice volumes. Applied to a 1+1d XY spin chain, the LLM autonomously discovers a compact 4-parameter circuit that captures boundary-induced symmetry breaking with sub-percent energy deviation, enabling successful validation on the \texttt{Zuchongzhi} quantum processor. Guided by this insight, we extend the framework to 2+1d quantum field theories, where scalable variational ansätze have remained elusive. For a scalar field theory, the search yields a symmetry-preserving, 3-parameter shallow-depth ansatz whose optimized parameters converge to size-independent constants for lattices $n \ge 4$, providing, to our knowledge, the first scalable ansatz for this class of 2+1d models. Our results establish a practical route toward AI-assisted, human-guided discovery in quantum simulation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matteo Scandi, Álvaro M. Alhambra</p>
            <p>Starting from a microscopic description of weak system-bath interactions, we derive from first principles a quantum master equation that does not rely on the well-known rotating wave approximation. This includes generic many-body systems, with Hamiltonians with vanishingly small energy spacings that forbid that approximation. The equation satisfies a general form of detailed balance, called KMS, which ensures exact convergence to the many-body Gibbs state. Unlike the more common notion of GNS detailed balance, this notion is compatible with the absence of the rotating wave approximation. We show that the resulting Lindbladian dynamics not only reproduces the thermal equilibrium point up to a small renormalization of the system Hamiltonian, but it also approximates the true system evolution with an error that grows at most linearly in time, giving an exponential improvement upon previous estimates. This master equation has quasi-local jump operators, can be efficiently simulated on a quantum computer, and reduces to the usual Davies dynamics in the limit of a coarse-graining time much larger than the inverse of the smallest frequency difference. With it, we provide a rigorous model of many-body thermalization relevant to both open quantum systems and quantum algorithms.</p>

            <p>In continuous-variable (CV) QKD with optical coherent detection, the widely adopted \textit{trusted detector noise} model improves both the secret key rate and the transmission distance. This model assumes that detector noise is inherently random and inaccessible to an adversary. While substantial research has focused on shielding the detector, it is far more difficult to justify the adversary's ignorance of the detector noise. In this paper, we introduce a \textit{calibrated detector noise} model for CV-QKD, which relies solely on the isolation of the detector from the adversary's intervention. Specifically, our model applies even when detector noise is predictable to the adversary. We analyze the electrical noise of a commercial balanced photoreceiver and perform numerical simulations to compare different noise models. Our results show that when the detector noise variance is an order of magnitude below the vacuum noise, the proposed model achieves a secret key rate comparable to that of the trusted detector noise model, while eliminating the questionable assumption of ``truly random'' detector noise.</p>

Crucially, we establish and leverage the connection between these Hilbert-Schmidt volumes and the symplectic volumes of the corresponding regular co-adjoint orbits, formalized through the Duistermaat-Heckman measure. By meticulously synthesizing these volume computations -- specifically, the ratios defining the relevant probability measures -- we reconstruct and rigorously verify the 8/33 separability probability.

            <p>This study introduces a framework for learning a low-depth surrogate quantum circuit (SQC) that approximates the nonlinear, dissipative, and hence non-unitary Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) collision operator in the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) for the D2Q9 lattice. By appropriately selecting the quantum state encoding, circuit architecture, and measurement protocol, non-unitary dynamics emerge naturally within the physical population space. This approach removes the need for probabilistic algorithms relying on any ancilla qubits and post-selection to reproduce dissipation, or for multiple state copies to capture nonlinearity. The SQC is designed to preserve key physical properties of the BGK operator, including mass conservation, scale equivariance, and D8 equivariance, while momentum conservation is encouraged through penalization in the training loss. When compiled to the IBM Heron quantum processor's native gate set, assuming all-to-all qubit connectivity, the circuit requires only 724 native gates and operates locally on the velocity register, making it independent of the lattice size. The learned SQC is validated on two benchmark cases, the Taylor-Green vortex decay and the lid-driven cavity, showing accurate reproduction of vortex decay and flow recirculation. While integration of the SQC into a quantum LBM framework presently requires measurement and re-initialization at each timestep, the necessary steps towards a measurement-free formulation are outlined.</p>

            <p>Bosonic systems, particularly in quantum optics and atomic physics, are leading platforms for achieving quantum enhanced precision in parameter estimation. By exploiting properties such as mode and particle entanglement, it is possible to attain precisions that surpass the shot noise limit with respect to key resources like probe number or energy. Yet the mechanisms by which these bosonic resources enable quantum enhancement remain unclear. Consequently, the design of optimal probes and evolutions often relies on case by case analyses, where continuous and discrete variable regimes are treated separately and their connection is still unclear. We develop a comprehensive framework for quantum metrology that unifies all known precision enhancement mechanisms based on bosonic systems. Our approach employs a superselection rule compliant representation of the electromagnetic field that explicitly includes the phase reference, thereby enforcing total particle number conservation and bridging the discrete and continuous limits of quantum optics and symmetric massive systems. Within this unified formalism, of which established results emerge as special cases, we identify the distinct roles of mode and particle entanglement for quantum enhanced precision. The framework further provides general measurement optimization strategies for arbitrary multimode entangled probe states and naturally incorporates noise and non-unitary dynamics, ensuring applicability to realistic experimental conditions.</p>

We find that thermal noise reduces quantum synchronization, highlighting the importance of low-temperature conditions. This study provides useful insights into tunable magnonic interactions in cavity systems, with possible applications in quantum information processing and hybrid quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Charge acceleration without radiation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yakir Aharonov, Daniel Collins, Sandu Popescu</p>
            <p>The existence of electromagnetic radiation - radio-waves, microwaves, light, x-rays and so on - is one of the most important physical phenomena, and our ability to manipulate them is one of the most significant technological achievement of humankind. Underlying this ability is our understanding of how radiation is produced: whenever an electric charge is accelerated, it radiates. Or, at least, this is how it has been hitherto universally thought. Here we prove that quantum mechanically electric charges can be accelerated without radiating. The physical setup leading to this behavior is relatively simple (once one knows what to do) but its reasons are deep: it relies on the fact that quantum mechanically particles can be accelerated even when no forces act on them, via the Aharonov-Bohm effect. As we argue, the effect presented here is just them tip of an iceberg - it implies the need to reconsider the basic understanding of radiation. Finally, it seems clear that the effect goes far beyond electromagnetism and applies to any kind of radiation.</p>

            <h2>Tunable Non-Gaussianity and Exact Higher-Order Coherences for Quantum Advantage</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arash Azizi</p>
            <p>Non-Gaussian states are essential for achieving a quantum advantage in continuous-variable (CV) information processing. Among these, coherent superpositions of squeezed states are a foundational resource. While exact higher-order statistics are available in the undisplaced case, a complete and analytically tractable treatment with a common displacement has been missing. We introduce and solve the displaced Janus state-a coherent superposition of two squeezed coherent states that share the same displacement-and develop an analytical framework, based on a family of Generalized Squeezing Polynomials, that yields closed-form expressions for arbitrary-order factorial moments and coherence functions \(g^{(k)}(0)\), the full Wigner function, and the quantum Fisher information. The analysis shows how interference at a fixed mean, driven by a mismatch of the component covariances rather than by mean separation, can be precisely engineered to transform the extreme photon bunching of the constituents into strong sub-Poissonian and even perfect multiphoton suppression. We further provide a rigorous quantum Fisher information analysis, proving that parameters encoded by linear generators (for example, the number operator) are bounded by the standard quantum limit, whereas parameters encoded by quadratic generators (for example, squeezing transformations) achieve Heisenberg-limited scaling. Together, these results furnish a complete analytical toolkit for a versatile class of non-Gaussian states, establishing the displaced Janus state as a key primitive for hybrid quantum protocols, quantum metrology, and fault-tolerant continuous-variable computation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ratun Rahman, Atit Pokharel, Md Raihan Uddin, Dinh C. Nguyen</p>
            <p>Quantum federated learning (QFL) is an emerging field that has the potential to revolutionize computation by taking advantage of quantum physics concepts in a distributed machine learning (ML) environment. However, the majority of available quantum simulators are primarily built for general quantum circuit simulation and do not include integrated support for machine learning tasks such as training, evaluation, and iterative optimization. Furthermore, designing and assessing quantum learning algorithms is still a difficult and resource-intensive task. Real-time updates are essential for observing model convergence, debugging quantum circuits, and making conscious choices during training with the use of limited resources. Furthermore, most current simulators fail to support the integration of user-specific data for training purposes, undermining the main purpose of using a simulator. In this study, we introduce SimQFL, a customized simulator that simplifies and accelerates QFL experiments in quantum network applications. SimQFL supports real-time, epoch-wise output development and visualization, allowing researchers to monitor the process of learning across each training round. Furthermore, SimQFL offers an intuitive and visually appealing interface that facilitates ease of use and seamless execution. Users can customize key variables such as the number of epochs, learning rates, number of clients, and quantum hyperparameters such as qubits and quantum layers, making the simulator suitable for various QFL applications. The system gives immediate feedback following each epoch by showing intermediate outcomes and dynamically illustrating learning curves. SimQFL is a practical and interactive platform enabling academics and developers to prototype, analyze, and tune quantum neural networks with greater transparency and control in distributed quantum networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M.V. Petrenko, A.K. Vershovskii</p>
            <p>Hydrogen-like alkali atoms with a single valence electron are the most common objects in quantum optics and, at the same time, serve as essential tools of the field. Under conditions of optical pumping, strong spin-exchange and ultra-weak magnetic field (spin-exchange relaxation free mode, SERF), ensembles of such atoms in the gas phase can demonstrate not only the absence of spin-exchange relaxation, but also nonlinear collective effects. We present experimental evidence that the alignment, i.e. the quadrupole momentum, can not only be preserved under SERF conditions, but also coexist and interact with the orientation, i.e. the dipole momentum. We also show that this interaction leads to bistability: a small change in conditions can cause the medium to transition to a different steady state, an effect characterized by hysteresis. The combination of properties of this effect opens up a wide range of applications as optical keys or memory elements with a storage time of hundreds of seconds in tasks of quantum information and cryptography.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guilhem Doat, Augustin Vanrietvelde</p>
            <p>The study of quantum reference frames has received renewed interest over the last years, leading to the parallel development of non-equivalent frameworks by different communities. We clarify the differences between these frameworks. At the mathematical level, they mainly differ in the kind of symmetry (either weak or strong) employed to constrain the system. We show that this mathematical difference corresponds to a fundamental physical question: whether the global charge associated to the symmetry group is accessible to symmetry-constrained observers. In this context, we formulate a definition of a perspective in terms of operational capacities, or lack thereof. Turning to consequences of adopting either approach, we discuss how adopting the weak approach induces an ambiguity in the momenta included in each perspective and bars from defining reversible QRF transformations. We then review and analyze the existing arguments motivating each approach, and show how they bear upon the problem of charge accessibility. Finally, we introduce a simple operational scenario in which upholding two reasonable physical postulates leads to the conclusion that internal observers could measure the global charge by 1/ performing a relativized interference measurement and 2/ classically communicating.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement in the energy-constrained prepare-and-measure scenario: applications to randomness certification and channel discrimination</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raffaele D'Avino, Gabriel Senno, Mir Alimuddin, Antonio Acín</p>
            <p>Quantum information tasks are often analyzed under varying trust assumptions about the devices involved. The semi-device-independent (SDI) framework offers a balance between needed assumptions and experimental feasibility. In this work, we study the energy-constrained SDI scenario, where the only assumption in a prepare-and-measure setup is an upper bound on the energy of the prepared quantum states. In contrast to previous studies that restricted the preparation and measurement devices to be classically correlated, we show that allowing entanglement strictly enlarges the set of achievable correlations. We identify two operational consequences of this result. The first concerns randomness certification, where we show that allowing the adversary to employ entangled strategies may significantly reduce the amount of certifiable randomness. This includes situations where the amount of randomness drops to zero in the presence of entanglement, while it remains positive when entanglement is excluded. Second, for the task of distinguishing an arbitrary quantum channel from the identity, we show that the known dimension-independent bound on the advantage conferred by entanglement is violated under an energy constraint.</p>

            <h2>Spatial Incompatibility Witnesses for Quantum Temporal Correlations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiangjing Liu, Harshit Verma, Yunlong Xiao, Oscar Dahlsten, Mile Gu</p>
            <p>We introduce a witness-based framework for certifying quantum temporal correlations via the pseudo-density matrix (PDM) formalism, which is a spatiotemporal generalization of the density matrix. We define spatial incompatibility (SI) as the minimum distance between a PDM and valid density matrices. For trace-norm distance, we show that this reduces to the PDM's negativity, enabling the construction of experimentally accessible SI witnesses. We derive a tight bound on SI for quantum channels and analyze the respective roles of state and channel coherence in witnessing SI. Our approach, unlike the LG framework, exploits measurements that generate coherence through state disturbance. We further show that channels satisfying the LG inequality for incoherent states can still exhibit detectable SI, demonstrating that measurement disturbance enhances the certification of temporal correlations.</p>

            <p>We study quantum differential privacy (QDP) by defining a notion of the order of informativeness between two pairs of quantum states. In particular, we show that if the hypothesis testing divergence of the one pair dominates over that of the other pair, then this dominance holds for every $f$-divergence. This approach completely characterizes $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-QDP mechanisms by identifying the most informative $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-DP quantum state pairs. We apply this to analyze the stability of quantum differentially private learning algorithms, generalizing classical results to the case $\delta>0$. Additionally, we study precise limits for privatized hypothesis testing and privatized quantum parameter estimation, including tight upper-bounds on the quantum Fisher information under QDP. Finally, we establish near-optimal contraction bounds for differentially private quantum channels with respect to the hockey-stick divergence.</p>

            <p>The ability to preserve multipartite entanglement in noisy environments is central to advancing quantum information processing. In this work, we develop a semiclassical theoretical model of three entangled qubits exposed to local Markov noise environments with tunable statistical correlations between noise sources. We show that such correlations can significantly influence the dynamics of multipartite entanglement, in some cases slowing its decay and, under ideal conditions, even enabling full preservation. Using tripartite negativity as an entanglement measure, we derive analytical results for the GHZ and W states, demonstrating their contrasting responses to correlated and anticorrelated noise. Our analysis identifies regimes in which multipartite entanglement can be sustained despite environmental interactions, offering new insight into how noise correlations may serve as a resource for protecting quantum coherence in multi-qubit systems.</p>

            <p>We study many-body quantum geometric effects in time-dependent system with emergent quantum integrable field theory instantaneously. We establish a theorem stating that the Berry connection matrix thus all associated geometric quantities of the system can be precisely characterized by excitations up to two particles from the initial quantum integrable system. To illustrate the many-body geometric influence, we analyze an Ising chain subjected to both a small longitudinal field and a slowly rotating transverse field, whose low-energy physics in the scaling limit is instantaneously governed by the quantum $E_8$ integrable field theory. Focusing on the quantum geometric potential (QGP), we show the QGP continuously suppresses the instantaneous energy gaps with decreasing longitudinal field, thereby enhancing many-body Landau-Zener tunneling as evidenced by the Loschmidt echo and its associated spectral entropy. The critical threshold for the longitudinal field strength is determined,where the spectral entropy linearly increases with system size and exhibits hyperscaling behavior when approaching to the threshold. As the longitudinal field passes the threshold and decreases toward zero, the QGP continuously leads to vanishing instantaneous energy gaps involving more low-energy excitations, resulting in increasing spectral entropy indicative of many-body Landau-Zener tunneling. Our results unveil telltale quantum geometric signatures in time-dependent many-body systems, elucidating the intricate interplay between quantum geometry and dynamics.</p>

            <p>SNSPDs are indispensable for applications ranging from quantum information processing to deep-space optical communications, owing to their high detection efficiency, low dark counts, and excellent timing resolution. However, further improving the intrinsic detection efficiency (IDE) remains crucial for optimizing SNSPD performance. Ion irradiation has recently emerged as a powerful post-fabrication method to enhance SNSPD characteristics. Here, we studied the effects of He-ion irradiation on the thermal properties of NbN SNSPDs. We systematically examine the evolution of thermal boundary conductance as a function of ion fluence (0-1.1E17 ions/cm2), observing a 57% decrease from 127 to 54 W/m^2K^4 with increasing fluence, followed by saturation at approximately 9E16 ions/cm2. At this fluence, the minimum hotspot relaxation time measurements indicate a 41% increase, rising from 17 to 24 ps,while the electron-phonon interaction time decreases, with the magnitude of change depending on temperature and sample this http URL reveals defect formation at the NbN/SiO2 interface (6-8 nm) and He-bubble formation within the SiO2 layer (30-260 nm), contributing to the extended thermal relaxation time. These irradiation-induced modifications play a key role in enhancing the IDE of the treated devices. We further demonstrate a post-irradiation SNSPD showing a saturated IDE plateau at 2000 nm from 2.7 K to 28 mK, enabled by thermal modifications and a weakly wavelength-dependent avalanche-assisted mechanism. Our findings highlight ion irradiation as a valuable tool for thermal tailoring in SNSPDs and advance the understanding of detection physics and defect engineering in superconducting optoelectronics.</p>

            <h2>How gravitational waves change photon orbital angular momentum quantum states</h2>

            <p>We explore the evolution of vortex light in the presence of gravitational waves (GWs) and demonstrate that the quantized orbital angular momentum (OAM) states can make transitions to other states due to the GWs. The interaction is calculated based on the framework of the wave propagation in linearized gravity theory and canonical quantization of the light field in curved spacetime. It is found that when a photon possessing OAM of $l$ interacts with GWs, the OAM modes of $l\pm1$ and $l\pm2$ may be excited with probabilities of $P_{l\pm1}\sim 10^{-17}$ and $P_{l\pm2}\sim 10^{-20}$, respectively. Higher probabilities of the transitions can be achieved when the photon radial wave vector or the propagation distance is increased, or when the photons encounter GWs with stronger amplitudes or smaller frequencies. Thus, a new GW detection technique is proposed, which may exhibit good performance in a wide range of GW frequencies. Furthermore, the detector is insensitive to seismic noise and is more advantageous for determining the distance of the source compared to current interferometer detectors.</p>

            <p>Chirality describes the asymmetry between an object and its mirror image and manifests itself in diverse functionalities across all scales of matter - from molecules and aggregates to thin films and bulk chiral materials. A particularly intriguing example is chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS), where chiral structures orient electron spins enantio-sensitively. Despite extensive research, the fundamental origin of spin-chirality coupling, the unexpectedly large magnitude of the CISS effect, and the possible role of electromagnetic fields in it remain unclear. Here, we address these issues by examining the simplest scenario: spin-resolved photoionization of randomly oriented chiral molecules. We uncover a universal mechanism of spin-selective chiral photodynamics, arising solely from electric-dipole interactions and previously unrecognized. This mechanism embodies a chiral molecular compass - a photoinduced magnetization vector that orients the photoelectron spin. It arises in photoexcited chiral molecules even under isotropic illumination, operates even in isotropic chiral media, and enables a phenomenon central to CISS: locking of the photoelectron spin orientation to molecular geometry. It shows that chiral molecules can sustain time-odd correlations whereas achiral molecules cannot. Our findings have broad implications, from unambiguously identifying the origin of CISS effect in photoionization to harvesting correlations underlying this effect in other forms of CISS in various chiral materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shuze Chen, Tianyi Peng</p>
            <p>Value decomposition has long been a fundamental technique in multi-agent dynamic programming and reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, the value function of a global state $(s_1,s_2,\ldots,s_N)$ is often approximated as the sum of local functions: $V(s_1,s_2,\ldots,s_N)\approx\sum_{i=1}^N V_i(s_i)$. This approach traces back to the index policy in restless multi-armed bandit problems and has found various applications in modern RL systems. However, the theoretical justification for why this decomposition works so effectively remains underexplored. In this paper, we uncover the underlying mathematical structure that enables value decomposition. We demonstrate that a multi-agent Markov decision process (MDP) permits value decomposition if and only if its transition matrix is not "entangled" -- a concept analogous to quantum entanglement in quantum physics. Drawing inspiration from how physicists measure quantum entanglement, we introduce how to measure the "Markov entanglement" for multi-agent MDPs and show that this measure can be used to bound the decomposition error in general multi-agent MDPs. Using the concept of Markov entanglement, we proved that a widely-used class of index policies is weakly entangled and enjoys a sublinear $\mathcal O(\sqrt{N})$ scale of decomposition error for $N$-agent systems. Finally, we show how Markov entanglement can be efficiently estimated in practice, providing practitioners with an empirical proxy for the quality of value decomposition.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Federico Piazza</p>
            <p>I investigate spacetime singularities from the point of view of the wavefunction of the universe. In order to extend the classical notion of geodesic incompleteness one has to include the proper time of an observer as a degree of freedom in the Wheeler DeWitt equation. This leads to a Schrödinger equation along the observer worldline. Near the singularity, as in the classical BLK treatment, I ignore spatial gradients and effectively describe the spacetime around the worldline in the mini-superspace approximation. Then the problem proves identical to a spherically symmetric scattering of a quantum particle off a central potential and singularity avoidance is tantamount to unitary evolution for this system. Standard types of matter (dust, radiation) correspond to regular potentials and thus lead to a bounce. The most singular component, spatial anisotropy, is associated to a conserved charge and yields a negative inverse-square potential -- like standard angular momentum, but with opposite sign. This potential is critical, in that the unitarity of the evolution depends on the actual numerical factor in front of it, i.e., on the anisotropy charge.</p>

            <p>We consider quenches of a quantum system that is prepared in a canonical equilibrium state of one Hamiltonian and then evolves unitarily in time under a different Hamiltonian. Technically, our main result is a systematic expansion of the pre- and post-quench canonical ensembles in the quench strength. We first demonstrate how this can be used to predict the system's temperature after the quench from equilibrium properties at the pre-quench temperature. For a thermalizing post-quench system, it furthermore allows us to calculate equilibrium observable expectation values. Finally, in the presence of additional conserved quantities besides the Hamiltonian, we obtain a hierarchy of necessary conditions for thermalization towards the (post-quench) canonical ensemble. At first order, these thermalization conditions have a nice geometric interpretation in operator space with the canonical covariance as a semi-inner product: The quench operator (difference between post- and pre-quench Hamiltonians) and the conserved quantity must be orthogonal in the orthogonal complement of the post-quench Hamiltonian. We illustrate the results numerically for a variety of setups involving integrable and nonintegrable models.</p>

Here we establish the bulk-boundary correspondence for graphene embedded in a circularly polarized cavity. By combining exact diagonalization (ED) of zigzag ribbons, a semi-analytic T-matrix for half-infinite lattices, and analytical insights from a Dirac-Jaynes-Cummings model, we show that (i) every light-matter interaction-induced gap hosts pairs of unidirectional light-matter edge currents depending on the Chern number of the band while some of them are even bright; (ii) these chiral states persist throughout the entire photon ladder; and (iii) their dispersion, localization length and photon distribution exhibit a universal scaling controlled by the light-matter interaction. Time-evolution simulations further demonstrate that a dark electronic edge excitation can be converted into a bright and unidirectionally propagating current that remains coherent over long time scales. Our results predict an experimental signature of the hybrid band topology and a blueprint for tunable chiral channels in next generation quantum optical solid-state devices.</p>

            <p>We propose a method for using a single-axis atom interferometric gravity gradiometer to measure off-diagonal elements of the gravity gradient tensor. By tilting the gradiometer, the measured gradient becomes a linear combination of different components of the gravity gradient tensor, and through multiple measurements at different tilts the separate tensor components can be inferred. We present a theoretical and numerical investigation of this technique, both for terrestrial surveys where the tilt is statically set by the user and for surveys where a strapdown sensor is dynamically tilted by the motion of the platform. We show that the gradiometer's sensitivity to the vertical gravity gradient is only slightly reduced by this method while allowing for more gradiometer information to be obtained. Major sources of error and loss of sensitivity on dynamic platforms are shown to be mitigated using an optical-gimbal technique employing commercially-available fibre-optic gyroscopes and tip-tilt mirrors.</p>

            <p>This essay offers an epistemological reinterpretation of the foundational divide between matrix mechanics and wave mechanics.

These epistemic architectures anticipate, in philosophical form, the logical asymmetry expressed by the P versus NP problem in computational complexity. Here, the contrast between efficient generation and efficient recognition is treated not as a mathematical taxonomy but as a framework for understanding how knowledge is produced and validated across physics, computation, and cognition. The essay reconstructs the mathematical history of quantum mechanics through the original derivations of Werner Heisenberg, Max Born, Pascual Jordan, Paul Dirac, Erwin Schrödinger, Paul Ehrenfest, and Wolfgang Pauli, culminating in John von Neumann's unification of both approaches within the formalism of Hilbert space. By juxtaposing Heisenberg's algorithmic formalism with Schrödinger's representational one, it argues that their divergence reveals a structural feature of scientific reasoning itself-the enduring tension between what can be procedurally constructed and what can only be recognized.</p>

            <p>We propose and demonstrate an experimental scheme to engineer thermal baths with independently tunable temperatures and dissipation rates for the motional modes of a trapped-ion system. This approach enables robust thermal-state preparation and quantum simulations of open-system dynamics in bosonic and spin-boson models at well-controlled finite temperatures. We benchmark our protocol by experimentally realizing out-of-equilibrium dynamics of a charge-transfer model at different temperatures. We observe that, when the process occurs at a higher temperature, the transfer rate spectrum broadens, with reduced rates at small donor-acceptor energy gaps and enhanced rates at large gaps. We then employ our scheme to study local-temperature effects in a two-mode vibrationally assisted exciton transfer system, where we observe thermally activated interference pathways for excitation transfer.</p>

            <h2>Hybrid Atomistic-Parametric Decoherence Model for Molecular Spin Qubits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Katy Aruachan, Sanoj Raj, Yamil J. Colón, Daniel Aravena, Felipe Herrera</p>
            <p>Solid-state molecular qubits with open-shell ground states have great potential for addressability, scalability, and tunability, but understanding the fundamental limits of quantum coherence in these systems is challenging due to the complexity of the qubit environment. To address this, we develop a random Hamiltonian approach where the molecular $g$-tensor fluctuates due to classical lattice motion obtained from molecular dynamics simulations at constant temperature. Atomistic $g$-tensor fluctuations are used to construct Redfield quantum master equations that predict the relaxation $T_1$ and dephasing $T_2$ times of copper porphyrin qubits in a crystalline framework. Assuming one-phonon spin-lattice interaction processes, $1/T$ temperature scaling and $1/B^3$ magnetic field scaling of $T_1$ are established using atomistic bath correlation functions. Atomistic $T_1$ predictions overestimate the available experimental data by orders of magnitude. Quantitative agreement with measurements at all magnetic fields is restored by introducing a magnetic field noise model to describe lattice nuclear spins, with field-dependent noise amplitude in the range $\delta B\sim 10\,\mu{\rm T}- 1\,{\rm mT}$ for the copper porphyrin system. We show that while $T_1$ scales as $1/B$ experimentally due to a combination of spin-lattice and magnetic noise contributions, $T_2$ scales strictly as $ 1/B^2$ due to low-frequency dephasing processes associated with magnetic field noise. Our work demonstrates the potential of dynamical methods for modeling the open quantum system dynamics of molecular spin qubits.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Konrad Mickiewicz, Valentin Link, Walter T. Strunz</p>
            <p>We present an approach for efficiently simulating strongly damped quantum systems subjected to periodic driving, employing a periodic matrix product operator representation of the influence functional. This representation enables the construction of a numerically exact Floquet propagator that captures the non-Markovian open system dynamics, thus providing a dissipative analogue to the Floquet Hamiltonian of driven isolated quantum systems. We apply this method to study the asymptotic heating of a reservoir in spin-boson models, characterizing the deviation from equilibrium conditions. Moreover, we show how a local driving of two qubits can be utilized to stabilize a transient entanglement buildup of the qubits originating from the interaction with a common environment. Our results make it possible to directly study both stationary and transient dynamics of strongly damped and driven quantum systems within a transparent theoretical and numerical framework.</p>

            <h2>Modelling many-body quantum dynamics with stochastic trajectories: a critical test on the Tavis-Cummings model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. Leonau, S. Chuchurka, V. Sukharnikov, A. Benediktovitch, N. Rohringer</p>
            <p>We critically explore the applicability of a recently proposed framework to sample the quantum dynamics of a many-body quantum system interacting with light by stochastic trajectories, applying it to the closed and open Tavis-Cummings model (TCM). The stochastic differential equations (SDEs) sample the positive P phase-space representation by analog complex-valued dynamical variables that are linked to the quantum operators. Statistical average over the stochastic trajectories yields the evolution of the quantum mechanical expectation values. However, numerical implementation of these SDEs for the TCM indicates divergent solutions, also known from other phase-space methods. This limits the applicability of the framework to finite propagation times, that are strongly dependent on the physical parameters and initial conditions of the system. We outline the underlying mathematical reason for these divergences and show that their contribution to the averages are, however, essential. To attempt to regularize the divergences, we transform the SDEs to an equivalent set of SDEs with different noise realisations, thereby pushing the valid time boundary. Quantum collapse and revival of the TCM, however, cannot be recovered by the stochastic trajectory approach, pointing to the general difficulty of the applicability of stochastic phase-space sampling methods to systems with strong quantum features.</p>

            <p>Massive quantum systems have emerged as compelling tabletop interface-systems for testing the quantum nature of gravity. However, conventional schemes that focus on directly using gravity to induce entanglement suffer from overwhelming environmental decoherence: maintaining entanglement between two oscillators requires an impractically high mechanical quality factor. In this work, we put forward an alternative reservoir-engineered scheme, whose core function is to quantify how gravity modifies (rather than prepares) the steady-state entanglement. Compared to quantum gravity, classical gravity introduces additional dissipative channels, which in turn give rise to distinct entanglement characteristics and thus enable the discrimination between the two types of gravity. Notably, this entanglement difference can still be maintained even when the mechanical quality factor is far below the threshold required by conventional schemes. Moreover, it demonstrates significant robustness against non-gravitational couplings, specifically, those like Casimir and Coulomb forces that are inherent in experimental setups. Our scheme relaxes the experimental requirements for verifying quantum gravity, thereby paving a new path toward its near-term realization.</p>

            <p>Photon loss is the biggest enemy in quantum communications. Direct transmission typically results in a small fraction of photons surviving over long distances, hindering advanced applications such as loophole-free Bell tests and device-independent quantum key distribution. Quantum teleportation offers a "disembodied" way of transferring particles through a virtual channel--quantum entanglement--which, in principle, could overcome the photon transmission loss. Experimentally, however, no previous quantum teleportation of single photons has shown a higher survival probability than using direct transmission. To overcome this challenge, here we first propose and demonstrate an all-optical scheme for remote preparation of entangled photons. Through an effective 15-dB channel loss, we realize a heralding efficiency of 82% for event-ready entangled photons. Based on the prior distributed entanglement, we demonstrate that teleportation-based transmission efficiency offers a 2.95-fold enhancement, compared to using direct transmission through the same channel, therefore establishing an unconditional teleportational advantage.</p>

            <h2>Multipolar and nonlocal effects in plasmon-mediated entanglement generation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luke C. Ugwuoke, Tjaart P. J. Krüger, Mark S. Tame</p>
            <p>The generation of quantum entanglement is important for a wide range of quantum technology protocols. In nanophotonics, a promising platform for quantum technologies, entanglement generation via plasmon-mediated coupling in quantum dot qubits is often modeled within the dipole limit, where only dipolar plasmons of the mediating nanoparticle are considered, and the local response approximation, where nonlocal corrections are ignored. However, multipolar effects manifest strongly at coupling distances less than the nanoparticle size, while nonlocal optical effects stem from a size-induced dielectric response. We investigated these two important effects in the generation of two-qubit entanglement mediated by plasmonic coupling. A cavity quantum electrodynamic approach is employed, where the induced plasmonic effects lead to modified transition rates in the dynamics of the coupled quantum dot qubits. We find that multipolar modes and size-dependent damping lead to entanglement decay at small coupling distances and limit mediated entanglement with certain particle sizes. We discuss potential implications of multipolar modes in entanglement-based quantum sensing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> James Brown, Tarini S Hardikar, Kenny Heitritter, Kanav Setia</p>
            <p>Simulating molecular systems on quantum computers requires efficient mappings from Fermionic operators to qubit operators. Traditional mappings such as Jordan-Wigner or Bravyi-Kitaev often produce high-weight Pauli terms, increasing circuit depth and measurement complexity. Although several local qubit mappings have been proposed to address this challenge, most are specialized for structured models like the Hubbard Hamiltonian and perform poorly for realistic chemical systems with dense two-body interactions. In this work, we utilize a suite of techniques to construct compact and noise-resilient Fermion-to-qubit mappings suitable for general molecular Hamiltonians. Building on the Generalized Superfast Encoding (GSE) and other similar works, we demonstrate that it outperforms prior encodings in both accuracy and hardware efficiency for molecular simulations. Our improvements include path optimization within the Hamiltonian's interaction graph to minimize operator weight, introduction of multi-edge graph structures for enhanced error detection without added circuit depth, and a stabilizer measurement framework that directly maps logical terms and stabilizers to the Z-basis using Clifford simulation. Applying these methods to simulations of $(H_2)_2$ and $(H_2)_3$ systems yields significantly improved absolute and correlation energy estimates under realistic hardware noise, with further accuracy gains achieved by increasing code distance. We also propose a [[2N, N, 2]] variant of GSE compatible with square-lattice and (quasi-)linear hardware topologies, demonstrating a twofold reduction in RMSE for orbital rotations on IBM Kingston hardware. These results establish GSE as a very attractive mapping for molecular quantum simulations.</p>

            <p>Establishing quantum gravity theory remains one of the major challenges in modern physics, as the lack of experimental evidence makes it difficult to explore. In response to this challenge, proposals to test quantum entanglement induced by Newtonian gravity in table-top experiments have attracted significant attention as a potentially feasible approach far below the Planck energy scale. In this work, we propose a scheme to amplify gravity-induced entanglement between two masses using parametric resonance. Specifically, we consider two parametrically resonant oscillators interacting through Newtonian gravity, each governed by the Mathieu equation. We analyzed the logarithmic negativity between two oscillators and investigate the effects of random force noise and linear damping. As a result, we find an exponential growth of gravity-induced entanglement between the oscillators, which reflects the dynamical instability of parametric resonant systems.</p>

            <p>Quantum entanglement is one of the primary features which distinguishes quantum computers from classical computers. In gate-based quantum computing, the creation of entangled states or the distribution of entanglement across a quantum processor often requires circuit depths which grow with the number of entangled qubits. However, in teleportation-based quantum computing, one can deterministically generate entangled states with a circuit depth that is constant in the number of qubits, provided that one has access to an entangled resource state, the ability to perform mid-circuit measurements, and can rapidly transmit classical information. In this work, aided by fast classical field programmable gate array-based control hardware with a feedback latency of only 150 ns, we explore the utility of teleportation-based protocols for generating non-local, multi-partite entanglement between superconducting qubits. First, we demonstrate well-known protocols for generating Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states and non-local CNOT gates in constant depth. Next, we utilize both protocols for implementing a quantum fan-out gate in constant depth among three non-local qubits (i.e., controlled-NOT-NOT). Finally, we demonstrate deterministic state teleportation and entanglement swapping between qubits on opposite sides of our quantum processor. Throughout this work, we find that the fidelity of our teleportation-based protocols is limited by measurement-induced dephasing on idling spectator qubits. Therefore, our work serves as a useful study of the current benefits and limitations of teleportation-based protocols on contemporary superconducting quantum processors.</p>

            <h2>Optimizing quantum violation for multipartite facet Bell inequalities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jin-Fu Chen, Mengyao Hu, Jordi Tura</p>
            <p>Nonlocality shapes quantum correlations, revealed through the violation of Bell inequalities. The intersection of all valid Bell inequalities is the so-called local polytope. In multipartite systems, characterizing the local polytope quickly becomes an intractable task as the system size increases. Optimizing Bell inequalities to maximize the ratio between their quantum value and classical bound is key to understanding multipartite nonlocality. We propose a gradient-based method for this optimization. Numerical results indicate that local maxima of this ratio typically correspond to facet Bell inequalities of the local polytope. This enables an iterative search for tight and robust Bell inequalities. Applied to permutation-invariant scenarios, the method provides tight Bell inequalities with large quantum violations and facilitates experimental certification of Bell correlations without full knowledge of the local polytope.</p>

            <p>Recently, a technique known as quantum symmetry test has gained increasing attention for detecting bipartite entanglement in pure quantum states. In this work we show that, beyond qualitative detection, a family of well-defined measures of bipartite and multipartite entanglement can be obtained with symmetry tests. We propose and benchmark several efficient methods to estimate these measures, and derive near-optimal sampling strategies for each. Despite the nonlinearity of the methods, we demonstrate that the sampling error scales no worse than $O(N_{\mathrm{tot}}^{-1/2})$ with the total number of copies $N_{\mathrm{tot}}$, which suggests experimental feasibility. By exploiting symmetries we compute our measures for large number of copies, and derive the asymptotic decay exponents for relevant states in many-body systems. Using these results we identify tradeoffs between estimation complexity and sensitivity of the presented entanglement measures, oriented to practical implementations.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we investigate the nonlinear properties of the double-Morse potential as a possible resource for single-mode quantum states because of its double-well structure and anharmonicity. We derive the ground state wave function and the associated energy spectrum analytically, using the asymmetry (width parameter) $\alpha$ as the primary control parameter. These results show a systematic and evident influence on $\alpha$. We assess the non-Gaussianity and non-classicality measures, quantifying their nonlinearity and quantum behavior. In particular, we discover that both metrics rise monotonically with $\alpha$. Furthermore, we examine the metrological performance for estimating $\alpha$. By calculating the pertinent Fisher information and building workable estimators, we show that optimal strategies can saturate the Cramér-Rao bound, with straightforward position measurements on shallow wells already producing high precision. These results collectively demonstrate that the double-Morse potential is a genuine, controllable source of non-Gaussianity, whose non-classicality and metrological applications increase with $\alpha$. We highlight the potential applications of this model in real-world quantum technologies and discuss the implications for continuous-variable quantum information processing and computation.</p>

            <p>Quantum Secure Direct Communication (QSDC), a paradigm-shifting breakthrough in quantum communication, exploits quantum states for unmediated information transmission. Rooted in the inviolable fundamental laws of quantum mechanics, QSDC enables ultrasensitive detection of even the faintest eavesdropping attempts, guaranteeing true communication security solely when no interference exists. If eavesdropping or intrusion is detected mid-transmission, the system instantly alerts users and severs data flow, shielding them from unauthorized tracking and mitigating hacker threats. Over two decades, QSDC has seen extraordinary advancements, currently attaining kilobit-per-second transmission over 100 km of commercial optical fiber. However, its practical scalability remains constrained by insufficient transmission rates, a critical bottleneck. Semantic communication, which drastically boosts transmission efficiency by extracting core information features, nevertheless stays vulnerable to malicious intrusions. Integrating these paradigms promises to simultaneously enhance equivalent data rate and security. Herein, we propose and experimentally validate a quantum semantic communication scheme, applying it to 3D point clouds. It achieves a 46.30-fold efficiency gain over direct transmission, surpassing both Wyner and Shannon capacity limits. This breakthrough not only clears the path for large-scale QSDC deployment but also marks a pivotal milestone in quantum information science.</p>

            <p>Cavity magnonics, owing to its strong magnon-photon coupling and excellent tunability, has attracted significant interest in quantum information science. However, achieving strong and robust macroscopic entanglement remains a long-standing challenge due to the inherently linear nature of the beam-splitter interaction. Here, we propose an experimentally feasible scheme to generate and enhance macroscopic entanglement between two remote magnon modes by injecting squeezed vacuum fields (SVFs) into coupled microwave cavities. We demonstrate that even a single SVF applied to one cavity can induce steady magnon-magnon entanglement, while applying two SVFs (the double-squeezed configuration) enables selective activation of two independent entanglement channels associated with the cavity supermodes. Remarkably, quantum interference between the two SVFs allows for phase-controlled enhancement of entanglement, resulting in significantly improved robustness against cavity dissipation and thermal noise. Under realistic parameters, the survival temperature of quantum entanglement increases from approximately $260$ mK to $450$ mK. Our results open a promising route toward controllable and thermally resilient macroscopic entanglement in cavity magnonics. Our results establish a versatile and controllable approach to generating and enhancing quantum entanglement through double-squeezed-field interference, opening new avenues to study and enhance macroscopic quantum physics in cavity-magnon systems with only beam-splitter interactions.</p>

            <p>We study the polaritonic states and dynamics of multiple Jahn-Teller (JT) active molecules coupled to the modes of a Fabry-Perot cavity. We find that collective effects dramatically alter the interplay of electronic, vibrational and cavity angular momenta, giving rise to markedly different polaritonic spectra and dynamics even when going from one to two JT molecules. Starting from the ground vibronic state, we find that JT molecules collectively coupled to a common cavity can access a cascade of high-angular-momentum vibronic states in the presence of a single cavity photon, in sharp contrast to the single molecule case where the range of accessible vibronic angular momentum values are bounded. The observable consequences are a broadening of the cavity-molecular polariton spectrum and a suppression of photon polarization dynamics under broadband excitation of the system. Our results uncover new pathways for vibronic angular momentum transfer unique to collective molecular polaritonics with potential implications for cavity-assisted photo-physics and photo-chemistry.</p>

            <p>Interactions between objects can be classified as fundamental or emergent. Fundamental interactions are either extremely short-range or decay inversely with the separation distance, such as the Coulomb potential between charges or the gravitational attraction between masses. In contrast, emergent quantum van der Waals (vdW) and Casimir interactions decay considerably faster ($R^{-6}$ or $R^{-7}$) with distance $R$. Here we apply perturbative quantum electrodynamics (QED) to a many-body (MB) system of atoms modeled as charged harmonic oscillators, and reveal a persistent inverse-distance MB-QED interaction stemming from the coupling between virtual photons and molecular plasmons in the non-retarded regime. This interaction, scaling with the third power of the fine-structure constant, is reminiscent of the Lamb shift for a single atom. Although weaker than vdW forces, this MB-QED $R^{-1}$ interaction may substantially surpass gravitational attraction in future experiments probing quantum gravity at microscopic scales.</p>

            <p>The Exact Factorization (EF) theory aims at the separation of the nuclear and electronic degrees of freedom in the many-body (MB) quantum mechanical problem. Being formally equivalent to the solution of the MB Schrödinger equation, EF sets up a strategy for the construction of efficient approximations in the theory of the correlated electronic-nuclear motion. Here we extend the EF formalism to incorporate the case of a system under the action of an electromagnetic field. An important interplay between the physical magnetic and the Berry-curvature fields is revealed and discussed within the fully non-adiabatic theory. In particular, it is a known property of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation that, for a neutral atom in a uniform magnetic field, the latter is compensated by the Berry-curvature field in the nuclear equation of motion (\citet{Yin-92}). From an intuitive argument that the atom must not be deflected by the Lorentz force from a straight line trajectory, it has been conjectured that the same compensation should occur within the EF theory as well. We give a rigorous proof of this property.</p>

Ion implantation into the top p-doped layer of a p-i-n diode creates high-resistivity tracks, providing electrical isolation between adjacent regions.

In contrast, physical etching can reduce single-band transmission by more than 30% for an etch width of 100 nm. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach using quantum dots embedded in a glideplane photonic crystal waveguide, controlling the detuning between different spin-state combinations of two highly chiral quantum dots coupled to the same mode. Second-order photon correlation measurements provide a sensitive probe of the chirality-dependent photon statistics, which are in good agreement with a waveguide-QED master equation model.

Here we investigate spectroscopic signatures owing to the angular momentum quantization of the atomic states utilized in an electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT) sensing scheme for linearly polarized RF fields. Specific combinations of atomic terms are shown to give rise to universal, distinctive fingerprints in the detected optical fields upon rotating the RF field polarization. Using a dressed state picture, we identify two types of atomic angular momentum ladders that display strikingly disparate spectroscopic signatures, including the complementary absence or presence of a central spectral EIT peak. Our study adds important insights into the prospects of Rydberg atomic gases for quantum metrological electric field characterization.

            <p>Photon loss is the dominant source of noise in optical quantum systems. The Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) bosonic code provides significant protection; however, even low levels of loss can generate uncorrectable errors that another concatenated code must handle. In this work, we characterize these errors by deriving analytic expressions for the logical channel that arises from pure loss acting on approximate GKP qubits. Unlike random displacement noise, we find that the loss-induced logical channel is not a stochastic Pauli channel. We also provide analytic expressions for the logical channel for "heralded loss," when the light scattered out of the signal mode is measured either by photon number counting -- i.e., photon subtraction -- or heterodyne detection. These offer a pathway to intentionally inducing non-Pauli channels for, e.g., magic-state production.</p>

The detector's material inhomogeneity gives access to direct vector coupling to the dark-matter field. We conduct a Bayesian search based on matched-filter statistics, yielding upper bounds consistent with thermal noise and above those set by equivalence principle tests. No signal is observed, but the experiment demonstrates stable, quantum-limited operation and validates a scalable approach to resonant detection. With optimized test masses, lower temperature, and multiplexed arrays, the platform offers a path toward competitive constraints on vector-mediated dark-matter interactions.</p>

            <h2>From Quantum Relative Entropy to the Semiclassical Einstein Equations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Philipp Dorau, Albert Much</p>
            <p>We provide arguments indicating that the semiclassical Einstein equations follow from quantum relative entropy and its proportionality to an area variation. Using modular theory, we establish that the relative entropy between the vacuum state and coherent excitations of a scalar quantum field on a bifurcate Killing horizon is given by the energy flux across the horizon. Under the assumption of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy-area formula, this energy flux is proportional to a variation in the surface area of the horizon cross section. The semiclassical Einstein equations follow automatically from this identification. Our approach provides a quantum field theoretic generalization of Jacobson's thermodynamic derivation of the Einstein equations, replacing classical thermodynamic entropy with the well-defined quantum relative (Araki-Uhlmann) entropy. This suggests that quantum information plays a central role in what is often seen as a zeroth order approximation of a theory of quantum gravity, namely quantum field theory in curved spacetimes.</p>

            <h2>Controlled generation of 3D vortices in driven atomic Josephson junctions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vijay Pal Singh, Ludwig Mathey, Herwig Ott, Luigi Amico</p>
            <p>We propose an ac-driven atomic Josephson junction as a clean and tunable source of three dimensional (3D) solitary waves in quantum fluids. Depending on the height of the junction barrier, the emitted excitations appear as vortex rings at low velocity or vorticity-free rarefaction pulses near the sound velocity, thus spanning the complete Jones-Roberts family of solitons. The Shapiro-step phenomenon renders the emission deterministic: on the first, second, third Shapiro steps, the junction ejects one, two, and three solitary excitations per drive cycle. This enables controlled generation of single- and multi-excitation configurations, allowing detailed studies of the full crossover between vortex rings and rarefaction pulses and their interaction dynamics. In particular, deterministic multi-ring emission provides insights into leapfrogging dynamics of two and three coaxial rings and their decay via boundary-assisted, sound-mediated processes. This ac-driven protocol establishes a compact and reproducible platform for generating, classifying, and controlling 3D solitonic excitations, paving the way for precision studies of nonlinear vortex dynamics, dissipation, and quantum turbulence in trapped superfluids.</p>

            <h2>Memory effects in repeated uses of quantum channels</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hayden Zammit, Roberto Salazar, Gianluca Valentino, Johann A. Briffa, Tony J. G. Apollaro</p>
            <p>Quantum Information Processing (QIP) tasks can be efficiently formulated in terms of quantum dynamical maps, whose formalism is able to provide the appropriate mathematical representation of the evolution of open quantum systems. A key QIP task is quantum state transfer (QST) aimed at sharing quantum information between distant nodes of a quantum network, enabling, e.g. quantum key distribution and distributed quantum computing. QST has primarily been addressed insofar by resetting the quantum channel after each use, thus giving rise to memoryless channels. Here we consider the case where the quantum channel is continuously used, without implementing time- and resource- consuming resetting operations. We derive a general, analytical expression for the $n^{\mathrm{th}}$-use average QST fidelity for $U(1)$-symmetric channels and apply our formalism to a perfect QST channel in the presence of imperfect readout timing. We show that even relatively small readout timing errors give rise to memory effects which have a highly detrimental impact on subsequent QST tasks.</p>

            <p>Randomness is fundamental for secure communication and information processing. While continuous-variable optical systems offer an attractive platform for this task, certifying genuine quantum randomness in such setups remains challenging. We present a semi-device-independent scheme for randomness certification tailored to continuous-variable implementations, where the dimension assumption is operationally implemented by restricting state preparations to the two-level Fock subspace. Using standard homodyne and displacement-based measurements, we show that simple optical setups can achieve dimension-witness violations that certify positive min-entropy, even in the presence of realistic losses and misaligned reference frames. These results demonstrate that practical and scalable quantum randomness generation is achievable with minimal experimental complexity on continuous-variable platforms.</p>

            <p>The negatively charged tin-vacancy center in diamond (SnV-) is an excellent solid state qubit with optically-addressable transitions and a long electron spin coherence time at elevated temperatures. However, implementing scalable quantum nodes with high-fidelity optical readout of the electron spin state requires efficient photon emission and collection from the system. In this manuscript, we report a quantum photonic interface for SnV- centers based on one-dimensional photonic crystal cavities fabricated in diamond thin films. Furthermore, we develop a model describing the spontaneous emission dynamics of our system, allowing for rigorous determination of Purcell factors and the C/D branching ratio from cavity enhancement of the C and D transitions of the SnV- zero phonon line. We observe quality factors up to ~6000 across this sample, and measure up to a 12-fold lifetime reduction. By considering the lifetime reduction of both the C and D transitions independently, we determine the C/D branching ratio to be {\eta}BR=0.7815, in line with previous theoretical and experimental findings. Finally from our analysis, we extract a Purcell factor of up to Fc=26.21(0.01) for a single SnV- transition.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stephen Brockerhoff, Brittany Corn-Agostini</p>
            <p>The ability to preserve multipartite entanglement in noisy environments is central to advancing quantum information processing. In this work, we develop a semiclassical theoretical model of three entangled qubits exposed to local Markov noise environments with tunable statistical correlations between noise sources. We show that such correlations can significantly influence the dynamics of multipartite entanglement, in some cases slowing its decay and, under ideal conditions, even enabling full preservation. Using tripartite negativity as an entanglement measure, we derive analytical results for the GHZ and W states, demonstrating their contrasting responses to correlated and anticorrelated noise. Our analysis identifies regimes in which multipartite entanglement can be sustained despite environmental interactions, offering new insight into how noise correlations may serve as a resource for protecting quantum coherence in multi-qubit systems.</p>

            <h2>Self-induced manipulation of biphoton entanglement in topologically distinct modes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei-Wei Zhang, Chao Chen, Jizhou Wu</p>
            <p>Biphoton states have shown promising applications in quantum information processing, including quantum communications, quantum metrology, and quantum imaging. The generation and manipulation of biphoton entanglement in topologically distinct modes paves the way in this direction. Here we present a comprehensive method for regulating the topological properties of the system by combining the nonlinearity in waveguides, i.e., nonlinearity in the waveguide coupling materials, and the waveguide lattice structure. Our method enables the generation of topological biphoton states with injected pump activation on the topologically trivial modes. This is realized through self-induced manipulation on pump-dependent nonlinear couplings on the defects, which is unable to be realized while there are no such nonlinear couplings. Specifically, by including the nonlinear gain/loss mechanism in the coupling between the nearest-neighbor waveguides and the third-order Kerr nonlinearity effect along the waveguides, the injected pump power will be the controllable parameter for the manipulation of the topology in the defect states and the generation of biphoton entanglement states. We also present an experimental proposal to realize our scheme and its generalization in the contemporaneous "active" topological photonics time-bin platforms. Our method can be used in other Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) models with various defect configurations. Our method enables the reusability and versatility of SSH lattice chips and their application for fault-tolerant quantum information processing, promoting the industrialization process of quantum technology.</p>

Our approach achieves reliable integrated quantum storage with record efficiencies of 80.3(7)% for weak coherent pulses and 69.8(1.6)% for telecom-heralded single photons, alongside the storage of 20 temporal modes with an average efficiency of 51.3(2)%. Moreover, the thin-membrane Eu3+:Y2SiO5 architecture enables spectrally tunable efficient quantum storage via variable strain, providing a flexible interface for quantum networks. By combining high efficiency, large multimode capacity, and tunability, our devices establish a versatile hardware foundation for scalable quantum repeaters and chip-scale photonic processors.</p>

            <h2>Recovery of optical losses with the Petz recovery map</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jinyan Chen, Minjeong Song, Valerio Scarani</p>
            <p>Optical systems are a main platform for quantum information processing, while a hidden challenge in these systems is information loss due to scattering into unmonitored modes, typically modeled as state-independent beam-splitter interactions. While such losses simply erase information encoded across modes, they directly degrade information encoded in the quantum state of a mode. Perfect correction of these Gaussian lossy channels with Gaussian operations alone is known to be impossible. In this work, we investigate the Petz recovery map as an approximate recovery. We construct the Petz recovery of single mode losses and its implementations. In particular, we show that the recovery performance of Petz recovery map is better than the recovery protocol that replaces the noisy state with the belief state. Also, when the reference state is far from the true state, it is better not to use the Petz recovery map but to leave the noisy state instead. We discuss the physical intuition of Petz recovery map and finally shows that it is near-optimal among the considered recovery protocols.</p>

We obtain concrete criteria for successful coherence-to-work conversion, and highlight the importance of a coherent motor-battery interaction. This device harnesses nonclassical features during all stages of its cycle, and demonstrates the functionality of a nanomachine whose parts are all quantum coherent.</p>

            <p>We introduce a family of bosonic quantum error-correcting codes built as a rotation-symmetric superposition of squeezed vacuum states, which promise protection against both loss and dephasing noise channels. The robustness of these "squeezed-vacuum codes" arises from being arranged at evenly spaced angles in phase-space, and simultaneously in evenly spaced photon-number support $n \equiv {2k} \! \pmod {2m}$. We present simple preparation circuits: a two-legged code using a Hadamard-conditional-squeezing-Hadamard sequence on an ancilla qubit, and for general "$m$-legged" codewords using sequences of conditional rotations. The performance of these codes is evaluated against loss and dephasing noises using the Knill-Laflamme violation function and benchmarked against cat codes. As the number $m$ of squeezed-vacuum states in a code increases, the code exhibits improved loss tolerance at the cost of higher dephasing sensitivity. We outline implementations in circuit QED and trapped-ion platforms, where high-fidelity Gaussian operations and conditional controls are available or under active development. These results help establish squeezed-vacuum codes as practical, hardware-ready, members of the bosonic codes class.</p>

            <p>Optical neural networks (ONNs) have been developed to enhance processing speed and energy efficiency in machine learning by leveraging optical devices for nonlinear activation and establishing connections among neurons. In this work, we propose a quantum optical neural network (QONN) that utilizes atom-cavity neurons with controllable photon absorption and emission. These quantum neurons are designed to replace the electronic components in ONNs, which typically introduce delays and substantial energy consumption during nonlinear activation. To evaluate the performance of the QONN, we apply it to the MNIST digit classification task, considering the effects of photon absorption duration, random atom-cavity detuning, and stochastic photon loss. Additionally, we introduce a convolutional QONN to facilitate a real-world satellite image classification (SAT-6) task. Due to its compact hardware and low power consumption, the QONN offers a promising solution for real-time satellite sensing, reducing communication bandwidth with ground stations and thereby enhancing data security.</p>

            <p>Single-photon emitters are fundamental building blocks for quantum information processing, communication and sensing. However, unwanted interactions with bulk phonons in their host environment strongly limit their coherence and controllability. We report single color centers in nanodiamonds that are strongly and comprehensively decoupled from the bulk phononic environment. The color centers feature record-narrow linewidths down to 0.3 nm at room temperature and stable, bright emission, exceeding 10 Mcps in saturation. Notably, the bulk phonon sideband is almost entirely suppressed, revealing the presence of a single localized vibrational mode outside the diamond phonon band. Our observations and simulations point towards a unique mechanism for phonon decoupling in common wide-gap materials, based on a strongly radiative orbital transition coupled to a localized vibrational mode. The new color center enables qualitatively higher performance for applications in quantum networks and nanoscale sensing, and the exploration of new physical resources associated with vibrational states.</p>

            <p>We investigate quantum coherence in a hybrid cavity magnomechanical system incorporating a squeezed-magnon drive. By analyzing the Gaussian quantum coherence of the cavity, magnonic, and mechanical subsystems, as well as the total system coherence, we identify the critical roles of phase control, coupling strength, drive power, and thermal noise. We show that the squeezing amplitude and phase precisely modulate the effective magnon frequency and damping, enabling phase-dependent enhancement and nonreciprocal transfer of coherence. Our systematic parameter analysis indicates that increasing driving power and photon-magnon coupling enhances quantum coherence, while thermal decoherence leads to its degradation. However, this effect is partially suppressed by the presence of magnon squeezing. The results show that squeezed magnons are a robust and tunable resource for controlling, stabilizing, and optimizing quantum coherence in cavity magnomechanical platforms, offering potential applications in hybrid magnonic systems and coherent quantum information processing.</p>

            <p>The ability to efficiently simulate a variety of interacting quantum systems on a single device is an overarching goal for digital and analog quantum simulators. In circuit quantum electrodynamical systems, strongly nonlinear superconducting oscillators are typically realized using transmon qubits, featuring a wide range of tunable couplings that are mainly achieved via flux-dependent inductive elements. Such controllability is highly desirable both for digital quantum information processing and for analog quantum simulations of various physical phenomena, such as arbitrary spin-spin interactions. Furthermore, broad tunability facilitates the study of driven-dissipative oscillator dynamics in previously unexplored parameter regimes. In this work, we demonstrate the ability to selectively activate different dynamical regimes between two strongly nonlinear oscillators using parametric modulation. In particular, our scheme enables access to regimes that are dominated by photon-hopping, two-mode squeezing, or cross-Kerr interactions. Finally, we observe level repulsion and attraction between Kerr-nonlinear oscillators in regimes where the nonlinearities exceed the coupling strengths and decay rates of the system. Our results could be used for realizing purely analog quantum simulators to study arbitrary spin systems as well as for exploring strongly nonlinear oscillator dynamics in previously unexplored interaction regimes.</p>

            <p>The universal quantum computer will enable the simulation of arbitrary quantum states governed by arbitrary Hamiltonians. In this context, it is essential to equip future quantum processors with fault-tolerant logical qudits, since qudits naturally align with the simulation of multi-level physical systems. In this study, we present a general framework and working examples of fault-tolerant logical qudit encoding using spin systems, which are among the most coherent and robust finite multi-level physical platforms. The d-dimensional logical qudit encoding with distance-3 (or 5) codewords can be designed within a 12d (or 40d)-dimensional Hilbert space, and the design can be further generalized to 2t+1-distance codes and to encodings exploiting multiple physical qudits. A quantitative comparison shows that the logical qudit encoding proposed here offers an exponential resource advantage over multi-level mappings from logical qubits, and therefore we believe this strategy can pave the way for realizing logical qudit encodings in finite multi-level physical systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sumeet, M. Hörmann, K.P. Schmidt</p>
            <p>We propose a quantum algorithm for computing one quasi-particle excitation energies in the thermodynamic limit by combining numerical linked-cluster expansions (NLCEs) and the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). Our approach uses VQE to block-diagonalize the cluster Hamiltonian through a single-unitary transformation. This unitary is then post-processed using the projective cluster-additive transformation (PCAT) to ensure cluster additivity, a key requirement for NLCE convergence. We benchmark our method on the transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) in one and two dimensions, and with longitudinal field, computing one quasi-particle dispersions in the high-field polarized phase. We compare two cost function classes, trace minimization and variance-based, demonstrating their effectiveness with the Hamiltonian variational ansatz (HVA). For pure TFIM, $\lceil N/2 \rceil$ layers suffice: NLCE+VQE matches exact diagonalization. For TFIM with longitudinal field, where parity symmetry breaks and PCAT becomes essential, both $\lceil N/2 \rceil$ and $N$ layers converge with increasing cluster size, with $N$ layers providing improved accuracy. Our results establish PCAT as a cluster-additive framework that extends variational quantum algorithms to excited-state calculations in the thermodynamic limit via NLCE. While demonstrated with VQE, the PCAT post-processing approach, which requires only low-energy eigenspace information, applies to any quantum eigenstate preparation method.</p>

In the context of estimating multiple parameters of a quantum system, this manifests as a fundamental trade-off between the precisions with which different parameters can be estimated. Often, a parameter can be optimally measured, but at the cost of gaining no information about incompatible parameters. Here, we report that there are systems where one parameter's information can be maximised while not completely losing information about the other parameters. In doing so, we find attainable trade-off relations for quantum parameter estimation with a structure that is different to typical Heisenberg-type trade-offs.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kohei Fujiu, Shota Nagayama, Shin Nishio, Hideaki Kawaguchi, Takahiko Satoh</p>
            <p>The surface code is one of the leading quantum error correction codes for realizing large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC). One major challenge in realizing surface-code-based FTQC is the extremely large number of qubits required. To mitigate this problem, fusing multiple codewords of the surface code into a densely packed configuration has been proposed. It is known that by using dense packing, the number of physical qubits required per logical qubit can be reduced to approximately three-fourths compared to simply placing surface-code patches side by side. Despite its potential, concrete deformation procedures and quantitative error-rate analyses have remained largely unexplored. In this work, we present a detailed code-deformation procedure that transforms multiple standard surface code patches into a densely packed, connected configuration, along with a conceptual microarchitecture to utilize this dense packing. We also propose a CNOT gate-scheduling for stabilizer measurement circuits that suppresses hook errors in the densely packed surface code. We performed circuit-level Monte Carlo noise simulation of densely packed surface codes using this gate scheduling. The numerical results demonstrate that as the code distance of the densely packed surface code increases and the physical error rate decreases, the logical error rate of the densely packed surface code becomes lower than that of the standard surface code. Furthermore, we find that only when employing hook-error-avoiding syndrome extraction can the densely packed surface code achieve a lower logical error rate than the standard surface code, while simultaneously reducing the space overhead.</p>

            <p>Open systems feature a variety of phenomena that arise from non-Hermitian physics. Recent theoretical studies have offered much insights into these phenomena through the non-Bloch band theory, though many of the theory's key features are experimentally elusive. For instance, the correspondence between complex momenta and non-Hermitian bands, while central to non-Bloch band theory, has so far defied direct experimental observation. Here we experimentally study the non-Hermitian spectral deformation in complex-momentum space, by implementing a non-Hermitian lattice with long-range couplings in the synthetic orbital-angular-momentum (OAM) dimension of photons inside a degenerate cavity. Encoding the complex momenta in the phase and amplitude modulations of the OAM modes, and devising a complex-momentum-resolved projective detection, we reconstruct the spectral deformation in momentum space, where the eigenspectrum on the complex plane morphs through distinct geometries. This enables us to experimentally extract key information of the system under the non-Bloch band theory, including exceptional points in the complex-momentum space, the open-boundary spectra, and the generalized Brillouin zone. Our work demonstrates a versatile platform for exploring non-Hermitian physics and non-Bloch band theory, and opens the avenue for direct experimental investigation of non-Bloch features in the complex-momentum space.</p>

In this work, we decode the quantum search advantage by investigating the critical role of quantum state properties in random-walk-based algorithms. We propose three distinct variants of quantum random-walk search algorithms and derive exact analytical expressions for their success probabilities. These probabilities are fundamentally determined by specific initial state properties: the coherence fraction governs the first algorithm's performance, while entanglement and coherence dominate the outcomes of the second and third algorithms, respectively. We show that increased coherence fraction enhances success probability, but greater entanglement and coherence reduce it in the latter two cases. These findings reveal fundamental insights into harnessing quantum properties for advantage and guide algorithm design. Our searches achieve Grover-like speedups and show significant potential for quantum-enhanced machine learning.</p>

            <h2>Finite-dimensional Lie algebras in bosonic quantum dynamics: The single-mode case</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tim Heib, Andreea Silvia Goia, Sona Baghiyan, Robert Zeier, David Edward Bruschi</p>
            <p>We study, classify, and explore the mathematical properties of finite-dimensional Lie algebras occurring in the quantum dynamics of single-mode and self-interacting bosonic systems. These Lie algebras are contained in the real skew-hermitian Weyl algebra $\hat{A}_1$, defined as the real subalgebra of the Weyl algebra $A_1$ consisting of all skew-hermitian polynomials. A central aspect of our analysis is the choice of basis for $\hat{A}_1$, which is composed of skew-symmetric combinations of two elements of the Weyl algebra called monomials, namely strings of creation and annihilation operators combined with their hermitian conjugate. Motivated by the quest for analytical solutions in quantum optimal control and dynamics, we aim at answering the following three fundamental questions: (i) What are the finite-dimensional Lie subalgebras in $\hat{A}_1$ generated by monomials alone? (ii)~What are the finite-dimensional Lie subalgebras in $\hat{A}_1$ that contain the free Hamiltonian? (iii) What are the non-abelian and finite-dimensional Lie subalgebras that can be faithfully realized in $\hat{A}_1$? We answer the first question by providing all possible realizations of all finite-dimensional non-abelian Lie algebras that are generated by monomials alone. We answer the second question by proving that any non-abelian and finite-dimensional subalgebra of $\hat{A}_1$ that contains a free Hamiltonian term must be a subalgebra of the Schrödinger algebra. We partially answer the third question by classifying all nilpotent and non-solvable Lie algebras that can be realized in $\hat{A}_1$, and comment on the remaining cases. Finally, we also discuss the implications of our results for quantum control theory. Our work constitutes an important stepping stone to understanding quantum dynamics of bosonic systems in full generality.</p>

            <p>Noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers hold the promise of tackling complex and otherwise intractable computational challenges through the massive parallelism offered by qubits. Central to realizing the potential of quantum computing are perfect entangling (PE) two-qubit gates, which serve as a critical building block for universal quantum computation. In the context of quantum optimal control, shaping electromagnetic pulses to drive quantum gates is crucial for pushing gate performance toward theoretical limits. In this work, we leverage reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to discover near-optimal pulse shapes that yield PE gates. A collection of RL agents is trained within robust simulation environments, enabling the identification of effective control strategies even under noisy conditions. Selected agents are then validated on higher-fidelity simulations, illustrating how RL-based methods can reduce calibration overhead when compared to quantum optimal control techniques. Furthermore, the RL approach is hardware agnostic with the potential for broad applicability across various quantum computing platforms.</p>

            <h2>Sample-efficient quantum error mitigation via classical learning surrogates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei-You Liao, Ge Yan, Yujin Song, Tian-Ci Tian, Wei-Ming Zhu, De-Tao Jiang, Yuxuan Du, He-Liang Huang</p>
            <p>The pursuit of practical quantum utility on near-term quantum processors is critically challenged by their inherent noise. Quantum error mitigation (QEM) techniques are leading solutions to improve computation fidelity with relatively low qubit-overhead, while full-scale quantum error correction remains a distant goal. However, QEM techniques incur substantial measurement overheads, especially when applied to families of quantum circuits parameterized by classical inputs. Focusing on zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE), a widely adopted QEM technique, here we devise the surrogate-enabled ZNE (S-ZNE), which leverages classical learning surrogates to perform ZNE entirely on the classical side. Unlike conventional ZNE, whose measurement cost scales linearly with the number of circuits, S-ZNE requires only constant measurement overhead for an entire family of quantum circuits, offering superior scalability. Theoretical analysis indicates that S-ZNE achieves accuracy comparable to conventional ZNE in many practical scenarios, and numerical experiments on up to 100-qubit ground-state energy and quantum metrology tasks confirm its effectiveness. Our approach provides a template that can be effectively extended to other quantum error mitigation protocols, opening a promising path toward scalable error mitigation.</p>

            <h2>Recent Advances on Nonadiabatic Geometric Quantum Computation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zheng-Yuan Xue, Cheng-Yun Ding</p>
            <p>The geometric phase stands as a foundational concept in quantum physics, revealing deep connections between geometric structures and quantum dynamical evolution. Unlike dynamical phases, geometric phases exhibit intrinsic resilience to certain types of perturbation, making them particularly valuable for quantum information processing, where maintaining coherent quantum operations is essential. This article provides a review of geometric phases in the context of universal quantum gate construction, i.e., the geometric quantum computation (GQC), with special attention to recent progress in nonadiabatic implementations that enhance gate fidelity and/or operational robustness. We first review a unified theoretical framework that can encompass all existing nonadiabatic GQC approaches, then systematically examine the design principles of nonadiabatic geometric gates with a particular focus on how optimal control techniques can be leveraged to improve the accuracy and noise resistance. In addition, we conducted detailed numerical comparisons of various nonadiabatic GQC protocols, offering a quantitative assessment of their respective performance characteristics and practical limitations. Through this focused investigation, our aim is to provide researchers with both fundamental insights and practical guidance for advancing geometric approaches in quantum computing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xian-Li Yin, Meixi Guo, Jian Huang, Heung-wing Joseph Lee, Guofeng Zhang</p>
            <p>Quantum batteries (QBs), acting as energy storage devices, have potential applications in future quantum science and technology. However, the QBs inevitably losses energy due to their interaction with environment. How to enhance the performance of the QBs in the open-system case remains an important challenge. Here we propose a scheme to realize the driven-dissipative QBs in atom-waveguide-QED systems and demonstrate significant improvements in both the stored energy and extractable work (ergotropy) of the QBs via feedback control. For a single-atom QB, we show that combining the measurement and coherent feedback controls enables nearly perfect stable charging under the weak coherent driving. For the QB array, the measurement-based feedback allows us to control different dynamical phases in the thermodynamic limit: (i) a continuous boundary time-crystal phase, where persistent periodic energy charge-discharge oscillations emerge despite the presence of the dissipation into the waveguide, and (ii) two stationary phases -- one reaches full charge while the other maintains only small energy storage. This work broadens the scope of driven-dissipative QBs and provides practical strategies for enhancing their performance.</p>

            <h2>Survival acceleration</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yakov Bloch, Avshalom C. Elitzur</p>
            <p>Relativistic time dilation implies that an accelerating excited atom would have its lifetime prolonged in the lab frame. In this paper, we demonstrate a complementary effect: Longer-lived excited atoms turn out to have been accelerated. We propose the following experiment. An excited atom is prepared in a superposition of momenta. Due to relativistic time dilation, in the lab frame, the decay rate of components with higher momentum is diminished. As time passes without the atom emitting a photon, higher-momentum components become more probable. This results in a time-dependent shift of the expectation value of momentum. Taking into account first-order relativistic corrections, we calculate the force and acceleration undergone by the atom due to the fact that it did not emit a photon.</p>

            <p>We investigate optimal metrological protocols for phase estimation in the presence of correlated dephasing noise, including spin-squeezed states sensing strategies as well as parallel and adaptive protocols optimized using tensor-network based numerical methods. The results are benchmarked against fundamental bounds obtained either via a latest quantum comb extension method or an optimized classical simulation method. We find that the spin-squeezed offer practically optimal performance in the regime where phase fluctuations are positively correlated, but can be outperformed by tensor-network optimized strategies for negatively correlated fluctuations.</p>

            <h2>Matrix-product state skeletons in Onsager-integrable quantum chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Imogen Camp, Nick G. Jones</p>
            <p>Matrix-product state (MPS) skeletons are connected networks of Hamiltonians with exact MPS ground states that underlie a phase diagram. Such skeletons have previously been found in classes of free-fermion models. For the translation-invariant BDI and AIII free-fermion classes, it has been shown that the underlying skeleton is dense, giving an analytic approach to MPS approximation of ground states anywhere in the class. In this paper, we partially expose the skeleton in certain interacting spin chains: the $N$-state Onsager-integrable chiral clock families. We construct MPS that form a dense MPS skeleton in the gapped regions surrounding a sequence of fixed-point Hamiltonians (the generators of the Onsager algebra). Outside these gapped regions, these MPS remain eigenstates, but no longer give the many-body ground state. Rather, they are ground states in particular sectors of the spectrum. Our methods also allow us to find further MPS eigenstates; these correspond to low-lying excited states within the aforementioned gapped regions. This set of MPS excited states goes beyond the previous analysis of ground states on the $N=2$ free-fermion MPS skeleton. As an application of our results, we find a closed form for the disorder parameter in a family of interacting models. Finally, we remark that many of our results use only the Onsager algebra and are not specific to the chiral clock model representation.</p>

            <p>It is well known that a quantum walk in an ordered medium exhibits ballistic propagation. A related process is the driven quantum walk, in which the number of walkers varies over time. In this work, we show that a driven quantum walk in an array of nonlinear waveguides does not propagate ballistically, but instead exhibits two distinct transport regimes: superballistic and superdiffusive. Moreover, we study the effects of off-diagonal and diagonal disorder. In addition to the observation of Anderson localization, both types of disorder lead to the disappearance of the superballistic regime.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sami Abdul Sater, Maxime Garnier, Thierry Martinez, Harold Ollivier, Ulysse Chabaud</p>
            <p>Verification of quantum computations is crucial as experiments advance toward fault-tolerant quantum computing. Yet, no efficient protocol exists for certifying states generated in the Magic-State Injection model -- the foundation of several fault-tolerant quantum computing architectures. Here, we introduce an efficient protocol for certifying Clifford-enhanced Product States, a large class of quantum states obtained by applying an arbitrary Clifford circuit to a product of single-qubit, possibly magic, states. Our protocol only requires single-qubit Pauli measurements together with efficient classical post-processing, and has efficient sample complexity in both the independent (i.i.d.) and adversarial (non-i.i.d.) settings. This fills a key gap between Pauli-based certification schemes for stabilizer or (hyper)graph states and general protocols demanding non-Pauli measurements or classically intractable information about the target state. Our work provides the first efficient, Pauli-only certification protocol for the Magic-State Injection model, leading to practical verification of universal quantum computation under minimal experimental assumptions.</p>

            <h2>Extending QAOA-GPT to Higher-Order Quantum Optimization Problems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Leanto Sunny, Abhinav Rijal, George Siopsis</p>
            <p>The recently proposed QAOA-GPT framework demonstrated that generative pre-trained transformers can learn mappings between problem graphs and optimized quantum circuits for the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). In this work, we extend QAOA-GPT to Higher-Order Unconstrained Binary Optimization (HUBO) problems, focusing on spin-glass Hamiltonians that include cubic interaction terms. Using FEATHER graph embeddings to encode topological information, we train the model on graph-circuit pairs generated via ADAPT-QAOA and evaluate its performance on 8- and 16-qubit instances embedded on heavy-hex lattices. The generative model produces adaptive QAOA-like circuits and corresponding variational parameters in a single forward pass, bypassing the iterative classical optimization loop. The generated circuits achieve average approximation ratios exceeding 0.95, closely matching classically optimized ADAPT-QAOA results, while maintaining consistent parameter distributions across circuit depths. These results demonstrate that QAOA-GPT generalizes effectively to higher-order cost Hamiltonians and complex energy landscapes, establishing generative modeling as a scalable pathway toward autonomous variational circuit design and quantum algorithm discovery in the NISQ era.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Perspectivism as a Framework of Scientific Inquiry in Quantum Mechanics and Beyond</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vassilios Karakostas, Elias Zafiris</p>
            <p>Contemporary perspectivism is viewed as a framework of scientific inquiry concerning the origin, generation and systematization of scientific knowledge of nature by focusing on the conditions under which such knowledge may arise in perspectivist terms and investigating the essential ramifications of these conditions. To this end, we develop the conceptual, methodological and semantic framework of contemporary perspectivism according to the norms of the proposed endo-theoretic approach. Implementation of the preceding three-fold scheme in quantum mechanics implies that the global structure of a quantum algebra of events can be consistently comprehended through a multilevel structure of locally variable Boolean perspectives, interconnected in a category-theoretic environment, yielding jointly all the information encoded in the former. In this respect, the proposed approach validates the perspectivist/contextual nature of quantum mechanics at a fundamental level of discourse. Furthermore, due to its general character, it may acquire the form of a theoretical pattern of scientific inquiry in the natural sciences, especially when dealing with complex trans-perspectival phenomena, the analysis of which requires the use of information resulting from more than one perspective. Finally, in the appendix, we provide a concise comparative assessment between our perspectivist framework of quantum theory and Rovelli's relational interpretation of quantum mechanics.</p>

            <p>We present a Time-to-Digital Converter (TDC) implemented on a 16 nm Xilinx UltraScale Plus FPGA that achieves a resolution of 1.15 ps, RMS precision of 3.38 ps, a differential nonlinearity (DNL) of [-0.43, 0.24] LSB, and an integral nonlinearity (INL) of [-2.67, 0.15] LSB. This work introduces two novel hardware-independent post-processing techniques - Partial Order Reconstruction (POR) and Iterative Time-bin Interleaving (ITI) - that significantly enhance the performance of FPGA-based TDCs. POR addresses the missing code problem by inferring the partial order of each time bin through code density test data and directed acyclic graph (DAG) analysis, enabling near-complete recovery of usable bins. ITI further improves fine time resolution by merging multiple calibrated tapped delay lines (TDLs) into a single unified delay chain, achieving scalable resolution without resorting to averaging. Compared to state-of-the-art FPGA-based TDC architectures, the proposed methods deliver competitive or superior performance with reduced hardware overhead. These techniques are broadly applicable to high-resolution time measurement and precise delay calibration in programmable logic platforms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vijay Pal Singh, Ludwig Mathey, Herwig Ott, Luigi Amico</p>
            <p>We propose an ac-driven atomic Josephson junction as a clean and tunable source of three dimensional (3D) solitary waves in quantum fluids. Depending on the height of the junction barrier, the emitted excitations appear as vortex rings at low velocity or vorticity-free rarefaction pulses near the sound velocity, thus spanning the complete Jones-Roberts family of solitons. The Shapiro-step phenomenon renders the emission deterministic: on the first, second, third Shapiro steps, the junction ejects one, two, and three solitary excitations per drive cycle. This enables controlled generation of single- and multi-excitation configurations, allowing detailed studies of the full crossover between vortex rings and rarefaction pulses and their interaction dynamics. In particular, deterministic multi-ring emission provides insights into leapfrogging dynamics of two and three coaxial rings and their decay via boundary-assisted, sound-mediated processes. This ac-driven protocol establishes a compact and reproducible platform for generating, classifying, and controlling 3D solitonic excitations, paving the way for precision studies of nonlinear vortex dynamics, dissipation, and quantum turbulence in trapped superfluids.</p>

            <h2>Strain-Tunable Spin Filtering and Valley Splitting Coexisting with Anomalous Hall Effect in 2D Half-Metallic VSe2/VN Heterostructure: Toward a Unified Spintronic-Valleytronic Platform</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vivek Chowdhury, Ahmed Zubair</p>
            <p>Rapid progress in valleytronics and spintronics is limited by the scarcity of two-dimensional materials that simultaneously provide robust valley splitting and strong spin selectivity. Here we showed that a van der Waals heterostructure (VSe2/VN) built from hexagonal VSe2 and hexagonal VN addressed this gap. Using first-principles density functional theory, phonon, ab initio molecular dynamics stability tests, Bader charge analysis, and Wannier-based Berry-curvature calculations, we demonstrated an energetically and dynamically stable heterostructure that exhibited interlayer charge transfer and a work function intermediate between the constituent monolayers. The electronic structure showed small indirect PBE gap (108.9 meV), with HSE06 indicating a half-metallic tendency; a sizable conduction-band valley splitting (\Delta CKK' = 22.9 meV for spin-up and \Delta CKK' = 61.3 meV for spin-down); and pronounced spin asymmetry, where the spin-down channel showed a wide semiconducting gap (0.64 eV) while the spin-up channel was nearly gapless. These features yielded a high zero-strain spin-filter efficiency P = 75.4%, tunable to 82.5% under +4% biaxial tensile strain. The heterostructure also supported non-zero, valley-contrasting Berry curvature, and a large anomalous Hall conductivity (peak sigmaxy = 568.33 S/cm). Importantly, mean-field estimation placed the ferromagnetic Curie temperature near room temperature at zero strain (Tc = 284.04 K), while Tc decreased to 183.9 K at +4% strain, the magnetic order remained robust to cryogenic temperatures, providing a beneficial tuning knob to balance spin-filter performance with thermal stability in device-relevant regimes. These results identified VSe2/VN as a practical, strain-tunable platform for integrated valleytronic, spintronic devices, and for exploring anomalous Hall and valley-dependent transport phenomena.</p>

            <p>Resolving sources beyond the diffraction limit is important in imaging, communications, and metrology. Current image-based methods of super-resolution require phase information (either of the source points or an added filter) and perfect alignment with the centroid of the object. Both inhibit the practical application of these methods, as uniform motion and/or relative jitter destroy their assumptions. Here, we show that measuring intensity in the Fourier plane enables super-resolution without any of the issues of image-based methods. We start with the shift-invariance of the Fourier transform and the observation that the two-point position problem ${x_1,x_2}$ in the near field corresponds to the single-point wavenumber problem $k\ =2\pi/(x_2-x_1)$ in the far field. We consider the full range of mutual coherence and show that for fully coherent sources, the Fourier method saturates the quantum limit, i.e. it gives the best possible measurement. Similar results hold for sub-Rayleigh constellations of N sources, which can act collectively as a spatially averaged metasurface and/or individually as elements of a phased-array antenna. The theory paves the way to merge Fourier optics with super-resolution techniques, enabling experimental devices that are both simpler and more robust than previous designs.</p>

            <p>Er-substituted yttrium iron garnet (Er:YIG) holds the potential of combining the low magnetic damping of YIG with the telecom-band optical transitions of $\text{Er}^{3+}$ ions, making it a suitable material for hybrid optomagnonic devices and microwave-to-optical quantum transduction. We report the epitaxial growth of $\text{Er}_{x}\text{Y}_{3-x}\text{Fe}_{5}\text{O}_{12}$ films with $x=0.008-0.20$ on (111)-oriented gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) substrates using pulsed laser deposition. X-ray diffraction, reciprocal space mapping, and scanning transmission electron microscopy confirm single-phase, fully coherent growth with atomically sharp interfaces across the entire substitution range. Magnetometry reveals a gradual decrease in saturation magnetization with increasing Er content, consistent with antiparallel coupling between Er$^{3+}$ spins and the net Fe$^{3+}$ moments, along with the emergence of an in-plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy. The ferromagnetic resonance broadens with Er concentration due to increased Gilbert damping and inhomogeneous linewidth broadening. Films with low Er content ($x=0.008$), most relevant for optomagnonic applications, retain nearly isotropic magnetization and exhibit a damping parameter only slightly higher than that of undoped YIG. These results identify growth and substitution conditions that preserve YIG's low-loss magnetic properties while introducing optical functionality, establishing Er:YIG as a viable platform for hybrid quantum magnonics and microwave-to-optical transduction.</p>

            <p>Giorgio Parisi's exact solution of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass, recognized with the 2021 Nobel Prize in Physics, revealed revolutionary hierarchical organization in disordered systems, yet systematic validation has remained computationally intractable beyond $N \sim 100$ spins, and the topological limits of this complexity remain unexplored. Here we leverage quantum annealing to extend ground-state computations to 4000 spins and systematically probe both the emergence and breakdown of replica symmetry breaking. Three independent measurements validate core RSB predictions: ground-state energies converge to Parisi's value $E_\infty/N = -0.7633$ with predicted $N^{-2/3}$ finite-size corrections; chaos exponent $\theta = 0.51 \pm 0.02$ confirms mean-field square-root scaling ($R^2 = 0.989$); and state-space overlap distribution exhibits broad continuous structure ($\sigma_q = 0.19$) characteristic of hierarchical landscape organization. We then investigate RSB robustness by introducing controlled network dilution via the Blume-Capel model with vacancy formation. Remarkably, hierarchical complexity remains invariant under 36\% dilution, proving RSB is a topological property of network connectivity rather than spin density. Beyond a critical threshold in the range $0.8 < D_c < 0.9$, the hierarchy collapses discontinuously as the system undergoes complete conversion to the all-vacancy state within a narrow parameter window an abrupt avalanche-driven transition where independent-vacancy mean-field theory correctly predicts the energy scale but fails to capture the cooperative dynamics. This comprehensive validation across thermodynamics, universality, landscape geometry, and topological limits establishes quantum advantage for probing fundamental statistical mechanics in complex systems relevant to neural networks, optimization, and materials science.</p>

            <p>The prohibition of finite-temperature phase transition in one-dimensional (1D) Ising models and 1D/2D quantum Heisenberg models with short-range interactions fundamentally constrains the application potentials of low-dimensional magnetic materials. Recently, ultranarrow phase crossover (UNPC), which can approach a transition at a desirable finite temperature $T_0$ arbitrarily closely, was discovered in 1D decorated Ising chains and ladders. Here we present a theoretical study of similarly decorated, yet much more challenging, quantum Heisenberg ferrimagnets in a magnetic field, which features ferromagnetic backbone exchange $J$, antiferromagnetic site-decoration coupling $J_{AF}$, and different magnetic moments for the backbone and decorating spins $\mu_aS_a<\mu_bS_b$. We exactly solved the model in the large $J$ limit -- as a central-macrospin model -- and found two finite-temperature second-order transitions; just above $T_{c2}$ a ``half-ice, half-fire'' regime appears. Finite-$J$ weak-field results follow from an effective-field mapping, suggesting the emergence of UNPC at finite $T_0$ in 2D square lattices thanks to its exponentially strong initial magnetic susceptibility $\chi_0\propto e^{4\pi S_a^2 J/T_0}$, though less likely in 1D chains where $\chi_0\propto J/T_0$. These results may shed light on new technological applications of low-dimensional quantum spin systems and attract experimental and computational tests.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S. Azadi, A. Principi, T.D. Kühne, M.S. Bahramy</p>
            <p>We determine the resonating-valence-bond (RVB) state in graphene using real-space quantum Monte Carlo with correlated variational wave functions. Variational and diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (DMC) calculations with Jastrow-Slater-determinant and Jastrow-antisymmetrized-geminal-power ansatze are employed to evaluate the RVB pairing energy. Using a rectangular graphene sample that lacks $\pi/3$ rotational symmetry, we found that the single-particle energy gap near the Fermi level depends on the system size along the $x$-direction. The gap vanishes when the length satisfies $L_x=3n\sqrt{3}d$, where $n$ is an integer and $d$ is the carbon-carbon bond length, otherwise, the system, exhibits a finite gap. Our DMC results show no stable RVB pairing in the zero-gap case, whereas the opening of a finite gap near the Fermi level stabilizes the electron pairing. The DMC predicted absolute value of pairing energy at the thermodynamic limit for a finite-gap system is $\sim 0.48(1)$ mHa/atom. Our results reveal a feometry-driven electron pairing mechanism in the confined graphene nanostructure.</p>

            <p>We study a transport phenomenon in certain coined quantum walks where a subspace of states localized at a vertex gets transferred to another vertex. We first develop characterizations for perfect and pretty good subspace state transfer using the spectral properties of a Hermitian weighted digraph obtained from the underlying graph. We then provide a polynomial-time algorithm that tests whether perfect pointwise subspace state transfer occurs at an integer step, given that the subspace and coins are rational. Finally, we construct several infinite families of examples that admit perfect pointwise $d$-dimensional subspace state transfer where $d\ge 2$.</p>

            <p>One of the main residual limitations of inertial sensors based on atom interferometry stems from laser beam distortions, which cause parasitic phase shifts and non-homogeneous matter-light couplings. Here we present numerical simulations, accompanied by analytical calculations, which quantify the impact of these effects in a cold atom gradiometer. We demonstrate that the propagation of interferometric laser beam aberrations, combined with initial asymmetry and significant time-of-flight expansion of the the two atomic sources, limit the common-mode rejection of phase noise in a differential configuration. The resulting deviations in gravitational acceleration and its gradient are within reach of current experimental devices. Our study allows us to evaluate the surface quality requirements for retroreflective optics in cold-atom gradiometers of various baselines, and can be extended to other sensors based on different interferometer geometries.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cecilie Hermansen, Jens Paaske</p>
            <p>Self-sustained oscillators play a central role in the stabilization and synchronization of complex dynamical systems. A number of different physical systems are currently being investigated to clarify the importance of such active components in the quantum realm. Here we explore the properties of a driven dissipative electron-photon hybrid system based on superconducting microwave resonators coupled resonantly to a voltage-biased double quantum dot (DQD). First, we establish a Hopf bifurcation at a critical value of the electron-photon coupling, beyond which an effective negative friction sustains steady limit-cycle oscillations of individual resonators. Second, we show that two such limit-cycle resonators coupled via the same voltage-biased DQD synchronize for small enough frequency detuning. A nonlinear photon Keldysh action is derived by perturbation theory in the effective circuit fine-structure constant, and the limit-cycle dynamics is analyzed in terms of resulting saddle-point, and Fokker-Planck equations. In the Markovian limit of infinite bias voltage, these results are shown to agree well with the solution of a corresponding Lindblad master equation for the DQD resonator system.</p>

            <p>Magnetotransport underlines many important phenomena in condensed matter physics, such as the Hall effect and magnetoresistance (MR) effect. Thus far, most magnetotransport studies are based on bulk resistance measurements without direct access to microscopic details of the spatial transport pattern. Here, we report nanoscale imaging of magnetotransport using a scanning single-spin quantum magnetometer, which is demonstrated in a graphene-metal hybrid device at room temperature. By visualizing the current flow at elevated magnetic fields (~0.5 T), we directly observe the Lorentz deflection of current near the graphene-metal interface, which is a hallmark of magnetotransport. Combining the local current distribution with global resistance measurements, we reveal that transport properties of the hybrid are governed by a complex interplay of intrinsic MR around the Dirac cone, carrier hydrodynamics, interface resistance, and the nanoscale device geometry. Furthermore, accessing the local transport pattern across the interface enables quantitative mapping of spatial variations in contact resistance, which is commonly present in electronic devices made from two-dimensional materials yet non-trivial to characterize. Our work demonstrates the potential of nanoscale current imaging techniques for studying complex electronic transport phenomena that are difficult to probe by resistance-based measurements.</p>

            <h2>A Graphical Calculus for Quantum Computing with Multiple Qudits using Generalized Clifford Algebras</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robert Lin</p>
            <p>In this work, we develop a graphical calculus for multi-qudit computations with generalized Clifford algebras, building off the algebraic framework developed in our prior work. We build our graphical calculus out of a fixed set of graphical primitives defined by algebraic expressions constructed out of elements of a given generalized Clifford algebra, a graphical primitive corresponding to the ground state, and also graphical primitives corresponding to projections onto the ground state of each qudit. We establish many properties of the graphical calculus using purely algebraic methods, including a novel algebraic proof of a Yang-Baxter equation and a construction of a corresponding braid group representation. Our algebraic proof, which applies to arbitrary qudit dimension, also enables a resolution of an open problem of Cobanera and Ortiz on the construction of self-dual braid group representations for even qudit dimension. We also derive several new identities for the braid elements, which are key to our proofs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in many cases, the verification of involved vector identities can be reduced to the combinatorial application of two basic vector identities. Additionally, in terms of quantum computation, we demonstrate that it is feasible to envision implementing the braid operators for quantum computation, by showing that they are 2-local operators. In fact, these braid elements are almost Clifford gates, for they normalize the generalized Pauli group up to an extra factor $\zeta$, which is an appropriate square root of a primitive root of unity.</p>

            <p>Quantum computing and quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) are respectively the state-of-the-art quantum and classical computing methods for understanding many-body quantum systems. Here, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm that integrates these two methods, inheriting their distinct features in efficient representation and manipulation of quantum states and overcoming their limitations. We first introduce non-stoquasticity indicators (NSIs) and their upper bounds, which measure the sign problem, the most notable limitation of QMC. We show that our algorithm could greatly mitigate the sign problem, which decreases NSIs with the assistance of quantum computing. Meanwhile, the use of quantum Monte Carlo also increases the expressivity of shallow quantum circuits, allowing more accurate computation that is conventionally achievable only with much deeper circuits. We numerically test and verify the method for the N$_2$ molecule (12 qubits) and the Hubbard model (16 qubits). Our work paves the way to solving practical problems with intermediate-scale and early-fault tolerant quantum computers, with potential applications in chemistry, condensed matter physics, materials, high energy physics, etc.</p>

The main idea of this work is a symmetry-reduced semidefinite programming hierarchy that detects when no such joint state exists. The hierarchy is complete, in the sense that it detects every incompatible set of spectra. The refutations it provides are dimension-free, certifying incompatibility in all local dimensions. The hierarchy also applies to the sums of Hermitian matrices problem, the compatibility of local unitary invariants, for certifying vanishing Kronecker coefficients, and to optimize over equivariant state polynomials.</p>

            <p>Random ensembles of pure states have proven to be extremely important in various aspects of quantum physics such as benchmarking the performance of quantum circuits, testing for quantum advantage, providing novel insights for many-body thermalization and studying the black hole information paradox. Although generating a fully random ensemble is experimentally challenging, approximations of it are just as useful and are known to emerge naturally in a variety of physical models, including Rydberg setups. These are referred to as approximate quantum state designs, and verifying their degree of randomness can be an expensive task, similar to performing full quantum state tomography on many-body systems. In this theoretical work, we efficiently validate the character of approximate quantum designs with respect to data size acquisition when compared to the conventional frequentist approach. This is achieved by translating the information residing in the complex many-body state into a succinct representation of classical data using a random projective measurement basis, which is then processed using methods of statistical inference such as maximum likelihood estimation and neural networks and benchmarked against the predictions of shadow tomography. Our scheme of combining machine learning methods for postprocessing the data obtained from randomized measurements for efficient characterisation of (approximate) quantum state k designs is applicable to any noisy quantum platform that can generate quantum designs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aniruddha Sen, Kenneth Goodenough, Don Towsley</p>
            <p>Quantum networks are important for quantum communication, enabling tasks such as quantum teleportation, quantum key distribution, quantum sensing, and quantum error correction, often utilizing graph states, a specific class of multipartite entangled states that can be represented by graphs. We propose a novel approach for distributing graph states across a quantum network. We show that the distribution of graph states can be characterized by a system of subgraph complementations, which we also relate to the minimum rank of the underlying graph and the degree of entanglement quantified by the Schmidt-rank of the quantum state. We analyze resource usage for our algorithm and show that it improves on the number of qubits, bits for classical communication, and EPR pairs utilized, as compared to prior work. In fact, the number of local operations and resource consumption for our approach scales linearly in the number of vertices. This produces a quadratic improvement in completion time for several classes of graph states represented by dense graphs, which translates into an exponential improvement by allowing parallelization of gate operations. This leads to improved fidelities in the presence of noisy operations, as we show through simulation in the presence of noisy operations. We classify common classes of graph states, along with their optimal distribution time using subgraph complementations. We find a sequence of subgraph complementation operations to distribute an arbitrary graph state which we conjecture is close to the optimal sequence, and establish upper bounds on distribution time along with providing approximate greedy algorithms.</p>

            <p>Consider an open quantum system with (discrete-time) Markovian dynamics. Our task is to store information in the system in such a way that it can be retrieved perfectly, even after the system is left to evolve for an arbitrarily long time. We show that this is impossible for classical (resp. quantum) information precisely when the dynamics is mixing (resp. asymptotically entanglement breaking). Furthermore, we provide tight universal upper bounds on the minimum time after which any such dynamics 'scrambles' the encoded information beyond the point of perfect retrieval. On the other hand, for dynamics that are not of this kind, we show that information must be encoded inside the peripheral space associated with the dynamics in order for it to be perfectly recoverable at any time in the future. This allows us to derive explicit formulas for the maximum amount of information that can be protected from noise in terms of the structure of the peripheral space of the dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Topologically protected negative entanglement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wen-Tan Xue, Ching Hua Lee</p>
            <p>The entanglement entropy encodes fundamental characteristics of quantum many-body systems, and is particularly subtle in non-Hermitian settings where eigenstates generically become non-orthogonal. In this work, we find that negative biorthogonal entanglement generically arises from topologically protected non-orthogonal edge states in free fermion systems, especially for flat-band edge states. Departing from previous literature which associated negative entanglement with exceptional gapless points, we show that robustly negative entanglement can still occur in gapped systems. Gapless 2D flat-band edge states, however, exhibit novel $S_A\sim -\frac{1}{2}L_y^2\log L$ entanglement behavior which scales quadratically with the transverse dimension $L_y$, independent of system parameters. This dramatically negative scaling can be traced to a new mechanism known as non-Hermitian critical skin compression (nHCSC), where topological and skin localization in one direction produces a hierarchy of extensively many probability non-conserving entanglement eigenstates across a cut in another direction. Our discovery sheds light on new avenues where topology interplays with criticality and non-Hermitian localization, unrelated to traditional notions of topological entanglement entropy. This topologically protected negative entanglement also manifests in the second Rényi entropy, which can be measured through SWAP operator expectation values.</p>

            <p>Destructive interference-based photon-phonon antibunching can lead to violations of classical inequalities in optomechanical cavity systems. In this paper, we explore the violation of the classical Cauchy-Schwarz inequality by examining second-order auto-correlation and cross-correlation functions, as well as Bell's nonlocality, to analyze the quantum correlations of single photon-phonon excitations when the system is driven by two weak probe fields. We propose that the violation of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality can serve as an indicator for the stronger nonclassical tests associated with Bell's theorem. Our system reveals strong quantum correlations of photon-phonon pairs with distinctive antidiagonal patterns of photon filtering. For numerical analysis, we consider a weak effective optomechanical coupling strength and various optical-to-mechanical field amplitude ratios that enable unconventional photon (phonon) blockades at resonance. The findings are significant for producing sub-Poissonian signals under optimal conditions and have potential applications in hybrid systems for generating on-demand single photon-phonon pairs.</p>

We demonstrate that the quantum reservoir outperforms traditional classical reservoir computing in both memory retention and nonlinear data processing through two tasks, namely the prediction of time-series data using the Mackey-Glass task and the classification of sine-square waveforms. Our results show significant performance improvements with an increasing number of atoms, facilitated by non-destructive, continuous quantum measurements and polynomial regression techniques.

            <p>There are possible physical theories that give greater violations of Bell's inequalities than the corresponding Tsirelson bound, termed post-quantum non-locality. Such theories do not violate special relativity, but could give an advantage in certain information processing tasks. There is another way in which entangled quantum states exhibit non-classical phenomena, with one notable example being Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering; a violation of a bipartite Bell inequality implies EPR steering, but the converse is not necessarily true. The study of post-quantum EPR steering is more intricate, but it has been shown that it does not always imply post-quantum non-locality in a conventional Bell test. In this work we show how to distribute resources in a larger network that individually do not demonstrate post-quantum non-locality but violate a Tsirelson bound for the network. That is, we show how to activate post-quantum steering so that it can now be witnessed as post-quantum correlations in a Bell scenario. One element of our work that may be of independent interest is we show how to self-test a bipartite quantum assemblage in a network, even assuming post-quantum resources.</p>

            <p>While the spontaneous emission from independent emitters provides spatially uncorrelated photons - a typical manifestation of quantum randomness, the interference of the coherent scattering leads to a well-defined intensity pattern - a feature described by linear optics. We here demonstrate experimentally how the interplay between the two mechanisms in large systems of quantum emitters leads to spatial variations of photon correlations. The implementation with trapped ion crystals in free space allows us to observe the anti-correlation between photon rates and variance of the photon number distributions in chains of up to 18 ions. For smaller crystals of four ions, the transition from a sub-Poissonian to a super-Poissonian variance of the photon number in the scattered light is reported. For higher numbers of scatterers, the photon statistics still display a strong deviation from the fully incoherent scattering case. Our results illustrate how the interference of coherent scattering, combined with spontaneous emission, provides a control mechanism for the light statistics.</p>

            <p>The reliability of quantum computation critically depends on the performance of quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs), which can be severely degraded by hook errors that reduce the effective code distance. In this work, we construct a family of $[[n,1,3]]$ non-CSS QECCs to achieve fault-tolerant (FT) syndrome measurement, where $ 6 \leq n \leq 10$. We employ the bare-ancilla method of Muyuan Li \emph{et al.} to demonstrate fault tolerance in the presence of hook errors during syndrome extraction. We present a systematic protocol for generating these QECCs using graph codes. Using a custom lookup-table decoder, we simulate the code's performance under both anisotropic and circuit-level depolarizing noise. Our results reveal a trade-off in performance with respect to the code rate and identify optimized codes under these noise models. We benchmark our results against the infamous flag-qubit method of Chao \emph{et al.}. Notably, we introduce a code with improved code rate while maintaining the same distance as the work of Muyuan Li \emph{et al.} Our approach facilitates the identification and construction of a family of distance three FT non-CSS QECCs.</p>

            <p>Ontological models, as used in the generalised contextuality literature, play a central role in current research on quantum foundations, providing a framework for defining classicality, constructing classical analogues of key quantum phenomena, and examining the ontology of quantum states. In this work, we show that a counterfactual account of Lüders' rule -- which we argue is naturally implied by the mathematical structure of the rule itself -- renders such models inherently incompatible with the quantum formalism. This incompatibility arises because the counterfactual update requires ontological models to update their states according to conditional probability, which in turn which in turn renders predictions of sequential measurements order-independent. This implies that ontological models, even contextual ones, must either act differently to what we would expect given (this, typically implicitly-assumed account of) quantum state update rule, or cannot model quantum behaviour.</p>

To illustrate the oracle's representation-theoretic power and near-term experimental accessibility, we encode a Gaussian imaginary time evolution spectral filter. As a result, we define a continuous linear combination of unitaries block-encoding. Due to the ancillary qumode's infinite-dimensional nature, continuous variable qumodes constitute a powerful compilation tool for encoding continuous spectral functions without discretization errors while minimizing resource requirements. We then focus on the ubiquitous task of preparing eigenstates in quantum spin models. For completeness, we provide an end-to-end compilation which expresses high-level oracles in terms of an experimentally realizable instruction set architecture in both 1D and 2D. Finally, we examine the leading-order effects of physical errors and highlight open research directions.

Crucially, we show how to efficiently optimize multicopy witnesses to desired states, which is a current challenge. As an example of both theoretical and experimental interest, existing trace polynomial witnesses are significantly improved while preserving their symmetries and implementability with randomized measurements. Besides detecting entanglement, we also find new witnesses detecting $k$-copy distillability. A recipe for the single-copy case is shown to be effective for generic and Werner states.</p>

Recently, several approaches, including physics-informed machine learning, have been developed to address some of these limitations. Motivated by the potential of quantum computing, we report on our attempt to map one such classical physics-informed algorithm to a quantum framework. The primary goal is to investigate the technical challenges of this mapping, given that quantum algorithms rely on computing principles fundamentally different from those in classical computing. Quantum computers operate using qubits, which exploit superposition and entanglement, offering the potential to solve classically intractable problems. While current quantum hardware is limited, hybrid quantum-classical algorithms-particularly in quantum machine learning (QML)-demonstrate potential for near-term applications and can be readily simulated. We apply QML to subsurface imaging through the development of a hybrid quantum physics-informed neural network (HQ-PINN) for post-stack and pre-stack seismic inversion. The HQ-PINN architecture adopts an encoder-decoder structure: a hybrid quantum neural network encoder estimates P- and S-impedances from seismic data, while the decoder reconstructs seismic responses using geophysical relationships. Training is guided by minimizing the misfit between the input and reconstructed seismic traces. We systematically assess the impact of quantum layer design, differentiation strategies, and simulator backends on inversion performance. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through the inversion of both synthetic and the Sleipner field datasets. The HQ-PINN framework consistently yields accurate results, showcasing quantum computing's promise for geosciences and paving the way for future quantum-enhanced geophysical workflows.</p>

            <h2>New perspectives on quantum kernels through the lens of entangled tensor kernels</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seongwook Shin, Ryan Sweke, Hyunseok Jeong</p>
            <p>Quantum kernel methods are one of the most explored approaches to quantum machine learning. However, the structural properties and inductive bias of quantum kernels are not fully understood. In this work, we introduce the notion of entangled tensor kernels - a generalization of product kernels from classical kernel theory - and show that all embedding quantum kernels can be understood as an entangled tensor kernel. We discuss how this perspective allows one to gain novel insights into both the unique inductive bias of quantum kernels, and potential methods for their dequantization.</p>

            <h2>Quantitative Evaluation of Quantum/Classical Neural Network Using a Game Solver Metric</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Suzukaze Kamei, Hideaki Kawaguchi, Shin Nishio, Takahiko Satoh</p>
            <p>To evaluate the performance of quantum computing systems relative to classical counterparts and explore the potential, we propose a game-solving benchmark based on Elo ratings in the game of tic-tac-toe. We compare classical convolutional neural networks (CCNNs), quantum or quantum convolutional neural networks (QNNs, QCNNs), and hybrid classical-quantum neural networks (Hybrid NNs) by assessing their performance based on round-robin matches. Our results show that the Hybrid NNs engines achieve Elo ratings comparable to those of CCNNs engines, while the quantum engines underperform under current hardware constraints. Additionally, we implement a QNN integrated with quantum communication and evaluate its performance to quantify the overhead introduced by noisy quantum channels, and the communication overhead was found to be modest. These results demonstrate the viability of using game-based benchmarks for evaluating quantum computing systems and suggest that quantum communication can be incorporated with limited impact on performance, providing a foundation for future hybrid quantum applications.</p>

            <h2>Efficient Two Photon Generation from an Emitter in a Cavity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M.I. Mazhari, Rituraj</p>
            <p>Two-photon states are essential for quantum technologies such as metrology, lithography, and communication. One of the primary methods of two-photon generation is based on parametric down-conversion, but this suffers from low efficiency and a large footprint. This work presents a detailed theoretical investigation of an alternative approach: two-photon generation from an emitter in a doubly resonant cavity. The system is modeled by the Lindblad master Equation, and an approximate analytical solution is derived to determine the experimentally achievable limits on efficiency and brightness. Additionally, the optimal cavity parameters for achieving these limits are also identified. For experimentally feasible parameters, the maximum efficiency is approximately 35%, which is significantly higher than that of parametric down-conversion-based methods. The optimal rate and efficiency for two-photon generation are achieved when the outcoupling rate of the cavity mode at the two-photon emission frequency matches the single-photon atom-field coupling strength. Moreover, the outcoupling rate of the cavity mode at the one-photon emission frequency for single photons should be minimized. The cavity field properties are also examined by studying the second-order correlation function at zero time delay and the Mandel Q parameter, revealing highly bunched two-photon emission and super-Poissonian statistics. The quantum-jump framework, combined with Monte Carlo simulations, is used to characterize the mechanism of two-photon emission and the emission spectra of the cavity. Two-photon emission is demonstrated to be a rapid cascade process of quantum jumps, and its spectrum consists of three prominent peaks corresponding to transitions between the dressed states of the system.</p>

            <p>Color centers in silicon are emerging as spin-photon interfaces operating at telecommunication wavelengths. The nanophotonic device integration of silicon color centers via ion implantation leads to significant optical linewidth broadening, which makes indistinguishable photon generation challenging. Here, we study the optical spectral diffusion of T centers in a silicon photonic crystal cavity. We investigate the linewidth broadening timescales and origins by measuring the temporal correlations of the resonance frequency under different conditions. Spectral hole burning measurements reveal no spectral broadening at short timescales from 102 ns to 725 ns. We probe broadening at longer timescales using a check pulse to herald the T center frequency and a probe pulse to measure frequency after a wait time. The optical resonance frequency is stable up to 3 ms in the dark. Laser pulses below the silicon band gap applied during the wait time leads to linewidth broadening. Our observations establish laser-induced processes as the dominant spectral diffusion mechanism for T centers in devices, and inform materials and feedback strategies for indistinguishable photon generation.</p>

We investigate how the usability of various Bell inequalities differs depending on the presence of noise. Moreover, we present the benefit of certification for Shannon compared to min-entropy, as well as the tight analytical lower bound for Shannon entropy in randomness certification.</p>

            <p>We experimentally study the interaction between a cold atom cloud and many longitudinal modes of a high quality Fabry-Perot cavity, by measuring signatures of collective light shifts in the cavity transmission spectrum of an optical frequency comb probe. Using a resonator coupled to more than $10^5$ intracavity atoms, we detect significant shifts of $\sim 100$ cavity modes simultaneously, which is a direct manifestation of physics beyond the hitherto explored regime of cavity-cold atom interaction with only single or few longitudinal modes at a time. For the cavity mode closest to the atomic resonance, we demonstrate a bistability in the transmission spectrum, arising due to a combined coupling of the cloud to an external pump laser and a cavity mode probed by the optical frequency comb. These results establish a platform for deeper exploration of multifrequency cavity quantum electrodynamics, where ultrashort pulsed sources can be used for optical manipulation, cooling and entanglement of cold atoms in a resonator.</p>

            <h2>Unlocking early fault-tolerant quantum computing with mitigated magic dilution</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Surabhi Luthra, Alexandra E. Moylett, Dan E. Browne, Earl T. Campbell</p>
            <p>As quantum computing progresses towards the early fault-tolerant regime, quantum error correction will play a crucial role in protecting qubits and enabling logical Clifford operations. However, the number of logical qubits will initially remain limited, posing challenges for resource-intensive tasks like magic state distillation. It is therefore essential to develop efficient methods for implementing non-Clifford operations, such as small-angle rotations, to maximise the computational capabilities of devices within these constraints. In this work, we introduce mitigated magic dilution (MMD) as an approach to synthesise small-angle rotations by employing quantum error mitigation techniques to sample logical Clifford circuits given noisy encoded magic states. We explore the utility of our approach for the simulation of the 2D Fermi-Hubbard model. We identify evolution time regimes where MMD outperforms state-of-the-art synthesis techniques in the number of noisy encoded magic states required for square lattices up to size $8 \times 8$. Moreover, we demonstrate that our method can provide a practical advantage that is quantified by a better-than-quadratic improvement in the resource requirements for small-angle rotations over classical simulators. This work paves the way for early fault-tolerant demonstrations on devices supporting millions of quantum operations, the so-called MegaQuOp regime.</p>

            <p>These notes present a review of the status of quantum computing with arrays of neutral atom qubits, an approach which has demonstrated remarkable progress in the last few years. Scaling digital quantum computing to qubit counts and control fidelities that will enable solving outstanding scientific questions, and provide commercial value, is an outstanding challenge, not least because of the requirement of connecting and entangling distant qubits. Long-range Rydberg gates and physical motion outfit atomic qubit arrays with tools for establishing connectivity. These tools operate on different timescales and with distinct levels of parallelization. We analyze several prototypical architectures from the perspective of achieving fast connectivity for circuits with large scale entanglement, as well as fast cycle times for measurement based quantum error correcting codes. Extending Rydberg interactions to multiple atomic species has emerged as a promising route to achieving this latter requirement.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ya-Tang Yu, I Gusti Ngurah Yudi Handayana, Wei Chen, H. H. Jen</p>
            <p>Waveguide quantum electrodynamics (wQED) with underlying collective and long-range atom-atom interactions has led to many distinct dynamical phenomena, including modified collective radiations and intriguing quantum correlations. It stands out as a unique platform to illustrate correlated photon transport, as well as to promise applications in quantum information processing. Here we manifest a fast and high atomic excitation transport by employing two separated chirally-coupled atomic arrays. This enhanced waveguide-mediated transport of excitations emerges due to the dominance of few subradiant right eigenstates that are spectrally isolated and spatially localized in the system's dynamics. Contrary to the instinct of applying the cascaded systems with unidirectional couplings to expedite direct and high excitation transport, the optimal system configurations in open wQED systems demand slight or finite nonreciprocal decay channels to facilitate energy transport by exploiting waveguide-mediated couplings. We also investigate the effect of the couplings' directionality and the scaling of atom number on the transport properties. Our results showcase the wide applicability in wQED platforms and provide insights into quantum engineering and quantum information applications.</p>

            <h2>Bending Hyperplanes, Nonlinear Entanglement Witnesses via Envelopes of Linear Witnesses</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> AmirHossein Tangestaninejad, Vahid Karimipour</p>
            <p>Entanglement witnesses (EWs) are fundamental tools for detecting entanglement. However traditional linear witnesses often fail to identify most of the entangled states. In this work, we construct a family of nonlinear entanglement witnesses by taking the envelope of linear witnesses defined over continuous families of pure bipartite states with fixed Schmidt bases. This procedure effectively "bends" the hyperplanes associated with linear witnesses into curved hypersurfaces, thereby extending the region of detectable entangled states. The resulting conditions can be expressed in terms of the positive semi-definiteness of a family of matrices, whose principal minors define a hierarchy of increasingly sensitive detection criteria. We show that this construction is not limited to the transposition map and generalizes naturally to arbitrary Positive but not Completely Positive (PnCP) maps, leading to nonlinear analogues of general entanglement witnesses. We emphasize that the required measurements remain experimentally accessible, as the nonlinear criteria are still formulated in terms of expectation values over local operator bases. Through both analytical and numerical examples, we demonstrate that the proposed nonlinear witnesses outperform their linear counterparts in detecting entangled states which may evade individual linear EWs in the construction. This approach offers a practical and conceptually elegant enhancement to entanglement detection in finite-dimensional systems.</p>

            <h2>Testing Distinguishability and Determinism in Atoms</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mark G. Raizen</p>
            <p>We propose and analyze experiments to test distinguishability and determinism in atoms. As a first step, we consider experiments to test if atoms are distinguishable from each other due to small differences in the nuclear magnetic moment. The idea is to measure the hyperfine splitting for stable isotopes that are confined to ion traps, by accumulating statistics over time with different atoms. The three cases analyzed are strontium-87 with an odd number of neutrons, lutetium-175 with an odd number of protons, and lutetium-176 with an odd number of protons and neutrons. We then consider the possibility of performing the same tests on newly created stable isotopes. We also propose that a time-dependent nuclear magnetic moment may enable deterministic tracking of the life cycle of an isotope, and prediction of age since creation and time until decay of radioisotopes. The case of thulium-170 is considered, it is particularly interesting as a radioisotope with an odd number of protons and neutrons. More generally, we argue that any atomic transition could change in time, either due to the atomic nucleus or to the electron charge distribution. The latter could be tested in a dual atomic clock in a ladder configuration to search for the aging of an electronic transition.</p>

            <p>Recent developments in quantum technologies have enabled significant improvements in the precision of optical sensing systems. This work explores the integration of distributed quantum sensing (DQS) with optical gyroscopes to improve the estimation accuracy of angular velocity. Utilizing bright two-mode squeezed states (bTMSS), which offer high photon numbers and strong bipartite quantum correlations, we propose a novel configuration that leverages continuous-variable entanglement across multiple spatially separated optical gyroscopes. Unlike traditional quantum sensing that enhances a single sensor, our approach focuses on estimating a global phase shift corresponding to the average angular rotation across distributed optical gyroscopes with quantum-enhanced sensitivity. We analyze the phase sensitivities of different bTMSS configurations, including M mode-entangled bTMSS and separable M-bTMSS, and evaluate their performance through the quantum Cramér-Rao bound. The analysis shows that, with 5% photon loss in every channel in the system, the proposed scheme shows a sensitivity enhancement of ~9.3 dB beyond the shot-noise limit, with an initial squeezing of ~9.8 dB. The present scheme has potential applications in quantum-enhanced inertial navigation and precision metrology within emerging quantum networks.</p>

            <p>Pulse-based Quantum Machine Learning (QML) has emerged as a novel paradigm in quantum artificial intelligence due to its exceptional hardware efficiency. For practical applications, pulse-based models must be both expressive and trainable. Previous studies suggest that pulse-based models under dynamic symmetry can be effectively trained, thanks to a favorable loss landscape that avoids barren plateaus. However, the resulting uncontrollability may compromise expressivity when the model is inadequately designed. This paper investigates the requirements for pulse-based QML models to be expressive while preserving trainability. We establish a necessary condition pertaining to the system's initial state, the measurement observable, and the underlying dynamical symmetry Lie algebra, supported by numerical simulations. Our findings provide a framework for designing practical pulse-based QML models that balance expressivity and trainability.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seyed Javad Akhtarshenas, Saman Karimi, Mahdi Salehi</p>
            <p>In the framework of mutually unbiased bases (MUBs), a measurement in one basis gives \emph{no information} about the outcomes of measurements in another basis. Here, we relax the no-information condition by allowing the $d$ outcomes to be predicted according to a predefined probability distribution $q=(q_0,\ldots,q_{d-1})$. The notion of mutual unbiasedness, however, is preserved by requiring that the extracted information is the same for any preparation and any measurement; regardless of which state from which basis is chosen to prepare the system, the outcomes of measuring the system with respect to the other basis generate the same probability distribution. In the light of this, we define the notion of \emph{mutually equi-biased bases} (MEBs) such that within each basis the states are equi-biased with respect to the states of the other basis and that the bases are mutually equi-biased with respect to each other. For $d=2,3$, we derive a complete set of $d+1$ MEBs. The mutual equi-biasedness imposes nontrivial constraints on the distribution $q$, leading for $d=3$ to the restriction $1/3\le\mu \le 1/2$ where $\mu=\sum_{k=0}^{2}q_k^2$. To capture the incompatibility of the measurements in MEBs, we derive an inequality for the probabilities of projective measurements in a qudit system, which yields an associated entropic uncertainty inequality. Finally, we construct a class of positive maps and their associated entanglement witnesses based on MEBs. While an entanglement witness constructed from MUBs is generally finer than one based on MEBs when both use the same number of bases, for certain values of the index $\mu$, employing a larger set of MEBs can yield a finer witness. We illustrate this behavior using isotropic states of a $3\times 3$ system. Our results reveal that not all bases in a set of $L$ MEBs can have contribution for the entanglement detection. ...</p>

A co-citation-based selection method is employed to trace the evolution of QPUF architectures, from early QR-PUFs to more recent Hybrid PUFs (HPUFs). This method further supports a discussion on the role of information-theoretic analysis in mitigating inconsistencies in QPUF responses, underscoring the deep connection between secret-key generation and authentication. Despite notable advances, achieving practical and robust QPUF-based authentication remains an open challenge.</p>

            <p>We study the error exponents in quantum hypothesis testing between two sets of quantum states, extending the analysis beyond the independent and identically distributed case to encompass composite correlated hypotheses. In particular, we introduce and compare two natural extensions of the quantum Hoeffding divergence and anti-divergence to sets of quantum states, establishing their equivalence or quantitative relations. In the error exponent regime, we generalize the quantum Hoeffding bound to stable sequences of convex, compact sets of quantum states, demonstrating that the optimal Type-I error exponent, under an exponential constraint on the Type-II error, is precisely characterized by the regularized quantum Hoeffding divergence between the sets. In the strong converse exponent regime, we provide a general lower bound on the exponent in terms of the regularized quantum Hoeffding anti-divergence and a matching upper bound when the null hypothesis is a singleton. The generality of these results enables applications in various contexts, including (i) refining the generalized quantum Stein's lemma by [Fang, Fawzi & Fawzi, 2024]; (ii) exhibiting counterexamples to the continuity of the regularized Petz Rényi divergence and Hoeffding divergence; (iii) obtaining error exponents for adversarial channel discrimination and resource detection problems.</p>

Furthermore, for a specific value of a the exact spectral equivalence to the discrete SSH model is established. Distinct from previous continuous analogues based on Schrödinger or Dirac-type Hamiltonians, our approach maintains chiral symmetry, does not require an external potential and features periodic energy bands. On finite domains, the model supports a flat band with zero energy formed by a countable infinite set of exponentially localized zero-energy edge states of topological origin. Beyond SSH, our method lays the foundation for constructing non-local, continuous analogues of a wide class of bipartite and multipartite lattices, opening new paths for theoretical exploration and new challenges for experimental realization in topological quantum matter.</p>

            <p>For a century, quantum theorists have been reading the mathematical entrails of quantum mechanics (QM) to divine the nature of quantum reality. But to little avail. In this paper a different approach is taken, namely to identify and explain the basic intuitive ideas involved in QM. This does not tell one how those basic `gears' all mesh together in the beautiful mathematics of QM. But this does give one some intuitive (\textit{anschaulich})) ideas about the quantum reality described in the seemingly hard-to-interpret mathematical framework.</p>

            <h2>Going beyond Landauer: Information-cost relations from inference based on the maximum entropy principle</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuanyuan Xiao, Jian-Hua Jiang, Junjie Liu</p>
            <p>The Landauer's principle, a cornerstone of information thermodynamics, provides a fundamental lower bound on the energetic cost of information erasure in terms of the information content change. However, its traditional formulation is largely confined to systems exchanging solely energy with an ideal thermal bath. In this work, we derive general information-cost trade-off relations that go beyond the scope of Landauer's principle by developing a thermodynamic inference approach based on the maximum entropy principle. These relations require only information about the system and are applicable to complex quantum scenarios involving multiple conserved charges and non-thermal environments. Specifically, we present two key results: (i) In scenarios where only the mean values of observables are accessible, we derive an information-content-informed upper bound on the thermodynamic cost which complements an existing generalized Landauer lower bound. (ii) When second-order fluctuations can also be measured, we obtain an information-content-informed lower bound on the change in variances of observables, thereby extending the Landauer's principle to constrain higher-order fluctuation costs. We numerically validate our information-cost trade-off relations using a coupled-qubit system exchanging energy and excitations, a driven qubit implementing an information erasure process, and a driven double quantum dot system that can operate as an inelastic heat engine. Our results underscore the broad utility of maximum-entropy inference in constraining thermodynamic costs for generic finite-time quantum processes, with direct relevance to quantum information processing and quantum thermodynamic applications.</p>

            <h2>Linear-Size QAC0 Channels: Learning, Testing and Hardness</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yangjing Dong, Fengning Ou, Penghui Yao</p>
            <p>Shallow quantum circuits have attracted increasing attention in recent years, due to the fact that current noisy quantum hardware can only perform faithful quantum computation for a short amount of time. The constant-depth quantum circuits $\mathbf{QAC}^0$, a quantum counterpart of $\mathbf{AC}^0$ circuits, are the polynomial-size and constant-depth quantum circuits composed of only single-qubit unitaries and polynomial-size generalized Toffoli gates. The computational power of $\mathbf{QAC}^0$ has been extensively investigated in recent years. In this paper, we are concerned with $\mathbf{QLC}^0$ circuits, which are linear-size $\mathbf{QAC}^0$ circuits, a quantum counterpart of $\mathbf{LC}^0$. * We show that depth-$d$ $\mathbf{QAC}^0$ circuits working on $n$ input qubits and $a$ ancilla qubits have approximate degree at most $\tilde{O}((n+a)^{1-2^{-d}})$, improving the $\tilde{O}((n+a)^{1-3^{-d}})$ degree upper bound of previous works. Consequently, this directly implies that to compute the parity function, $\mathbf{QAC}^0$ circuits need at least $\tilde{O}(n^{1+2^{-d}})$ circuit size. * We present the first agnostic learning algorithm for $\mathbf{QLC}^0$ channels using subexponential running time and queries. Moreover, we also establish exponential lower bounds on the query complexity of learning $\mathbf{QAC}^0$ channels under both the spectral norm distance of the Choi matrix and the diamond norm distance. * We present a tolerant testing algorithm which determines whether an unknown quantum channel is a $\mathbf{QLC}^0$ channel. This tolerant testing algorithm is based on our agnostic learning algorithm. Our approach leverages low-degree approximations of $\mathbf{QAC}^0$ circuits and Pauli analysis as key technical tools. Collectively, these results advance our understanding of agnostic learning for shallow quantum circuits.</p>

            <h2>Analytic and Stochastic Approach to Quantum Advantages in Ground State and Quantum State Preparation Problems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Taehee Ko, Sungbin Lim</p>
            <p>We study the problems of state preparation, ground state preparation and quantum state preparation. We propose an analytic approach to a stochastic quantum algorithm which prepares the ground state for $n$-qubit Hamiltonian that is represented by $\text{poly}(n)$ Pauli operators and has an inverse-polynomial gap, requiring only $\text{poly}(n)$ Pauli rotations, measurements, and classical time complexity when $n$ exceeds a threshold, to inverse-polynomial precision given the initial overlap being lower bounded by $\frac{1}{2^n}$. Extending this result, we prove that any $n$-qubit quantum state can be prepared in two regimes: (1) with a constant number of Pauli rotations to constant precision, or (2) with a polynomial number of rotations to inverse-polynomial precision. Our results improve over previous approaches to quantum state preparation in terms of gate complexity, thereby yielding quantum space advantage. As an application, we identify a practical condition under which quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems can be solved with exponential quantum speedups.</p>

            <h2>On Cryptography and Distribution Verification, with Applications to Quantum Advantage</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bruno Cavalar, Eli Goldin, Matthew Gray, Taiga Hiroka, Tomoyuki Morimae</p>
            <p>One of the most fundamental problems in the field of hypothesis testing is the identity testing problem: whether samples from some unknown distribution $\mathcal{G}$ are actually from some explicit distribution $\mathcal{D}$. It is known that when the distribution $\mathcal{D}$ has support $[N]$, the optimal sample complexity for the identity testing problem is roughly $O(\sqrt{N})$. However, many distributions of interest, including those which can be sampled efficiently, have exponential support size, and therefore the optimal identity tester also requires exponential samples. In this paper, we bypass this lower bound by considering restricted settings. The above $O(\sqrt{N})$ sample complexity identity tester is constructed so that it is not fooled by any (even inefficiently-sampled) distributions. However, in most applications, the distributions under consideration are efficiently samplable, and therefore it is enough to consider only identity testers that are not fooled by efficiently-sampled distributions. In this setting we can hope to construct efficient identity testers. We investigate relations between efficient verification of classical/quantum distributions with classical/quantum cryptography, showing the following results: (1). Classically efficiently samplable distributions are verifiable if and only if one-way functions do not exist. (2). Quantumly efficiently samplable distributions are verifiable by $\mathbf{P}^\mathbf{PP}$ with a polynomial number of samples. (3). Sampling-based quantum advantage can be verified quantumly (with a polynomial number of samples) if one-way puzzles do not exist. (4). If QEFID pairs exist, then some quantumly efficiently samplable distributions are not verifiable.</p>

            <p>The reliable distribution of high-dimensional entangled quantum states, an important resource in quantum technologies, through optical fibre networks is challenging due to the need to maintain coherence across multiple modes. Here we demonstrate the distribution of four-dimensional path-encoded entangled quantum states between photonic chips, enabled by a novel multimode phase stabilisation algorithm. The algorithm utilises the reconfigurability of the integrated photonic circuits to complete one iteration of phase stabilisation in just two measurement rounds for an arbitrary number of modes, and requires no additional hardware to the quantum measurements it enables. As a result, we are able to perform complete quantum state tomography across two chips using the minimum number of local projective measurements to verify the fidelity of the distributed entangled state to be 86% (compared to 8.1% without the phase stabilisation) with an entanglement entropy of 0.995+/-0.002.</p>

            <h2>On Encoding Matrices using Quantum Circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liron Mor Yosef, Haim Avron</p>
            <p>Over a decade ago, it was demonstrated that quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize numerical linear algebra by enabling algorithms with complexity superior to what is classically achievable, e.g., the seminal HHL algorithm for solving linear systems. Efficient execution of such algorithms critically depends on representing inputs (matrices and vectors) as quantum circuits that encode or implement these inputs. For that task, two common circuit representations emerged in the literature: block encodings and state preparation circuits. In this paper, we systematically study encodings matrices in the form of block encodings and state preparation circuits. We examine methods for constructing these representations from matrices given in classical form, as well as quantum two-way conversions between circuit representations. Two key results we establish (among others) are: (a) a general method for efficiently constructing a block encoding of an arbitrary matrix given in classical form (entries stored in classical random access memory); and (b) low-overhead, bidirectional conversion algorithms between block encodings and state preparation circuits, showing that these models are essentially equivalent. From a technical perspective, two central components of our constructions are: (i) a special constant-depth multiplexer that simultaneously multiplexes all higher-order Pauli matrices of a given size, and (ii) an algorithm for performing a quantum conversion between a matrix's expansion in the standard basis and its expansion in the basis of higher-order Pauli matrices.</p>

            <h2>Scrambling Without Chaos in Random Free-Fermionic Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ali Mollabashi, Mohammad-Javad Vasli</p>
            <p>We study the role of randomness in the scrambling of quantum information within integrable free-fermionic systems. Considering quadratic Hamiltonians with varying degrees of randomness, we analyze entanglement-based measures to characterize the scrambling structure. We show that the memory effect in the entanglement of disjoint subsystems of Gaussian states vanishes when the local couplings are random, indicating information delocalization. The tripartite mutual information exhibits negative saturation values similar to those in chaotic systems, albeit with a smaller magnitude, revealing weaker scrambling under integrable quadratic dynamics. Despite integrability, spectral analyses reveal that local random models display a spectral-form-factor ramp and a partial crossover in the single-particle level-spacing ratio from Poisson-like to Wigner--Dyson-like behavior within a certain range of random couplings. These results demonstrate that randomness can act as a minimal ingredient for inducing information scrambling in integrable quadratic fermionic models.</p>

            <p>We establish a unified framework connecting decoherence and quantum complexity. By vectorizing the density matrix into a pure state in a double Hilbert space, a decoherence process is mapped to an imaginary-time evolution. Expanding this evolution in the Krylov space, we find that the $n$-th Krylov basis corresponds to an $n$-error state generated by the decoherence, providing a natural bridge between error proliferation and complexity growth. Using two dephasing quantum channels as concrete examples, we show that the Krylov complexity remains nonsingular for strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry-breaking (SWSSB) crossovers, while it exhibits a singular area-to-volume-law transition for genuine SWSSB phase transitions, intrinsic to mixed states.</p>

            <h2>A No-Go Theorem for Shaping Quantum Resources</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samuel Alperin</p>
            <p>The ability to engineer non-Gaussian quantum resources underlies quantum technologies from communication and metrology to universal computation. However, while a number of canonical works have set no-go limits for attaining such resources from Gaussian operations, it is widely assumed that such resources can be tuned freely by non-Gaussian Hamiltonian dynamics. Here we prove a general no-go theorem for such resource shaping: no smooth Hamiltonian dynamics can modify higher-order statistical moments of a continuous-variable state without simultaneously changing its mean and covariance. This analytic constraint implies a rigidity theorem for Hamiltonian quantum control-only quadratic (symplectic) generators preserve the Gaussian moment hierarchy, while every non-quadratic term necessarily couples the Gaussian and non-Gaussian sectors. The theorem identifies the symplectic algebra as the unique invariant subalgebra whose differential representations terminate at finite (second) order within the otherwise infinite Hamiltonian algebra. It thereby defines the analytic boundary between classically simulable Gaussian dynamics and the fully universal non-Gaussian regime-the continuous-variable analogue of the Gottesman-Knill frontier.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shotaro Shirai, Shinichi Inoue, Shuhei Tamate, Rui Li, Yasunobu Nakamura, Atsushi Noguchi</p>
            <p>Entangling gates between neighboring physical qubits are essential for quantum error correction. Implementing them in an all-microwave manner simplifies signal routing and control apparatus of superconducting quantum processors. We propose and experimentally demonstrate an all-microwave controlled-Z (CZ) gate that achieves high fidelity while suppressing residual ZZ interactions. Our approach utilizes a fixed-frequency transmon coupler and multi-path coupling, thereby sufficiently reducing the net transverse interaction between data transmons to suppress residual ZZ interactions. The controlled phase arises from the dispersive frequency shift of the $|gf\rangle$$\unicode{x2013}$$|eg\rangle$ transition between the coupler and one of the data transmons conditioned on the state of the other data transmon. Driving the transitions at the midpoint of two dispersively shifted resonance frequencies induces state-dependent geometric phases to achieve the CZ gate. Crucially, with this scheme, we can maintain a small net transverse interaction between two data transmons while increasing the coupling between the data and coupler transmons to accelerate the CZ-gate speed. Additionally, we measure the coupler state after the gate to detect a subset of decoherence-induced failures that occur during the gate operation. These events constitute erasure errors with known locations, enabling erasure-aware quantum error-correcting codes to improve future logical qubit performance.</p>

            <p>Qubit mapping/routing is a critical stage in compilation for both near-term and fault-tolerant quantum computers, yet existing scalable methods typically impose several times the routing overhead in terms of circuit depth or duration. This inefficiency stems from a fundamental disconnect: compilers rely on an abstract routing model (e.g., three-CX-unrolled SWAP insertion) that completely ignores the idiosyncrasies of native gates supported by physical devices. Recent hardware breakthroughs have enabled high-precision implementations of diverse instruction set architectures (ISAs) beyond standard CX-based gates. Advanced ISAs involving gates such as SQiSW and ZZ({\theta}) gates offer superior circuit synthesis capabilities and can be realized with higher fidelities. However, systematic compiler optimization strategies tailored to these advanced ISAs are lacking. To address this, we propose Canopus, a unified qubit mapping/routing framework applicable to diverse quantum ISAs. Built upon the canonical representation of two-qubit gates, Canopus centers on qubit routing to perform deep co-optimization in an ISA-aware approach. Canopus leverages the two-qubit canonical representation and the monodromy polytope to model the synthesis cost for more intelligent SWAP insertion during the routing stage. We also formalize the commutation relations between two-qubit gates through the canonical form, providing a generalized approach to commutativity-based optimizations. Experiments show that Canopus consistently reduces routing overhead by 15%-35% compared to state-of-the-art methods across different ISAs and topologies. Our work also presents a coherent method for co-exploration of program patterns, quantum ISAs, and hardware topologies.</p>

            <p>Designing expressive yet trainable quantum circuit architectures remains a major challenge for variational quantum algorithms, as manual or heuristic designs often yield suboptimal performance. We propose HyRLQAS (Hybrid-Action Reinforcement Learning for Quantum Architecture Search), a unified framework that integrates discrete gate placement and continuous parameter generation within a hybrid action space. Unlike existing approaches that optimize circuit structure and parameters separately, HyRLQAS jointly learns both topology and initialization while dynamically refining previously placed gates through reinforcement learning. Trained in a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) environment, the agent autonomously constructs circuits that minimize molecular ground-state energy. Experimental results demonstrate that HyRLQAS achieves consistently lower energy errors and more compact circuit structures compared with discrete-only and continuous-only baselines. Furthermore, the hybrid action space yields superior parameter initializations, producing post-optimization energy distributions with consistently lower minima. These findings suggest that hybrid-action reinforcement learning offers a principled pathway toward automated and hardware-efficient quantum circuit design.</p>

            <p>The problem of revocation of quantum states after sharing is interesting and we ask: Is it possible for a dealer to revoke the state once shared, before the reconstruction process? Additional resources like bell states are used to help the dealer to get back the state. In a three-party scenario, we show an independent way to revoke, if, for any reason, the dealer is not sure about the intention of the/any reconstructor. In general, the classical outcomes of the dealer in sharing phase are needed, to be able to reconstruct the state perfectly. When both the shareholders are dishonest, and without the dealer's knowledge, collude to reconstruct, they always have some chance of succeeding. This is addressed by giving more control to the dealer by making him/her) to have a quantum share as well. We give a sharing and revocation protocol with a four-qubit entangled resource shared among three parties (two qubits with the dealer and one each with the shareholders). We further consider a class of four qubit pure entangled states as resource and explicitly find the range of parameters for which the protocol will be successful.</p>

We also investigate spectral hole-burning spectra with varying magnetic fields, which provides insight into hyperfine and superhyperfine interactions. Using again spectral holes but also optical free induction decays (FIDs), we assess optical coherence times, finding a maximum of 1.1 $\mu s$ when a 2T magnetic field is applied.

            <p>Ekerå and Håstad have introduced a variation of Shor's algorithm for the discrete logarithm problem (DLP). Unlike Shor's original algorithm, Ekerå-Håstad's algorithm solves the short DLP in groups of unknown order. In this work, we prove a lower bound on the probability of Ekerå-Håstad's algorithm recovering the short logarithm $d$ in a single run. By our bound, the success probability can easily be pushed as high as $1 - 10^{-10}$ for any short $d$. A key to achieving such a high success probability is to efficiently perform a limited search in the classical post-processing by leveraging meet-in-the-middle techniques. Asymptotically, in the limit as the bit length $m$ of $d$ tends to infinity, the success probability tends to one if the limits on the search space are parameterized in $m$. Our results are directly applicable to Diffie-Hellman in safe-prime groups with short exponents, and to RSA via a reduction from the RSA integer factoring problem (IFP) to the short DLP.</p>

            <p>Moiré and super-moiré materials provide exceptional platforms to engineer exotic correlated quantum matter. The vast number of sites required to model moiré systems in real space remains a formidable challenge due to the immense computational resources required. Super-moiré materials push this requirement to the limit, where millions or even billions of sites need to be considered, a requirement beyond the capabilities of conventional methods for interacting systems. Here, we establish a methodology that allows solving correlated states in systems reaching a billion sites, that exploits tensor-network representations of real-space Hamiltonians and self-consistent real-space mean-field equations. Our method combines a tensor-network kernel polynomial method with quantics tensor cross interpolation algorithm, enabling us to solve exponentially large models, including those whose single particle Hamiltonian is too large to be stored explicitly. We demonstrate our methodology with super-moiré systems featuring spatially modulated hoppings, many-body interactions and domain walls, showing that it allows access to self-consistent symmetry broken states and spectral functions of real-space models reaching a billion sites. Our methodology provides a strategy to solve exceptionally large interacting problems, providing a widely applicable strategy to compute correlated super-moiré quantum matter.</p>

            <p>Non-Abelian topological insulators are characterized by matrix-valued, non-commuting topological charges with regard to more than one energy gap. Their descriptions go beyond the conventional topological band theory, in which an additive integer is endowed separately with each (degenerate group of) energy band(s). In this work, we reveal that Floquet (time-periodic) driving could not only enrich the topology and phase transitions of non-Abelian topological matter, but also induce bulk-edge correspondence unique to nonequilibrium setups. Using a one-dimensional (1D), three-band model as an illustrative example, we demonstrate that Floquet driving could reshuffle the phase diagram of the non-driven system, yielding both gapped and gapless Floquet band structures with non-Abelian topological charges. Moreover, by dynamically tuning the anomalous Floquet $\pi$-quasienergy gap, non-Abelian topological transitions inaccessible to static systems could arise, leading to much more complicated relations between non-Abelian topological charges and Floquet edge states. These discoveries put forth the periodic driving as a powerful scheme of engineering non-Abelian topological phases (NATPs) and incubating unique non-Abelian band topology beyond equilibrium.</p>

We show that the Kondo effect can be restored by locally adjusting the chemical potential on the impurity site, and we identify realistic parameter regimes and preparation protocols suited to current experiments with AEA arrays. Our work paves the way for novel quantum simulations of the Kondo problem and offers new insights into Kondo physics in unconventional regimes.</p>

            <h2>Krylov Complexity in Lifshitz-type Dirac Field Theories</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hamid R. Imani, Komeil Babaei Velni, M. Reza Mohammadi Mozaffar</p>
            <p>We study Krylov complexity in Lifshitz-type Dirac field theories with a generic dynamical critical exponent $z$. By computing the Lanczos coefficients for massless and massive cases, we analyze the growth and saturation behavior of Krylov complexity in different regimes. We incorporate a hard UV cutoff and investigate the effects of lattice discretization, revealing fundamental differences between continuum and lattice models. In the presence of a UV cutoff, Krylov complexity exhibits an initial exponential growth followed by a linear regime, with saturation values of the Lanczos coefficients dictated by the cutoff scale. For the lattice model, we find a fundamental departure from the continuum case: due to the finite Krylov basis, Krylov complexity saturates rather than growing indefinitely. Our findings suggest that Lifshitz scaling influences operator growth and information spreading in quantum systems. We further find that increasing the Lifshitz exponent $z$ suppresses Krylov complexity, entropy, and Lanczos growth in both massless and massive cases, while enhancing K-variance. This trend reverses under a hard UV cutoff, where complexity and entropy increase with $z$. In lattice models, early-time complexity and $b_n$ decay shift with $z$, echoing the continuum behavior of massive and massless regimes.</p>

            <h2>General Signal Model and Capacity Limit for Rydberg Quantum Information System</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jieao Zhu, Linglong Dai</p>
            <p>Rydberg atomic receivers represent a transformative approach to achieving high-sensitivity, broadband, and miniaturized radio frequency (RF) reception. However, existing static signal models for Rydberg atomic receivers rely on the steady-state assumption of atomic quantum states, which cannot fully describe the signal reception process of dynamic signals. To fill in this gap, in this paper, we present a general model to compute the dynamic signal response of Rydberg atomic receivers in closed form. Specifically, by applying small-signal perturbation techniques to the quantum master equation, we derive closed-form Laplace domain transfer functions that characterize the receiver's dynamic responses to time-varying signal fields. To gain more insights into the quantum-based RF-photocurrent conversion process, we further introduce the concept of quantum transconductance that describes the quantum system as an equivalent classical system. By applying quantum transconductance, we quantify the influence of in-band blackbody radiation (BBR) noise on the atomic receiver sensitivity. Extensive simulations for Rydberg atomic receivers validate the proposed signal model, and demonstrate the possibility of quantum receivers to outperform classical electronic receivers through the improvement of quantum transconductance.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement Suppression Due to Black Hole Scattering</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kazuki Doi, Tadashi Takayanagi</p>
            <p>We consider the evolution of entanglement entropy in a two-dimensional conformal field theory with a holographic dual. Specifically, we are interested in a class of excited states produced by a combination of pure-state (local operator) and mixed-state local quenches. We employ a method that allows us to determine the full time evolution analytically. While a single insertion of a local operator gives rise to a logarithmic time profile of entanglement entropy relative to the vacuum, we find that this growth is heavily suppressed in the presence of a mixed-state quench, reducing it to a time-independent constant bump. The degree of suppression depends on the relative position of the quenches as well as the ratio of regularization parameters associated with the quenches. This work sheds light on the interesting properties of gravitational scattering involving black holes.</p>

Our setup enables simultaneous readout of both the atomic internal state and position on a one-dimensional array of optical tweezers. We benchmark the protocol using two atoms in the same Rydberg state, which experience van der Waals repulsion, and measure velocities in agreement with theoretical predictions. When preparing the atoms in a different pair state, we observe an oscillatory dynamics that we attribute to the proximity of a macrodimer bound state. Finally, we perform a Stern-Gerlach-like experiment in which a superposition of the two previous pair states results in the separation of the atomic wavepacket into two macroscopically distinct trajectories, thereby demonstrating spin-motion coupling mediated by the interactions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Longwen Zhou, Rujia Jing, Shenlin Wu</p>
            <p>Critical edge states appear at the bulk gap closing points of topological transitions. Their emergence signify the existence of topologically nontrivial critical points, whose descriptions fall outside the scope of gapped topological matter. In this work, we reveal and characterize topological critical points and critical edge states in non-Hermitian systems. By applying the Cauchy's argument principle to two characteristic functions of a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, we obtain a pair of winding numbers, whose combination yields a complete description of gapped and gapless topological phases in one-dimensional, two-band non-Hermitian systems with sublattice symmetry. Focusing on a broad class of non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains, we demonstrate the applicability of our theory for characterizing gapless symmetry-protected topological phases, topologically distinct critical points, phase transitions along non-Hermitian phase boundaries and their associated topological edge modes. Our findings not only generalize the concepts of topologically nontrivial critical points and critical edge modes to non-Hermitian setups, but also yield additional insights for analyzing topological transitions and bulk-edge correspondence in open systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ho June Kim, Fabian Schmid, David Holzapfel, Daniel Kienzler</p>
            <p>We report on efficient rovibrational state-selective loading of single H$_2^+$ molecular ions into a cryogenic linear Paul trap using (2+1) resonance-enhanced multi-photon ionization (REMPI). The H$_2^+$ ions are created by resonant two-photon excitation of H$_2$ molecules from the $X\;^1\Sigma_g^+$ state to the $E,F\;^1\Sigma_g^+$ state, followed by non-resonant one-photon ionization. The H$_2^+$ ions are produced from residual gas and sympathetically cooled by a co-trapped, laser-cooled $^9$Be$^+$ ion. By tuning the wavelength of the REMPI laser, we observe the loading of single H$_2^+$ ions via the ($\nu' = 0$, $L' = 0, 1, 2, 3$) rovibrational levels of the $E,F\;^1\Sigma_g^+$ intermediate state. We measure the success probability for the production of H$_2^+$ in the ($\nu^+ = 0$, $L^+ = 1$) state via the ($\nu' = 0$, $L' = 1$) level to be 85(6)% by quantum logic spectroscopy (QLS) of the hyperfine structure of this rovibrational state. Furthermore, we load an H$_2^+$ ion via the ($\nu' = 0$, $L' = 2$) level and confirm its rovibrational state to be ($\nu^+ = 0$, $L^+ = 2$) by QLS. We perform QLS probes on the ion over 19 h and observe no decay of the rotationally excited state. Our work demonstrates an efficient state-selective loading mechanism for single-ion, high-precision spectroscopy of hydrogen molecular ions.</p>

The QPC is arranged to maximize the readout contrast between two neighboring, coupled electron and hole QDs. We apply the readout scheme to a single-particle electron-hole double QD and demonstrate time-resolved detection of charge states as well as magnetic field dependent tunneling rates. This promises a high-fidelity readout scheme for individual spin and valley states, which is important for the operation of spin, valley or spin-valley qubits in bilayer graphene.</p>

            <p>Metasurfaces composed of subwavelength nanostructures enable simultaneous control of polarization and wavefront, greatly enhancing holographic information capacity. Building on this capability, we extend holography into the quantum domain by experimentally realizing Bell-state holograms-distinct holographic images encoded in polarization-entangled Bell states of photon pairs. A polarization-multiplexed dielectric metasurface generates spatial modes conditioned on both input and output polarizations, entangling the holographic pattern with the two-photon state. To characterize these quantum holograms, we further develop quantum hologram tomography, reconstructing the full density matrix of the holographic state pixel by pixel. The reconstructed density-matrix hologram reveals tailor-made holographic symbols attached to individual Bell states through the metasurface, with contrast built up among the different Bell components as theory shows. This framework unifies metasurface photonics with quantum-state reconstruction and provides a scalable route toward high-dimensional quantum communication, encryption and information processing based on holographically encoded quantum light.</p>

Achieving sensitivity at the THz (meV) scale requires materials with smaller superconducting gaps than those of conventional aluminum or niobium-based devices. Here, we report the fabrication and characterization of hafnium (Hf)-based Josephson junctions (Hf-HfOx-Hf), demonstrating Hf as a promising low-Tc material platform for ultra-low threshold single THz photon and single-phonon detection. Structural and chemical analyses reveal crystalline films and well-defined oxide barriers, while electrical transport measurements at both room and cryogenic temperatures exhibit clear Josephson behavior, enabling extraction of key junction parameters such as critical current, superconducting gap and normal-state resistance.

            <p>Precise control over rotational angular momentum is at the heart of recent advances in quantum chemistry, quantum simulation, and quantum computation with ultracold bialkali molecules. Each rotational state comprises a rich manifold of hyperfine states arising from combinations of rotation and nuclear spins; this often yields hundreds of transitions available between a given pair of rotational states, and the efficient navigation of this complex space is a current challenge for experiments. Here, we describe a general approach based on a simple heuristic and graph theory to quickly identify optimal sets of states in ultracold bialkali molecules. We explain how to find pathways through the many available transitions to prepare the molecule in a specific state with maximum speed for any desired fidelity. We then examine networks of states where multiple couplings are present at the same time. As example applications, we first identify a closed loop of four states in the RbCs molecule where there is minimal population leakage out of the loop during simultaneous microwave coupling; we then extend the optimisation procedure to account for decoherence induced by magnetic-field noise and obtain an optimal set of 3 states for quantum computation applications.</p>

            <h2>Emergent Dynamical Translational Symmetry Breaking as an Order Principle for Localization and Topological Transitions</h2>

            <p>Localization transitions represent a fundamental class of continuous phase transitions, yet they occur without any accompanying symmetry breaking. We resolve this by introducing the concept of dynamical translational symmetry (DTS), which is defined not by the Hamiltonian but by the long-time dynamics of local observables. Its order parameter, the time-averaged local translational contrast (TLTC), quantitatively diagnoses whether evolution restores or breaks translational equivalence. We demonstrate that the TLTC universally captures the Anderson localization transition, the many-body localization transition, and topological phase transitions, revealing that these disparate phenomena are unified by the emergent breaking of DTS. This work establishes a unified dynamical-symmetry framework for phases transitions beyond the equilibrium paradigm.</p>

            <p>Understanding how quantum systems transition from integrable to fully chaotic behavior remains a central open problem in physics. The Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model provides a paradigmatic framework for studying many-body chaos and holography, yet it captures only the strongly correlated limit, leaving intermediate regimes unexplored. Here, we investigate the Yukawa--SYK (YSYK) model, where bosonic fields mediate random fermionic interactions, and demonstrate that it naturally bridges single-particle and many-body chaos. Using spectral and dynamical chaos markers, we perform a comprehensive finite-size characterization of the YSYK model. We show that the interaction strength acts as a tunable control parameter interpolating between the SYK$_2$ and SYK$_4$ limits, and introduce a framework enabling direct and quantitative comparison with these benchmark models. In the intermediate regimes, we uncover distinct dynamical regimes marked by partial ergodicity breaking, prethermalization plateaus, and incomplete scrambling. Finally, we propose a feasible optical-cavity implementation of the YSYK model using ultra-cold atoms. Our results establish the YSYK model as a unifying platform connecting single-particle and many-body chaos, paving the way for experimental observation of these phenomena.</p>

Using two $^{40}\mathrm{Ca}^+$ ions and the optical--metastable--ground architecture, we encode the data qubit in the ground-state manifold and the monitor qubit in a metastable-state manifold to achieve spectral separation. The monitor qubit senses common magnetic fluctuations during data-qubit experiments, enabling feedforward corrections to the qubit-control drives. Under applied magnetic noise with a realistic spectrum ($1/f^{2}$), the protocol maintains coherence and, when compared with interleaved calibration, it extends usable data-qubit probe times by up to a factor of ${\sim}\sqrt{2}$ and doubles the experimental duty cycle. These results establish monitor qubits as a scalable tool for real-time recalibration in quantum information processors.</p>

            <p>Noise suppression is of paramount importance for reliable quantum information processing and computation. We show that for any single-mode bosonic code (qumode) corrupted by thermal~noise at rate~$\eta$ and mean \mbox{excitation}~$\bar{n}$, a hybrid continuous-discrete-variable~(CV-DV) interferometer using only a single qubit ancilla~(DV) and two controlled~Fourier~(CF) gates sandwiching the noise channel suppresses its effects to $\mathcal{O}(\eta^2)$ \emph{without} any active error correction or destructive measurements of the encoded state and with high success probabilities~$>0.5$ if~$\eta(1+\bar{n})<0.5$. This suppression scheme works by conditionally monitoring the photon-number parities after the interferometer. Bosonic codes with two logical states of the same photon-number parity (like-parity codes) are \emph{completely resilient} to DV amplitude- and phase-damping ancilla noise. For such codes, the interferometer simplifies to the use of a qumode rotation gate and a \emph{single} CF~gate. This presents a clear advantage of our CF-gate-based error suppression scheme over previously-proposed ``bypass'' protocols, where qubit information transferred to the DV mode is readily corrupted by damping~noise. Finally, we present a simple extension to direct communication of qumode states between two parties over a noisy channel using a preshared DV entangled state, by implementing a CF gate in the first laboratory and its inverse in the other. Such a communication protocol achieves a similar fidelity performance at the same success rate as the single-party case, but with greater resilience to the ancilla noise than DV~teleportation. Resource-efficient multi-qubit codes that depend on a few essential long-range interactions can benefit from it.</p>

            <p>Scaling of quantum gates remains a central challenge in quantum information science. Ultrafast gates based on spin-dependent kicks provide a promising approach for trapped-ion systems. However, these gates require laser pulses with both high temporal tunability and stability, which are difficult to achieve with existing pulsed sources. Here, we propose a programmable pulsed source that allows flexible control of pulse intensity, waveform, and phase profiles. This enables precise manipulation of pulse sequences, thereby improving the fidelity of entangling gates. Furthermore, since the pulse parameters can be conveniently tuned, various coherent population-transfer schemes can be implemented adiabatic SDKs, thereby improving both the fidelity and robustness of fast quantum gate. Simulation results show that our programmable pulse system can achieve gate fidelities above 99.99% with strong robustness against variations in pulse intensity and single-photon detuning using stimulated Raman adiabatic rapid passage (STIRARP) protocols.</p>

            <p>The introduction of an asymmetric term into the quantum Rabi model generally lifts energy-level degeneracies. However, when the asymmetry parameter takes specific multiples of the bosonic mode frequency, level degeneracies reappear$-$a phenomenon referred to as the hidden symmetry in the asymmetric quantum Rabi model. Identifying the origin of this hidden symmetry and its explicit operator form constitutes two central tasks in studying this system. Here, we investigate the origin of this hidden symmetry using the method of two successive diagonalizations, with a focus on physics in the regime where the ratio between the two-level splitting $\Delta$ and the mode frequency $\omega$ satisfies $\Delta/\omega \gg 1$. We find that the hidden symmetry stems from energy-level matching within the asymmetric double-well potential, a picture strongly supported by the wavefunctions of both the ground and excited states. Moreover, the emergence of an excited-state quantum phase transition is identified and qualitatively discussed, which arises from the breaking and restoration of this hidden symmetry across different coupling regimes. Our results provide deeper insight into the physics of the asymmetric quantum Rabi model, particularly in the previously less-explored strong-coupling regime where $\Delta/\omega \gg 1$.</p>

We generalize this exotic behavior of entanglement sharing dynamics to more general systems with arbitrary N qubits, instead of restricting to the atom-cavity mode interaction system. We also demonstrate methods to control the entanglement freezing time and freezing value, and we discover a nontrivial dynamics where entanglement is frozen permanently. In addition, we show that this phenomenon is not a coincidence but a universal feature in a variety of systems with a geometric explanation of the mechanisms.</p>

We give the concepts of these channels, derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for a Gaussian channel to belong to each class, and explore the intrinsic relationships among them. Additionally, since quantifying the steering capability of Gaussian channels in continuous-variable systems requires an understanding of the structure of free superchannels, we also provide a detailed characterization of Gaussian unsteerable superchannels and maximal Gaussian unsteerable superchannels.</p>

            <p>Although multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) terahertz (THz) continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) is theoretically secure, practical vulnerabilities may arise due to detector imperfections. This paper explores a CV measurement-device-independent (MDI) QKD system operating at THz frequencies within a MIMO framework. In this system, measurement is delegated to an untrusted third party, Charlie, rather than the receiver, eliminating all detector attacks and significantly enhancing the system's practical security. Using transmit-receive beamforming techniques, the system transforms MIMO channels into multiple parallel lossy quantum channels, enabling robust key distribution between Alice and Bob. This study examines entanglement-based and prepare-and-measure protocols, deriving secret key rates for both asymptotic and finite code scenarios. Simulations reveal the critical role of multiple antenna configurations and efficient homodyne detection in mitigating free-space path loss and maximizing key rates. Results indicate that system performance is optimized at lower THz frequencies for long-range transmissions and higher frequencies for short-range applications. The proposed protocol offers a scalable solution for secure quantum communications in next-generation wireless networks, demonstrating potential for deployment in both indoor and outdoor environments.</p>

The entanglement between the probe and ancilla photons enhances the detection performance per unit average photon number in the probe mode, particularly in low-reflectivity and high-noise scenarios. However, photon loss severely limits the practical advantage of such protocols. To address this, we employ a channel superposition framework, which encompasses two kinds of channel superposition protocols: indefinite causal order (ICO) and path superposition with disjoint environment (PS-DE). Our analytical and numerical analysis based on the quantum Chernoff bound shows that both ICO and PS-DE can, in principle, achieve an advantage. The advantage persists as long as non-zero interference remains, reverting to the performance of standard quantum illumination once the interference is completely suppressed. Crucially, the ICO protocol is significantly more robust, maintaining a tighter upper bound on the error probability than standard quantum illumination and the PS-DE approach. This performance hierarchy is rooted in their fundamental structures: ICO exploits a shared environment to generate stronger quantum interference, while PS-DE, relying on disjoint environments, offers a more experimentally tractable albeit less potent alternative.</p>

            <h2>Robust Quantum Teleportation Against Noise Using Weak Measurement and Flip Operations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohit Dhanik, Shraddha Sharma, Pitamber Mahanandia</p>
            <p>This study presents an improved quantum teleportation protocol designed to enhance fidelity in noisy environments by combining weak measurements (WMs) with flip and reversal operations. In our scheme, Alice prepares a four-qubit entangled state and shares one of the entangled qubits with Bob, which serves as the quantum channel for teleporting an arbitrary single-qubit state. Since the communication channel is subject to noise, Alice performs a weak measurement on the shared qubit before transmission to reduce the impact of decoherence. Building upon existing WM-flip-reversal frameworks, we propose a modified weak measurement and reversal (WMR) protocol tailored for different noises in a four-qubit entangled system. The approach applies WM and flip operations prior to transmission to enhance resilience against noise, followed by corresponding reversal operations after transmission to recover the original quantum state. We systematically compare the performance of our proposed WMR protocol with the previously proposed WM-flip-reversal method under three common noise models: amplitude damping channel (ADC), phase flip channel (PFC), and bit flip channel (BFC). Our analysis reveals that the modified WMR scheme achieves significantly higher teleportation fidelity and improved robustness, particularly in bit flip noise environments. These findings highlight the potential of optimized weak measurement strategies for developing more reliable and noise-tolerant quantum communication protocols.</p>

            <h2>Adaptive Entanglement-Aware Routing for Satellite Quantum Networks under Orbital and Atmospheric Variability</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dhrumil Bhatt, Vidushi Kumar</p>
            <p>The expansion of satellite-based quantum networks requires adaptive routing mechanisms that can sustain entanglement under dynamic orbital and atmospheric conditions. Conventional schemes, often tailored to static or idealised topologies, fail to capture the combined effects of orbital motion, fading, and trust variability in inter-satellite links. This work proposes an \textit{adaptive entanglement-aware routing framework} that jointly accounts for orbital geometry, atmospheric attenuation, and multi-parameter link evaluation. The routing metric integrates fidelity, trust, and key-rate weights to maintain connectivity and mitigate loss from turbulence and fading. Monte Carlo simulations across multiple orbital densities ($\rho = 10^{-6}$~km$^{-3}$) and environmental regimes, standard atmosphere, strong turbulence, and clear-sky LEO show up to a 275\% improvement in key generation rate and a 15\% increase in effective entanglement fidelity over existing adaptive methods. The framework achieves sub-linear path-length scaling with network size and remains robust for fading variances up to $\sigma_{\mathrm{fade}}=0.1$, demonstrating strong potential for future global quantum constellations.</p>

            <p>We analyze the recently observed breakdown of the integer quantum Hall effect in a two-dimensional electron gas embedded in a metallic split-ring resonator. By accounting for both the quantized vacuum field and electrostatic boundary modifications, we identify a mechanism that could potentially explain this breakdown in terms of non-chiral edge channels arising from electrostatic boundary effects. For experimentally relevant geometries, a minimal single-electron model of this mechanism predicts characteristic signatures and energy scales consistent with those observed in experiments. These predictions can be directly tested against alternative, purely vacuum-induced explanations to shed further light on the origin of this puzzling phenomenon.</p>

            <p>The polarization entanglement of photons emitted by semiconductor quantum dots is unavoidably limited by the spin fluctuations of the host lattice nuclei. To overcome this limitation, we develop a theory of entangled photon pair generation by a symmetric colloidal quantum dot mediated by a triplet exciton. We derive general analytical expressions for the concurrence as a function of the hyperfine interaction strength and show that it is intrinsically higher than that in conventional doublet-exciton systems such as self-assembled quantum dots. The concurrence sensitively depends on the shape anisotropy and the strain applied to a nanocrystal. In particular, we uncover a possibility of completely suppressing the detrimental effect of the hyperfine interaction due to the interplay between nanocrystal anisotropy and electron-hole exchange interaction. We argue that this represents the ultimate limit for the generation of entangled photon pairs by semiconductor quantum dots.</p>

            <p>Quasiparticle hybridization remains a major challenge to realizing and controlling exotic states of matter in existing quantum simulation platforms. We report the absence of hybridization for compact localized states (CLS) emerging in the chiral spin liquid described by the Yao-Kivelson model. The CLS form due to destructive quantum interference at fine-tuned coupling constants and populate perfectly flat quasiparticle bands on an effective kagome lattice. Using a formalism for general Majorana-hopping Hamiltonians, we derive exact expressions for CLS for various flux configurations and both for the topological and trivial phases of the model. In addition to finite-energy matter fermions with characteristic spin-spin correlations, we construct compact localized Majorana zero modes attached to $\pi$-flux excitations, which enable non-Abelian braiding of Ising anyons with minimal separation. Our results inform the quantum simulation of topologically ordered states of matter and open avenues for exploring flat-band physics in quantum spin liquids.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marcello Caleffi, Laura d'Avossa, Xu Han, Angela Sara Cacciapuoti</p>
            <p>The complementary features of different qubit platforms for computing and communicating impose an intrinsic hardware heterogeneity in any quantum network, where nodes, while processing and storing quantum information, must also communicate through quantum links. Indeed, one of the most promising hardware platforms at quantum node scale for scalable and fast quantum computing is the superconducting technology, which operates at microwave frequencies. Whereas, for communicating at distances of practical interest beyond few meters, quantum links should operate at optical frequencies. Therefore, to allow the interaction between superconducting and photonic technologies, a quantum interface, known as quantum transducer, able to convert one type of qubit to another is required. This paper aims to provide a tutorial treatise on the fundamental research challenges of quantum transduction. The tutorial is structured around a communications engineering framework, thereby shedding light on its fundamental role in quantum network design and deployment- a perspective often overlooked in existing literature. This framework allows us to categorize different transduction modalities and to reveal an unorthodox one where the transducer itself can act as an entanglement source. From this standpoint, it is possible to conceive different source-destination link archetypes, where transduction plays a crucial role in the communication performances. The analysis also translates the quantum transduction process into a proper functional block within a new communication system model for a quantum network.</p>

            <h2>Architecting Scalable Trapped Ion Quantum Computers using Surface Codes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Scott Jones, Prakash Murali (University of Cambridge)</p>
            <p>Trapped ion (TI) qubits are a leading quantum computing platform. Current TI systems have less than 60 qubits, but a modular architecture known as the Quantum Charge-Coupled Device (QCCD) is a promising path to scale up devices. There is a large gap between the error rates of near-term systems ($10^{-3}$ to $10^{-4}$) and the requirements of practical applications (below $10^{-9}$). To bridge this gap, we require Quantum Error Correction (QEC) to build logical qubits that are composed of multiple physical qubits. While logical qubits have been demonstrated on TI qubits, these demonstrations are restricted to small codes and systems. There is no clarity on how QCCD systems should be designed to implement practical-scale QEC. This paper studies how surface codes, a standard QEC scheme, can be implemented efficiently on QCCD-based systems. To examine how architectural parameters of a QCCD system can be tuned for surface codes, we develop a near-optimal topology-aware compilation method that outperforms existing QCCD compilers by an average of 3.8X in terms of logical clock speed. We use this compiler to examine how hardware trap capacity, connectivity and electrode wiring choices can be optimised for surface code implementation. In particular, we demonstrate that small traps of two ions are surprisingly ideal from both a performance-optimal and hardware-efficiency standpoint. This result runs counter to prior intuition that larger traps (20-30 ions) would be preferable, and has the potential to inform design choices for upcoming systems.</p>

While this holds true for macroscopic systems at equilibrium, here we show that, when the order of interactions between two identical thermalization channels is indefinite, an anomalous heat flow emerges, whereby heat can sometime flow from a colder entity to a hotter one. Taking advantage of this anomalous heat flow, we design a quantum Otto cycle with indefinite causal order, which not only achieves refrigeration but also generates work. The anomalous heat flow and the quantum Otto cycle are experimentally simulated in a photonic quantum setup, which provides a proof-of-principle demonstration of the theory.</p>

            <p>Temporal entanglement (TE) of an influence matrix (IM) has been proposed as a measure of complexity of simulating dynamics of local observables in a many-body system. Foligno et al. [Phys. Rev. X 13, 041008 (2023)] recently argued that the TE in chaotic 1d quantum circuits obeys linear (volume-law) scaling with evolution time. To reconcile this apparent high complexity of IM with the rapid thermalization of local observables, here we study the relation between TE, non-Markovianity, and local temporal correlations for chaotic quantum baths. By exactly solving a random-unitary bath model, and bounding distillable entanglement between future and past degrees of freedom, we argue that TE is extensive for low enough bath growth rate, and it reflects genuine non-Markovianity. This memory, however, is entirely contained in highly complex temporal correlations, and its effect on few-point temporal correlators is negligible. An IM coarse-graining procedure, reducing the allowed frequency of measurements of the probe system, results in a transition from volume- to area-law TE scaling. We demonstrate the generality of this TE transition in 1d circuits by analyzing the kicked Ising model analytically at dual-unitary points, as well as numerically away from them. This finding indicates that dynamics of local observables are fully captured by an area-law IM. We provide evidence that the compact IM MPS obtained via standard compression algorithms accurately describes local evolution.</p>

            <p>Physical Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) states are inherently noisy as ideal ones would require infinite energy. While this is typically considered as a deficiency to be actively corrected, this work demonstrates that imperfect GKP stabilizer states can be leveraged in order to apply non-Clifford gates using only linear optical elements. In particular, Gaussian operations on normalizable GKP states, combined with homodyne measurements, permit two key primitives: clean projection onto Pauli eigenstates in the normalizable GKP codespace, thereby implementing Clifford gates with high fidelity; and probabilistic projection of unmeasured modes onto non-Pauli eigenstates. These results demonstrate that normalizable GKP stabilizer states combined with Gaussian operations provide a practical framework for computational universality within the measurement-based model of quantum computation in a realistic continuous-variable setting.</p>

            <p>Quantum photonic networks require two distinct functionalities: bright single-photon sources and long-lived quantum memories. III-V semiconductor quantum dots excel as deterministic and coherent photon emitters, while rare-earth ions such as erbium (Er$^{3+}$) in crystalline oxides offer exceptional spin and optical coherence at telecom wavelengths. Combining these systems and their functionalities via direct epitaxy is challenging due to lattice mismatch and incompatible growth conditions. Here we demonstrate low-temperature pulsed laser deposition of Er$^{3+}$-doped TiO$_{2}$ thin films directly on GaAs and GaSb substrates. Controlled surface preparation with an arsenic cap and an oxygen-deficient buffer layer enables the growth of epitaxial anatase TiO$_{2}$ (001) at 390$^{o}$C with sub-300 pm surface roughness, while avoiding interface degradation. In contrast, high-temperature oxide desorption or growth temperatures drive the transition to rough, polycrystalline rutile film, as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. Minimal coincident interface area (MCIA) modeling explains the orientation-selective growth on GaAs and GaSb. Raman and cryogenic photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy verify the crystal phase and optical activation of Er$^{3+}$ ions. This multi-parameter growth strategy helps preserve III-V quantum dot functionality and yields smooth surfaces suitable for low-loss nanophotonic structures. Our results establish a materials platform for monolithically integrating rare-earth quantum memories with semiconductor photon sources, paving the way toward scalable hybrid quantum photonic chips.</p>

            <p>For single-parameter sensing, Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) probes achieve optimal quantum-enhanced precision across the unknown parameter range, solely relying on parameter-independent separable measurement strategies for all values of the unknown parameter. However, in the multiparameter setting, a single GHZ probe not only fails to achieve quantum advantage but also the corresponding optimal measurement becomes complex and dependent on the unknown parameters. Here, we provide a recipe for multiparameter sensing with GHZ probes using quantum error correction techniques by treating all but one unknown parameters as noise, whose effects can be corrected. This strategy restores the core advantage of single parameter GHZ-based quantum sensing, namely reaching optimally quantum-enhanced precision for all unknown parameter values while keeping the measurements separable and fixed. Specifically, given one shielded ancilla qubit per GHZ probe, our protocol extracts optimal possible precision for any probe size. While this optimal precision is shot-noise limited for a single GHZ probe, we recover the Heisenberg scaling through use of multiple complementary GHZ probes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the protocol with Bayesian estimation.</p>

            <p>Quantum state discrimination, alongside its other applications, has recently found use as a tool for witnessing generalised contextuality. In this article, we derive noncontextuality inequalities for both conclusive and inconclusive outcomes across various guessing strategies. For minimum- error discrimination, the advantage is in terms of the confidences of individual outcomes, while for unambiguous state discrimination, it is in terms of the average guessing probability. For maximum- confidence discrimination, we show that contextual advantages occur not only for the confidence but also their average, the guessing probability, as well as the inconclusive outcome rate. Our results unify the contextual advantages across all state discrimination schemes and figures of merit. We envisage that various quantum information applications based on state discrimination may offer advantages over non-contextual theories.</p>

            <p>Pure dephasing is the dominant leak mechanism in photonic cat qubits because its phase errors disrupt the parity protection, rendering the qubit vulnerable to energy relaxation. In this manuscript, we reveal that this dephasing mechanism conceals an interesting physical phenomenon: it induces \textit{asymmetric leakage} from the cat-state subspace, where even- and odd-parity cat states decay at different rates. This leak asymmetry enables the dynamics of the system to be described by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, thereby transforming the cat qubit into a platform with controllable gain and loss for probing non-Hermitian physics. Within this platform, we demonstrate the possibility to control the parity-time symmetry phase transition in a single cat qubit by adjusting its amplitude. Moreover, we couple two cat qubits to realize an entanglement phase transition induced by the exceptional point. Our work constructs a controllable non-Hermitian system simulator, overturning the conventional paradigm that treats dephasing as harmful noise.</p>

            <p>We introduce a quantum key distribution (QKD) primitive based on charge teleportation: by Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC) on an entangled many-body ground state, Alice's one-bit choice steers the sign of a local charge shift at Bob, which directly encodes the key bit. Relative to energy teleportation schemes, the charge signal is bit-symmetric, measured in a single basis, and markedly more robust to realistic noise and model imperfections. We instantiate the protocol on transverse-field Ising models, star-coupled and one-dimensional chain, obtain closed-form results for two qubits, and for larger systems confirm performance via exact diagonalization, circuit-level simulations, and a proof-of-principle hardware run. We quantify resilience to classical bit flips and local quantum noise, identifying regimes where sign integrity, and hence key correctness, is preserved. These results position charge teleportation as a practical, low-rate QKD primitive compatible with near-term platforms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ahmad Salmanogli, Hesam Zandi</p>
            <p>This study introduces a superconducting quantum chip architecture designed to simultaneously preserve entanglement and readout fidelity, addressing one of the key trade-offs in the development of scalable quantum hardware. In conventional quantum circuits, strong qubit qubit coupling enhances entanglement but often leads to undesired crosstalk, dephasing, and reduced measurement fidelity. To mitigate these effects, we propose a hybrid multiqubit configuration consisting of nine transmon qubits organized into interior and exterior groups, interconnected via a flux tunable qubit and a network of distributed resonators. The interior qubits along with tunable qubit form an entanglement core, while the exterior qubits operate in the dispersive regime under large detuning to enable readout. The degree of entanglement can be dynamically tuned by adjusting the coupling between the central tunable qubit and the interior qubits. The total Hamiltonian includes all significant coupling contributions, encompassing effective exchange interactions among interior and exterior qubits, as well as their mediated couplings through interface resonators. By numerically solving the complete Hamiltonian alongside the Lindblad master equation, the system dynamics are characterized, allowing evaluation of both spectroscopic features and separation fidelity. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed design maintains strong entanglement by creating the avoided-crossing region while sustaining measurement fidelity around 0.995 under realistic noise conditions. These findings confirm that entanglement strength and readout fidelity can be co-optimized within a single, reconfigurable architecture, establishing a viable route toward high-performance and scalable superconducting quantum processors.</p>

            <p>While geometric quantum gates are often theorized to possess intrinsic resilience to control errors by exploiting the global properties of evolution paths, this promise has not consistently translated into practical robustness. We present a streamlined framework for nonadiabatic geometric quantum gates (NGQGs) that incorporates additional auxiliary constraints to suppress dynamical contamination and achieve super-robust performance. Within this framework, we also design NGQGs using noncyclic paths, offering enhanced design flexibility. Implemented on superconducting transmon qubits, our scheme realizes high-fidelity single-qubit gates that are robust against Rabi amplitude error $\epsilon$, with infidelity scaling as $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^4)$, in contrast to the $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^2)$ behavior of conventional dynamical gates. We further analyze two-qubit NGQGs under parametric driving. Our results identify subtle limitations that compromise performance in two-qubit scenarios, underscoring the importance of phase compensation and waveform calibration. The demonstrated simplicity and generality of our super-robust NGQG scheme make it applicable across diverse quantum platforms.</p>

            <p>Local quantum coherence in a two-level system (TLS) is typically generated via time-dependent driving. However, it can also emerge autonomously from symmetry-breaking interactions between the TLS and its surrounding environment at a low temperature. Although such environments often consist of interacting atoms or spins, the role of interactions within the environment in generating the autonomous local coherence has remained unexplored. Here, we address this gap by analyzing an exactly solvable model, which comprises a target TLS coupled to $N$ interacting source TLSs that represent the environment, with the whole system being in thermal equilibrium. We show that the local coherence not only persists but can be enhanced at finite temperatures of the environment compared to the case of no inter-source interactions. The temperature dependence of the coherence bears signatures of a quantum phase transition, and our analytical results suggest strategies for its optimization. Our findings reveal generic properties of the autonomously generated quantum coherence and point to viable routes for observing the coherence at nonzero temperatures.</p>

In the past few years, certain protocols have been developed, but their physical realizations induces natural losses on the system mainly originated from coupling the photonic structures, setting a limit on the efficiency and maximal qubit number. In this paper, we examine a physical implementation of two specific protocols for generating distinct cluster states: a two-dimensional cluster state and a tree cluster state. Our approach leverages the unique properties of a quantum metasurface and its free space settings to implement two-qubit quantum-logic gates, namely CNOT, CZ, and E gates, with practical fidelities exceeding 0.9, and potential speed-up due to parallelism. In addition, we analyze these protocols fidelities for practical conditions of potential implementation experiments, such as thermal fluctuation of trapped atoms.</p>

            <h2>Neutral-atom quantum computation using multi-qubit geometric gates via adiabatic passage</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sinchan Snigdha Rej, Bimalendu Deb</p>
            <p>Adiabatic geometric phase gates offer enhanced robustness against fluctuations compared to con- ventional Rydberg blockade-based phase gates that rely on dynamical phase accumulation. We theoretically demonstrate two- and multi-qubit phase gates in a neutral atom architecture, relying on a double stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (double-STIRAP) pulse sequence that imprints a controllable geometric phase on the qubit systems. The system is designed in such a way that every atom is individually addressable, and moreover, no extra laser is required to be applied on the target atom while scaling up the system from two- to multi-qubit quantum gates. The gate fidelity has been numerically analyzed by changing the gate operation time, and we find that 98% to 99% fidelity can be achieved for gate time $\simeq$ 0.6 $\mu$s. We perform a systematic error analysis, which re- veals that our proposed gates can exhibit strong resilience against fluctuations in Rabi frequencies, finite blockade strength, and atomic position variations. These results establish our approach as a physically feasible and scalable pathway toward fault-tolerant quantum computation with neutral atoms. We simulate Grover's search algorithm for two-, three-, and four-qubit systems with high success probability and thereby demonstrate the utility and scalability of our proposed gates for quantum computation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benedikt Tissot, Soubhadra Maiti, Emil R. Hellebek, Anders Søndberg Sørensen</p>
            <p>Different quantum systems possess different favorable qualities. On the one hand, ensemble-based quantum memories are suited for fast multiplexed long-range entanglement generation. On the other hand, single-atomic systems provide access to gates for processing of information. Both of those can provide advantages for high-rate entanglement generation within quantum networks. We develop a hybrid architecture that takes advantage of these properties by combining trapped-ion nodes and nodes comprised of spontaneous parametric down conversion photon pair sources and absorptive memories based on rare-earth ion ensembles. To this end, we solve the central challenge of matching the different bandwidths of photons emitted by those systems in an initial entanglement-generation step. This enables the parallel execution of multiple probabilistic tasks in the initial stage. We show that our approach can lead to a significant speed-up for the fundamental task of creating ion-ion entanglement over hundreds of kilometers in a quantum network.</p>

            <p>We introduce quantum-enhanced memetic tabu search (QE-MTS), a non-variational hybrid algorithm that achieves state-of-the-art scaling for the low-autocorrelation binary sequence (LABS) problem. By seeding the classical MTS with high-quality initial states from digitized counterdiabatic quantum optimization (DCQO), our method suppresses the empirical time-to-solution scaling to $\mathcal{O}(1.24^N)$ for sequence length $N \in [27,37]$. This scaling surpasses the best-known classical heuristic $\mathcal{O}(1.34^N)$ and improves upon the $\mathcal{O}(1.46^N)$ of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm, achieving superior performance with a $6\times$ reduction in circuit depth. A two-stage bootstrap analysis confirms the scaling advantage and projects a crossover point at $N \gtrsim 47$, beyond which QE-MTS outperforms its classical counterpart. These results provide evidence that quantum enhancement can directly improve the scaling of classical optimization algorithms for the paradigmatic LABS problem.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vincent Gierisch, Wolfgang Mauerer</p>
            <p>Commercially available Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices now make small hybrid quantum-classical experiments practical, but many tools hide configuration or demand ad-hoc scripting. We introduce the Quantum Experiment Framework (QEF): A lightweight framework designed to support the systematic, hypothesis-driven study of quantum algorithms. Unlike many existing approaches, QEF emphasises iterative, exploratory analysis of evolving experimental strategies rather than exhaustive empirical evaluation of fixed algorithms using predefined quality metrics. The framework's design is informed by a comprehensive review of the literature, identifying principal parameters and measurement practices currently reported in the field. QEF captures all key aspects of quantum software and algorithm experiments through a concise specification that expands into a Cartesian product of variants for controlled large-scale parameter sweeps. This design enables rigorous and systematic evaluation, as well as precise reproducibility. Large sweeps are automatically partitioned into asynchronous jobs across simulators or cloud hardware, and ascertain full hyper-parameter traceability. QEF supports parameter reuse to improve overall experiment runtimes, and collects all metrics and metadata into a form that can be conveniently explored with standard statistical and visualisation software. By combining reproducibility and scalability while avoiding the complexities of full workflow engines, QEF seeks to lower the practical barriers to empirical research on quantum algorithms, whether these are designed for current NISQ devices or future error-corrected quantum systems.</p>

It is a key component to the implementation of CV quantum-information protocols and benefits from operating, by design, at room temperature. However, performing high-speed quantum information processing remains a major challenge, as conventional homodyne detectors often fail to sustain pulsed operation at high repetition rates due to electronic limitations. We present wideband homodyne detectors operating at near-infrared (NIR) and telecom wavelengths, with optimized performance at repetition rates up to 150 MHz. We demonstrate their performance by resolving the pulse-by-pulse structure of squeezed states of light at telecom wavelengths while preserving their spectral multimode properties.</p>

            <h2>Controlling Hong-Ou-Mandel antibunching via parity governed spectral shaping of biphoton states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mikhail Guselnikov, Alexei D. Kiselev, Andrei Gaidash, George Miroshnichenko, Anton Kozubov</p>
            <p>We investigate into experimentally detectable effects such as the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) bunching and antibunching. These regimes can be characterized using the symmetry degree parameter $D_S$ that enters the two-photon coincidence probability $P_{2c}=(1-D_S)/2$. In the case of HOM bunching (antibunching), $D_S$ is positive (negative). Though the symmetry degree can generally be expressed in terms of the difference between the contributions coming from the symmetric and antisymmetric parts of the biphoton joint spectral amplitude (JSA), $\psi(\omega_1,\omega_2)$, for a certain physically realizable class of the JSA, where $\psi(\omega_1,\omega_2)$ is proportional to the product of amplitudes $\varphi_1(\omega_1)\varphi_2(\omega_2)$ multiplied by a Gaussian shaped entangling factor, we find the sign of $D_S$ is primarily governed by the parity properties of the spectral function, $\varphi_{12}(\omega)=\varphi_1(\omega)\varphi_2^*(\omega)$. It is the even (odd) part of $\varphi_{12}=\varphi_{12}^{(+)}+\varphi_{12}^{(-)}$ that meets the parity condition $\varphi_{12}^{(+)}(\omega-\Omega)=\varphi_{12}^{(+)}(\Omega-\omega)$ ($\varphi_{12}^{(-)}(\omega-\Omega)=- \varphi_{12}^{(-)}(\Omega-\omega)$) to yield the positive (negative) contribution, $D_S^{(+)}$ ($-D_S^{(-)}$), to the symmetry degree parameter: $D_S=D_S^{(+)}-D_S^{(-)}$. We have shown that switching between the bunching and antibunching regimes can be realized using the experimentally accessible family of modulated biphoton states produced using the spectral phase modulation fine-tuned via the sub-nanometer scale variation of the path length. For this class of modulated states, the Schmidt number has been computed as a function of the modulation parameter. This dependence reveals the structure of narrow resonance peaks strongly correlated with the corresponding narrow dips of the symmetry degree where the HOM antibunching occurs.</p>

            <p>Interactions between quantum systems enable quantum gates, the building blocks of quantum information processing. In photonics, direct photon-photon interactions are too weak to be practically useful, so effective interactions are engineered with linear optics and measurement. A central challenge is to realize such interactions non-locally, i.e., between photons that remain spatially separated. We present experimental proposals for several essential non-local multiphoton quantum gates that act on spatially separated photons, in both qubit and high-dimensional qudit systems. All solutions were discovered by the AI-driven discovery system called PyTheus. Rather than using pre-shared entanglement or Bell state measurements, our gates use as a resource quantum indistinguishability by path identity - a technique that exploits coherent superpositions of the photon pair origins. While analyzing these solutions, we uncovered a new mechanism that mimics much of the properties of quantum teleportation, without shared entanglement or Bell state measurements. Technically, our results establish path indistinguishability as a practical resource for distributed quantum information processing; conceptually, they demonstrate how automated discovery systems can contribute new ideas and techniques in physics.</p>

            <p>In the search with wildcards problem [Ambainis, Montanaro, Quantum Inf.~Comput.'14], one's goal is to learn an unknown bit-string $x \in \{-1,1\}^n$. An algorithm may, at unit cost, test equality of any subset of the hidden string with a string of its choice. Ambainis and Montanaro showed a quantum algorithm of cost $O(\sqrt{n} \log n)$ and a near-matching lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$. Belovs [Comput.~Comp.'15] subsequently showed a tight $O(\sqrt{n})$ upper bound. We consider a natural generalization of this problem, parametrized by a subset $\cal{Q} \subseteq 2^{[n]}$, where an algorithm may test whether $x_S = b$ for an arbitrary $S \in \cal{Q}$ and $b \in \{-1,1\}^S$ of its choice, at unit cost. We show near-tight bounds when $\cal{Q}$ is any of the following collections: bounded-size sets, contiguous blocks, prefixes, and only the full set. All of these results are derived using a framework that we develop. Using symmetries of the task at hand we show that the quantum query complexity of learning $x$ is characterized, up to a constant factor, by an optimization program, which is succinctly described as follows: `maximize over all odd functions $f : \{-1,1\}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ the ratio of the maximum value of $f$ to the maximum (over $T \in \cal{Q}$) standard deviation of $f$ on a subcube whose free variables are exactly $T$.' To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first work to use the primal version of the negative-weight adversary bound (which is a maximization program typically used to show lower bounds) to show new quantum query upper bounds without explicitly resorting to SDP duality.</p>

            <h2>Krylov Complexity Meets Confinement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xuhao Jiang, Jad C. Halimeh, N. S. Srivatsa</p>
            <p>In high-energy physics, confinement denotes the tendency of fundamental particles to remain bound together, preventing their observation as free, isolated entities. Interestingly, analogous confinement behavior emerges in certain condensed matter systems, for instance, in the Ising model with both transverse and longitudinal fields, where domain walls become confined into meson-like bound states as a result of a longitudinal field-induced linear potential. In this work, we employ the Ising model to demonstrate that Krylov state complexity--a measure quantifying the spread of quantum information under the repeated action of the Hamiltonian on a quantum state--serves as a sensitive and quantitative probe of confinement. We show that confinement manifests as a pronounced suppression of Krylov complexity growth following quenches within the ferromagnetic phase in the presence of a longitudinal field, reflecting slow correlation dynamics. In contrast, while quenches within the paramagnetic phase exhibit enhanced complexity with increasing longitudinal field, reflecting the absence of confinement, those crossing the critical point to the ferromagnetic phase reveal a distinct regime characterized by orders-of-magnitude larger complexity and display trends of weak confinement. Notably, in the confining regime, the complexity oscillates at frequencies corresponding to the meson masses, with its power-spectrum peaks closely matching the semiclassical predictions.</p>

            <h2>Legal Entanglement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicholas Godfrey, Ted Sichelman</p>
            <p>Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon in which two physical systems are correlated in such a way that they appear to instantaneously affect one another, regardless of the distance between them. As commonly understood, Bell's Theorem famously demonstrates that any causal explanation of entanglement must discard either locality (the principle that nothing, including information, travels faster than light) or classical notions of realism (or both). Drawing on this concept, several legal scholars have metaphorically described 'entangled' legal concepts. For instance, if a state's highest court redefines the concept of 'foreseeability' in negligence law, this redefinition alters the concept of 'reasonable care' immediately in the eyes of the law. Godfrey (2024) is the first work to mathematically model entangled legal concepts, particularly in the context of legal interpretation. Here, we extend the quantification to the formulation and delineation of law (lawmaking) and the adjudication of law (judgment). In so doing, we connect legal entanglement to Sichelman's (2022) work on legal entropy, complexity, and the informational content of law. In addition to quantifying entanglement across various legal contexts, our approach provides broader insights. For example, it offers a more comprehensive analysis of the uses and limits of 'modularity' in law--specifically, the role legal boundaries (spatial or intangible) play in reducing information costs within legal systems. Moreover, we discuss how our model can improve theories of legal artificial intelligence. Finally, we explore the application of legal theory back to physics. If quantum physical entanglement operates analogously to legal entanglement, it requires discarding both locality and classical realism, though not in the manner commonly imagined.</p>

            <h2>Unified Effective Field Theory for Nonlinear and Quantum Optics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaochen Liu, Ken-Tye Yong</p>
            <p>Predicting phenomena that mix few-photon quantum optics with strong field nonlinear optics is hindered by the use of separate theoretical formalisms for each regime. We close this gap with a unified effective field theory valid for frequencies lower than the material-dependent cutoff set by the band gap, plasma frequency, or similar scale. The action couples the electromagnetic gauge field to vector polarisation modes. An isotropic potential generates the optical susceptibilities, while a higher-dimension axion-like term captures magnetoelectric effects; quantisation on the Schwinger-Keldysh contour with doubled BRST ghosts preserves gauge symmetry in dissipative media. One-loop renormalisation-group equations reproduce the measured dispersion of the third-order susceptibility from terahertz to near-visible frequencies after matching a single datum per material. Real-time dynamics solved with a matrix-product-operator engine yield two to four percent agreement with published results for GaAs polariton cavities, epsilon-near-zero indium-tin-oxide films and superconducting quarton circuits. The current formulation is limited to these 1-D geometries and sub-cut-off frequencies; higher-dimensional or above-cut-off phenomena will require additional degrees of freedom or numerical methods.</p>

            <p>Hydrides have long been considered promising candidates for achieving room-temperature superconductivity; however, the extremely high pressures typically required for high critical temperatures remain a major challenge in experiment. Here, we propose a class of high-Tc ambient-pressure superconductors with MH4 stoichiometry. These hydrogen-based compounds adopt the bcc PtHg4 structure type, in which hydrogen atoms occupy the one-quarter body-diagonal sites of metal lattices, with the metal atoms acting as chemical templates for hydrogen assembly. Through comprehensive first-principles calculations, we identify three promising superconductors, PtH4, AuH4 and PdH4, with superconducting critical temperatures of 84 K, 89 K, and 133 K, respectively, all surpassing the liquid-nitrogen temperature threshold of 77 K. The remarkable superconducting properties originate from strong electron-phonon coupling associated with hydrogen vibrations, which in turn arise from phonon softening in the mid-frequency range. Our results provide crucial insights into the design of high-Tc superconductors suitable for future experiments and applications at ambient pressure.</p>

In this work, we investigate the twist-three parton distribution functions, which encode quantum interference between quark-gluon-quark states, and for the first time, determine them directly from experimental data. The analysis combines observables described by collinear and transverse-momentum-dependent factorization theorems within a unified global fit, incorporating a complete leading-order QCD evolution at the twist-three level. The extracted distributions reveal a clear flavor-dependent patterns and distinct from zero at a statistically significant level ($2-3\sigma$). These findings provide the first quantitative evidence for quark-gluon-quark correlations within the proton, revealing its genuinely quantum nature and opening a new direction for precision studies of partonic correlations.</p>

            <p>Continuous particle exchange thermal machines require no time-dependent driving, can be realised in solid-state electronic devices, and miniaturised to nanometre scale. Quantum dots, providing a narrow energy filter and allowing to manipulate particle flow between the hot and cold reservoirs are at the heart of such devices. It has been theoretically shown that by mitigating passive heat flow, Carnot efficiency can be approached arbitrarily closely in a quantum dot heat engine, and experimentally, values of 0.7{\eta}C have been reached. However, for practical applications, other parameters of a thermal machine, such as maximum power, efficiency at maximum power, and noise - stability of the power output or heat extraction - take precedence over maximising efficiency. We explore the effect of internal microscopic dynamics of a quantum dot on these quantities and demonstrate that its performance as a thermal machine depends on few parameters - the overall conductance and three inherent asymmetries of the dynamics. These parameters will act as a guide to engineering the quantum states of the quantum dot, allowing to optimise its performance beyond that of the simplest case of a two-fold spin-degenerate transmission level.</p>

We address this by considering presheaf cohomologies of states and entanglement witnesses. Sheafification erases the global-from-local signature while leaving within-patch multipartite structure, captured by local entanglement groups introduced here. For smooth parameter families, the obstruction admits a differential-geometric representative obtained by pairing an appropriate witness field with the curvature of a natural unitary connection on the associated bundle of amplitudes. We also introduce a Quantum Entanglement Index (QEI) as an index-theoretic invariant of entangled states and explain its behavior. Finally, we outline a theoretical physics approach to probe these ideas in quantum many-body systems and suggest a possible entanglement-induced correction as an experimental target.</p>

            <p>Localization transitions represent a fundamental class of continuous phase transitions, yet they occur without any accompanying symmetry breaking. We resolve this by introducing the concept of dynamical translational symmetry (DTS), which is defined not by the Hamiltonian but by the long-time dynamics of local observables. Its order parameter, the time-averaged local translational contrast (TLTC), quantitatively diagnoses whether evolution restores or breaks translational equivalence. We demonstrate that the TLTC universally captures the Anderson localization transition, the many-body localization transition, and topological phase transitions, revealing that these disparate phenomena are unified by the emergent breaking of DTS. This work establishes a unified dynamical-symmetry framework for phases transitions beyond the equilibrium paradigm.</p>

            <p>We study a broad class of qudit stabilizer codes, termed $\mathbb{Z}_N$ bivariate-bicycle (BB) codes, arising either as two-dimensional realizations of modulated gauge theories or as $\mathbb{Z}_N$ generalizations of binary BB codes. Our central finding, derived from the polynomial representation, is that the essential topological properties of these $\mathbb{Z}_N$ codes can be determined by the properties of their $\mathbb{Z}_p$ counterparts, where $p$ are the prime factors of $N$, even when $N$ contains prime powers ($N = \prod_i p_i^{k_i}$). This result yields a significant simplification by leveraging the well-studied framework of codes with prime qudit dimensions. In particular, this insight directly enables the generalization of the algebraic-geometric methods (e.g., the Bernstein-Khovanskii-Kushnirenko theorem) to determine anyon fusion rules in the general qudit situation. Moreover, we analyze the model's symmetry-enriched topological order (SET) to reveal a quasi-fractonic behavior, resolving the anyon mobility puzzle in this class of models. We also present a computational algebraic method using Gröbner bases over the ring of integers to efficiently calculate the topological order and its SET properties.</p>

            <p>We investigate the local characteristics of the Fulling-Rindler vacuum for a massive Dirac field induced by a planar boundary moving with constant proper acceleration in $(D+1)$-dimensional flat spacetime. On the boundary, the field operator obeys the bag boundary condition. The boundary divides the right Rindler wedge into two separate regions, called RL and RR regions. In both these regions, the fermion condensate and the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the energy-momentum tensor are decomposed into two contributions. The first one presents the VEVs in the Fulling-Rindler vacuum when the boundary is absent and the second one is the boundary-induced contribution. For points away from the boundary, the renormalization is reduced to the one for the boundary-free geometry. The total VEVs are dominated by the boundary-free parts near the Rindler horizon and by the boundary-induced parts in the region near the boundary. For a massive field the boundary-free contributions in the fermion condensate and the vacuum energy density and effective pressures are negative everywhere. The boundary-induced contributions in the fermion condensate and the energy density are positive in the RL region and negative in the RR region. For a massless field the fermion condensate vanishes in spatial dimensions $D\geq 2$, while the VEV of the energy-momentum tensor is different from zero. This behavior contrasts with that of the VEVs in the Minkowski vacuum for the geometry of a boundary at rest relative to an inertial observer. In the latter case, the fermion condensate for a massless field is nonzero, while the VEV of the energy-momentum tensor becomes zero.</p>

            <h2>Path distributions for describing eigenstates of the harmonic oscillator and other 1-dimensional problems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Randall M. Feenstra</p>
            <p>The manner in which probability amplitudes of paths sum up to form wave functions of a harmonic oscillator, as well as other, simple 1-dimensional problems, is described. Using known, closed-form, path-based propagators for each problem, an integral expression is written that describes the wave function. This expression conventionally takes the form of an integral over initial locations of a particle, but it is re-expressed here in terms of a characteristic momentum associated with motion between the endpoints of a path. In this manner, the resulting expression can be analyzed using a generalization of stationary-phase analysis, leading to distributions of paths that exactly describe each eigenstate. These distributions are valid for all travel times, but when evaluated for long times they turn out to be real, non-negative functions of the characteristic momentum. For the harmonic oscillator in particular, a somewhat broad distribution is found, peaked at value of momentum that corresponds to a classical energy which in turn equals the energy eigenvalue for the state being described.</p>

            <p>Ground state preparation is a central application for quantum computers but remains challenging in practice. In this work, we quantitatively investigate the performance and gate counts of double-bracket quantum algorithms (DBQAs) for ground state preparation. We propose a practical strategy in which DBQAs refine initial state preparation circuits, and we compile them for Heisenberg chains using controlled-Z and single-qubit gates. Warm-started DBQAs consistently improve both the energy and ground-state fidelity relative to the initial states provided by variational ansätze, indicating that DBQAs offer an effective unitary synthesis method. To demonstrate compatibility with near-term hardware, we executed a proof-of-concept example on IBM devices. With error mitigation, we observed a statistically significant improvement over the corresponding warm-start circuit. Furthermore, numerical emulations for the same system size indicate that executing DBQAs on Quantinuum's hardware could achieve similar cost-function gains without requiring error mitigation. These findings suggest that DBQAs are a promising approach for enhancing ground-state approximations on near-term quantum devices.</p>

            <p>Quantum computing is an emerging field recognized for the significant speedup it offers over classical computing through quantum algorithms. However, designing and implementing quantum algorithms pose challenges due to the complex nature of quantum mechanics and the necessity for precise control over quantum states. Despite the significant advancements in AI, there has been a lack of datasets specifically tailored for this purpose. In this work, we introduce QCircuitBench, the first benchmark dataset designed to evaluate AI's capability in designing and implementing quantum algorithms using quantum programming languages. Unlike using AI for writing traditional codes, this task is fundamentally more complicated due to highly flexible design space. Our key contributions include: 1. A general framework which formulates the key features of quantum algorithm design for Large Language Models. 2. Implementations for quantum algorithms from basic primitives to advanced applications, spanning 3 task suites, 25 algorithms, and 120,290 data points. 3. Automatic validation and verification functions, allowing for iterative evaluation and interactive reasoning without human inspection. 4. Promising potential as a training dataset through preliminary fine-tuning results. We observed several interesting experimental phenomena: LLMs tend to exhibit consistent error patterns, and fine-tuning does not always outperform few-shot learning. In all, QCircuitBench is a comprehensive benchmark for LLM-driven quantum algorithm design, and it reveals limitations of LLMs in this domain.</p>

            <p>Warehouses play a central role in industrial logistics, functioning as critical hubs for storing and organizing inventory to support efficient production. Optimizing item allocation within these facilities is essential for reducing operational costs and improving delivery times. In this work, we address the optimization of inventory allocation in warehouses equipped with gravity-flow racks, which are designed for First In, First Out (FIFO) logistics, a configuration that inherently requires item reinsertions during retrieval operations to maintain flow continuity. These reinsertions, however, are time-consuming and costly, so minimizing their occurrence is crucial for operational efficiency. We propose an optimization strategy that simultaneously allocates multiple items, determining their placement across available shelves in a single decision step, explicitly accounting for every item and every shelf in the warehouse. By jointly evaluating multiple items, our approach enables globally optimized placement decisions, minimizing conflicts that arise in sequential methods. The problem is formulated as a QUBO, allowing implementation on both classical metaheuristics and quantum-hybrid solvers. We assess performance by comparing three classical optimization approaches - two variants of Simulated Annealing and the commercial solver Gurobi - with D-Wave's hybrid solver, which uniquely combines quantum annealing with classical metaheuristics. Complementing these benchmarks, a factory-scale simulation based on real operational data shows that considering larger batches of items in the allocation step can significantly reduce reinsertions, highlighting the practical potential of the proposed approach for industrial logistics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessandro Sinibaldi, Douglas Hendry, Filippo Vicentini, Giuseppe Carleo</p>
            <p>We introduce a classical computational method for quantum dynamics that relies on a global-in-time variational principle. Unlike conventional time-stepping approaches, our scheme computes the entire state trajectory over a finite time window by minimizing a loss function that enforces the Schrödinger's equation. The variational state is parametrized with a Galerkin-inspired ansatz based on a time-dependent linear combination of time-independent Neural Quantum States. This structure is particularly well-suited for exploring long-time dynamics and enables bounding the error with the exact evolution via the global loss function. We showcase the method by simulating global quantum quenches in the paradigmatic Transverse-Field Ising model in both 1D and 2D, uncovering signatures of ergodicity breaking and absence of thermalization in two dimensions. Overall, our method is competitive compared to state-of-the-art time-dependent variational approaches, while unlocking previously inaccessible dynamical regimes of strongly interacting quantum systems.</p>

            <p>The radiative linewidth of a two-level emitter (TLE) fundamentally limits the bandwidth available for quantum information processing. Despite its importance, no prior experiment has systematically examined how driving detuning affects the indistinguishability of photons scattered from a TLE - a parameter critical for photonic quantum computing. Here, we perform post-selective two-photon interference measurements between mutually detuned resonance fluorescence signals from an InAs quantum dot embedded in a micropillar cavity. At small mutual laser detunings (<=0.5GHz), the results are accurately described by the pure-state model [Nat. Commun. 16, 6453 (2025)], which treats all resonance-fluorescence photons as spontaneous emission. At larger detunings, we uncover an anomalous feature in the two-photon interference, where the normalised second-order correlation function under orthogonal polarisations yields g2_vert(0) < 0.5.</p>

            <h2>A quasi-particle picture for entanglement cones and horizons in analogue cosmology</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Carlos Fulgado-Claudio, Alejandro Bermudez</p>
            <p>Although particle production in curved quantum field theories (cQFTs) is key to our understanding of the early universe and black hole physics, its direct observation requires extreme conditions or unrealistic sensitivities. Recent progress in quantum simulators indicates that analogues of cosmological particle production can be observed in table-top experiments of cold atomic gases described by effective cQFTs. This promises a high degree of tunability in the synthesised curved spacetimes and, moreover, sets a clear roadmap to explore the interplay of particle production with other non-perturbative effects genuine to interacting QFTs. We hereby focus on the appearance of scalar and pseudo-scalar condensates for self-interacting Dirac fermions, and study how dynamical mass generation and spontaneous symmetry breaking affects real-time dynamics through the lens of entanglement. We use the entanglement contour (EC) to analyse the spatio-temporal structure of particle production, showing that a quasi-particle picture for the EC captures the cosmological horizon in accelerating spacetimes, while also being sensitive to the effect of different symmetry-breaking processes. In particular, we show that the combined breakdown of time-reversal symmetry due to the expanding spacetime, and parity due to a pseudo-scalar condensate, manifests through the structure of the light-cone-like propagation of entanglement.</p>

            <p>Rydberg atom arrays are a front-running platform for quantum processors. A major challenge threatening the scalability of this platform is the limited qubit connectivity due to the finite range of interatomic interactions. We explore an approach to realize dynamical all-to-all connectivity with the use of moving "messenger" atomic qubits that couple distant "computational" qubits held in a static tweezer array. We detail and compare four specific architectures based on this concept, each presenting distinct advantages and challenges tied to the efficacy of techniques used to couple, move and measure atomic qubits. We demonstrate that, though technologically demanding, the messenger-qubit paradigm opens a promising avenue to a truly scalable quantum processor based on Rydberg atoms.</p>

            <h2>Spontaneous irreversibility and objective thermalization in stochastic modifications of quantum theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aritro Mukherjee</p>
            <p>The deterministic and time-reversal symmetric dynamics of isolated quantum systems is at odds with irreversible equilibration observed in generic thermodynamic systems. Standard approaches at a reconciliation employ subjective restrictions on the space of observables or states and do not explain how a single macroscopic quantum system achieves equilibrium dynamically. We instead argue that quantum theory is an effective theory and requires corrections to accurately describe systems approaching the thermodynamic limit. We construct a stochastic extension of quantum theory which is practically identical to quantum mechanics for microscopic systems, yet allows single, isolated macroscopic systems to objectively thermalize, generically. A fluctuation-dissipation relation guarantees physical consistency including norm preservation, energy conservation, no superluminal signalling and the emergence of microcanonical equilibrium. We further discuss the inclusion of objective collapse, thereby realizing a falsifiable theory of spontaneous universal irreversibility which describes the quantum-to-classical crossover dynamics of macroscopic quantum systems. The dynamics of the model describe spontaneous symmetry breaking, quantum state reduction and objective quantum thermalization for individual systems while realizing an emergent hybrid statistics for ensembles which interpolates between Born's rules and microcanonical equilibrium.</p>

There are accidental degeneracies that take place at particular values of the box radius, some of which can be determined from the conditionally-solvable condition. Some of the roots stemming from the conditionally-solvable condition appear to converge towards the critical values of the model parameter. This analysis is facilitated by the Rayleigh-Ritz method that provides accurate eigenvalues.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sabina Drăgoi, Alberto Baiardi, Daniel J. Egger</p>
            <p>Combinatorial optimization problems have wide-ranging applications in industry and academia. Quantum computers may help solve them by sampling from carefully prepared Ansatz quantum circuits. However, current quantum computers are limited by their qubit count, connectivity, and noise. This is particularly restrictive when considering optimization problems beyond the quadratic order. Here, we introduce Ansatze based on an approximate quadratization of high-order Hamiltonians which do not incur a qubit overhead. The price paid is a loss in the quality of the noiseless solution. Crucially, this approximation yields shallower Ansatze which are more robust to noise than the standard QAOA one. We show this through simulations of systems of 8 to 16 qubits with variable noise strengths. Furthermore, we also propose a noise-aware Ansatz design method for quadratic optimization problems. This method implements only part of the corresponding Hamiltonian by limiting the number of layers of SWAP gates in the Ansatz. We find that for both problem types, under noise, our approximate implementation of the full problem structure can significantly enhance the solution quality. Our work opens a path to enhance the solution quality that approximate quantum optimization achieves on noisy hardware.</p>

            <p>Scalable classical simulation of quantum circuits is crucial for advancing quantum algorithm development and validating emerging hardware. This work focuses on performance enhancements through targeted low-level and NUMA-aware tuning on a single-node system, thereby not only advancing the efficiency of classical quantum simulations but also establishing a foundation for scalable, heterogeneous implementations that bridge toward noiseless quantum computing. Although few prior studies have reported similar hardware-level optimizations, such implementations have not been released as open-source software, limiting independent validation and further development. We introduce an open-source, high-performance extension to the QuEST state vector simulator that integrates state-of-the-art low-level and NUMA-aware optimizations for modern processors. Our approach emphasizes locality-aware computation and incorporates hardware-specific techniques including NUMA-aware memory allocation, thread pinning, AVX-512 vectorization, aggressive loop unrolling, and explicit memory prefetching. Experiments demonstrate substantial speedups--5.5-6.5x for single-qubit gate operations, 4.5x for two-qubit gates, 4x for Random Quantum Circuits (RQC), and 1.8x for the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT). Algorithmic workloads further achieve 4.3-4.6x acceleration for Grover and 2.5x for Shor-like circuits. These results show that systematic, architecture-aware tuning can significantly extend the practical simulation capacity of classical quantum simulators on current hardware.</p>

            <h2>Positive maps and extendibility hierarchies from copositive matrices</h2>

            <p>This work introduces and systematically studies a new convex cone of PCOP (pairwise copositive). We establish that this cone is dual to the cone of PCP (pairwise completely positive) and, critically, provides a complete characterization for the positivity of the broad class of covariant maps. We provide a way to lift matrices from the cone of COP to PCOP, thereby creating a powerful bridge between the theory of copositive forms and the positive maps. We develop an analogous framework for decomposable maps, introducing the cone PDEC. As a primary application of this framework, we define a novel family of linear maps $\Phi_t^G$ parameterized by a graph $G$ and a real parameter $t$. We derive exact thresholds on $t$ that determine when these maps are positive or decomposable, linking these properties to fundamental graph-theoretic parameters. This construction yields vast new families of positive indecomposable maps, for which we provide explicit examples derived from infinite classes of graphs, most notably rank 3 strongly regular graphs such as Paley graphs. On the dual side, we investigate the entanglement properties of large classes of (symmetric) states. We prove that the SOS hierarchies used in polynomial optimization to approximate the cone of copositive matrices correspond precisely to dual cones of witnesses for different levels of the PPT bosonic extendibility hierarchy}-. In the setting of the DPS hierarchy for separability, we construct a large family of optimal entanglement witnesses that are not certifiable by any level of the PPT bosonic extendibility hierarchy, answering a long standing open question from [DPS04]. Leveraging the duality, we also provide an explicit construction of (mixture of) bipartite Dicke states that are simultaneously entangled and $K_r$-PPT bosonic extendible for any desired hierarchy level $r \geq 2$ and local dimension $n \geq 5$.</p>

            <h2>Learning stabilizer structure of quantum states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Srinivasan Arunachalam, Arkopal Dutt</p>
            <p>We consider the task of learning a structured stabilizer decomposition of an arbitrary $n$-qubit quantum state $|\psi\rangle$: for $\epsilon > 0$, output a state $|\phi\rangle$ with stabilizer-rank $\textsf{poly}(1/\epsilon)$ such that $|\psi\rangle=|\phi\rangle+|\phi'\rangle$ where $|\phi'\rangle$ has stabilizer fidelity $< \epsilon$. We first show the existence of such decompositions using the recently established inverse theorem for the Gowers-$3$ norm of states [AD,STOC'25]. To learn this structure, we initiate the task of self-correction of a state $|\psi\rangle$ with respect to a class of states $S$: given copies of $|\psi\rangle$ which has fidelity $\geq \tau$ with a state in $S$, output $|\phi\rangle \in S$ with fidelity $|\langle \phi | \psi \rangle|^2 \geq \tau^C$ for a constant $C>1$. Assuming the algorithmic polynomial Frieman-Rusza (APFR) conjecture in the high doubling regime (whose combinatorial version was recently resolved [GGMT,Annals of Math.'25]), we give a polynomial-time algorithm for self-correction of stabilizer states. Given access to the state preparation unitary $U_\psi$ for $|\psi\rangle$ and its controlled version $cU_\psi$, we give a polynomial-time protocol that learns a structured decomposition of $|\psi\rangle$. Without assuming APFR, we give a quasipolynomial-time protocol for the same task. As our main application, we give learning algorithms for states $|\psi\rangle$ promised to have stabilizer extent $\xi$, given access to $U_\psi$ and $cU_\psi$. We give a protocol that outputs $|\phi\rangle$ which is constant-close to $|\psi\rangle$ in time $\textsf{poly}(n,\xi^{\log \xi})$, which can be improved to polynomial-time assuming APFR. This gives an unconditional learning algorithm for stabilizer-rank $k$ states in time $\textsf{poly}(n,k^{k^2})$. As far as we know, learning arbitrary states with even stabilizer-rank $2$ was unknown.</p>

Remarkably, it has been found that GME can be activated from multiple copies of biseparable quantum states, which do not possess GME individually. Here, we experimentally demonstrate unambiguous evidence of such GME activation from two copies of a biseparable three-qubit state in a trapped-ion quantum processor. These results not only challenge notions of quantum resources but also highlight the potential of using multiple copies of quantum states to achieve tasks beyond the capabilities of the individual copies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sojeong Park, Changhun Oh</p>
            <p>Sampling problems have emerged as a central avenue for demonstrating quantum advantage on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. However, physical noise can fundamentally alter their computational complexity, often making them classically tractable. Motivated by the recent success of matrix product state (MPS)-based classical simulation of Gaussian boson sampling (Oh et al., 2024), we extend this framework to investigate the classical simulability of other noisy quantum sampling models. We develop MPS-based classical algorithms for lossy boson sampling and noisy instantaneous quantum polynomial-time (IQP) sampling, both of which retain the tunable accuracy characteristic of the MPS approach through the bond dimension. Our approach constructs pure-state decompositions of noisy or lossy input states whose components remain weakly entangled after circuit evolution, thereby providing a means to systematically explore the boundary between quantum-hard and classically-simulable regimes. For boson sampling, we analyze single-photon, Fock, and cat-state inputs, showing that classical simulability emerges at transmission rates scaling as $O(1/\sqrt{N})$, reaching the known boundary of quantum advantage with a tunable and scalable method. Beyond reproducing previous thresholds, our algorithm offers significantly improved control over the accuracy-efficiency trade-off. It further extends the applicability of MPS-based simulation to broader classes of noisy quantum sampling models, including IQP circuits.</p>

SQDMetal enables accurate, efficient, and scalable simulations while remaining community-driven and free from commercial constraints. In this work, we validate SQDMetal through mesh convergence studies which benchmark SQDMetal against COMSOL Multiphysics and Ansys, demonstrating excellent agreement for both eigenmode and electrostatic (capacitance) simulations. Furthermore, we simulate superconducting resonators and transmon qubits, showing reasonable agreement with experimental measurements. SQDMetal also supports advanced capabilities, including Hamiltonian extraction via the energy participation ratio (EPR) method, incorporation of kinetic inductance effects, and full 3D modelling of device geometry for improved predictive accuracy. By unifying open-source tools into a single framework, SQDMetal lowers the barriers to entry for community members seeking to access high-performance simulations to assist in the design and optimization of their devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Manuel Calixto, Octavio Castaños</p>
            <p>Quantum information measures are proposed to analyze the structure of near-gap electronic states in HgTe quantum wells in a strip geometry $(x,y)\in (-\infty,\infty)\times [0,L]$ of finite width $L$. This allows us to establish criteria for distinguishing edge from bulk states in the topological insulator phase, including the transition region and cutoff of the wave number $k_x$ where edge states degenerate with bulk states. Qualitative and quantitative information on the near-gap Hamiltonian eigenstates, obtained by tight-binding calculations, is extracted from localization measures, like the inverse participation ratio (IPR), entanglement entropies of the reduced density matrix (RDM) to the spin sector --measuring quantum correlations due to the spin-orbit coupling (SOC)-- and from correlation functions for a $y$-space partition. The analysis of IPR and entanglement entropies in terms of spin, wave number $k_x$ and position $y$, evidences a spin polarization structure and spatial confinement of near-gap wave functions at the boundaries $y=0,L$ and low $k_x$, as correspond to helical edge states. IPR localization measures provide momentum $k_x$ cutoffs from which near-gap states are no longer localized at the boundaries of the sample and become part of the bulk. Below this $k_x$-point cutoff, the entanglement entropy and the spin probabilities of the RDM also capture the spin polarization structure of edge states and exhibit a higher variability compared to the relatively low entropy of the bulk state region. For a real-space partition, the edge-state region in momentum space exhibits lower correlation modulus, but higher correlation arguments, than the bulk-state region.</p>

Before recovering Fujikawa's expression for the chiral anomaly from the regularised measure, we explore the deeper number-theoretic structure underlying the ill-defined spectral sum associated with the anomaly, interpreting it through the lens of smoothed asymptotics. Our approach unifies two complementary perspectives: the analytic regularisation of Fujikawa and the topological characterisation given by the Atiyah-Singer index theorem. We further investigate how the measure transforms under changes to the regularisation scale and derive a function $\iota_E(\Lambda)$ that encodes this dependence, showing how its Mellin moments govern the appearance of divergences. Finally, we comment on the conceptual relationship between the regularised measure, $\eta$ regularisation, and the generalised Schwinger proper-time formalism, with a particular focus on the two-dimensional Schwinger model.</p>

            <h2>Systematic construction of asymptotic quantum many-body scar states and their relation to supersymmetric quantum mechanics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Masaya Kunimi, Yusuke Kato, Hosho Katsura</p>
            <p>We develop a systematic method for constructing asymptotic quantum many-body scar (AQMBS) states. While AQMBS states are closely related to quantum many-body scar (QMBS) states, they exhibit key differences. Unlike QMBS states, AQMBS states are not energy eigenstates of the Hamiltonian, making their construction more challenging. We demonstrate that, under appropriate conditions, AQMBS states can be obtained as low-lying gapless excited states of a parent Hamiltonian, which has a QMBS state as its ground state. Furthermore, our formalism reveals a connection between QMBS and supersymmetric (SUSY) quantum mechanics. The QMBS state can be interpreted as a SUSY-unbroken ground state.</p>

            <h2>Effective Quantum Gravitational Collapse in Metric Variables: The $\barμ$ Scheme</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> L. Boldorini, G. Montani</p>
            <p>We study, using the metric variables, how an effective theory for the Oppenheimer-Snyder gravitational collapse can be built with the $\bar{\mu}$ scheme from Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG). The collapse is analyzed for both the flat and spherical models. In both scenarios the effective theory make possible to avoid the formation of the singularity. The source of this is found in the presence of a negative pressure term inside the stress-energy tensor of the gravitational field. This pressure is analyzed and is concluded that the effective polymer model is the reason why the negative pressure appears. A characterization of the solutions for both models is also carried out, showing that the collapse is altered and avoided in favor of a transition from a black hole state to a white hole one, transition that occurs when the collapse has reached a Planckian regime.</p>

            <h2>Symmetry Sectors in Chord Space and Relational Holography in the DSSYK</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sergio E. Aguilar-Gutierrez</p>
            <p>In holography, gauging symmetries of the boundary theory leads to important modifications in the bulk. In this work, we study constraints to gauge symmetry sectors in the chord Hilbert space of the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) with matter, and we connect them to different proposals of its bulk dual. These sectors include chord parity symmetry, corresponding to End-Of-The-World (ETW) branes and Euclidean wormholes in sine dilaton gravity; and relative time-translations in a doubled DSSYK model (resulting from a single DSSYK with an infinitely heavy matter chord) used in de Sitter holography. We define and evaluate partition functions and thermal correlation functions of the ETW brane and Euclidean wormhole systems in the boundary theory. We deduce the holographic dictionary by matching geodesic lengths in the bulk with the spread complexity of the parity-gauged DSSYK. The Euclidean wormholes of fixed size are perturbatively stable, and their baby universe Hilbert space is non-trivial only when matter is added. We conclude studying the constraints in the path integral of the doubled DSSYK. We derive the gauge invariant operator algebra of one of the DSSYKs dressed to the other one and discuss its holographic interpretation.</p>

            <h2>A Conservative Theory of Semiclassical Gravity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francisco Pipa</p>
            <p>We argue that semiclassical gravity can be made consistent by assuming that quantum systems source or are classically affected by a gravitational field only when they undergo certain non-gravitational interactions that give rise to environment-induced decoherence. When systems are not affected by this decoherence-inducing process, they do not source a gravitational field, and the expectation value of their stress-energy tensor does not enter the semiclassical equations describing the gravitational field in a region. In the absence of these interactions in a region, spacetime may be flat. We argue that this can be tested by investigating the gravitational field sourced by quasi-isolated systems and the absence of gravity-mediated entanglement in the Bose-Marletto-Vedral (BMV) experiment, providing distinct predictions. We propose a possible kind of decoherence-inducing interactions that give rise to gravity, which involve chains of causally ordered non-gravitational localized interactions between quantum systems modeled via decoherence and test functions that we call Stable Determination Chains (SDCs). SDCs obey conditions that aim to address the measurement problem and allow for a conservative theory of gravity. It is conservative because it does not need to modify the fundamental equations of quantum theory, unlike spontaneous and gravity-induced collapse approaches to semiclassical gravity, and without invoking relationalism. Furthermore, it does not appeal to nonlocal, retrocausal, or superdeterministic hidden variables. We argue that these SDCs provide additional benefits, such as a semiclassical estimate of the value of the cosmological constant, the prediction of a time-varying cosmological constant that weakens with time, in agreement with some of the recent evidence, and a proposal about how SDCs give rise to gravity.</p>

            <h2>Resonant Valance Bond Ground States on Corner-sharing Lattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhao Zhang, Cecilie Glittum</p>
            <p>The Hubbard model in the $U\to\infty$ limit has recently been shown to have resonant valence bond (RVB) ground states on the corner-sharing sawtooth and pyrochlore lattices in the dilute doping limit of a single vacancy. The two results were obtained by different approaches which do not apply to one another. We make the first step towards unifying them by studying the quasi-1D lattice of a pyrochlore stripe, where all corners are not shared between two tetrahedra, and the valence bond configurations are not fixed by the location of the vacancy. The energy level ordering of irreducible representations of each tetrahedron shows that a chain of them has exponentially degenerate partial RVB or dimer-monomer ground states where each tetrahedron hosts one spin-$1/2$ monomer and one spin-$0$ dimer. The exact ground states in the infinitely long chain limit are analytically solved by introducing basis transformations between local Hilbert spaces of neighboring tetrahedra, and its energy agrees with the extrapolation of numerical exact diagonalization results of finite sized systems.</p>

            <p>The study of many-body localized (MBL) phases intrinsically links spectral properties with eigenstate characteristics: localized systems exhibit Poisson level statistics and area-law entanglement entropy, while ergodic systems display volume-law entanglement and follow random matrix theory predictions, including level repulsion. Here, we introduce the interacting Anderson Quantum Sun model, which significantly deviates from these conventional expectations. In addition to standard localized and ergodic phases, we identify a regime that exhibits volume-law entanglement coexisting with intermediate spectral statistics. We also identify another nonstandard regime marked by Poisson level statistics, sub-volume entanglement growth, and rare-event-dominated correlations, indicative of emerging ergodic instabilities. These results highlight unconventional routes of ergodicity breaking and offer fresh perspectives on how Anderson localization may be destabilized.</p>

We show that the anisotropy parameter of the {\it XXZ} model can be tuned by applying a magnetic field and, in particular, that it changes drastically near the Förster resonance points. Based on this result, we propose experimental realizations of spin-1/2 and spin-1 Heisenberg-type quantum spin models in Rydberg atom quantum simulators, without relying on Floquet engineering. Our results provide guidance for future experiments of Rydberg atom quantum simulators and offer insight into quantum many-body phenomena emerging in the Heisenberg model.</p>

            <p>Hyperon-antihyperon pairs produced in high-energy electron-positron annihilation are promising systems for the study of quantum information properties. In this work, we make an analysis of two types of quantum correlations, the quantum steering and discord, in hyperon-antihyperon systems produced in electron-positron annihilation based on the $X$-shaped spin density matrix. The behaviors of these quantum correlations differ from those in elementary particle-antiparticle systems such as the top quark and tau lepton due to the polarization effect. The hierarchy of quantum correlations is examined and partially confirmed in hyperon-antihyperon systems: $ \textrm{Bell Nonlocality} \subset \textrm{Steering} \subset \textrm{Entanglement} \subset \text{Discord}$. The loopholes and quantum decoherence effect are also discussed in our work.</p>

            <p>Recent advances in scaling up spin-based quantum processors have revealed unanticipated issues related to thermal effects. Microwave pulses required to manipulate and read the qubits are found to overheat the spins environment, which unexpectedly induces Larmor frequency shifts, reducing thereby gate fidelities. In this study, we shine light on these elusive thermal effects, by experimentally characterizing the temperature dependence of the Larmor frequency for a single hole spin in silicon. Our results unambiguously reveal an electrical origin underlying the thermal susceptibility, stemming from the spin-orbit-induced electric susceptibility. We perform an accurate modeling of the spin electrostatic environment and gyromagnetic properties, allowing us to pinpoint electric dipoles as responsible for these frequency shifts, that unfreeze as the temperature increases. Surprisingly, we find that the thermal susceptibility can be tuned with the magnetic field angle and can even cancel out, unveiling a sweet spot where the hole spin is rendered immune to thermal effects. These findings bear important implications for optimizing spin-based quantum processors fidelity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bowen Ouyang, Pratik Rath</p>
            <p>Previous work on Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity has shown that, at low temperatures, the annealed entropy becomes negative and departs from the quenched entropy. From the perspective of the random-matrix theory (RMT) dual of JT gravity, this effect is encoded in the continuous spectrum at the spectral edge that is universally described by the Airy model. At low temperature, the quenched entropy exhibits a power law dependence determined by the symmetry class of the RMT ensemble. Here we study the same question in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model which possesses much more structure than RMT. Through numerical simulations, we find that the level spacing statistics of the SYK model match the relevant RMT ensembles even near the spectral edge, thus leading to an agreement with the RMT prediction for the power-law behaviour of the quenched entropy at low temperatures. We also show similar effects in supersymmetric wormholes filled with matter, which is modeled by the $\mathcal N = 2$ supersymmetric SYK model. Numerically extracting the spectral edge properties of the BPS operators allows us to compute the quenched entanglement entropy of the wormhole in the large particle number limit.</p>

A theoretical and numerical framework based on the Kitaev-Heisenberg Hamiltonian is developed to model spin interactions in $Li_2IrO_3$. Here, the existence of topological zero-energy states is demonstrated, and their signatures in the edge-localized spectral weight are identified. A device concept based on this material is also proposed with potential industrial applications in spintronics, magnetic field sensing, and topological quantum memory.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryohei Kobayashi, Guanyu Zhu, Po-Shen Hsin</p>
            <p>A fundamental problem in fault-tolerant quantum computation is the tradeoff between universality and dimensionality, exemplified by the the Bravyi-König bound for $n$-dimensional topological stabilizer codes. In this work, we extend topological Pauli stabilizer codes to a broad class of $n$-dimensional Clifford hierarchy stabilizer codes. These codes correspond to the $(n+1)$D Dijkgraaf-Witten gauge theories with non-Abelian topological order. We construct transversal non-Clifford gates through automorphism symmetries represented by cup products. In 2D, we obtain the first transversal non-Clifford logical gates including T and CS for Clifford stabilizer codes, using the automorphism of the twisted $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$ gauge theory (equivalent to $\mathbb{D}_4$ topological order). We also combine it with the just-in-time decoder to fault-tolerantly prepare the logical T magic state in $O(d)$ rounds via code switching. In 3D, we construct a transversal logical $\sqrt{\text{T}}$ gate in a non-Clifford stabilizer code at the third level of the Clifford hierarchy, located on a tetrahedron corresponding to a twisted $\mathbb{Z}_2^4$ gauge theory. Due to the potential single-shot code-switching properties of these codes, one could achieve the 4th level of Clifford hierarchy with an $O(d^3)$ space-time overhead, avoiding the tradeoff observed in 2D. We propose a conjecture extending the Bravyi-König bound to Clifford hierarchy stabilizer codes, with our explicit constructions providing an upper bound of spatial dimension $(N-1)$ for achieving the logical gates in the $N^\text{th}$-level of Clifford hierarchy.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zahar Sayapin, Daniil Rabinovich, Nikita Korolev, Kirill Lakhmanskiy</p>
            <p>Increasing the utility of currently available Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices requires developing efficient methods to mitigate hardware errors, taking into account the constraints of these devices such as medium number of qubits and limited connectivity between them. In this work we propose a novel Cyclic Layout Permutations based Zero Noise Extrapolation (CLP-ZNE) protocol for such a task. The method leverages the inherent non-uniformity of gate errors in NISQ hardware and exploits symmetries of quantum circuits with one-dimensional connectivity to extrapolate the expectation value, averaged over cyclic circuit layout permutations, to the level of zero noise. In contrast to the previous layout permutation based approaches, for $n$ qubit circuit CLP-ZNE requires measurements of only $O(n)$ different circuit layouts to reconstruct the noiseless expected value. When benchmarked against noise channels modeling the IBM Torino quantum computer, the method reduces a typical expectation value error by an order of magnitude, depending on the protocol specifications. By employing a noise model derived from real hardware specifications, including both depolarizing and $T_1/T_2$ relaxation processes, these results give evidence for the applicability of CLP-ZNE to present-day NISQ processors.</p>

            <p>Classical shadows provide a versatile framework for estimating many properties of quantum states from repeated, randomly chosen measurements without requiring full quantum state tomography. When prior information is available, such as knowledge of symmetries of states and operators, this knowledge can be exploited to significantly improve sample efficiency. In this work, we develop three classical shadow protocols tailored to systems with local (or gauge) symmetries to enable efficient prediction of gauge-invariant observables in lattice gauge theory models which are currently at the forefront of quantum simulation efforts. For such models, our approaches can offer exponential improvements in sample complexity over symmetry-agnostic methods, albeit at the cost of increased circuit complexity. We demonstrate these trade-offs using a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory, where a dual formulation enables a rigorous analysis of resource requirements, including both circuit depth and sample complexity.</p>

A central advantage of this approach, dubbed stabilized analytic continuation (SAC), is its robustness to statistical noise arising from finite repetitions of a quantum experiment, making it well-suited to realistic quantum hardware. As a demonstration, we use SAC to estimate the von Neumann entanglement entropy of a numerically simulated quenched Néel state from Rényi entropies estimated via the randomized measurement protocol. We then apply the method to experimental Rényi data from a trapped-ion quantum simulator, extracting subsystem von Neumann entropies at different evolution times. Finally, we briefly note that the SAC framework is readily generalizable to obtain other nonlinear diagnostics, such as the logarithmic negativity and Rényi relative entropies.</p>

            <p>Correlation self-testing of quantum theory involves identifying a task or set of tasks whose optimal performance can be achieved only by theories that can realise the same set of correlations as quantum theory in every causal structure. Following this approach, previous work has ruled out various classes of generalised probabilistic theories whose joint state spaces have a certain regularity in the sense of a (discrete) rotation symmetry of the bipartite state spaces. Here we consider theories whose bipartite state spaces lack this regularity. We form them by taking the convex hull of all the local states and a finite number of non-local states. We show that a criterion of compositional consistency is needed in such theories: for a measurement effect to be valid, there must exist at least one measurement that it is part of. This goes beyond previous consistency criteria and corresponds to a strengthening of the no-restriction hypothesis. We show that quantum theory outperforms these theories in a task called the adaptive CHSH game, which shows that they can be ruled out experimentally. We further show a connection between compositional consistency and Tsirelson's bound.</p>

These can become entangled upon scattering, but how much entanglement can be created in this process? Here we address this question with fully coherent calculations of bipartite scattering in three-dimensional space, quantifying entanglement by the inverse of the single particle purity. We show that the standard plane-wave description of scattering fails to capture the entanglement properties, due to the essential role of quantum uncertainty in the initial state. For a more realistic description of a scattering setup and narrow initial momentum dispersion, we find the entanglement to scale linearly with the scattering cross section, including strong enhancement close to shape resonances. We discuss how the generation of motional entanglement can be detected in experiments. Our results open the way to probing and eventually using entanglement in quantum collisions.</p>

            <p>Achieving high-fidelity single- and two-qubit gates is essential for executing arbitrary digital quantum algorithms and for building error-corrected quantum computers. We propose a theoretical framework for implementing quantum gates using frequency- and amplitude-modulated microwave control, which extends conventional amplitude modulation by introducing frequency modulation as an additional degree of control. Our approach operates on fixed-frequency qubits, converting the need for qubit frequency tunability into drive frequency modulation. Using Floquet theory, we analyze and design these drives for optimal fidelity within specified criteria. Our framework spans adiabatic to nonadiabatic gates within the Floquet framework, ensuring broad applicability across gate types and control schemes. Using typical transmon qubit parameters in numerical simulations, we demonstrate a universal gate set-including the X, Hadamard, phase, and CZ gates-with control error well below 0.1% and gate times of 25-40 ns for single-qubit operations and 125-135 ns for two-qubit operations. Furthermore, we show an always-on CZ gate tailored for driven qubits, which has gate times of 80-90 ns.</p>

            <p>Induced-coherence interferometry, first introduced in the Zou-Wang-Mandel (ZWM) setup, enables retrieval of object information from the interference pattern of light that never interacted with the object. This scheme relies on two identically correlated photon pairs and the absence of "which-way" information about the photons illuminating the object to induce coherence in their companions. In previous studies, the effect of thermal background on the ZWM interferometer was considered; here we explicitly include background noise and analyze the interference visibility in both low- and high-gain regimes, revealing how thermal photons introduce an incoherent offset that lowers the observed interference contrast. We show that the visibility can be restored either by optimal attenuation or by extending the geometry to a three-SPDC configuration. Furthermore, we demonstrate that introducing heralded detection removes the detrimental effect of thermal background noise, restoring high-contrast interference fringes.</p>

            <p>Molecular spin systems are promising candidates for quantum information processing and nanoscale sensing, yet their characterization at room temperature remains challenging due to fast spin decoherence. In this work, we use $T_1$ relaxometry of shallow nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond to probe the electron spin ensemble of a polycrystalline copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) thin film. In addition to unequivocally identifying the NV-CuPc interaction thanks to its hyperfine spectrum, we further extract key parameters of the CuPc spin ensemble, including its correlation time and local lattice orientation, that cannot be measured in bulk electron resonance experiments. The analysis of our experimental results confirms that electron-electron interactions dominate the decoherence dynamics of CuPc at room temperature. Additionally, we demonstrate that the CuPc-enhanced NV relaxometry can serve as a robust method to estimate the NV depth with $\sim1$~nm precision. Our results establish NV centers as powerful probes for molecular spin systems, providing insights into molecular qubits, spin bath engineering, and hybrid quantum materials, and offering a potential pathway toward their applications such as molecular-scale quantum processors and spin-based quantum networks.</p>

For small squeezing parameters, the resulting two-mode states possess higher entanglement than pure two-mode squeezed vacuum states. We also propose a linear-optical heralding scheme that approximates this superposition of oppositely squeezed states without requiring strong Kerr nonlinearities.

            <h2>Quantum phase transition in the anisotropic Rabi model induced by parametric amplification</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuan Qiu, Ke-Xiong Yan, Jun-Hao Lin, Jie Song, Ye-Hong Chen, Yan-Xia</p>
            <p>In this manuscript, we analyze the mechanism of the superradiant phase transition in the anisotropic Rabi model under the classical oscillator limit using the pattern picture. By expanding the anisotropic Rabi model Hamiltonian in operator space, we obtained three patterns, and we find that the phase transition arises from the competition between patterns. The difficulty in achieving the classical oscillator limit motivates our investigation into the quantum phase transition within a parametrically-driven Jaynes-Cummings model. This parametrically-driven Jaynes-Cummings model can reproduce the dynamics of a ultrastrong-coupling anisotropic Rabi model in a squeezed-light frame. According to the eigenenergies and eigenstates of the normal and superradiant phases of this equivalent anisotropic Rabi model, we find that the excitation energy of the normal phase and the superradiant phase vanishes at the critical point. The photon number becomes infinite beyond the critical point. These results indicate that the system undergoes a superradiant phase transition at the critical point.</p>

            <h2>Thermodynamic Probes of Multipartite Entanglement in Strongly Interacting Quantum Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Harsh Sharma, Sampriti Saha, A. S. Majumdar, Manik Banik, Himadri Shekhar Dhar</p>
            <p>Quantifying multipartite entanglement in quantum many-body systems and hybrid quantum computing architectures is a fundamental yet challenging task. In recent years, thermodynamic quantities such as the maximum extractable work from an isolated system (the ergotropy) have allowed for entanglement measures that are operationally more accessible. However, these measures can be restrictive when applied to systems governed by Hamiltonians with strong collective or interparticle interactions. Motivated by advances in quantum simulators, we propose a framework that circumvents these restrictions by evaluating global and local ergotropy either through controlled quenching of interactions or by measuring suitable local observables only. We show that this formalism allows us to correctly estimate genuine multipartite entanglement in both stationary and time-evolved states of systems with strong interactions, including parametrized quantum states simulated on a quantum circuit with varying circuit depth and noise. We demonstrate its applicability to realistic physical models, namely, the Tavis-Cummings model, the three-level Dicke model, and the transverse-field Ising model, highlighting its potential as a versatile tool for characterizing entanglement in near-term quantum simulators.</p>

            <h2>Integration of quantum dots at the tips of single plasmonic bipyramid nanoantennas for strong coupling at room temperature</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kseniia Mamaeva, Hodjat Haijan, Carolyn Elliott, Hannah Killeen, Teodora Faraone, Larisa Florea, Colm Delaney, A. Louise Bradley</p>
            <p>Achieving strong coupling between excitons of colloidal semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) and localized surface plasmon polaritons (LSPs) is critical for advanced room-temperature quantum emitter and sensing applications. A key challenge is to have precise control of the emitters position with respect to an individual plasmonic nanostructure. Here, we present room temperature strong coupling between QDs and a single gold nano-bipyramid (BPs). The selection of the bipyramid plasmonic nanocavity offers access to a single hotspot with a very small mode volume. The localization of QDs at a single hotspot is achieved via plasmon-triggered two-photon polymerization. This technique exploits the enhanced electric field at the BP tip to selectively polymerize a photosensitive QD-containing formulation. Room-temperature scattering spectra of a 3-QD-BP system reveal Rabi splitting of 349.3 meV and a coupling strength of 175.68 meV. The with distinct anti-crossing behavior is confirmed by simulations. This approach simplifies QD integration for strong coupling systems compared to previous methods. These results indicate a scalable platform for solid-state quantum technologies with colloidal QDs, enabling explora-tion of exciton-plasmon interactions and further advance-ment of applications in quantum optics and quantum sensing under ambient conditions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yiquan Yang, Xiaolong Hu, Wei Du, Shuhe Wu, Peiyu Yang, Guzhi Bao, Weiping Zhang</p>
            <p>Chiral discrimination of enantiomeric biomolecules is vital in chemistry, biology, and medicine. Conventional methods, relying on circularly polarized light, face weak chiroptical signals and potential photodamage. Despite extensive efforts to improve sensitivity under low-photon exposure, classical chiral probes remain fundamentally bounded by the shot-noise limit due to quantum fluctuations. To beat these limitations, we demonstrate quantum-elevated chiral discrimination using continuous-variable polarization-entangled states as moderate-photon-flux, high-sensitivity, quantum-noise-squeezed chiral probes. We achieve a 5 dB improvement beyond the SNL in distinguishing L- and D-amino acids in liquid phase. This non-destructive, biocompatible protocol enables high-sensitivity chiral analysis, with broad implications for drug development, biochemical research, environmental monitoring, and asymmetric synthesis.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guido Ladenburger, Finn Schmolke, Eric Lutz</p>
            <p>First-passage phenomena play a fundamental role in classical stochastic processes. We here exactly solve a quantum first-passage time problem for quantum diffusion driven by measurement noise, a generalization of classical Brownian motion. Such continuous monitoring may trap the measured quantum system in a decoherence-free subspace, a fraction of the available state space that is isolated from the surroundings, and thus plays an important role in quantum information science. We analytically determine the first-passage time distribution, whose form neither depends on the system Hamiltonian nor on the measurement operator, and is therefore universal. These results provide a general framework to investigate the first-passage statistics of diffusive quantum trajectories.</p>

            <p>Error mitigation is essential for the practical implementation of quantum algorithms on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. This work explores and extends Clifford Data Regression (CDR) to mitigate noise in quantum chemistry simulations using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). Using the H$_4$ molecule with the tiled Unitary Product State (tUPS) ansatz, we perform noisy simulations with the ibm torino noise model to investigate in detail the effect of various hyperparameters in CDR on the error mitigation quality. Building on these insights, two improvements to the CDR framework are proposed. The first, Energy Sampling (ES), improves performance by selecting only the lowest-energy training circuits for regression, thereby further biasing the sample energies toward the target state. The second, Non-Clifford Extrapolation (NCE), enhances the regression model by including the number of non-Clifford parameters as an additional input, enabling the model to learn how the noisy-ideal mapping evolves as the circuit approaches the optimal one. Our numerical results demonstrate that both strategies outperform the original CDR.</p>

            <h2>Atom-Field Non-Markovian Dynamics in Open and Dissipative Systems: An Efficient Memory-Kernel Approach Linked to Dyadic Greens Function and CEM Treatments</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hyunwoo Choi, Jisang Seo, Weng C. Chew, Dong-Yeop Na</p>
            <p>In this work, we present a numerical framework for modeling single photon emission from a two level system in open and dissipative systems beyond the Markovian approximation. The method can be readily integrated into standard computational electromagnetic (CEM) solvers such as finite difference time domain (FDTD) and finite element method (FEM). We numerically verify the completeness of boundary and medium assisted modes in the modified Langevin noise formalism by reconstructing the imaginary part of the dyadic Greens function through modal expansion in three dimensions. This reconstruction enables a first principles description of atom field interaction via the multi mode Jaynes Cummings model in open and dissipative environments. Within the single excitation manifold, we show that the memory kernel of a two level system is determined by the imaginary part of the Greens function, implying that radiative modes alone govern the relevant dynamics. The proposed framework thus provides a Greens function based approach for describing atomic population and single photon dynamics, directly compatible with Maxwell solvers. We then present concrete strategies for implementing our method in both FDTD and FEM frameworks, demonstrating its practical applicability. We further verify numerical results for a lossy Lorentz Drude type mirror, including both the case of a TLS near a finite sized metallic mirror and that of a TLS centered in a Fabry Perot cavity. This work establishes a rigorous foundation for incorporating quantum emitter dynamics into computational electromagnetics, thereby extending classical solvers toward quantum light matter interactions.</p>

            <p>Creation and manipulation of non-classical states of light is rapidly becoming the focus of modern attosecond science. Here, we demonstrate numerically how such states can arise by considering a modification of the well-known problem of superradiance encountered already by Dicke. Similarly to him, we investigate photon emission by ensembles of indistinguishable atoms. In contrast to him, however, we leverage symmetry-based selection rules to suppress emission of single photons by single atoms. A steady state is therefore only reached following a spontaneous transition into a collective symmetry-broken state of atoms and photonic modes. The novel non-Markovian, non-perturbative method applied allows us to observe a large quantum state of light form and exhibit drastically non-classical statistics once the system undergoes a symmetry-breaking transition.</p>

            <h2>Annual-modulation fingerprint of the axion wind induced sideband triplet in quantum dot spin qubit sensors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiangjun Tan, Zhanning Wang</p>
            <p>We propose a phase-coherent, narrowband magnetometer for searching couplings between axions or axion-like particles (ALPs) and electron spins, using gate-defined silicon quantum-dot spin qubits. With repeated Ramsey echo sequences and dispersive readout, the qubit precession response can be tracked with sub-Hz spectral resolution. The accessible axion mass window is determined using a series of filtering protocols that take into account sensing noise, including readout errors and $1/f$ noise. We demonstrate clear evidence of sidereal modulation of the signal due to Earth's rotation, while Earth's orbital motion produces an annual amplitude envelope that generates sidebands at fixed frequency spacing $\pm \Omega_\oplus$ around the sidereal component. For axion masses between $1$-$10~\mu{\rm eV}$, the proposed method covers axion-electron coupling strengths $g_{ae}$ ranging from $10^{-14}$ to $10^{-10}$. Including both daily and annual modulation patterns in the likelihood analysis enhances the rejection of stationary or instrumental noise. Our results indicate that spin-qubit magnetometry can achieve sensitivities approaching those suggested by astrophysical considerations, providing a complementary, laboratory-based probe of axion-electron interactions. Although we focus on silicon spin-qubit architectures, the approach is broadly applicable to spin-based quantum sensors.</p>

            <p>Initial system-environment correlations are a thermodynamic resource, enabling work extraction via their erasure. We compare the work potential of classical, quantum, and hypothetical stronger-than-quantum correlations as a function of measurement misalignment. While all models can yield a peak extractable work of k_B T ln 2, corresponding to a mutual information of ln 2, their value as a resource differs critically in its robustness. The classical resource is fragile, decaying linearly with misalignment, whereas the quantum resource is robust, decaying only quadratically. Thus, the degree of nonlocality maps not to the maximum energetic value of a correlation, but to its operational robustness as a thermodynamic fuel.</p>

            <p>Cryptography depends on truly unpredictable numbers, but physical sources emit biased or correlated bits. Quantum mechanics enables the amplification of imperfect randomness into nearly perfect randomness, but prior demonstrations have required physically co-located, loophole-free Bell tests, constraining the feasibility of remote operation. Here we realize certified randomness amplification across a network by dynamically probing large, entangled quantum states on Quantinuum's 98-qubit Helios trapped-ion quantum processor. Our protocol is secure even if the remote device acts maliciously or is compromised by an intercepting adversary, provided the samples are generated quickly enough to preclude classical simulation of the quantum circuits. We stream quantum gates in real time to the quantum processor, maintain quantum state coherence for $\approx 0.9$ seconds, and then reveal the measurement bases to the quantum processor only milliseconds before measurement. This limits the time for classical spoofing to 30 ms and constrains the location of hypothetical adversaries to a $4{,}500$ km radius. We achieve a fidelity of 0.586 on random circuits with 64 qubits and 276 two-qubit gates, enabling the amplification of realistic imperfect randomness with a low entropy rate into nearly perfect randomness.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Safoura Mirkhalaf, Helmut Ritsch, Karol Gietka</p>
            <p>It is often argued that two coupled quantum harmonic oscillators, even when cooled to their ground state, display no inherently quantum features beyond quantized energy levels. Here, we challenge this view by showing that their classical observables can encode genuinely quantum features. In particular, we demonstrate that the characteristic frequency shifts observed in such systems act as a signature of non-classical correlations and ground-state entanglement at zero temperature, specifically two-mode squeezing between the uncoupled modes. From a complementary perspective, these two effects -- frequency shifts and squeezing -- represent the same underlying phenomenon expressed in different mode bases. What appears as a spectral renormalization in one description manifests as entanglement in another. These shifts therefore can serve as an entanglement witness accessible via standard frequency measurements. Furthermore, we show that this underlying squeezing, although not directly measurable, can be exploited to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio in precision frequency measurements of individual oscillators without requiring squeezed quantum noise. Our results uncover a new route to quantum-enhanced sensing within systems traditionally regarded as classical, offering fresh insight into how signatures of quantumness persist across the quantum-to-classical boundary.</p>

In this model, quantum algorithms have been shown to offer an unconditional exponential advantage in space. However, experimentally implementing such streaming algorithms requires qubits that remain coherent while interacting with an external data stream. In this work, we realize such a data-streaming model using Quantinuum Helios trapped-ion quantum computer with long-lived qubits that communicate with an external server. We implement a quantum pair sketch, which is the primitive underlying many quantum streaming algorithms, and use it to solve Hidden Matching, a problem known to exhibit a theoretical exponential quantum advantage in space. Furthermore, we compile the quantum streaming algorithm to fault-tolerant quantum architectures based on surface and bivariate bicycle codes and show that the quantum space advantage persists even with the overheads of fault-tolerance.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andras Ferenczi, Sutapa Samanta, Dagen Wang, Todd Hodges</p>
            <p>Federated learning (FL) is a widely used method for training machine learning (ML) models in a scalable way while preserving privacy (i.e., without centralizing raw data). Prior research shows that the risk of exposing sensitive data increases cumulatively as the number of iterations where a client's updates are included in the aggregated model increase. Attackers can launch membership inference attacks (MIA; deciding whether a sample or client participated), property inference attacks (PIA; inferring attributes of a client's data), and model inversion attacks (MI; reconstructing inputs), thereby inferring client-specific attributes and, in some cases, reconstructing inputs. In this paper, we mitigate risk by substantially reducing per client exposure using a quantum computing-inspired quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formulation that selects a small subset of client updates most relevant for each training round. In this work, we focus on two threat vectors: (i) information leakage by clients during training and (ii) adversaries who can query or obtain the global model. We assume a trusted central server and do not model server compromise. This method also assumes that the server has access to a validation/test set with global data distribution. Experiments on the MNIST dataset with 300 clients in 20 rounds showed a 95.2% per-round and 49% cumulative privacy exposure reduction, with 147 clients' updates never being used during training while maintaining in general the full-aggregation accuracy or even better. The method proved to be efficient at lower scale and more complex model as well. A CINIC-10 dataset-based experiment with 30 clients resulted in 82% per-round privacy improvement and 33% cumulative privacy.</p>

Using a fermionic transfer matrix method, we compute these quantities in the 2d $\pm J$ random-bond Ising model-corresponding to a surface code under bit-flip noise-on system sizes up to $512$ and over $10^7$ disorder realizations. All critical points extracted from statistical and information-theoretic indicators coincide with high precision at $p_c=0.1092212(4)$, with the coherent information exhibiting the smallest finite-size effects.

Moreover, we obtain Lieb-Robinson bounds with exponential light cones for the generated dynamics. For the proof, we mainly assume Lieb-Robinson bounds with linear light cones for dynamics generated by uniformly bounded local terms.

            <p>We introduce a focal-plane detector for advancing the energy and angular resolutions of current X-ray telescopes. The architecture integrates a metallic magnetic microcalorimeter (MMC) array of paramagnetic absorber pads with a thin layer of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond for simultaneous optical readout. An impinging X-ray photon induces a temperature transient in an absorber pad, kept at ~35 mK. This time- and temperature-dependent magnetic field transient is then optically imaged by diamond NV centers, kept at 4 K and positioned directly below the pad. For a 10 $\mu$m absorber length used with a 12 m focal length telescope, our design yields an optimal angular resolution of ~0.17 arcseconds and energy resolution of ~0.70 eV. Our NV-MMC design improves upon current transition-edge sensors (TES) or MMCs read-out by superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUID) by enabling simultaneous optical readout of the entire MMC array. Because no additional cryogenic multiplexing electronics are required, our approach scales naturally to larger and finer arrays, supporting finer angular resolutions and wider fields of view.</p>

            <p>Molecular spin qubits are promising candidates for quantum technologies, but their performance is limited by decoherence arising from diverse mechanisms. The complexity of the environment makes it challenging to identify the main source of noise and target it for mitigation. Here we present a systematic experimental and theoretical framework for analyzing the mechanisms of transverse relaxation in copper(II) phthalocyanine (CuPc) diluted into diamagnetic phthalocyanine hosts. Using pulsed EPR spectroscopy together with first-principles cluster correlation expansion simulations, we quantitatively separate the contributions from hyperfine-coupled nuclear spins, spin--lattice relaxation, and electron--electron dipolar interactions. Our detailed modeling shows that both strongly and weakly coupled nuclei contribute negligibly to $T_2$, while longitudinal dipolar interactions with electronic spins, through instantaneous and spectral diffusion, constitute the main decoherence channel even at moderate spin densities. This conclusion is validated by direct comparison between simulated spin-echo dynamics and experimental data. By providing a robust modeling and experimental approach, our work identifies favorable values of the electron spin density for quantum applications, and provides a transferable methodology for predicting ensemble coherence times. These insights will guide the design and optimization of molecular spin qubits for scalable quantum devices.</p>

For specific potential and nonlinearity parameters, we derive analytically exact, degenerate scattering states (doubly or triply degenerate) exhibiting perfect transmission. Using the Bogoliubov--de Gennes approach, we analyze the stability of these reflectionless degenerate states, demonstrating that only one solution within each degenerate manifold is dynamically stable. Furthermore, we study a configuration with spatially localized nonlinearity, identifying an exact reflectionless state under specific conditions. Numerical analysis shows that this state marks the system's transition from monostability to bistability as the incident wave amplitude increases. Our work establishes an analytic framework for these multistable transmission phenomena, directly relevant to coherent matter-wave transport in ultracold atomic systems and optical propagation in engineered photonic lattices.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Error Correction-like Noise Mitigation for Wave-like Dark Matter Searches with Quantum Sensors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hajime Fukuda, Takeo Moroi, Thanaporn Sichanugrist</p>
            <p>We propose a quantum error correction-like noise mitigation protocol for enhancing the sensitivity of wave-like dark matter searches with quantum sensors. Our protocol uses multiple sensors to mitigate the noise affecting each sensor individually, allowing for the suppression of excitation noise that is parallel to the dark matter signal. We demonstrate that our protocol can improve the sensitivity to dark matter signals by a factor of $\sqrt{N}$, where $N$ is the number of sensors used. Furthermore, we find that our protocol achieves the same performance as the standard quantum limit by the ideal measurement, which is impossible to achieve due to the unknown phase of the dark matter field. Our work can be widely applied to various types of signals with unknown phases, and has the potential to enhance the sensitivity of quantum sensors such as arrays of resonant cavities.</p>

            <h2>Isolated quantum-state networks in ultracold molecules</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tom R. Hepworth, Simon L. Cornish, Philip D. Gregory</p>
            <p>Precise control over rotational angular momentum is at the heart of recent advances in quantum chemistry, quantum simulation, and quantum computation with ultracold bialkali molecules. Each rotational state comprises a rich manifold of hyperfine states arising from combinations of rotation and nuclear spins; this often yields hundreds of transitions available between a given pair of rotational states, and the efficient navigation of this complex space is a current challenge for experiments. Here, we describe a general approach based on a simple heuristic and graph theory to quickly identify optimal sets of states in ultracold bialkali molecules. We explain how to find pathways through the many available transitions to prepare the molecule in a specific state with maximum speed for any desired fidelity. We then examine networks of states where multiple couplings are present at the same time. As example applications, we first identify a closed loop of four states in the RbCs molecule where there is minimal population leakage out of the loop during simultaneous microwave coupling; we then extend the optimisation procedure to account for decoherence induced by magnetic-field noise and obtain an optimal set of 3 states for quantum computation applications.</p>

            <h2>Integrability of a family of clean SYK models from the critical Ising chain</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kohei Fukai, Hosho Katsura</p>
            <p>We establish the integrability of a family of SYK models with uniform $p$-body interactions. We derive the R-matrix and mutually commuting transfer matrices that generate the Hamiltonians of these models, and obtain their exact eigenspectra and eigenstates. Remarkably, the R-matrix is that of the critical transverse-field Ising chain. This work reveals an unexpected connection between the SYK model, central to many-body quantum chaos, and the critical Ising chain, a cornerstone of statistical mechanics.</p>

            <h2>Inertial Repulsion from Quantum Geometry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maike Fahrensohn, R. Matthias Geilhufe</p>
            <p>We derive a repulsive, charge-dipole-like interaction for a Dirac particle in a rotating frame, arising from a geometric $U(1)$ gauge symmetry associated with the Berry phase. The Lagrangian of this system includes a non-inertial correction due to centrifugal field coupling. By imposing gauge symmetry and treating it as a full gauge theory, the Lagrangian is extended to include Berry connection and curvature terms. Upon integrating out the geometric gauge field, the effective action is obtained. This leads to the emergence of a repulsive, long-range effective interaction in the Lagrangian. Explicitly, in the non-inertial frame of the observer, the geometric gauge invariance effectively leads to a repulsive Coulomb-interaction in momentum space. In real space, the inertial repulsion manifests in a $1/\vert r\vert^{2}$ potential, which is symmetric about the origin of rotation and mirrors charge-dipole interaction.</p>
