            <h2>On Quantum Simulation of QED in Coulomb Gauge</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaojun Yao</p>
            <p>A recent work (Li, 2406.01204) considered quantum simulation of Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) on a lattice in the Coulomb gauge with gauge degrees of freedom represented in the occupation basis in momentum space. Here we consider representing the gauge degrees of freedom in field basis in position space and develop a quantum algorithm for real-time simulation. We show that the Coulomb gauge Hamiltonian is equivalent to the temporal gauge Hamiltonian when acting on physical states consisting of fermion and transverse gauge fields. The Coulomb gauge Hamiltonian guarantees that the unphysical longitudinal gauge fields do not propagate and thus there is no need to impose any constraint. The local gauge field basis and the canonically conjugate variable basis are swapped efficiently using the quantum Fourier transform. We prove that the qubit cost to represent physical states and the gate depth for real-time simulation scale polynomially with the lattice size, energy, time, accuracy and Hamiltonian parameters. We focus on the lattice theory without discussing the continuum limit or the UV completion of QED.</p>

            <h2>Coupled Cluster Downfolding Theoryin Simulations of Chemical Systems on Quantum Hardware</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicholas P. Bauman, Muqing Zheng, Chenxu Liu, Nathan M. Myers, Ajay Panyala, Bo Peng, Ang Li, Karol Kowalski</p>
            <p>The practical application of quantum technologies to chemical problems faces significant challenges, particularly in the treatment of realistic basis sets and the accurate inclusion of electron correlation effects. A direct approach to these problems is currently infeasible due to limitations in the number of logical qubits, their fidelity, and the shallow circuit depths supported by existing hardware; all of which hinder simulations at the required level of accuracy. A promising alternative is hybrid quantum-classical computing, where classical resources are used to construct effective Hamiltonians characterized by dimensions that conform to the constraints of current quantum devices. In this paper, we demonstrate the performance of a hybrid approach: coupled-cluster downfolded Hamiltonians are first evaluated in reduced-dimensionality active spaces, and the corresponding ground-state energies are subsequently computed using quantum algorithms. Our comprehensive analysis explores the achievable accuracy in recovering correlation energies when hundreds of orbitals are downfolded into a problem size tractable by today's quantum hardware. We argue that such flexible hybrid algorithms, where problem size can be tailored to available quantum resources, can serve as a bridge between noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices and future fault-tolerant quantum computers, marking a step toward the early realization of quantum advantage in chemistry.</p>

            <h2>Passive Quantum Interconnects: High-Fidelity Quantum Networking at Higher Rates and Less Overhead</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seigo Kikura, Kazufumi Tanji, Akihisa Goban, Shinichi Sunami</p>
            <p>High-fidelity, high-rate quantum interconnect is a fundamental building block of scalable quantum technologies. The cavity-assisted photon scattering (CAPS) approach is an attractive alternative to commonly used active protocols based on photon emission and two-photon interference: it offers higher success probability and greater intrinsic robustness to imperfections, while remaining a passive operation that does not require complex atom excitation sequences or intermodule synchronization. Despite these advantages, CAPS has not been a primary choice for quantum interconnect protocols since the estimated fidelity and the rate of CAPS-based networking have been severely limited in existing protocols and analysis frameworks. In this work, we eliminate these limitations by protocol improvements aided by a thorough analysis of the atom-cavity dynamics, to demonstrate that existing or near-term optical cavity qualities are sufficient for achieving a fidelity of 0.999 with short optical pulses required for high-rate networking. We show that efficient time-multiplexed operation is possible with suppressed crosstalk, enabling high-rate entanglement generation. We also propose a hybrid network configuration leveraging both photon emission and CAPS gates, eliminating the need for external photon sources while maintaining performance and robustness. As a concrete example, with 200 ${}^{171}$Yb atoms coupled to a cavity with internal cooperativity 100, atom-atom entanglement generation rate of $4 \times 10^5~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ is estimated at a fidelity of 0.999, with further speedup beyond $10^6~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ anticipated by the use of multiple wavelength channels. Our results establish the CAPS-based network protocol as a leading candidate for scaling quantum information platforms.</p>

            <h2>Superradiant Echoes Induced by Multiple Re-phasing of NV Spin Sub-ensembles Grating at Room Temperature</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qilong Wu, Yuan Zhang, Huihui Yu, Chong-Xin Shan, Klaus Mølmer</p>
            <p>In this Letter, we propose that superradiant echoes can be achieved at room temperature by applying a laser illumination and a microwave Hahn echo sequence to a diamond with a high concentration of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers placed in a dielectric microwave cavity. We identify that the combined action of two microwave driving pulses and a free evolution imprints a phase grating among NV spin sub-ensembles in frequency space, and multiple re-phasing of the grated spin sub-ensembles leads to multiple superradiant echoes through a collective coupling with the cavity. Furthermore, we show that the superradiant echoes can be actively tailored with the microwave pulses and the laser illumination by modifying the grating parameters, and the multiple re-phasing dynamics is analogous to the one leading to superradiant beats in optical clock system. In the future, the spin sub-ensembles grating and the resulting echoes can be further optimized with dynamical decoupling, which might pave the way for applications in quantum sensing.</p>

            <h2>Fiber transmission of cluster states via multi-level time-bin encoding</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Philip Rübeling, Robert Johanning, Jan Heine, Oleksandr V. Marchukov, Michael Kues</p>
            <p>The next generation of telecommunication networks will rely on the transmission of complex quantum states to enable secure and transformative information processing, utilizing entanglement and superposition. Cluster states - multipartite entangled states that retain entanglement under local measurements - are a vital resource for quantum networking applications such as blind photonic quantum computing, quantum state teleportation and all-photonic quantum repeaters. However, the transmission of cluster states over optical fiber has remained elusive with previous approaches. Here, we demonstrate the first transmission of a four-qubit cluster state over 25 km of single-mode fiber by using a two-photon multi-level time-bin encoding. We directly generate the state by exploiting coherent control of a parametric generation process, rendering a resource-intensive controlled-phase gate obsolete. To enable efficient and reconfigurable projective measurements on the multi-level time-bin encoded state, we introduce chirped-pulse modulation and implement the first time-bin beam splitter, allowing us to certify genuine multipartite entanglement and to demonstrate one-way computing operations. Our approach enables the transmission of complex quantum states over long-distance fibers, permitting the implementation of multipartite protocols and laying the foundation for large-scale quantum resource networks.</p>

            <h2>Measuring spatial coherence of quantum and classical light with an ultrastable monolithic interferometer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Edoardo Suerra, Mirko Siano, Bruno Paroli, Samuele Altilia, Marco A. C. Potenza, Matteo G. A. Paris, Simone Cialdi</p>
            <p>We describe a monolithic interferometer for spatial coherence measurements of both classical and quantum light sources. The design combines parametric down-conversion with a thermal source, using two identical calcite crystals to control beam alignment via birefringence. The monolithic structure ensures inherent stability. Spatial coherence is measured through temporal interferograms and spectral analysis, with both methods showing close agreement with theoretical predictions. The system is robust and performs reliably for both quantum and classical light. Its design enables automated, rapid coherence measurements across different source types.</p>

            <h2>Many-Body Fluctuation Theorems for Quantum Coherence and Correlation Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kun Zhang, Mo-Yang Ni, Hai-Long Shi, Xiao-Hui Wang, Jin Wang</p>
            <p>Fluctuation theorems establish exact relations for nonequilibrium dynamics, profoundly advancing the field of stochastic thermodynamics. In this Letter, we extend quantum fluctuation theorems beyond the traditional thermodynamic framework to quantum information dynamics and many-body systems, where both the system and the environment are multipartite without assuming any thermodynamic constraints. Based on the two-point measurement scheme and the classical probability, we establish the fluctuation theorem for the dynamics of many-body classical mutual information. By extending to quasiprobability, we derive quantum fluctuation theorems for many-body coherence and quantum correlations, presenting them in both integral and detailed forms. Our theoretical results are illustrated and verified using three-qubit examples, and feasible experimental verification protocols are proposed. These findings uncover the statistical structure underlying the nonequilibrium quantum information dynamics, providing fundamental insights and new tools for advancing quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Toward graviton detection via photon-graviton quantum state conversion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Taiki Ikeda, Youka Kaku, Sugumi Kanno, Jiro Soda</p>
            <p>A magnetic field enables the interconversion of photons and gravitons, yet the process is usually analysed only at the level of classical wave equations. We revisit photon-graviton conversion in a quantum field theoretic framework, allowing us to track the evolution of arbitrary quantum states. Treating the photons as squeezed coherent states and the gravitons as the squeezed vacuum expected for primordial gravitational waves, we derive analytic expressions for the conversion probability and show that it can be significantly enhanced compared to the conventional estimate. We further demonstrate that the conversion both swaps preexisting entanglement and generates genuinely new entanglement between the electromagnetic and gravitational sectors, which is impossible in any classical description. Detecting such nonclassical correlations would constitute compelling evidence for the quantization of gravity and offers a novel pathway toward graviton detection.</p>

            <h2>An entangled photon source for the telecom C-band based on a semiconductor-confined spin</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Petros Laccotripes, Junyang Huang, Ginny Shooter, Andrea Barbiero, Matthew S. Winnel, David A. Ritchie, Andrew J. Shields, Tina Muller, R. Mark Stevenson</p>
            <p>Multiphoton entangled states are a key resource for quantum networks and measurement-based quantum computation. Scalable protocols for generating such states using solid-state spin-photon interfaces have recently emerged, but practical implementations have so far relied on emitters operating at short wavelengths, incompatible with low-loss fibre transmission. Here, we take a key step towards the generation of telecom wavelength multi-qubit entangled states using an InAs/InP quantum dot. After establishing that all essential criteria for generating cluster states using a ground state spin as the entangler are satisfied, we implement a scalable protocol to entangle the resident spin with sequentially emitted photons directly in the telecom C-band. We demonstrate a two-qubit (spin-photon) entanglement fidelity of $59.5\pm 8.7\%$ and a lower bound of three-qubit (spin-photon-photon) entanglement fidelity of $52.7\pm 11.4\%$. Our results close the performance gap between short-wavelength quantum dot systems and the existing telecom infrastructure, establishing a route towards practical large photonic cluster states for fibre-based quantum network applications.</p>

            <h2>Simulating Quantum State Transfer between Distributed Devices using Noisy Interconnects</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marvin Bechtold, Johanna Barzen, Frank Leymann, Alexander Mandl</p>
            <p>Scaling beyond individual quantum devices via distributed quantum computing relies critically on high-fidelity quantum state transfers between devices, yet the quantum interconnects needed for this are currently unavailable or expected to be significantly noisy. These limitations can be bypassed by simulating ideal state transfer using quasiprobability decompositions (QPDs). Wire cutting, for instance, allows this even without quantum interconnects. Nevertheless, QPD methods face drawbacks, requiring sampling from multiple circuit variants and incurring substantial sampling overhead. While prior theoretical work showed that incorporating noisy interconnects within QPD protocols could reduce sampling overhead relative to interconnect quality, a practical implementation for realistic conditions was lacking. Addressing this gap, this work presents a generalized and practical QPD for state transfer simulation using noisy interconnects to reduce sampling overhead. The QPD incorporates a single tunable parameter for straightforward calibration to any utilized interconnect. To lower practical costs, the work also explores reducing the number of distinct circuit variants required by the QPD. Experimental validation on contemporary quantum devices confirms the proposed QPD's practical feasibility and expected sampling overhead reduction under realistic noise. Notably, the results show higher effective state transfer fidelity than direct transfer over the underlying noisy interconnect.</p>

            <h2>Analyzing Common Electronic Structure Theory Algorithms for Distributed Quantum Computing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Grier M. Jones, Hans-Arno Jacobsen</p>
            <p>To move towards the utility era of quantum computing, many corporations have posed distributed quantum computing (DQC) as a framework for scaling the current generation of devices for practical applications. One of these applications is quantum chemistry, also known as electronic structure theory, which has been poised as a "killer application" of quantum computing, To this end, we analyze five electronic structure methods, found in common packages such as Tequila and ffsim, which can be easily interfaced with the Qiskit Circuit Cutting addon. Herein, we provide insights into cutting these algorithms using local operations (LO) to determine their aptitude for distribution. The key findings of our work are that many of these algorithms cannot be efficiently parallelized using LO, and new methods must be developed to apply electronic structure theory within a DQC framework.</p>

            <h2>Deterministic Equations for Feedback Control of Open Quantum Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alberto J. B. Rosal, Patrick P. Potts, Gabriel T. Landi</p>
            <p>Feedback control in open quantum dynamics is crucial for the advancement of various coherent platforms. For a proper theoretical description, however, most feedback schemes rely on stochastic trajectories, which require significant statistical sampling and lack analytical insight. Currently, only a handful of deterministic feedback master equations exist in the literature. In this letter we derive a set of deterministic equations for describing feedback schemes based on generic causal signals. Our formulation is phrased in terms of sequentially applied quantum instruments, and is therefore extremely general, recovering various known results in the literature as particular cases. We then specialize this result to the case of quantum jumps and derive a new deterministic equation that allows for feedback based on the channel of the last jump, as well as the time since the last jump occurred. The strength of this formalism is illustrated with a detailed study of population inversion of a qubit using coherent drive and feedback, where our formalism allows all calculations to be performed analytically.</p>

            <p>We construct a relativistic quantum communication channel between two localized qubit systems, mediated by a relativistic quantum field, that can achieve the theoretical maximum for the quantum capacity in arbitrary curved spacetimes using the Unruh-DeWitt detector formalism. Using techniques from algebraic quantum field theory, we express the quantum capacity of the quantum communication channel purely in terms of the correlation functions of the field and the causal propagator for the wave equation. Consequently, the resulting quantum channel, and hence the quantum capacity, are by construction manifestly covariant, respect the causal structure of spacetime, and are independent of the details of the background geometry, topology, and the choice of Hilbert space (quasifree) representations of the field.</p>

            <h2>Stability and Loop Models from Decohering Non-Abelian Topological Order</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pablo Sala, Ruben Verresen</p>
            <p>Decohering topological order (TO) is central to the many-body physics of open quantum matter and decoding transitions. We identify relevant statistical mechanical models for decohering non-Abelian TO, which have been crucial for understanding the error threshold of Abelian stabilizer codes. The decohered density matrix can be described by loop models, whose topological loop weight $N$ is given by the quantum dimension of the decohering anyon -- reducing to the Ising model if $N=1$. In particular, the Rényi-$n$ moments of the decohered state correspond to $n$ coupled O$(N)$ loop models, and we exactly diagonalize the density matrix at maximal error rate. This allows us to relate the fidelity between two logically distinct ground states to properties of random O$(N)$ loop and spin models. Utilizing the literature on loop models, we find a remarkable stability to quantum channels which proliferate non-Abelian anyons with large quantum dimension, with the possibility of critical phases for smaller dimensions. We confirm our framework with exact results for Kitaev quantum double models, and with numerical simulations for the non-Abelian phase of the Kitaev honeycomb model. The latter is an example of a non-fixed-point wavefunction with non-bosonic and non-integral anyon dimensions. Our work opens up the possibility of non-Abelian TO being robust against maximally proliferating certain anyons, which can inform error-correction studies of these topological memories.</p>

We then demonstrate how the sensitivity of clocks and interferometers can be improved by the protection to unwanted experimental imperfections offered by the underlying topological robustness. The proposed implementation opens a path to exploit the unique opportunities offered by symmetry-protected topological phases in state-of-the-art quantum sensors.</p>

            <p>We report on optimizing the spectral purity of heralded single photons in the telecom O-band, where single photons can be propagated with low loss and low dispersion in a standard telecom optical fiber. We numerically searched for various group-velocity-matching conditions and corresponding optimal poling structures of a potassium titanyl phosphate crystal for spontaneous parametric downconversion. Our poling optimization results using phase-matching coherence-length and sub-coherence-length modulation schemes show > 99.4% spectral purity with pump wavelengths ranging from 603.8 nm to 887.3 nm. Some optimized configurations are feasible with off-the-shelf lasers and single-photon detectors. Moreover, by investigating noise photon spectra for different poling optimization methods, we show that, in practice, appropriate, gentle spectral filtering helps achieve high purity. This study will pave the way for developing practical quantum sources for quantum information applications at the telecom O-band.</p>

            <h2>Explicit Pfaffian Formula for Amplitudes of Fermionic Gaussian Pure States in Arbitrary Pauli Bases</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. A. Rajabpour, M. A. Seifi Mirjafarlou, Reyhaneh Khasseh</p>
            <p>The explicit computation of amplitudes for fermionic Gaussian pure states in arbitrary Pauli bases is a long-standing challenge in quantum many-body physics, with significant implications for quantum tomography, experimental studies, and quantum dynamics. These calculations are essential for analyzing complex properties beyond traditional measures, such as formation probabilities, global entanglement, and entropy in non-standard bases, where exact and computationally efficient methods remain underdeveloped. In addition to these physical applications, having explicit formulas is crucial for optimizing negative log-likelihood functions in quantum tomography, a key task in the NISQ era. In this work, we present an explicit Pfaffian formula (Theorem 1) for determining these amplitudes in arbitrary Pauli bases, utilizing a matrix whose structure reflects the qubit parity. Additionally, we introduce a recursive relation (Theorem 2) that connects amplitudes for systems with varying qubit numbers, enabling scalable computations for large systems. Together, these results provide a versatile framework for studying global entanglement, Shannon-Rényi entropies, formation probabilities, and performing efficient quantum tomography, thereby significantly expanding the computational toolkit for analyzing complex quantum systems. Finally, we utilize our formalism to determine the post-measurement entanglement entropy, reflecting how local measurements alter entanglement, and compare the outcomes with conformal field theory predictions.</p>

            <p>Leakage out from the qubit subspace compromises standard quantum error correction protocols and is a challenge for practical quantum computing. We propose a passive leakage removal unit based on an array of coupled disordered transmons and last-site reset by feedback-measurement or dissipation. The transmons have parametric disorder both in frequency and anharmonicity such that the qubit subspace is protected by localization through energy level mismatch while the energy levels for leakage excitations are in resonance for maximized leakage mobility. Leakage excitations propagate through the idle transmons until reaching the last site with feedback-measurement or dissipation removing them. For removing leakage excitations, we find two optimal measurement rates, which are comprehensively understood through two distinct timescales between the propagation and disintegration of leakage excitations. Based only on an array of standard transmon devices, our approach is readily compatible with existing superconducting quantum processor designs under realistic conditions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matheus Eiji Ohno Bezerra, Francesco Albarelli, Rafal Demkowicz-Dobrzanski</p>
            <p>Quantum multiparameter metrology is hindered by incompatibility issues, such as finding a single probe state (probe incompatibility) and a single measurement (measurement incompatibility) optimal for all parameters. The simultaneous estimation of phase shift and loss in a single optical mode is a paradigmatic multiparameter metrological problem in which such tradeoffs are present. We consider two settings: single-mode or two-mode probes (with a reference lossless mode), and for each setting we consider either Gaussian states or arbitrary quantum states of light restricted only by a maximal number of photons allowed. We find numerically that, as the number of photons increases, there are quantum states of light for which probe incompatibility disappears both in the single- and two-mode scenarios. On the other hand, for Gaussian states, probe incompatibility is present in the single-mode case and may be removed only in the two-mode setting thanks to the entanglement with the reference mode. Finally, we provide strong arguments that the fundamental incompatibility aspect of the model is measurement incompatibility, which persists for all the scenarios considered, and unlike probe-incompatibility cannot be overcome even in the large photon number limit.</p>

            <h2>Query Complexity of Classical and Quantum Channel Discrimination</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Theshani Nuradha, Mark M. Wilde</p>
            <p>Quantum channel discrimination has been studied from an information-theoretic perspective, wherein one is interested in the optimal decay rate of error probabilities as a function of the number of unknown channel accesses. In this paper, we study the query complexity of quantum channel discrimination, wherein the goal is to determine the minimum number of channel uses needed to reach a desired error probability. To this end, we show that the query complexity of binary channel discrimination depends logarithmically on the inverse error probability and inversely on the negative logarithm of the (geometric and Holevo) channel fidelity. As a special case of these findings, we precisely characterize the query complexity of discriminating two classical channels and two classical-quantum channels. Furthermore, by obtaining a tighter characterization of the sample complexity of quantum hypothesis testing, including prior probabilities, we provide a more precise characterization of query complexity when the error probability does not exceed a fixed threshold. We also provide lower and upper bounds on the query complexity of binary asymmetric channel discrimination and multiple quantum channel discrimination. For the former, the query complexity depends on the geometric Rényi and Petz Rényi channel divergences, while for the latter, it depends on the negative logarithm of the (geometric and Uhlmann) channel fidelity. For multiple channel discrimination, the upper bound scales as the logarithm of the number of channels.</p>

            <h2>Verifiable End-to-End Delegated Variational Quantum Algorithms</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matteo Inajetovic, Petros Wallden, Anna Pappa</p>
            <p>Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have emerged as promising candidates for solving complex optimization and machine learning tasks on near-term quantum hardware. However, executing quantum operations remains challenging for small-scale users because of several hardware constraints, making it desirable to delegate parts of the computation to more powerful quantum devices. In this work, we introduce a framework for delegated variational quantum algorithms (DVQAs), where a client with limited quantum capabilities delegates the execution of a VQA to a more powerful quantum server. In particular, we introduce a protocol that enables a client to delegate a variational quantum algorithm to a server while ensuring that the input, the output and also the computation itself remain secret. Additionally, if the protocol does not abort, the client can be certain that the computation outcome is indeed correct. This work builds on the general verification protocol introduced by Fitzimons and Kashefi (2017), tailoring it to VQAs. Our approach first proposes a verifiable Protocol for delegating the quantum computation required at each optimization step of a VQA, and then combines the iterative steps into an error-resilient optimization process that offers end-to-end verifiable algorithm execution. We also simulate the performance of our protocol tackling the Transverse Field Ising Model. Our results demonstrate that secure delegation of variational quantum algorithms is a realistic solution for near-term quantum networks, paving the way for practical quantum cloud computing applications.</p>

We show that this ratio differs from the similarly defined order probability and describe the decoding strategy whose success rate is described by the order probability. We refer to the latter as a probabilistic partition function decoding and show that it is the strategy that at zero temperature corresponds to maximum probability (MP) decoding. Based on the difference between the two decoders, we discuss the possibility of a maximum partition function decodability boundary outside the order-disorder phase boundary. At zero temperature, the difference between the two ratios measures to what degree MP decoding can be improved by accounting for degeneracy among maximum probability errors, through methods such as ensembling. We consider in detail the example of the toric code under bitflip noise, which maps to the Random Bond Ising Model. We demonstrate that estimation of logical performance through decoding probability and order probability is more sample efficient than estimation by counting failures of the corresponding decoders. We consider both uniform noise and noise where qubits are given individual error rates. The latter noise model lifts the degeneracy among maximum probability errors, but we show that ensembling remains useful as long as it also samples less probable errors.</p>

            <h2>Learning to Maximize Quantum Neural Network Expressivity via Effective Rank</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Juan Yao</p>
            <p>Quantum neural networks (QNNs) are widely employed as ansätze for solving variational problems, where their expressivity directly impacts performance. Yet, accurately characterizing QNN expressivity remains an open challenge, impeding the optimal design of quantum circuits. In this work, we introduce the effective rank, denoted as $\kappa$, as a novel quantitative measure of expressivity. Specifically, $\kappa$ captures the number of effectively independent parameters among all the variational parameters in a parameterized quantum circuit, thus reflecting the true degrees of freedom contributing to expressivity. Through a systematic analysis considering circuit architecture, input data distributions, and measurement protocols, we demonstrate that $\kappa$ can saturate its theoretical upper bound, $d_n=4^n-1$, for an $n$-qubit system when each of the three factors is optimally expressive. This result provides a rigorous framework for assessing QNN expressivity and quantifying their functional capacity. Building on these theoretical insights, and motivated by the vast and highly structured nature of the circuit design space, we employ $\kappa$ as a guiding metric for the automated design of highly expressive quantum circuit configurations. To this end, we develop a reinforcement learning framework featuring a self-attention transformer agent that autonomously explores and optimizes circuit architectures. By integrating theoretical characterization with practical optimization, our work establishes $\kappa$ as a robust tool for quantifying QNN expressivity and demonstrates the effectiveness of reinforcement learning in designing high-performance quantum circuits. This study paves the way for building more expressive QNN architectures, ultimately enhancing the capabilities of quantum machine learning.</p>

            <h2>Strategies for generating separable photon triplets in waveguides and ring resonators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gisell Lorena Osorio, Milica Banic, Nicolás Quesada</p>
            <p>Photon triplet sources exhibit non-Gaussian features, a key property for applications in quantum computing and quantum information. However, spectral correlations can limit the performance and detection efficiency of these systems. Motivated by this, we present a theoretical analysis of the spectral correlations of photon triplets generated through spontaneous third-order parametric down-conversion in photonic devices, and discuss strategies to quantify and minimize them. We propose two strategies to minimize spectral correlations: dispersion engineering in waveguides and pump engineering in resonators. We apply these strategies in two realistic source designs, namely a high-index-contrast optical fiber taper and a silicon nitride microring resonator. Finally, we discuss detection strategies for probing non-Gaussian features of the triplet state. We find that it is feasible to achieve few-mode generation of photon triplets using state-of-the-art experimental systems, a crucial step toward practical applications of photon triplet sources in quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>A Solvable Semi-infinite Fock-state-lattice SSH Model: the Stable Topological Zero Mode and the Non-Hermitian Bound Effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xing Yao Mi, Yong-Chun Liu, Zhi Jiao Deng, Chun Wang Wu, Ping Xing Chen</p>
            <p>Fock-state lattice (FSL) offers a powerful quantum simulator for topological phenomena due to the unbounded scalability and ease of implementation. Nevertheless, the unique topological properties induced by its site-dependent coupling have remained elusive, mainly due to the challenge of handling an infinite state space without translational symmetry. Here, we rigorously analyze the topological features of a semi-infinite FSL-based Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, in both Hermitian and non-Hermitian realms, by mapping it to the solvable Jaynes-Cummings (JC) model via a unitary displacement transformation. We find a more stable topological zero mode than the conventional SSH model, originating from the bound state at the inherent domain wall under anisotropic conditions. With gain and loss introduced, we predict a non-Hermitian bound effect (NHBE), i. e., any state overlapping with the bound state will quickly stabilize to the domain wall, with the minimal stabilization time occurring in the vicinity of exceptional point (EP). The paritytime (PT ) phase transition can be observed by the oscillating-to-steady crossover of dynamics in the subspace orthogonal to the bound state. Our work takes the first step towards exploring unique topological properties in infinite anisotropic topological models based on the promising FSL simulator.</p>

            <h2>Certification of high stellar ranks of quantum states of light with a pair of click detectors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jaromír Fiurášek</p>
            <p>Stellar rank of quantum states of light quantifies the amount of non-Gaussian resources required for their generation. One popular and practical approach to certification of stellar rank is based on measurement of click statistics with an array of binary detectors that can only distinguish the presence and absence of photons. Specifically, it was shown that measurements with an array of m+1 detectors allows one to certify stellar rank of approximate Fock state |m>, even when the state is subjected to losses or certain noise. Here we address the question how many click detectors are in principle required to certify high stellar ranks. We show that two click detectors arranged in a Hanbury Brown-Twiss setup suffice. Interestingly, detection of higher stellar rank is greatly facilitated by making the total detection efficiency of the detectors sufficiently low but well calibrated. Losses affect the response of the detection scheme in a way that can be exploited to certify stellar rank of high Fock states. We explicitly construct the corresponding stellar rank witnesses and discuss dependence of the stellar rank thresholds on parameters of the considered setup. Our results reveal that it is possible to certify high stellar ranks even with a minimalistic scheme that provides only very coarse grained information about the photon number statistics of the characterized state.</p>

            <h2>Computed tomography of propagating microwave photons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qi-Ming Chen, Aarne Keränen, Aashish Sah, Mikko Möttönen</p>
            <p>Propagating photons serve as essential links for distributing quantum information and entanglement across distant nodes. Knowledge of their Wigner functions not only enables their deployment as active information carriers but also provides error diagnostics when photons passively leak from a quantum processing unit. While well-established for standing waves, characterizing propagating microwave photons requires post-processing of room-temperature signals with excessive amplification noise. Here, we demonstrate amplification-free Wigner function tomography of propagating microwave photons using a superconductor--normal-metal--superconductor bolometer based on the resistive heating effect of absorbed radiation. By introducing two-field interference in power detection, the bolometer acts as a sensitive and broadband quadrature detector that samples the input field at selected angles at millikelvin with no added noise. Adapting the principles of computed tomography (CT) in medical imaging, we implement Wigner function CT by combining quadrature histograms across different projection angles and demonstrate it for Gaussian states at the single-photon level. Compressed sensing and neural networks further reduce the projections to three without compromising the reconstruction quality. These results address the long-standing challenge of characterizing propagating microwave photons in a superconducting quantum network and establish a new avenue for real-time quantum error diagnostics and correction.</p>

We assume the most general CPT conserving, Lorentz-invariant coupling of the spin-0 particle with the daughter bosons. We compute the most general two-boson density matrix obtained by averaging over kinematical configurations with an appropriate probability distribution (which can be obtained when both bosons subsequently decay into fermion-antifermion). We show that the two-boson state is entangled and violates the CGLMP inequality for all values of the (anomalous) coupling constants and that in this case the state is entangled iff it can violate the CGLMP inequality. As an exemplary process of this kind we use the decay $H\to ZZ$ with anomalous coupling.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pablo Sala, Jason Alicea, Ruben Verresen</p>
            <p>The effect of decoherence on topological order (TO) has been most deeply understood for the toric code, the paragon of Abelian TOs. We show that certain non-Abelian TOs can be analyzed and understood to a similar degree, despite being significantly richer. We consider both wavefunction deformations and quantum channels acting on $D_4$ TO, which has recently been realized on a quantum processor. By identifying the corresponding local statistical mechanical spin or rotor model with $D_4$ symmetry, we find a remarkable stability against proliferating non-Abelian anyons. This is shown by leveraging a reformulation in terms of the tractable O$(2)$ loop model in the pure state case, and $n$ coupled O$(2)$ loop models for Rényi-$n$ quantities in the decoherence case -- corresponding to worldlines of the proliferating anyon with quantum dimension $2$. In particular, we find that the purity ($n=2$) remains deep in the $D_4$ TO for any decoherence strength, while the $n \to \infty$ limit becomes critical upon maximally decohering a particular anyon type, similar to our wavefunction deformation result. The information-theoretic threshold ($n\to 1$) appears to be controlled by a disordered version of these stat-mech models, akin to the toric code case although significantly more robust. We furthermore use Monte Carlo simulations to explore the phase diagrams when multiple anyon types proliferate at the same time, leading to a continued stability of the $D_4$ TO in addition to critical phases with emergent $U(1)$ symmetry. Instead of loop models, these are now described by net models corresponding to different anyon types coupled together according to fusion this http URL opens up the exploration of statistical mechanical models for decohered non-Abelian TO, which can inform optimal decoders, and which in an ungauged formulation examples of non-Abelian strong-to-weak symmetry breaking.</p>

            <p>Hyper-Ramsey protocols have been successfully implemented on ultra-narrow optical clock transitions to reduce systematic frequency-shifts induced by AC-Stark shift and amplitude pulse variation. However, the compensation remains imperfect against laser probe intensity fluctuation, decoherence and unsuited for external quasi-static or low frequency noise perturbations. Here, we address these limitations by employing dynamical-decoupling methods composed by multiple rotary Hahn-echo pulses toggling probe frequency detunings between opposite signs during interrogating laser pulses. Time-optimized Uhrig sequences of refocusing pulses produce highly contrasted and robust hyper-Ramsey interferences against low-frequency noise distortions caused by environmental factors and imperfections in the probe parameters. Dynamically-decoupled SU(2) hyper-clocks pave the way to universal noise-resilient quantum sensors, unveiling fault-tolerant quantum metrology to track fundamental symmetries and search for new physics beyond the Standard Model.</p>

            <p>Scalable atom-based quantum platforms for simulation, computing, and metrology require fast high-fidelity, low-loss imaging of individual atoms. Standard fluorescence detection methods rely on continuous cooling, limiting the detection range to one atom and imposing long imaging times that constrain the experimental cycle and mid-circuit conditional operations. Here, we demonstrate fast and low-loss single-atom imaging in optical tweezers without active cooling, enabled by the favorable properties of ytterbium. Collecting fluorescence over microsecond timescales, we reach single-atom discrimination fidelities above 99.9% and single-shot survival probabilities above 99.5%. Through interleaved recooling pulses, as short as a few hundred microseconds for atoms in magic traps, we perform tens of consecutive detections with constant atom-retention probability per image - an essential step toward fast atom re-use in tweezer-based processors and clocks. Our scheme does not induce parity projection in multiply-occupied traps, enabling number-resolved single-shot detection of several atoms per site. This allows us to study the near-deterministic preparation of single atoms in tweezers driven by blue-detuned light-assisted collisions. Moreover, the near-diffraction-limited spatial resolution of our low-loss imaging enables number-resolved microscopy in dense arrays, opening the way to direct site-occupancy readout in optical lattices for density fluctuation and correlation measurements in quantum simulators.</p>

We present a full analytical solution to this quantum mechanical Hamiltonian problem by employing the formalism of two-phonon coherent states. Quantum estimation theory is applied to the resulting state of the optical field, with a focus on evaluating the classical and quantum Fisher information for estimating the strength of the quadratic coupling. Our estimation scheme considers both standard and balanced homodyne photodetection, assuming an initial optical state prepared as a superposition of vacuum and single-photon states. We show that balanced homodyne detection can saturate the quantum Fisher information, thus reaching the ultimate precision bound for estimating the quadratic coupling. Additionally, we investigate the effect of thermal noise on the quantum Fisher information in a realistic experimental context.</p>

            <p>Matter-wave interferometry is highly susceptible to inertial acceleration noises arising from the vibration of the experimental apparatus. There are various methods for noise suppression. In this paper, we propose leveraging the cross-correlation of multi-directional vibration noises to mitigate their dephasing effect in matter-wave interferometers. Specifically, we analyse an interferometer driven by its internal qubit under an external field and examine the dephasing caused by a two-dimensional random inertial force. As we will demonstrate, the coupling between the two-dimensional inertial force noise components will shift the resonance peak but not change the shape of the power spectral density. Moreover, when the noise approximately resonates with the intrinsic frequency of the test mass, we find that the standard deviation of the phase can be suppressed by a factor roughly equal to the Q-factor of the noise. This technique holds significant potential for future gravity experiments utilising quantum sensors, such as measuring gravitational acceleration and exploring quantum entanglement induced by gravity.</p>

            <p>The ultrastrong and deep strong coupling regimes exhibit a variety of intriguing physical phenomena. In this work, we utilize the Hopfield model of a two-mode bosonic system, with each mode interacts with a heat reservoir, to research the behavior of quantum coherence. Our results indicate that a coupled oscillator system can exhibit significant quantum coherence in the ultrastrong and deep strong coupling regimes. In the ground state, the photon-mode and the matter-mode coherences are equal. The larger coherences that encompass the photon mode, the matter mode, and the overall system are achieved at lower optical frequencies and with increased coupling strengths. Notably, the the beam-splitter and phase rotation terms alone does not generate coherences for either total coherence or subsystem coherences; instead, the generation of quantum coherences originates from the one-mode and two-mode squeezing terms. When heat environments are present, the total coherence can be enhanced by the the beam-splitter and phase rotation terms, while it has no effect on subsystem coherences. Moreover, when the one-mode and two-mode squeezing terms and the the beam-splitter and phase rotation terms are considered together, the total coherence increases with stronger coupling. We also observe that lower frequencies maximize total coherence in the deep strong coupling regime. These results demonstrate that the ultrastrong and deep strong coupling regimes give rise to novel characteristics of quantum coherence. This work provides valuable insights into the quantum coherence properties, particularly in the ultrastrong and deep strong coupling regimes between light and matter and may have potential applications in quantum information processing.</p>

            <p>Molecular exciton-polaritons exhibit long-range, ultrafast propagation, yet recent experiments have reported far slower propagation than expected. In this work, we implement a nonperturbative approach to quantify how static energetic disorder renormalizes polariton group velocity in strongly coupled microcavities. The method requires no exact diagonalization or master equation propagation, and depends only on measurable parameters: the mean exciton energy and its variance, the microcavity dispersion, and the Rabi splitting. Using parameters corresponding to recently probed organic microcavities, we show that exciton inhomogeneous broadening slows both lower and upper polaritons, particularly when the mean exciton energy fluctuation approaches the collective light-matter coupling strength. A detailed discussion and interpretation of these results is provided using perturbation theory in the limit of weak resonance scattering. Overall, our results support the view that exciton-phonon interactions likely dominate the recent experimental observations of polariton slowdown in disordered media.</p>

We engineer the periodic atomic array with two distinct nearest-neighbor spacings, i.e., $d$=$\lambda_0/2$ and $d$=$\lambda_0/4$, which correspond to Bragg and anti-Bragg scattering conditions, respectively. The system consists of eight atoms arranged to maintain these specific interatomic distances. By controlling atomic frequencies, we modify Bragg and anti-Bragg superatoms, resulting in distinctly different quantum optical phenomena, such as collectively induced transparency and a broad photonic bandgap. Moreover, due to strong waveguide-atom couplings in superconducting quantum circuits, efficient light manipulations are realized in small-size systems.

            <p>The performance of various quantum devices is fundamentally linked to the control of exciton transport. To explore this, we study the exciton transport of the two-dimensional multi-chain systems with different coupling configurations in an optical cavity. Two types of the chains--the homogeneous and heterogeneous coupling chain, as well as two inter-chain coupling conformations--the square and triangular arrangements, are considered. The effects of the inter-chain coupling, the dimerization parameter, the cavity, the length and number of the chains on exciton transport are systematically investigated for different coupling configurations through the spectra, the Hopfield coeffcients, and the steady-state dynamics of the system. The results show that in the absence of a cavity the exciton transport currents and effciency are determined by the exciton distribution across the multi-chain system. However, when a cavity is introduced the exciton transport can be significantly enhanced or suppressed by the polariton formation at the cavity-dressed energy level crossings and anticrossings near zero-energy modes, where the coherent excitation and LandauZener transitions occur. Meanwhile, we discover that the discontinuous and extremal points in the second-order partial derivatives of the photon Hopfield coeffcients with respect to the inter-chain coupling and the dimerization parameter correspond respectively to the crossings and anticrossings at the extreme points of the photon occupation number. Additionally, exciton transport effciency is closely related to the odevity of both chain length and chain number, and exhibits oscillatory behaviour. This work provides critical insights into the exciton transport mechanism in multichain-cavity system and theoretical basis for designing high-erformance excitonic devices with tunable transport properties.</p>

            <p>Macroscopic entanglement, as a critical quantum resource in quantum information science, has been extensively studied in coherent optomechanics over the past decades. However, entanglement in dissipative optomechanics, where the cavity linewidth depends on the position of the mechanical resonator, remains largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate quantum entanglement in a dissipative optomechanical system realized by a Michelson-Sagnac interferometer with a movable membrane. This configuration enables the switching between coherent and dissipative optomechanical couplings at will. With experimentally feasible parameters, we demonstrate that the steady-state mechanical displacement exhibits a nonlinear (linear) dependence on the driving power under coherent (dissipative) coupling. Furthermore, we show that the quantum entanglement generated via dissipative coupling is significantly stronger and more robust to noise than that generated via coherent coupling. When both coherent and dissipative couplings are simultaneously present, the entanglement is weakened due to quantum interference. Our results indicate that dissipative optomechanical coupling can be a promising route for engineering strong and noise-resilient quantum entanglement.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Callum Duffy, Marcin Jastrzebski</p>
            <p>In this work, we investigate the phenomenon of spectral bias in quantum machine learning, where, in classical settings, models tend to fit low-frequency components of a target function earlier during training than high-frequency ones, demonstrating a frequency-dependent rate of convergence. We study this effect specifically in parameterised quantum circuits (PQCs). Leveraging the established formulation of PQCs as Fourier series, we prove that spectral bias in this setting arises from the ``redundancy'' of the Fourier coefficients, which denotes the number of terms in the analytical form of the model contributing to the same frequency component. The choice of data encoding scheme dictates the degree of redundancy for a Fourier coefficient. We find that the magnitude of the Fourier coefficients' gradients during training strongly correlates with the coefficients' redundancy. We then further demonstrate this empirically with three different encoding schemes. Additionally, we demonstrate that PQCs with greater redundancy exhibit increased robustness to random perturbations in their parameters at the corresponding frequencies. We investigate how design choices affect the ability of PQCs to learn Fourier sums, focusing on parameter initialization scale and entanglement structure, finding large initializations and low-entanglement schemes tend to slow convergence.</p>

            <p>Enhancing measurement precision in quantum systems is vital for advancing technologies like quantum sensing and communication. Traditionally, quantum Fisher information (QFI) has been the key tool in determining precision limits within Hermitian quantum systems. However, recent research has expanded to non-Hermitian systems exhibiting real spectra. This study investigates various interpretations of non-Hermitian quantum dynamics such as the normalization and metric approaches. We demonstrate that owing to distinct types of dynamic behaviour, QFI expressions vary significantly depending on the formalism. In particular, the normalization formalism overestimates the enhancement and/or revivals in QFI, effectively post-selecting the most optimistic case of the evolution, which may give an overly favourable impression of the sensitivity and accuracy of quantum measurements. The metric-based interpretation maintains consistency with a Hermitian-like structure, offering a more stable and conservative assessment of measurement precision. This approach provides a more natural representation of the system's evolution, enabling a more accurate assessment of quantum measurement sensitivity without the need for post-selection. We support our claims by focussing on QFI dynamics for a qubit system, while advocating the metric interpretation as a more reliable guide for quantum metrology despite presenting both approaches as valid and complementary ways of understanding non-Hermitian dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Demonstration of measurement-free universal fault-tolerant quantum computation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Friederike Butt, Ivan Pogorelov, Robert Freund, Alex Steiner, Marcel Meyer, Thomas Monz, Markus Müller</p>
            <p>The ability to perform quantum error correction (QEC) and robust gate operations on encoded qubits opens the door to demonstrations of quantum algorithms. Contemporary QEC schemes typically require mid-circuit measurements with feed-forward control, which are challenging for qubit control, often slow, and susceptible to relatively high error rates. In this work, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a universal toolbox of fault-tolerant logical operations without mid-circuit measurements on a trapped-ion quantum processor. We present modular logical state teleportation between two four-qubit error-detecting codes without measurements during algorithm execution. Moreover, we realize a fault-tolerant universal gate set on an eight-qubit error-detecting code hosting three logical qubits, based on state injection, which can be executed by coherent gate operations only. We apply this toolbox to experimentally realize Grover's quantum search algorithm fault-tolerantly on three logical qubits encoded in eight physical qubits, with the implementation displaying clear identification of the desired solution states. Our work demonstrates the practical feasibility and provides first steps into the largely unexplored direction of measurement-free quantum computation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jared Gibson, Zhanzhi Jiang, Angela Kou</p>
            <p>Superconducting resonators with high quality factors are extremely sensitive detectors of the complex impedance of materials and devices coupled to them. This capability has been used to measure losses in multiple different materials and, in the case of circuit quantum electrodynamics (circuit QED), has been used to measure the coherent evolution of multiple different types of qubits. Here, we report on the implementation of a scanning resonator for probing quantum coherent devices. Our scanning setup enables tunable coherent coupling to systems of interest without the need for fabricating on-chip superconducting resonators. We measure the internal quality factor of our resonator sensor in the single-photon regime to be > 10000 and demonstrate capacitive imaging using our sensor with zeptoFarad sensitivity and micron spatial resolution at milliKelvin temperatures. We then use our setup to characterize the energy spectrum and coherence times of multiple transmon qubits with no on-chip readout circuitry. Our work introduces a new tool for using circuit QED to measure existing and proposed qubit platforms.</p>

            <h2>Lamb-Dicke Dynamics of Interacting Rydberg Atoms Coupled to the Motion of an Optical Tweezer Array</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aslam Parvej, Ludwig Mathey</p>
            <p>Neutral Rydberg atoms trapped in optical tweezer arrays provide a platform for quantum simulation and computation. In this work, we investigate the Lamb-Dicke dynamics of coupled Rydberg atoms for different trapping frequencies. We model the atomic motion by both internal and motional degrees of freedom, in which the motional states arise due to the oscillation of each atom in optical tweezer traps due to the light-atom interaction. In this setup, the internal states are coupled to a laser light with a Rabi frequency, while each internal state of each atom is also harmonically trapped with a trap frequency that depends on the internal state. The impact of the coherent motion of the optical tweezers on the collective dynamics of the many-body Rydberg atoms is explored for varying Lamb-Dicke parameters and with different trap frequencies. We see the occurrence of dynamical phases e.g., Rabi oscillations in the decoupled limit, the limit torus phase for magic trapping, and the limit cycle phase as the trap frequency is further increased.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sunkyu Yu, Xianji Piao, Namkyoo Park</p>
            <p>Understanding random open quantum systems is critical for characterizing the performance of large-scale quantum devices and exploring macroscopic quantum phenomena. Various features in these systems, including spectral distributions, gap scaling, and decoherence, have been examined by modelling randomness under the central limit theorem. Here, we investigate random open quantum systems beyond the central limit theorem, focusing on heavy-tailed system-environment interactions. By extending the Ginibre unitary ensemble, we model system-environment interactions to exhibit a continuous transition from light-tailed to heavy-tailed distributions. This generalized configuration reveals unique properties-gapless spectra, Pareto principle governing dissipation, orthogonalization, and quasi-degeneracies-all linked to the violation of the central limit theorem. The synergy of these features challenges the common belief-the tradeoff between stability and sensitivity-through the emergence of long-lived and ultrasensitive quantum coherences that exhibit an enhancement of two orders of magnitude compared to predictions under the central limit theorem. The result, which is based on heavy-tailedness of open quantum systems, provides highly desirable platforms for quantum sensing applications.</p>

            <h2>Extended Non-Markovian Stochastic Schrödinger Equation with Complex Frequency Modes for General Basis Functions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yukai Guo, Zeyu Huang, Xing Gao</p>
            <p>We present an extended formulation of the non-Markovian stochastic Schrödinger equation with complex frequency modes (extended cNMSSE), enabling the treatment of open quantum system dynamics under general spectral densities. This extension employs complete non-exponential basis expansions for the bath correlation functions, thereby generalizing the applicability of the cNMSSE framework beyond environments with Debye-type spectral structures. By preserving the wavefunction-based description and favorable linear-scaling properties, the extended cNMSSE offers an efficient and flexible approach to simulate non-Markovian quantum dynamics. The method is implemented within a pseudo-Fock space using conventional ladder operators and solved numerically via matrix product state (MPS) techniques. Benchmark simulations on four representative cases, including discrete spectra, Ohmic spectra with exponential and algebraic cutoffs, and critically damped Brownian spectral densities, demonstrate excellent agreement with results of hierarchy of forward-backward stochastic Schrödinger equations (HFB-SSE) and extended hierarchical equation of motion (HEOM). The extended cNMSSE thus provides a robust and scalable framework for accurate simulations of non-Markovian open quantum systems with general environments.</p>

            <p>Quantum information is typically fragile under measurement and environmental coupling. Remarkably, we find that its lifetime can scale exponentially with system size when the environment is continuously monitored via mid-circuit measurements -- regardless of bath size. Starting from a maximally entangled state with a reference, we analytically prove this exponential scaling for typical Haar random unitaries and confirm it through numerical simulations in both Haar-random and chaotic Hamiltonian systems. In the absence of bath monitoring, the lifetime exhibits a markedly different scaling: it grows at most linearly -- or remains constant -- with system size and decays inversely with bath size. We further extend our findings numerically to a broad class of initial states. We discuss implications for monitored quantum circuits in the weak measurement limit, quantum algorithms such as quantum diffusion models and quantum reservoir computing, and quantum communication. Finally, we evaluate the feasibility of resolving the predicted scaling regimes experimentally via noisy simulations of IBM Quantum hardwares.</p>

            <p>Coherent, continuous-wave, and electrically tunable chip-scale terahertz (THz) sources are critical for emerging applications in sensing, imaging, spectroscopy, communication, space and quantum technologies. Here, we demonstrate a robust source-on-a-chip THz emitter based on a layered high-temperature superconductor, engineered with an elliptical microcavity and capable of sustained coherent emission over an unprecedented operational lifetime exceeding 11 years. This compact THz source operates up to 60 K, with Tc= 90 K, delivering stable radiation in the 0.7-0.8 THz range, with on-chip electrical tunability from 100 GHz to 1 THz. Coherence arises from the phase-locked oscillation of intrinsic Josephson junction arrays, resonantly coupled to transverse electromagnetic modes within the cavity, analogous to a laser cavity, yielding collective macroscopic oscillations. THz emission remains detectable across a 0.5 m free-space open-air link at room temperature. We analyse the cavity-mode structure and extract THz photon generation rates up to 503 photons fs-1 in cryogenic conditions and 50-260 photons ps-1 over-the-air. These results establish long-term coherent THz emission from superconductors and chart a viable path toward scalable, tunable, solid-state coherent THz laser-on-a-chip platforms, especially for future classical and quantum systems.</p>

In particular, we consider the estimation of centre-of-mass three-momentum magnitude and polar scattering angle through measurements on the internal degrees of freedom (helicity or polarisation) of the scattered particles. Computations are carried out for pure and maximally mixed initial states. The QFIM values are then used to compute the quantum Cramér-Rao lower bounds on the estimations at hand. Further, we compare such ultimate bounds to the classical Fisher information of local polarisation or helicity degrees of freedom.</p>

This approach provides a detailed phase space perspective of fundamental quantum phenomena such as Rabi oscillations, atomic population inversion, and entanglement generation. We further measure the purity of the reduced quantized field state by means of an appropriate Wigner function corresponding to the bosonic field part in order to investigate the entanglement dynamics of the system.</p>

            <p>Superfluorescence (SF), a many-body quantum optics phenomenon, emerges from the collective interactions among self-organized and cooperatively coupled emitters, producing intense burst of ultrashort coherent radiation1-4. While SF has been observed in several solid-state materials5-9, the spontaneous generation of circularly polarized (CP) chiral SF has not been realized. Here, we report room-temperature chiral CP-SF originating from edge states in large-area (>100 um * 100 um), transferable vertically aligned chiral quasi-2D perovskite superlattices. Theoretical quantum optics calculations reveal that chirality-induced photon transport drives the transition from initially incoherent, weakly polarized spontaneous emission to highly polarized CP-SF, amplifying the circular polarization degree up to around 14%. Notably, the polarization helicity is found to flip between forward and backward propagation directions, a characteristic signature of a macroscopic CP dipole transition. Moreover, both the intensity and polarization degree of CP-SF can be tuned under weak magnetic fields, enabling precise control over solid-state quantum light emission at room temperature. Our findings emphasize the crucial role of chirality in establishing large-scale quantum coherence within chiral superlattices, thereby unveiling promising avenues for chirality-controlled quantum spin-optical applications 10,11.</p>

Arranging the atoms in an incommensurate lattice with respect to the radiation wavelength, the Bragg scattering into the cavity can be suppressed by destructive interference: the atomic array is subradiant to the cavity mode under transverse illumination. We show however, that strong collective coupling leads to a drastic modification of the excitation spectrum, as evidenced by well-resolved vacuum Rabi splitting in the intensity of the fluctuations. Furthermore, we demonstrate a significant polarization rotation in the linear scattering off the subradiant array via Raman scattering induced by the strongly coupled vacuum field.</p>

            <h2>Adding Photonic Entanglement to Superradiance by Using Multilevel Atoms</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amir Sivan, Meir Orenstein</p>
            <p>We show here that the photonic states emitted by ensembles of multilevel atoms via a superradiance process exhibit entanglement in the modal (frequency) degree of freedom, making this collective emission process a favorable candidate for a fast, bright and deterministic source of entangled photons. This entanglement is driven by two mechanisms: (i) selective excitation of the atomic ensemble to a superposition state and (ii) degeneracies of the optical transitions due to internal structure of the emitting atoms. The latter induces intricate non-radiative virtual transitions in the ensemble, which create interatomic correlations that are imprinted onto the emitted photons. One of the important outcomes of this complexity is the generation of mode-independent entangled multiphoton states. In addition, we study the dynamics of the correlations of the superradiating multilevel atom ensembles, and demonstrate a case where they exhibit beating in steady-state due to the aforementioned virtual transitions.</p>

            <p>We study the collective decay of an initially inverted ensemble of two-level emitters in two distinct scenarios: when coupled to a squeezed photonic reservoir and when interacting with a one-dimensional waveguide. Using a quantum-state diffusion approach to unravel the emission process, we investigate entanglement and classical correlations along individual quantum trajectories over time. This numerical analysis shows that despite an initial build-up of entanglement and a significant amount of entanglement due to either spin squeezing or dark states at late times, the essential features of the superradiant burst are well described by averages over fully factorizable states. We explain this observation in terms of an almost complete factorization of all 2-local observables, which we identify as a generic property of superradiant decay. Based on this insight, we provide a purely classical theory for the burst in squeezed superradiance, which is both intuitive and exact for a large number of emitters. Moreover, we find that our numerical approach also performs well in the presence of subradiant states, which dominate the slow residual decay of non-uniform ensembles at late times.</p>

            <p>Laughlin's thought experiment of quantized charge pumping is central to understanding the integer quantum Hall effect (IQHE) and the topological origin of its conductance quantization. Its direct experimental observation, however, has been hindered by the difficulty of realizing clean electronic edges. We address this by fabricating ultra-small, lithographically defined contacts on graphene. This creates a Corbino-equivalent system, with well-confined inner edge states. Crucially, the small contact size induces strong energy quantization of the edge states. This quantization allows us to directly resolve the spectral flow associated with Laughlin's pump. By tracing the finite-size resonances of the inner edge, we observe clear oscillations in conductance as a function of magnetic field and carrier density. The oscillation period scales with contact size, consistent with quantized charge transfer. Thus, our results provide a direct observation of the spectral flow underlying Laughlin's pump. The simplicity of the graphene platform makes this approach scalable and robust for exploring fundamental topological effects.</p>

            <p>Quantum key distribution (QKD) represents a cornerstone of secure communication in the quantum era. While discrete-variable QKD (DV-QKD) protocols were historically the first to demonstrate secure key exchange, continuous-variable QKD (CV-QKD) has emerged as a more practical alternative due to its seamless compatibility with current telecommunications infrastructure. CV-QKD relies on coherent and squeezed states of light, offering significant advantages for integration into modern optical networks. This review comprehensively explores the theoretical underpinnings, technological advancements, and practical challenges of CV-QKD. Special attention is given to the role of photonic integrated circuits (PICs) in enabling scalable and efficient implementation of CV-QKD systems. Furthermore, recent advances in machine learning have been leveraged to optimize CV-QKD performance, with data-driven techniques enhancing noise estimation, parameter optimization, and system security. Additionally, tensor networks provide efficient computational tools for analyzing complex quantum correlations, improving the efficiency and robustness of quantum key distribution protocols.

            <p>The resilience of quantum entanglement under irreversible, energy-transferring interactions remains a fundamental question in quantum foundations and emerging quantum technologies. We develop a fully microscopic quantum electrodynamics framework to describe how spatial entanglement evolves when one particle of an entangled pair undergoes dissipative processes such as ionization or inelastic scattering. We show that entanglement decay follows an exponential law governed by recoil-induced momentum diffusion and identify a sharp operational threshold separating quantum-coherent and classical regimes. This threshold depends on whether the cumulative recoil-induced uncertainty exceeds the intrinsic bandwidth of the entangled state. Our results extend decoherence theory beyond Gaussian and weak-coupling models, providing quantitative criteria for entanglement survival in radiative environments and informing the design of robust quantum protocols in quantum sensing, imaging, and radiation-based quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>Quantum reservoir computing is a machine learning framework that offers ease of training compared to other quantum neural network models, as it does not rely on gradient-based optimization. Learning is performed in a single step on the output features measured from the quantum system. Various implementations of quantum reservoir computing have been explored in simulations, with different measured features. Although simulations have shown that quantum reservoirs present advantages in performance compared to classical reservoirs, experimental implementations have remained scarce. This is due to the challenge of obtaining a large number of output features that are nonlinear transformations of the input data. In this work, we propose and experimentally implement a novel quantum reservoir computing platform based on a circuit quantum electrodynamics architecture, consisting of a single cavity mode coupled to a superconducting qubit. We obtain a large number of nonlinear features from a single physical system by encoding the input data in the amplitude of a coherent drive and measuring the cavity state in the Fock basis. We demonstrate classification of two classical tasks with significantly smaller hardware resources and fewer measured features compared to classical neural networks. Our experimental results are supported by numerical simulations that show additional Kerr nonlinearity is beneficial to reservoir performance.

Our approach describes the coupled dynamics of the quantum light field and single and double electron-hole pairs, i.e., excitons and biexcitons, and exactly accounts for Coulomb many-body correlations and carrier band dispersions. Using a simplified yet exact approach, we study a one-dimensional two-band system interacting with a single-mode, two-photon quantum state within a Tavis$\unicode{x2013}$Cummings framework. By employing an exact coherent factorization scheme, the computational complexity is reduced significantly enabling numerical simulations. We also derive a simplified model which includes only the bound $1s$-exciton and biexciton states for comparison. Our simulations reveal distinct single- and two-photon Rabi oscillations, corresponding to photon-exciton and exciton-biexciton transitions. We demonstrate, in particular, that biexciton continuum states significantly modify the dynamics in a way that cannot be captured by simplified models which consider only bound states.

            <p>Cavity magnonics explores the hybridization of photons and magnons within microwave resonators. One of the hallmarks of these systems is their ability to exhibit non-reciprocity, which is a key feature for radio frequency (RF) applications. One way to control non-reciprocal behaviors in cavity magnonics is the design of chiral cavities that allow selective coupling between photons and magnons depending on their polarization. However, a built-in chiral platform to harness and control non-reciprocity remains to be achieved. Here, we experimentally demonstrate controllable non-reciprocity (with an absolute isolation ratio reaching 46 dB) in a chiral resonator loaded with multiple yttrium iron garnet spheres. We develop a theoretical model of the S-parameters based on input-output formalism which highlights the links between the phases occurring in the system and its non-reciprocal behavior. Controllable non-reciprocity in cavity magnonics could enable the development of programmable isolators, circulators, and RF switches with improved performance.

            <p>Qubits based on Majorana Zero Modes (MZMs) in superconductor-semiconductor nanowires have attracted intense interest as a platform for utility-scale quantum computing. These qubits have been predicted to show extremely low error rates due to topological protection of the MZMs, where decoherence processes have been thought to be exponentially suppressed by either the nanowire length or the temperature. However, here we show that 1/f noise, which is ubiquitous in semiconductors, gives rise to a previously unexplored mechanism for Majorana qubit decoherence. The high frequency components of this noise causes quasiparticle excitations in the bulk of the topological superconductor, which in turn result in qubit errors that increase with the length of the nanowire. We calculate the probability of quasiparticle excitation for disorder-free nanowires in the presence of 1/f noise and show that this mechanism limits the decoherence times of the MZM qubits currently being developed to less than a microsecond even for perfectly uniform nanowires with no disorder. This decoherence time is significantly shorter than the time to implement quantum gates using this technology and is also shorter than the decoherence times of qubits in other leading solid-state architectures.</p>

            <p>Quantum correlations and non-classical states are indispensable resources for advancing quantum technologies, and their resilience at finite temperatures is crucial for practical experimental implementations. The two-qubit quantum Rabi model (2QQRM), a natural extension of the quantum Rabi model, describes two qubits coupled to a single bosonic mode and has been extensively studied in cavity quantum electrodynamics, superconducting circuits, and quantum information science. In this work, we investigate the persistence of quantum correlations and non-classical states in the 2QQRM at thermal equilibrium, focusing on the ultrastrong and deep strong coupling regimes. Through a systematic analysis of quantumness quantifiers, we demonstrate the emergence of long-lived quantum correlations, even in the presence of thermal noise. Notably, we uncover striking phenomena arising from the interplay between detuning and deep strong-coupling: in the high-frequency limit, where the qubit energy exceeds the cavity-mode energy, quantum criticality emerges, leading to a high degree of photon squeezing. In contrast, the opposite regime is characterized by robust qubit-qubit quantum correlations. Importantly, we show that both dispersive regimes exhibit quantum features that are remarkably robust to parameter fluctuations, making them advantageous for maintaining quantum coherence.

            <h2>Entangling color centers via magnon-antimagnon pair creation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eric Kleinherbers, Shane P. Kelly, Yaroslav Tserkovnyak</p>
            <p>We present how entanglement between a spatially separated pair of color centers can be created by letting them weakly interact with the quantum fluctuations of a nonequilibrium magnetic environment. To this end, we consider two coupled ferromagnets, one in the ground state and one in an inverted state with respect to an applied magnetic field. The resulting energetic instability leads to a quantum spin current in the vacuum state that is sustained by the creation of magnon-antimagnon pairs at the interface. We show that these quantum fluctuations imprint a steady-state entanglement onto the two dipole-coupled color centers through nonlocal dissipation. We derive conditions for establishing a maximally entangled Bell state. This entanglement is absent in thermal equilibrium.</p>

            <p>Micrometer-scale thin diamond devices are key components for various quantum sensing and networking experiments, including the integration of color centers into optical microcavities. In this work, we introduce a laser-cutting method for patterning microdevices from millimeter-sized diamond membranes. The method can be used to fabricate devices with micrometer thicknesses and edge lengths of typically 10 $\mu m$ to 100 $\mu m$. We compare this method with an established nanofabrication process based on electron-beam lithography, a two-step transfer pattern utilizing a silicon nitride hard mask material, and reactive ion etching. Microdevices fabricated using both methods are bonded to a cavity Bragg mirror and characterized using scanning cavity microscopy. We record two-dimensional cavity finesse maps over the devices, revealing insights about the variation in diamond thickness, surface quality, and strain. The scans demonstrate that devices fabricated by laser-cutting exhibit similar properties to devices obtained by the conventional method. Finally, we show that the devices host optically coherent Tin- and Nitrogen-Vacancy centers suitable for applications in quantum networking.</p>

            <p>Color center spins in diamond nanostructures are a key resource for emerging quantum technologies. Their innate surface proximity makes precise control of diamond surface chemistry essential for optimizing their functionality and charge states. However, conventional surface functionalization methods typically lack the tunability and efficiency required for robust charge-state control. Here, we introduce a deterministic, nonvolatile technique for continuously and efficiently tuning diamond's surface termination via laser-induced oxidation of H-terminated diamond nanopillars. By tracking SiV$^-$ photoluminescence as a charge-state proxy, we uncover the microscopic mechanism of this photocatalytic process through a systematic photon-flux and -energy analysis, where we identify charge-cycling of native defects as sources of optically generated holes driving the desired surface oxidation. Our results suggest that our method applies broadly to other color centers and host materials, offering a versatile tool for on-demand charge-state control and surface engineering in solid-state quantum devices.</p>

            <h2>Spin-Photon Correlations from a Purcell-enhanced Diamond Nitrogen-Vacancy Center Coupled to an Open Microcavity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julius Fischer, Yanik Herrmann, Cornelis F. J. Wolfs, Stijn Scheijen, Maximilian Ruf, Ronald Hanson</p>
            <p>An efficient interface between a spin qubit and single photons is a key enabling system for quantum science and technology. We report on a coherently controlled diamond nitrogen-vacancy center electron spin qubit that is optically interfaced with an open microcavity. Through Purcell enhancement and an asymmetric cavity design, we achieve efficient collection of resonant photons, while on-chip microwave lines allow for spin qubit control at a 10 MHz Rabi frequency. With the microcavity tuned to resonance with the nitrogen-vacancy center's optical transition, we use excited state lifetime measurements to determine a Purcell factor of 7.3 $\pm$ 1.6. Upon pulsed resonant excitation, we find a coherent photon detection probability of 0.5 % per pulse. Although this result is limited by the finite excitation probability, it already presents an order of magnitude improvement over the solid immersion lens devices used in previous quantum network demonstrations. Furthermore, we use resonant optical pulses to initialize and read out the electron spin. By combining the efficient interface with spin qubit control, we generate two-qubit and three-qubit spin-photon states and measure heralded Z-basis correlations between the photonic time-bin qubits and the spin qubit.</p>

            <h2>Measurement-based quantum computing with qudit stabilizer states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alena Romanova, Wolfgang Dür</p>
            <p>We show how to perform measurement-based quantum computing on qudits (high-dimensional quantum systems) using alternative resource states beyond the cluster state. Here, the entangling gate, characterizing the resource state, is a diagonal or block-diagonal Clifford operation instead of the usual controlled-phase gate for cluster states. This simple change has remarkable consequences: the applied entangling operation determines an intrinsic single-qudit gate associated with the resource that drives the quantum computation when performing single-qudit measurements on the resource state. We prove a condition for the intrinsic gate allowing for the measurement-based implementation of arbitrary single-qudit unitaries. Furthermore, for prime-power-dimensional qudits, we demonstrate that the complexity of the realization depends linearly on the dimension and the Pauli order of the intrinsic gate so that different entangling gates are associated with different computational overheads. In particular, we provide two examples of qutrit resource states, which allow more efficient quantum information transport and processing than the qutrit cluster state. Finally, we discuss the required two-dimensional geometry of the resource state for universal measurement-based quantum computing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joan Agustí, Christian M. F. Schneider, Kirill G. Fedorov, Stefan Filipp, Peter Rabl</p>
            <p>We describe a novel scheme for the generation of stationary entanglement between two separated qubits that are driven by a purely thermal photon source. While in this scenario the qubits remain in a separable state at all times when the source is broadband, i.e. Markovian, the qubits relax into an entangled steady state once the bandwidth of the thermal source is sufficiently reduced. We explain this phenomenon by the appearance of a quasiadiabatic dark state and identify the most relevant nonadiabatic corrections that eventually lead to a breakdown of the entangled state, once the temperature is too high. This effect demonstrates how the non-Markovianity of an otherwise incoherent reservoir can be harnessed for quantum communication applications in optical, microwave, and phononic networks. As two specific examples, we discuss the use of filtered room-temperature noise as a passive resource for entangling distant superconducting qubits in a cryogenic quantum link or solid-state spin qubits in a phononic quantum channel.</p>

            <p>Violation of Bell inequalities is an essential requirement for many quantum information and communication protocols. In high-dimensional systems, Bell inequality tests face the challenge of implementing genuinely multi-outcome measurements, since the emulation of these with separate dichotomic projections opens a binarisation loophole that local hidden variable theories can exploit. Here we show that the joint spectral intensity of a two-photon entangled state contains access to the necessary multi-outcome measurements to overcome this obstacle and certify nonlocality for high-dimensional states. This result is contrary to the belief that the joint spectral intensity is a phase-insensitive quantity and does not have sufficient information to certify entanglement or nonlocality. Using this approach, we violate the CGLMP Bell inequality up to dimension d = 8, all with negligible p-values, and for the first time close the binarisation loophole in high-dimensional Bell experiments. Guaranteeing nonlocal correlations using frequency-only measurements removes the technological hurdle of measurements in the temporal domain, thus greatly simplifying any practical implementation of future high-dimensional quantum information protocols.</p>

            <p>Semiclassical instanton theory captures nuclear quantum effects such as tunnelling in chemical reactions. It was originally derived from two different starting points, the flux correlation function and the ImF premise. In pursuit of a nonadiabatic rate theory, a number of methods have been proposed; almost all based on the less rigorous ImF premise. Only recently, we introduced a rigorous nonadiabatic ring-polymer instanton rate theory in the flux-correlation function framework which successfully bridges from the Born-Oppenheimer to the golden-rule limit. Here, we examine the previous ImF-based attempts and conclude that they do not capture the two limits correctly. In particular, we will highlight how the last in a series of developments, called mean-field ring-polymer instanton theory, breaks down in the golden-rule limit. We develop a new nonadiabatic ImF rate theory to remedy the failings of previous attempts while taking inspiration from them. We also consider the crossover from deep tunnelling to a high-temperature rate theory. We test our new nonadiabatic ImF theory on a range of models including asymmetric and multidimensional systems and we show reliable results for the deep-tunnelling regime but limitations for the related high-temperature rate theory.</p>

            <p>The characterization of quantum phase transitions is a fundamental task for the understanding of quantum phases of matter, with a number of potential applications in quantum technologies. In this work, we use digital quantum simulation as a resource to theoretically and experimentally study quantum phase transitions. More specifically, we implement the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm to the one-dimensional spin-$1/2$ transverse-field Ising chain in the presence of boundary magnetic fields. Such fields can induce a rich phase diagram, including a first-order line and also a continuous wetting transition, which is a quantum version of the classical wetting surface phenomenon. We present results for noiseless simulations of the associated quantum circuits as well as hardware results taken from a superconducting quantum processor. For different regions of the phase diagram, the quantum algorithm allows us to predict the critical value of the magnetic fields responsible for either the first or second-order transitions occuring in the system.</p>

We further extend to witness both quantum coherence and Bell nonlocality. We finally perform experiments with unified two-photon states, and validate the uncertainty principle, coherence and Bell nonlocality within the experimental error. Our methods for witnessing quantumness are valuable in characterizing quantum correlations in quantum information processing.</p>

            <p>Quantum simulators offer a new opportunity for the experimental exploration of non-equilibrium quantum many-body dynamics, which have traditionally been characterized through expectation values or entanglement measures, based on density matrices of the system. Recently, a more general framework for studying quantum many-body systems based on projected ensembles has been introduced, revealing novel quantum phenomena, such as deep thermalization in chaotic systems. Here, we experimentally investigate a chaotic quantum many-body system using projected ensembles on a superconducting processor with 16 qubits on a square lattice. Our results provide direct evidence of deep thermalization by observing a Haar-distributed projected ensemble for the steady states within a charge-conserved sector. Moreover, by introducing an ensemble-averaged entropy as a metric, we establish a benchmark for many-body information leakage from the system to its environment. Our work paves the way for studying quantum many-body dynamics using projected ensembles and shows a potential implication for advancing quantum simulation techniques.</p>

            <p>Searching for an unknown marked vertex on a given graph (also known as spatial search) is an extensively discussed topic in the area of quantum algorithms, with a plethora of results based on different quantum walk models and targeting various types of graphs. Most of these algorithms have a non-zero probability of failure. In recent years, there have been some efforts to design quantum spatial search algorithms with $100\%$ success probability. However, these works either only work for very special graphs or only for the case where there is only one marked vertex. In this work, we propose a different and elegant approach to quantum spatial search, obtaining deterministic quantum search algorithms that can find a marked vertex with certainty on any Laplacian integral graph with any predetermined proportion of marked vertices. Thus, this work discovers the largest class of graphs so far that allow deterministic quantum search, making it easy to design deterministic quantum search algorithms for many graphs, including the different graphs discussed in previous works, in a unified framework.</p>

            <p>Reconciling quantum mechanics and general relativity remains one of the most profound challenges in modern physics. The BMV (Bose-Marletto-Vedral) experiment can assess the quantum nature of gravity by testing whether gravitational interactions can generate entanglement between quantum systems. In this work, we show that entanglement can be generated by gravity without requiring spacetime superpositions or quantum spacetime degrees of freedom by using mediators that do not satisfy the usual property of local tomography when coupling to quantum matter. Specifically, we showcase how entanglement can be generated using three distinct toy models that display non-locally tomographic couplings between quantum matter and a locally classical gravitational mediator. These models include (i) fermionic systems with the parity superselection rule, (ii) non-Abelian anyonic systems, and (iii) a novel bit anti-bit model. Our results demonstrate a crucial point: a gravitational mediator which does not exhibit superpositions of its classical basis but still qualifies as non-classical via non-locally tomographic coupling mechanisms can generate entanglement through local interactions. This work also underscores the importance of relaxing local tomography in exploring the quantum-gravitational interface. It provides a novel perspective on the role of spacetime degrees of freedom in entanglement generation through local interactions.</p>

            <p>This work presents Quantum Adaptive Search (QAGS), a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for the global optimization of multivariate functions. The method employs an adaptive mechanism that dynamically narrows the search space based on a quantum-estimated probability distribution of the objective function. A quantum state encodes information about solution quality through an appropriate complex amplitude mapping, enabling the identification of the most promising regions, and thus progressively tightening the search bounds; then a classical optimizer performs local refinement of the solution. The analysis demonstrates that QAGS ensures a contraction of the search space toward global optima, with controlled computational complexity. The numerical results on the benchmark functions show that, compared to the classical methods, QAGS achieves higher accuracy while offering advantages in both time and space complexity.</p>

QSP is an algorithm that uses single-qubit dynamics to perform a polynomial function transformation.

We can map parameters from QSP to AIM to implement QSP-like evolution with nonadiabatic, high-amplitude external drives. By choosing AIM parameters that control non-adiabatic transition parameters (such as driving amplitude $A$, frequency $\omega$, and signal timing), one can achieve polynomial approximations and increase robustness in quantum circuits. The analogy presented here between QSP and AIM can be useful as a way to directly implement the QSP algorithm on quantum systems and obtain all the benefits from the fast Landau-Zener-Stuckelberg-Majotana (LZSM) quantum logic gates.</p>

            <p>We study the optical response of a binary system of identical atoms in which one of them is excited by an incoherent pump. %We study the properties of photon scattering, absorption and emission, together with the time evolution of the atomic system. %This allows us to characterize and eventually manipulate the state of the system, paving the way for prospective applications in quantum information processing. Applying the diagrammatic formalism developed in Donaire [Phys. Rev. A104, 043704 (2021)], it is shown how scattering, absorption, stimulated emission, spontaneous emission and resonant energy transfer can be tailored by varying i) the interatomic distance, which governs the interference effects of the emitted radiation; and ii) the pump rate, which determines the population of the atomic levels. It is found that, for sufficiently strong pumping, the collective component of the extinction cross-section becomes negligible, regardless of the interatomic distance, as optical gains compensate for losses, and the total extinction cross-section is reduced to less than half of its value in the absence of pumping. In contrast, at weak pumping and short interatomic distances, interference effects lead to a significant suppression of the extinction cross-section relative to that of two noninteracting atoms.</p>

Both resonant and off-resonant couplings of the QDs to the cavity modes are considered, and we analyze the resulting radiance witness as well as the intra- and inter-mode photon correlations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that phonon-induced cooperative two-mode two-photon processes significantly enhance the radiance witness. This enhancement is quantified by evaluating the emission and absorption rates associated with both single-mode and two-mode two-photon transitions. Finally, we compare the radiance witness and emission spectral linewidths for QDs coupled to single-mode and bimodal cavities, revealing that an increase in radiance witness is accompanied by a narrowing of the emission linewidth.</p>

            <p>Quantum photonic technologies rely on the ability to generate, manipulate, and interfere indistinguishable single photons on a scalable platform. Among the various approaches, spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) remains one of the most widely used methods for generating entangled or pure photon pairs. However most integrated SPDC sources relying on co-propagating geometries have a limited purity of heralded photons, or require lossy filtering. Type-2 SPDC processes can produce pure separable photons but typically suffer from lower efficiency and added complexity due to polarisation management. Here we show the first integrated counter-propagating photon-pair source on lithium niobate on insulator, where signal and idler photons are generated in opposite directions. The counter-propagating geometry leads to spectrally uncorrelated photon pairs without spectral filtering. The joint spectral intensity measurements and unheralded $g^{(2)}$ correlations, yield purities of (92$\pm$3)%. Interference between two independent sources achieves heralded visibilities of (71$\pm$3)%, confirming the scalability of the platform. These results establish a new route toward integrated, high-purity, and tunable photon sources. The demonstrated counter-propagating geometry offers a scalable solution for quantum photonic networks.</p>

            <p>Advanced photonic quantum technologies -- from quantum key distribution to quantum computing -- require on-chip sources of entangled photons that are both efficient and readily scalable. In this theoretical study, we demonstrate the generation of polarization-entangled Bell states in structurally simple waveguides by exploiting the intrinsic properties of nonlinear crystals. We thereby circumvent elaborate phase-matching strategies that commonly involve the spatial modulation of a waveguide's linear or nonlinear optical properties. We derive general criteria for the second-order susceptibility tensor that enable the generation of cross-polarized photon pairs via spontaneous parametric down-conversion in single-material waveguides. Based on these criteria, we systematically categorize all birefringent, non-centrosymmetric crystal classes in terms of their suitability. Using coupled mode theory, we then numerically analyze cuboid waveguides made from two materials that are highly relevant to integrated photonics: lithium niobate, a well-established platform, and barium titanate, an emerging alternative. We find that barium titanate consistently outperforms lithium niobate by providing a higher nonlinear efficiency and high concurrence over a significantly broader spectral range. These findings outline a practical route toward highly efficient, fabrication-friendly, and scalable sources of polarization-entangled photons for integrated quantum photonic circuits.</p>

            <h2>Observing Laughlin's pump using quantized edge states in graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bjarke S. Jessen, Maëlle Kapfer, YuhaoZhao, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Cory R. Dean, Oded Zilberberg</p>
            <p>Laughlin's thought experiment of quantized charge pumping is central to understanding the integer quantum Hall effect (IQHE) and the topological origin of its conductance quantization. Its direct experimental observation, however, has been hindered by the difficulty of realizing clean electronic edges. We address this by fabricating ultra-small, lithographically defined contacts on graphene. This creates a Corbino-equivalent system, with well-confined inner edge states. Crucially, the small contact size induces strong energy quantization of the edge states. This quantization allows us to directly resolve the spectral flow associated with Laughlin's pump. By tracing the finite-size resonances of the inner edge, we observe clear oscillations in conductance as a function of magnetic field and carrier density. The oscillation period scales with contact size, consistent with quantized charge transfer. Thus, our results provide a direct observation of the spectral flow underlying Laughlin's pump. The simplicity of the graphene platform makes this approach scalable and robust for exploring fundamental topological effects.</p>

            <h2>Imaginary Time Formalism for Causal Nonlinear Response Functions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sounak Sinha, Barry Bradlyn</p>
            <p>It is well established that causal linear response functions can be found by computing the much simpler imaginary time-ordered Matsubara functions and performing an analytic continuation. This principle is the basis for much of our understanding of linear response for interacting and disordered systems, via diagrammatic perturbation theory. Similar imaginary-time approaches have recently been introduced for computing nonlinear response functions as well, although the rigorous connection between Matsubara and causal nonlinear response functions has not been clearly elucidated. In this work, we provide a proof of this connection to all orders in perturbation theory. Using an equations of motion approach, we show by induction that casual nonlinear response functions at every order can be obtained from an analytic continuation of an appropriate time-ordered Matsubara function. We demonstrate this connection explicitly for second order response functions in the Lehmann representation. As a byproduct of our approach, we derive an explicit expression for the Lehmann representation of $n$-th order response functions by solving the equations of motion. We also use our result to find an analytic spectral density representation for both causal response functions and Matsubara functions. Finally, we show how our results lead to a family of generalized sum rules, focusing explicitly on the asymptotic expression for $n$-th harmonic generation rate.</p>

            <h2>Symmetry Sectors in Chord Space and Relational Holography in the DSSYK</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sergio E. Aguilar-Gutierrez</p>
            <p>Can there be multiple bulk theories for the same boundary theory? We answer this affirmatively in the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) model using the tools of constrained systems. We find different symmetry sectors generated by specific constraints within the chord Hilbert space of the DSSYK with matter. Each sector corresponds to a different bulk description. These include chord parity symmetry, corresponding to End-Of-The-World (ETW) branes and Euclidean wormholes in sine dilaton gravity; and relative time-translations in a doubled DSSYK model (as a single DSSYK with an infinitely heavy chord) used in de Sitter holography. We derive the partition functions and thermal correlation functions in the ETW brane and Euclidean wormhole systems from the boundary theory. We deduce the holographic dictionary by matching geodesic lengths in the bulk with the spread complexity of the parity-gauged DSSYK. The Euclidean wormholes of fixed size are perturbatively stable, and their baby universe Hilbert space is non-trivial only when matter is added. We conclude studying the constraints in the path integral of the doubled DSSYK. We derive the gauge invariant operator algebra of one of the DSSYKs dressed to the other one and discuss its holographic interpretation.</p>

            <h2>Observers and Timekeepers: From the Page-Wootters Mechanism to the Gravitational Path Integral</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zixia Wei</p>
            <p>Quantum gravity in a closed universe faces two a priori distinct yet seemingly related issues: the problem of time and the fact that its Hilbert space dimension is one. Both have been argued to be resolvable by formulating physics relative to an observer. Using a simple gravitational path integral model, we explain that the two issues arise from two distinct non-perturbative effects: the former from summing over metrics and the latter from summing over topologies. We then revisit the Page-Wootters mechanism, one of the earliest frameworks for formulating quantum mechanics relative to an observer, see how it applies to both issues, and introduce some new ingredients. In particular, we emphasize a hierarchy between an observer and a timekeeper. An observer is a subsystem of the universe whose specification results in a nontrivial Hilbert space, while a timekeeper is an observer with a specified history that can be used as a reference for the time of the environment and experiences a nontrivial time evolution. Finally, we propose a method for incorporating observers and timekeepers into the gravitational path integral and show that implementing a timekeeper in this way furnishes an observer-dependent generalization of holography.</p>

            <h2>Correlated reaction coordinate motion produces non-additive rate enhancement for electron and energy transfer in multi-acceptor structures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hanggai Nuomin, Feng-Feng Song, Peng Zhang, David N. Beratan</p>
            <p>Molecular structures with multiple donor, bridge, or acceptor units can display quantum interference effects that influence electron and energy transfer (ET and EnT) rates. Recent experiments found a 4- to 5-fold increase in ET rates for donor-acceptor structures with two acceptors compared to one. This result is surprising: simple classical or quantum analysis suggests a factor of two rate enhancement. We analyze the coupling interactions in multiple acceptor systems and find that rate enhancements beyond additive effects arise from acceptor-acceptor interactions that: 1) shift the reaction free energy, 2) change the donor-acceptor couplings, and 3) alter the reaction-coordinate motion. Consideration of these effects explains the observed rates in multi-acceptor systems and suggests strategies to tailor energy and electron transfer kinetics.</p>

            <p>The occurrence of Landau levels in quantum mechanics is well known when a charged particle is subjected to a uniform magnetic field. Considering the recent interest in the electronic properties of graphene which admits a dispersion relation which is linear in the momentum near the Dirac points, we revisit the problem of Landau levels in the spirit of the Dirac Hamiltonian and ask if there are certain non-uniform magnetic fields which also lead to a spectrum consisting of the Landau levels. The answer, as we show, is in the affirmative. In particular, by considering isospectral deformations of the uniform magnetic field, we present explicit expressions for non-uniform magnetic fields that are strictly isospectral to their uniform counterpart, thus supporting the Landau levels.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sankar Das Sarma, Katharina Laubscher, Haining Pan, Jay D. Sau, Tudor D. Stanescu</p>
            <p>One of the most important physical effects in condensed matter physics is the Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC), introduced in seminal works by Emmanuel Rashba. In this article, we discuss, describe, and review (providing critical perspectives on) the crucial role of RSOC in the currently active research area of topological quantum computation. Most, if not all, of the current experimental topological quantum computing platforms use the idea of Majorana zero modes as the qubit ingredient because of their non-Abelian anyonic property of having an intrinsic quantum degeneracy, which enables nonlocal encoding protected by a topological energy gap. It turns out that RSOC is a crucial ingredient in producing a low-dimensional topological superconductor in the laboratory, and such topological superconductors naturally have isolated localized midgap Majorana zero modes. In addition, increasing the RSOC strength enhances the topological gap, thus enhancing the topological immunity of the qubits to decoherence. Thus, Rashba's classic work on SOC may lead not only to the realization of localized non-Abelian anyons, but also fault tolerant quantum computation.</p>

            <p>In 2020, Ji et al. [arXiv:2001.04383 and Comm.~ACM 64}, 131 (2021)] provided a proof that the complexity classes $\text{MIP}^\ast$ and $\text{RE}$ are equivalent. This result implies a negative resolution of Tsirelson's problem, that is, $C_{qa}$ (the closure of the set of tensor product correlations) and $C_{qc}$ (the set of commuting correlations) can be separated by a hyperplane (that is, a Bell-like inequality). In particular, there are correlations produced by commuting measurements (a finite number of them and with a finite number of outcomes) on an infinite-dimensional quantum system which cannot be approximated by sequences of finite-dimensional tensor product correlations. Here, we point out that there are four logical possibilities of this result. Each possibility is interesting because it fundamentally challenges the nature of spacially separated systems in different ways. We list open problems for making progress for deciding which of the possibilities is correct.</p>

            <h2>Scrambling in Ising spin systems with periodic transverse magnetic fields</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rohit Kumar Shukla</p>
            <p>Scrambling of quantum information in both integrable and nonintegrable Floquet spin systems is studied. Our study employs tripartite mutual information (TMI), with negative TMI serving as an indicator of scrambling, where a more negative value suggests a higher degree of scrambling. Both integrable and nonintegrable Floquet systems display scrambling behavior across all periods lying between 0 to {\pi}/2, except at self-dual point({\pi}/4). Nonintegrable Floquet systems exhibit more pronounced scrambling compared to integrable ones across all periods. The degree of scrambling increases as we move towards the self-dual point (but not at the self-dual point), regardless of the initial states. TMI demonstrates periodic behavior at the self-dual point, with a period matching the system size in the case of the integrable system while displaying complex patterns in the non-integrable system. The initial growth of scrambling in both integrable and nonintegrable Floquet systems manifests as a power-law increase for small periods, followed by a sudden jump in scrambling near the self-dual point.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yannick Deville, Alain Deville</p>
            <p>Quantum Process Tomography (QPT) methods aim at identifying, i.e. estimating, a quantum process. QPT is a major quantum information processing tool, since it especially allows one to experimentally characterize the actual behavior of quantum gates, that may be used as the building blocks of quantum computers. We here consider unitary, possibly dense (i.e. without sparsity constraints) processes, which corresponds to isolated systems. Moreover, we develop QPT methods that are applicable to a significant number of qubits and hence to a high state space dimension, which allows one to tackle more complex problems. Using the unitarity of the process allows us to develop methods that first achieve part of QPT by performing an eigenanalysis of the estimated density matrix of a process output. Building upon this idea, we first develop a class of complete algorithms that are single-stage, in the sense that they use only one eigendecomposition. We then extend them to multiple-stage algorithms (i.e. with several eigendecompositions), in order to address high-dimensional state spaces while being less limited by the estimation errors made when using an arbitrary given Quantum State Tomography (QST) algorithm as a building block of our overall methods. We first propose two-stage methods and we then extend them to dichotomic methods, whose number of stages increases with the considered state space dimension. The relevance of our methods is validated with simulations. Single-stage and two-stage methods efficiently apply up to 13 qubits on a standard PC (with 16 GB of RAM). Multi-stage methods yield an even higher accuracy.</p>

            <p>The transition dynamics of two-state systems with time-dependent energy levels, first considered by Landau, Zener, Majorana, and Stückelberg, is one of the basic models in quantum physics and has been used to describe various physical systems. We propose here a generalization of the Landau-Zener (LZ) problem characterized by distinct paths of the instantaneous eigenstates as the system evolves in time while keeping the instantaneous eigenenergies exactly as in the standard LZ model. We show that these paths play an essential role in the transition probability $P$ between the two states, and can lead to a substantial reduction of $P$, being possible even to achieve $P=0$ in an instructive extreme case, and also to large $P$ even in the absence of any anticrossing point. The partial LZ model can describe valley transition dynamics during charge and spin shuttling in semiconductor quantum dots.</p>

            <p>Standard compilers for quantum circuits decompose arbitrary single-qubit gates into a sequence of physical X(pi/2) pulses and virtual-Z phase gates. Consequently, many circuit classes implement different logic operations but have an equivalent structure of physical pulses that only differ by changes in virtual phases. When many structurally-equivalent circuits need to be measured, generating sequences for each circuit is unnecessary and cumbersome, since compiling and loading sequences onto classical control hardware is a primary bottleneck in quantum circuit execution. In this work, we develop a hardware-assisted protocol for executing parameterized circuits on our FPGA-based control hardware, QubiC. This protocol relies on a hardware-software co-design technique in which software identifies structural equivalency in circuits and "peels" off the relevant parameterized angles to reduce the overall waveform compilation time. The hardware architecture then performs real-time "stitching" of the parameters in the circuit to measure circuits that implement a different overall logical operation. This work demonstrates significant speed ups in the total execution time for several different classes of quantum circuits.</p>

            <p>Dynamic quantum simulation is a leading application for achieving quantum advantage. However, high circuit depths remain a limiting factor on near-term quantum hardware. We present a compilation algorithm based on Matrix Product Operators for generating compressed circuits enabling real-time simulation on digital quantum computers, that for a given depth are more accurate than all Trotterizations of the same depth. By the efficient use of environment tensors, the algorithm is scalable in depth beyond prior work, and we present circuit compilations of up to 64 layers of $SU(4)$ gates. Surpassing only 1D circuits, our approach can flexibly target a particular quasi-2D gate topology. We demonstrate this by compiling a 52-qubit 2D Transverse-Field Ising propagator onto the IBM Heavy-Hex topology. For all circuit depths and widths tested, we produce circuits with smaller errors than all equivalent depth Trotter unitaries, corresponding to reductions in error by up to 4 orders of magnitude and circuit depth compressions with a factor of over 6.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Token Obfuscation via Superposition: A Post-Quantum Security Framework Using Multi-Basis Verification and Entropy-Driven Evolution</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S.M. Yousuf Iqbal Tomal, Abdullah Al Shafin</p>
            <p>Traditional cryptographic techniques, including token obfuscation, are increasingly vulnerable to quantum attacks due to advancements in quantum computing. Quantum algorithms such as Shor's and Grover's pose significant threats to classical security methods, necessitating quantum-resistant alternatives. This study proposes a quantum-based approach to token obfuscation that leverages superposition and multi-basis verification to enhance security against quantum adversaries. Tokens are encoded in quantum superposition states, ensuring probabilistic concealment until measured. A multi-basis verification protocol strengthens authentication by requiring validation across multiple quantum measurement bases. Additionally, a quantum decay protocol and token refresh mechanism dynamically manage the token lifecycle to prevent prolonged exposure and replay attacks. The model was tested through quantum simulations, evaluating entropy quality, adversarial robustness, and token verification reliability. Experimental validation demonstrates an entropy quality score of 0.9996, a 0% attack success rate across five adversarial models, and a 67% false positive rate, indicating strict security constraints. These findings confirm the effectiveness of quantum-based token obfuscation in preventing unauthorized reconstruction. The proposed approach provides a foundation for post-quantum cryptographic security by integrating entropy-driven state transformations, dynamic token evolution, and multi-basis verification. Future work will focus on optimizing computational efficiency and testing real-world implementations on quantum hardware.</p>

            <p>Recent progress in manipulating individual quantum systems enables the exploration of engines exploiting non-classical resources. One of the most appealing is the energy provided by the inherent backaction of quantum measurements. While a handful of experiments have investigated the inner dynamics of engines fueled by measurement backaction, powering a useful task by such an engine is missing. Here we demonstrate the amplification of microwave signals by an engine fueled by repeated quantum measurements of a superconducting transmon qubit. Using feedback, the engine acts as a quantum Maxwell demon operating without a hot thermal source. Measuring the gain of this amplification constitutes a direct probing of the work output of the engine, in contrast with inferring the work by measuring the qubit state along its evolution. Observing a good agreement between both work estimation methods, our experiment validates the accuracy of the indirect method. We characterize the long-term stability of the engine as well as its robustness to transmon decoherence, loss and drifts. Our experiment exemplifies a practical usage of the energy brought by quantum measurement backaction.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of a non-Hermitian SSH model that arises out of the no-click limit of a monitored SSH model in the Krylov space. We find that the saturation timescale of the complexity associated with the spread of the state in the Krylov subspace increases with the measurement rate, and late time behaviour differs across the $\mathrm{PT}$ symmetry transition point. Furthermore, extending the notion of this complexity for subsystems in Krylov space, we find that the scaling of its late time value with subsystem size shows a discontinuous jump across the $\mathrm{PT}$ transition point, indicating that it can be used as a suitable order parameter for such transition but not for the measurement-induced transition. Finally, we show that a generalized measure in the Krylov subspace, which contains information about the correlation landscape, such as Quantum Fisher information, which also possesses some structural similarity with the complexity functional, can be a promising probe of the measurement-induced phase.</p>

            <p>Bipartite quantum states with higher Schmidt numbers have been shown to outperform those with lower Schmidt numbers in various quantum information processing tasks, highlighting the operational advantage of entanglement dimensionality. Certifying the Schmidt number of such states is therefore crucial for efficient resource utilization. Ideally, this certification should rely as little as possible on the certifying devices to ensure robustness against their potential imperfections. Fully device-independent certification via Bell-nonlocal games offer strong robustness but suffers from fundamental limitations: it cannot certify the Schmidt number of all entangled states. We demonstrate that this insufficiency of Bell-nonlocal games is not limited to entangled states that do not exhibit Bell-nonlocality. Specifically, we prove the existence of Bell-nonlocal states whose Schmidt number cannot be certified by any Bell-nonlocal game when the parties are restricted to local projective measurements. To overcome this, we develop a measurement-device-independent certification method based on semi-quantum nonlocal games, which assume trusted preparation devices but treat measurement devices as black boxes. We prove that for any bipartite state with Schmidt number exceeding r, there exists a semi-quantum nonlocal game that can certify its Schmidt number. Finally, we provide an explicit construction of such a semi-quantum nonlocal game based on an optimal Schmidt number witness operator.</p>

            <p>We show that a large class of 2-adic Schrödinger equations is the scaling limit of certain continuous-time quantum Markov chains (CTQMCs). Practically, a discretization of such an equation gives a CTQMC. As a practical result, we construct new types of continuous time quantum walks (CTQWs) on graphs using two symmetric matrices. One matrix describes the transport between nodes in one direction, while the second describes the transport between nodes in the opposite direction. This construction includes, as a particular case, the CTQWs constructed using adjacency matrices. The final goal of this work is to contribute to the understanding of the foundations of quantum mechanics (QM) and the role of the hypothesis of the discreteness of space. The connection between 2-adic QM and CTQWs shows that 2-adic QM has a physical meaning. 2-Adic QM is a nonlocal theory because the Hamiltonians used are nonlocal operators, and consequently, spooky actions at a distance are allowed. However, this theory is not a mathematical toy. The experimental confirmation of the violation of Bell's inequality implies that this theory allows realism. We pointed out several new research problems connected with the foundations of quantum mechanics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xing M. Wang</p>
            <p>We propose the Branched Hilbert Subspace Interpretation (BHSI) as an alternative perspective on quantum measurement. BHSI describes measurement as a unitary branching of the local Hilbert space into decoherent, independent, and unitarily evolving subspaces, while updating observer states (through their equipment) by causally engaging and disengaging operators. Unlike the Copenhagen Interpretation (CI), BHSI avoids wave function collapse while maintaining the Born rule through the branch weights associated with the initial system state. Unlike the Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI), BHSI sidesteps parallel worlds by entangling branches with the local environment within a single world. We compare BHSI features with those of CI, MWI, and Bohmian Mechanics (BM). We investigate its implications for the double-slit experiment, Bell tests, Wigner and his friend, black hole radiation, and the delayed-choice quantum eraser. We examine quantum teleportation, demonstrating that locally controlled decoherence and recoherence processes (CDRP) can be observed. Specifically, we suggest experiments using modern Stern-Gerlach interferometers (SGI) to visualize the CDRP, measure branch weights that encode the Born rule, and predict the electromagnetic (EM) phase shift resulting from the independent unitary evolution of decoherent branches. BHSI thus provides a minimalist alternative to interpretations based on collapse or many-worlds.</p>

            <p>Quantum emitters are a key resource in quantum technologies, microscopy, and other applications. The ability to rapidly detect them is useful both for quality control in engineered emitter arrays and for high-contrast imaging of naturally occurring emitters. Using full photon-counting statistics and optimal Bayesian hypothesis testing, we show that extended Hong-Ou-Mandel interference between quantum emission and a coherent field enables orders-of-magnitude speed-ups in emitter detection under realistic noise and loss. Strikingly, the performance advantage improves as loss and background noise increase, and persists for incoherent emission. Taken together with prior demonstrations of extended Hong-Ou-Mandel interference, this suggest that substantial performance gains are achievable with current technology under realistic, non-ideal conditions. This offers a new approach to fast, low-intensity imaging and for emitter characterization in large-scale quantum systems. Fundamentally, the discovery that quantum interference and measurements, used together, are more robust to both loss and noise than standard measurement techniques opens the possibility of broad applications across quantum metrology.</p>

Our most stringent limit on the coupling strength is $g_{B - L} \lesssim 2.98 \times 10^{-21}$. We propose the POLONAISE (Probing Oscillations using Levitated Objects for Novel Accelerometry in Searches of Exotic physics) experiment, featuring short-, medium-, and long-term upgrades that will give us leading sensitivity in a wide mass range and demonstrating the promise of this novel quantum sensing technology in the hunt for dark matter.</p>

            <h2>Controlled probing of localization effects in the non-Hermitian Aubry-André model via topolectrical circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dipendu Halder, Saurabh Basu</p>
            <p>Anderson localization and the non-Hermitian skin effect are two distinct confinement phenomena of the eigenfunctions that are driven, respectively, by disorder and nonreciprocity. Understanding their interplay within a unified framework offers valuable insights into the localization properties of low-dimensional systems. To this end, we investigate a non-Hermitian version of the celebrated Aubry-André model, which serves as an ideal platform due to its unique self-dual properties and ability to demonstrate a delocalization-localization transition in one dimension. Interestingly, in our setting, the competition between Anderson localization and the skin effect can be precisely controlled via the complex phase of the quasiperiodic disorder. Additionally, by analyzing the time evolution, we demonstrate that quantum jumps between the skin states and the Anderson-localized states occur in the theoretical model. Further, to gain support for our theoretical predictions in an experimental platform, we propose a topolectrical circuit featuring an interface that separates two distinct electrical circuit networks. The voltage profile of the circuit exhibits confinement at the interface, analogous to the skin effect, while the phenomenon of Anderson localization in the circuit can be perceived via a predicted localization behavior near the excitation node, rather than exhibiting sudden non-Hermitian jumps, as observed in the tight-binding framework. This interplay leads to a spatially tunable localization of the output voltage of the circuit. Our findings provide deeper insights into the controlled confinement of the eigenstates of the non-Hermitian Aubry-André model by designing analogous features in topolectrical circuits, opening avenues in the fabrication of advanced electronic systems such as highly sensitive sensors and efficient devices for information transfer and communication.</p>

            <h2>Improved Honeycomb and Hyperhoneycomb Lattice Hamiltonians for Quantum Simulations of Non-Abelian Gauge Theories</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marc Illa, Martin J. Savage, Xiaojun Yao</p>
            <p>Improved Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonians for quantum simulations of non-Abelian Yang-Mills gauge theories are developed for honeycomb (2+1D) and hyperhoneycomb (3+1D) spatial tessellations. This is motivated by the desire to identify lattices for quantum simulations that involve only 3-link vertices among the gauge field group spaces in order to reduce the complexity in applications of the plaquette operator. For the honeycomb lattice, we derive a classically ${\cal O}(b^2)$-improved Hamiltonian, with $b$ being the lattice spacing. Tadpole improvement via the mean-field value of the plaquette operator is used to provide the corresponding quantum improvements. We have identified the (non-chiral) hyperhoneycomb as a candidate spatial tessellation for 3+1D quantum simulations of gauge theories, and determined the associated ${\cal O}(b)$-improved Hamiltonian.</p>

            <p>Femtosecond laser-writing offers distinct capabilities for fabrication, including three-dimensional, multi-material, and sub-diffraction-limited patterning. In particular, demonstrations of laser-written quantum emitters and photonic devices with superior optical properties have attracted attention. Recently, gallium nitride (GaN) has been reported to host quantum emitters with narrow and bright zero-phonon photoluminescence from ultraviolet to telecom ranges. However, emitters formed during epitaxy are randomly positioned, and until now, it has not been possible to fabricate quantum emitters in ordered arrays. In this paper, we employ femtosecond laser writing to create nano-ablations with sub-diffraction-limited diameter, and use rapid thermal annealing to activate co-located stable emitters. The emitters show MHz antibunched emission with a sharp spectral peak at room temperature. Our study not only presents an efficient approach to laser-written nanofabrication on GaN but also offers a promising pathway for the deterministic creation of quantum emitters in GaN, shedding light on the underlying mechanisms involved.</p>

            <p>The development of fault-tolerant quantum computers based on superconducting circuits faces critical challenges in qubit coherence, connectivity, and scalability. This review establishes metamaterials, artificial structures with on-demand electromagnetic properties, as a transformative solution. By engineering the photonic density of states, metamaterials can suppress decoherence via the Purcell effect and create multi-mode quantum buses for hardware-efficient control and long-range qubit coupling. We provide a comprehensive overview, from foundational principles and Hamiltonian engineering to the materials science of high-coherence devices. We survey state-of-the-art performance, highlighting record coherence times and coupling strengths achieved through metamaterial design. Furthermore, we explore advanced applications where engineered environments give rise to exotic excitations and topologically protected states, enabling novel error correction schemes and qubit architectures. Ultimately, we argue that metamaterials are evolving from passive components into the core architectural element of next-generation quantum technologies, paving a viable path toward scalable quantum computation.</p>

            <p>Deterministically positioned pyramidal InGaAs quantum dots (QDs) exhibit exceptional quantum properties, making them highly promising candidates for scalable on-chip quantum information processing. In this work, we investigate the coherent dynamics of positively charged excitons under the influence of strong magnetic fields in the Faraday configuration. Pyramidal quantum dots exhibit a fourfold splitting of the charged excitons even in the Faraday configuration, giving rise to an optically addressable double-{\Lambda} system akin to self-assembled quantum dots in oblique magnetic fields. Here, we investigate ultrafast complete coherent control of the trion to ground state transition utilizing advanced optical resonant excitation techniques and we observe quantum coherence over timescales that are similar to other prominent quantum dot platforms. These results pave the way towards establishing site-controlled pyramidal InGaAs QDs as scalable platforms for quantum information processing, expanding the reach of coherent control to new quantum systems.</p>

            <p>Networks have played a pivotal role in physics, mathematics, and biology, propelling the recent revolution in artificial intelligence. This paper studies quantum field theories on networks and proposes a novel junction condition on the node. The junction condition is consistent with energy conservation in the sense that the total energy flow into the node is zero. As an application, we explore the Casimir effect on networks. Remarkably, the Casimir force on one edge can be changed from attractive to repulsive by adjusting the lengths of the other edges, providing a straightforward way to control the Casimir effect. We begin by discussing the Casimir effect for $(1+1)$-dimensional free massless scalars on a simple network. We then extend this discussion to various types of networks and higher dimensions.

            <p>We investigate the generation of genuine tripartite entanglement in a triangular spin-qubit system due to spatially correlated noise. In particular, we demonstrate how the formation of a highly entangled dark state -- a W state -- enables robust, long-lived tripartite entanglement. Surprisingly, we find that environmentally induced coherent coupling does not play a crucial role in sustaining this entanglement. This contrasts sharply with the two-qubit case, where the induced coupling significantly influences the entanglement dynamics. Furthermore, we explore two promising approaches to enhance the tripartite entanglement by steering the system towards the dark state: post-selection and coherent driving. Our findings offer a robust method for generating high-fidelity tripartite entangled states with potential applications in quantum computation.</p>

            <p>Quantum mechanics allows for coherent control over the order in which different processes take place on a target system, giving rise to a new feature known as indefinite causal order. Indefinite causal order provides a resource for quantum information processing, and can be in principle be detected by the violation of certain inequalities on the correlations between measurement outcomes observed in the laboratory, in a similar way as quantum nonlocality can be detected by the violation of Bell inequalities. Here we report the experimental violation of a Bell-like inequality for causal order using a photonic setup where the order of two optical processes is controlled by a single photon of a polarization-entangled photon pair. Our proof-of-principle demonstration overcomes major technical challenges, including the need of high-speed quantum operations in photonic time-bin encoding, nanosecond synchronization of active optical and electronic elements to meet the target required for spacelike separation, and active temperature stabilization of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer to ensure statistically significant violations. These experimental advances enable a statistically significant violation of the causal inequality, and open up a path towards a device-independent certification of indefinite order of events with uncharacterized quantum devices.</p>

            <p>Photonics has emerged as one of the leading platforms for the implementation of real-world-applicable quantum technologies, enabling secure communication, enhanced sensing capabilities, as well as resolving previously intractable computational challenges. However, to harness the full potential of the photonics platform, several engineering feats need to be accomplished, among those is the quest for a scalable source of pure single photons. While single photon sources can be implemented in a variety of different ways, integrated lithium niobate stands out as a prime contender for a monolithic quantum photonics platform, given its second-order nonlinearity and proven classical scalability. Despite the extensive effort put into developing the platform, integrating suitable photon pair sources remains a hurdle limiting the scalability of quantum photonic systems in lithium niobate. We engineer three-wave-mixing in a nanophotonic lithium niobate device, integrating multiple near-perfect spectrally separable heralded single photon sources. By mixing photons generated via the developed sources, we show bosonic interference between indistinguishable photons, a crucial interaction for many photonic quantum computing protocols. This demonstration of the first proof-of-principle multi-source interference in integrated lithium niobate contributes to developing a truly scalable quantum photonics platform.</p>

Additionally, we provide numerical simulations showing that the protocol can unconditionally surpass the Gaussian limit of displacement sensing with prior information, even in the presence of realistic noise.

            <p>Quantum metrology promises measurement precision beyond the classical limit by using suitably tailored quantum states and detection strategies. However, scaling up this advantage is experimentally challenging, due to the difficulty of generating high-quality large-scale probes. Here, we build a photonic setup that achieves enhanced precision scaling by manipulating the probe's dynamics through operations performed in a coherently controlled order. Our setup applies an unknown rotation and a known orbital angular momentum increase in a coherently controlled order, in a way that reproduces a hybrid quantum SWITCH involving gates generated by both discrete and continuous variables. The unknown rotation angle $\theta$ is measured with precision scaling as $1/4ml$ when a photon undergoes a rotation of $2m\theta$ and an angular momentum shift of $2l \hbar$. With a practical enhancement factor as high as 2317, the ultimate precision in our experiment is $0.0105^{\prime \prime}$ when using $7.16\times10^7$ photons, corresponding to a normalized precision of $\approx 10^{-4}$rad per photon. No photon interaction occurs in our experiment, and the precision enhancement consumes only a linearly increasing amount of physical resources while achieving a nonlinear scaling of the precision. We further indicate that this nonlinear enhancement roots in an in-depth exploration of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle (HUP), and our findings not only deepen the understanding of the HUP but also pave a pathway for advancements in quantum metrology.</p>

            <h2>Universal framework with exponential speedup for the quantum simulation of quantum field theories including QCD</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jad C. Halimeh, Masanori Hanada, Shunji Matsuura</p>
            <p>We present a quantum simulation framework universally applicable to a wide class of quantum systems, including quantum field theories such as quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Specifically, we generalize an efficient quantum simulation protocol developed for bosonic theories in [Halimeh et al., arXiv:2411.13161] which, when applied to Yang-Mills theory, demonstrated an exponential resource advantage with respect to the truncation level of the bosonic modes, to systems with both bosons and fermions using the Jordan-Wigner transform and also the Verstraete-Cirac transform. We apply this framework to QCD using the orbifold lattice formulation and achieve an exponential speedup compared to previous proposals. As a by-product, exponential speedup is achieved in the quantum simulation of the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian, the latter being a special limit of the orbifold lattice Hamiltonian. In the case of Hamiltonian time evolution of a theory on an $L^d$ spatial lattice via Trotterization, one Trotter step can be realized using $\mathcal{O}(L^d)$ numbers of CNOT gates, Hadamard gates, phase gates, and one-qubit rotations. We show this analytically for any matter content and $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ gauge group with any $N$. Even when we use the Jordan-Wigner transform, we can utilize the cancellation of quantum gates to significantly simplify the quantum circuit. We also discuss a block encoding of the Hamiltonian as a linear combination of unitaries using the Verstraete-Cirac transform. Our protocols do not assume oracles, but rather present explicit constructions with rigorous resource estimations without a hidden cost, and are thus readily implementable on a quantum computer.</p>

            <p>Neutral atom technologies have opened the door to novel theoretical advances in surface-code protocols for fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC), offering a compelling alternative to lattice surgery by leveraging transversal gates. However, a crucial gap remains between the theory of FTQC and its practical realization on neutral atom systems; most critically, a key theoretical requirement -- that syndrome extraction must be performed frequently enough to keep error accumulation below a threshold constant -- is difficult to satisfy in a scalable manner in conventional zoned approach. In this work, we develop a comprehensive theoretical framework that closes such a gap, bridging theoretical advances in surface-code fault-tolerant protocols with capabilities of neutral atoms. Building on the "game of surface code" framework originally developed for superconducting qubits, we introduce an alternative game-based paradigm for transversal-gate FTQC that harnesses the unique strengths of neutral atom arrays. The game rules are designed to enable syndrome extraction at any intermediate step during logical gate implementation, ensuring compatibility with the threshold theorem. We further present an efficient method for designing resource state factories tailored to transversal-gate FTQC. As an application, our framework offers a systematic methodology and high-level abstraction for resource estimation and optimization, demonstrating that space-time performance competitive with a baseline lattice-surgery-based approach on superconducting qubits is possible, even when physical operations on neutral atoms are orders of magnitude slower. These results establish a solid foundation that bridges the theory and experiment of FTQC powered by neutral atoms, charting a well-founded pathway toward scalable, fault-tolerant quantum computers and setting practical directions for technological development.</p>

            <p>Critical quantum metrology aims to harness critical properties near quantum phase transitions to enhance parameter estimation precision. However, critical slowing down inherently limits the achievable precision within a finite evolution time. To address this challenge, we establish a fundamental scaling limit of critical quantum metrology with respect to the total evolution time. We find that the winding number of the system's phase space trajectory determines the scaling bound of quantum Fisher information. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the exponential scaling of the quantum Fisher information can be obtained, and for this, it is necessary to increase the winding number by the total evolution time. We explicitly construct a time-dependent control to achieve optimal scaling from a simple on-off scheme depending on the system's phase and discuss its topological nature. We highlight that such an exponential scaling of quantum Fisher information remains valid even without reaching the critical point and in the presence of thermal dissipation, albeit with a decreased exponent.</p>

            <p>In this work we study the dissipative quantum North-East-Center (NEC) model: a two-dimensional spin-1/2 lattice subject to chiral, kinetically constrained dissipation and coherent quantum interactions. This model combines kinetic constraints and chirality at the dissipative level, implementing local incoherent spin flips conditioned by an asymmetric majority-vote rule. Through a cluster mean-field approach, we determine the steady-state phase diagram of the NEC model under different Hamiltonians, consistently revealing the emergence of two distinct phases, bistable and normal, across all cases considered. We further investigate the stability of the steady-state with respect to inhomogeneous fluctuations in both phases, showing the emergence of instabilities at finite wavevectors in the proximity of the phase transition. Next, we study the nonergodicity of the model in the bistable phase. We characterize the dynamics of minority islands of spins surrounded by a large background of spins pointing in the opposite direction. We show that in the bistable phase, the minority islands are always reabsorbed by the surrounding at a constant velocity, irrespectively of their size. Finally, we propose and numerically benchmark an equation of motion for the reabsorption velocity of the islands where thermal and quantum fluctuations act independently at linear order.</p>

            <p>Photonic implementations of unitary processes on lattice structures, such as quantum walks, have been demonstrated across various architectures. However, few platforms offer the combined advantages of scalability, reconfigurability, and the ability to simulate dynamics on lattices with periodic boundary conditions, such as cyclic or toroidal geometries. Here, we employ a recently developed platform that enables the implementation of arbitrary translationally invariant unitary operations on one- and two-dimensional lattices, and demonstrate a natural mechanism for introducing periodic boundary conditions. Our approach leverages direct access to the reciprocal lattice, where discrete sampling of the unitary evolution effectively enforces the desired topology. We program our platform to realize quantum walks on 1D cyclic lattices and 2D lattices with cylindrical or toroidal topologies. The lattice size can be readily tuned by adjusting the sampling density in reciprocal space. By controlling reciprocal-space occupancy, we investigate the dynamics of localized states and wavepackets, observing refocusing behavior, breathing modes modulated by reciprocal-space discretizations, and wavepacket trajectories that reflect the underlying topology. We further demonstrate a form of dimensional reduction by mapping a 2D quantum walk on a cylinder to a 1D walk with a high-dimensional coin. These results establish a versatile platform for realizing a broad class of optical mode transformations within bounded Hilbert spaces.</p>

We demonstrate entanglement in each DoF by proving the violation of the Clauser Horne Shimony Holt (CHSH) inequality by more than 27 standard deviations (STDs) in each reduced space. Genuine hyperentanglement is then assessed from the negativity of an hyperentanglement witness, which is verified by more than 60 STDs.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ricardo Rodriguez, Nam Nguyen, Elizabeth Behrman, Andrew C. Y. Li, James Steck</p>
            <p>Using a Hamiltonian of physical interest, we show the existence of a unitary transformation that drives the initial state of a two-qubit system to a designated final state. We implement an application of the above framework by finding an optimal control process that enables us to determine the entanglement of the two-qubit system with a single measurement. We also show that this process is robust to environmental noise. Our results provide mathematical justification for our earlier computational experiments.</p>

            <p>In this work, we investigate quantum entanglement and work extraction in two distinct optomechanical systems. The first system consists of two spatially separated Fabry-Pérot cavities driven by squeezed light in the resolved-sideband regime, while the second system comprises a laser field incident on a vibrating mirror. We analyze the entanglement dynamics between optical and mechanical modes, as well as quantum correlations in a mixed optomechanical bipartite system (optic-optic mode) mediated by radiation pressure. Using logarithmic negativity as a measure, we quantify the entanglement evolution in both optic-optic and mirror-mirror bipartite subsystems. Furthermore, we show how three distinct types of extractable work vary with system parameters and examine their relationship with entanglement. Our results highlight the relationship between quantum correlations and extracted work in optomechanical system, offering insights for quantum information processing and energy transfer in hybrid systems.</p>

            <h2>Broadband photonic structures to achieve high coupling efficiencies and Purcell factors with dark and interlayer excitons in 2D materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maria Carolina Volpato, Kalebe B. Estevam, Marcelo I. Davanco, Pierre-Louis de Assis</p>
            <p>Horizontal slot waveguides are planar photonic structures with a guided mode which is strongly polarized in the out-of-plane direction and tightly confined in a sub-wavelength region of lower refractive index. We show through FDTD simulations that this mode can lead to coupling efficiencies $\beta>80\%$ and Purcell factors $F_P>10$ for some types of dark intralayer excitons in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers -- more aplty named ``gray excitons'', as their out-of-plane dipole does couple to adequately polarized light -- as well as interlayer excitons in TMD heterostructures. These figures indicate a path to the strong coupling regime for gray and interlayer excitons, while bright excitons are poorly coupled to the slot mode and experience Purcell suppression for $\lambda>\SI{1}{\micro\meter}$. A significant hurdle towards strong coupling, however, is the low oscillator strengths of these two excitonic species. We use the Tavis-Cummings model to show that a horizontal-slot racetrack resonator can overcome this difficulty and reach a cooperativity $C>>1$, albeit sacrificing the broadband characteristic of waveguides.</p>

            <h2>Distributing entanglement at the quantum speed limit in Rydberg chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kent Ueno, Alexandre Cooper</p>
            <p>We numerically study the transport of Rydberg excitations in chains of neutral atoms. We realize an effective flip-flop interaction using off-resonant driving fields. By tuning the relative distances between atoms and applying atom-selective detuning fields, we realize the perfect transport condition. This condition enables the transfer of a single Rydberg excitation from one end of the chain to the other, allowing the distribution of entanglement across the chain at the quantum speed limit. Through numerical simulations, we identify the set of control parameters that maximize the transport probability for experimentally relevant parameters. We study the various competing trade-offs involved in the hierarchy of approximations used to map the native Rydberg spin model onto the effective model driving spin transport. Our results suggest that entanglement can be distributed over chains of more than fifty atoms spanning hundreds of microns at room temperature. This study informs the selection of parameters for the experimental realization of perfect transport in Rydberg chains, providing a new approach to distribute entanglement among distant atoms in quantum processors.</p>

            <h2>Dynamics of Giant Atom Coupled with Disordered Lattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maohua Wang, Yan Zhang</p>
            <p>While ideal lattice models have been widely used to study giant-atom-lattice systems, they often neglect the disorder induced by defects during experimental fabrication. This work systematically explores the dynamics of a giant atom coupled to a disordered lattice characterized by random eigenfrequency fluctuations. By analyzing atomic excitation probabilities, photon dynamics, and energy spectra, we reveal that the system exhibits remarkable robustness when disorder is confined within a specific range. The atomic excitation probability remains stable, the lattice evolution process shows reproducibility, and the energy spectrum structure is minimally distorted. Notably, we introduce a quantitative parameter to measure non-Markovianity and demonstrate that disorder significantly influences the system's memory effects. These findings provide insights into the interplay between disorder, non-Markovianity, and photon dynamics, with potential applications in quantum information processing and the design of robust quantum devices.</p>

            <p>Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) has gathered significant interest for its potential to achieve high secret key rates and seamless integration with existing optical communication infrastructure. State-of-the-art CV-QKD systems primarily use coherent states for simplicity. However, squeezed states of light have been theoretically shown to offer significant advantages, including higher secret key rates, greater resilience to excess noise, and reduced requirements on information reconciliation efficiency. In this work, we experimentally verify these theoretical predictions and propose and demonstrate a practical squeezed-state CV-QKD system based on modern local-local oscillator and digital-signal-processing techniques. Operating over fibre channels and considering finite-size security against collective attacks we showed the advantages of our system over its coherent state counterpart.

            <h2>Scalable entangling gates on ion qubits via structured light addressing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xueying Mai, Liyun Zhang, Qinyang Yu, Junhua Zhang, Yao Lu</p>
            <p>A central challenge in developing practical quantum processors is maintaining low control complexity while scaling to large numbers of qubits. Trapped-ion systems excel in small-scale operations and support rapid qubit scaling via long-chain architectures. However, their performance in larger systems is hindered by spectral crowding in radial motional modes, a problem that forces reliance on intricate pulse-shaping techniques to maintain gate fidelities. Here, we overcome this challenge by developing a novel trapped-ion processor with an individual-addressing system that generates steerable Hermite-Gaussian beam arrays. The transverse gradient of these beams couples qubits selectively to sparse axial motional modes, enabling to isolate a single mode as entanglement mediator. Leveraging this capability, we demonstrate addressable two-qubit entangling gates in chains up to six ions with fidelities consistently around 0.97, achieved without complex pulse shaping. Our method significantly reduces control overhead while preserving scalability, providing a crucial advance toward practical large-scale trapped-ion quantum computing.</p>

            <p>The construction of entangling gates with individual addressing capability represents a crucial approach for implementing quantum computation in trapped ion crystals. Conventional entangling gate schemes typically rely on laser beam wave vectors to couple the ions' spin and motional degrees of freedom. Here, we experimentally demonstrate an alternative method that employs a polarization gradient field generated by a tightly focused laser beam, previously proposed as a Magnus-type quantum logic gate. Using this technique, we perform Raman operations on nuclear spin qubits encoded in 171Yb+ ions, generating spin-dependent forces along axial motional modes in a linear trap. By utilizing an acousto-optic deflector to create arbitrary spot pairs for individual ion addressing in two-ion (four-ion) chains, we achieve MS gates with fidelities exceeding 98.5% (97.2%). Further improvements in numerical aperture and laser power could reduce gate durations while enhancing fidelity. This method is compatible with, and can significantly simplify, optical tweezer gate proposals, where motional mode engineering enables scalable trapped-ion quantum computation. The technique can be extended to two-dimensional ion crystals, representing a key step toward large-scale trapped-ion quantum processors.</p>

            <p>High-efficiency single-photon detection in the microwave domain is a key enabling technology for quantum sensing, communication, and information processing. However, the extremely low energy of microwave photons (~{\mu}eV) presents a fundamental challenge, preventing direct photon-to-charge conversion as achieved in optical systems using semiconductors. Semiconductor quantum dot (QD) charge qubits offer a compelling solution due to their highly tunable energy levels in the microwave regime, enabling coherent coupling with single photons. In this work, we demonstrate microwave photon detection with an efficiency approaching 70% in the single-photon regime. We use a hybrid system comprising a double quantum dot (DQD) charge qubit electrostatically defined in a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure, coupled to a high-impedance Josephson junction (JJ) array cavity. We systematically optimize the hybrid device architecture to maximize the conversion efficiency, leveraging the strong charge-photon coupling and the tunable DQD tunnel coupling rates. Incoming cavity photons coherently excite the DQD qubit, which in turn generates a measurable electrical current, realizing deterministic photon-to-charge conversion. Moreover, by exploiting the independent tunability of both the DQD transition energy and the cavity resonance frequency, we characterize the system efficiency over a range of 3-5.2 GHz. Our results establish semiconductor-based cavity-QED architectures as a scalable and versatile platform for efficient microwave photon detection, opening new avenues for quantum microwave optics and hybrid quantum information technologies.</p>

            <p>The family of anisotropic two-dimensional (2D) emerging materials is rapidly evolving due to their low crystal symmetry and in-plane structural anisotropy. Among these, 2D tin sulfide (SnS) has gained significant attention because of its distinctive crystalline symmetry and the resulting extraordinary anisotropic physical properties.

In particular, it highlights advances in isolating high-quality SnS monolayers (1L-SnS) and in applying advanced techniques for anisotropic characterization. The discussion continues with an overview of the anisotropic optical properties of SnS, followed by recent progress in emerging electronic device applications, including energy storage, neuromorphic (synaptic) systems, and quantum technologies. In addition to presenting significant research findings on SnS, this perspective outlines current limitations and discusses emerging opportunities and future prospects for its application in quantum devices.</p>

A 641 nm standing-wave, blue-detuned from the $5s4d\,^{3}\textrm{D}_{3}$$\,\rightarrow$ $\,5p4d\,^{3}\textrm{F}_{4}$ transition, creates a dissipative optical lattice in the $^{3}\textrm{D}_{3}$ state.

By optically pumping the atoms to the $5s5p\,^{3}\textrm{P}_{0}$ state, we facilitate continuous outcoupling via a moving optical lattice with two fold improvement in atom number.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruoyu Yin, Qingyuan Wang, Sabine Tornow, Eli Barkai</p>
            <p>The recurrence time is the time a process first returns to its initial state. Using quantum walks on a graph, the recurrence time is defined through stroboscopic monitoring of the arrival of the particle to a node of the system. When the time interval between repeated measurements is tuned in such a way that eigenvalues of the unitary become degenerate, the mean recurrence time exhibits resonances. These resonances imply faster mean recurrence times, which were recorded on quantum computers. The resonance broadening is captured by a restart uncertainty relation [R. Yin, Q. Wang, S. Tornow, E. Barkai, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 122, e2402912121 (2025)]. To ensure a comprehensive analysis, we extend our investigation to include the impact of system size on the widened resonances, showing how the connectivity and energy spectrum structure of a system influence the restart uncertainty relation. Breaking the symmetry of the system, for example time-reversal symmetry breaking with a magnetic flux applied to a ring, removes the degeneracy of {the eigenvalues of the unitary}, hence modifying {the mean recurrence time and the widening of the transitions}, and this effect is studied in detail. The width of resonances studied here is related to the finite time resolution of relevant experiments on quantum computers, and to the restart paradigm.19</p>

We provide a number of examples of such generating sets and furthermore provide an algorithm for producing a sequence of rotations corresponding to any given Pauli rotation, which is shown to have optimal complexity. We also observe that certain sets generate $\mathfrak{su}(2^{N})$ at a faster rate than others, and we show how this rate can be optimized by tuning the fraction of anticommuting pairs of generators. Finally, we briefly comment on implications for measurement-based and trapped ion quantum computation as well as the construction of fault-tolerant gate sets.</p>

            <p>The quantum no-broadcasting theorem states that it is fundamentally impossible to perfectly replicate an arbitrary quantum state, even if correlations between the copies are allowed. While quantum broadcasting cannot occur through any physical process, it can be achieved via postprocessing of experimental data using a process called virtual quantum broadcasting (VQB). In this work, we report the experimental implementation of a quantum circuit based on the linear combination of unitaries, integrated with a post-processing protocol, to realize VQB in a nuclear magnetic resonance system. VQB can be expressed as a linear combination of two channels: the universal cloner, which broadcasts the target quantum state, and the universal antisymmetrizer, which reduces broadcasting error. We implement both channels within the same circuit and demonstrate that the universal cloner is the closest physical map to VQB. In addition, we show how the universal antisymmetrizer can be utilized to mitigate imperfections in the cloner, enabling near-ideal fidelity. Our method is applicable to broadcasting quantum systems of any dimension.</p>

            <h2>Thermalization and irreversibility of an isolated quantum system</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xue-Yi Guo</p>
            <p>The irreversibility and thermalization of many-body systems can be attributed to the erasure of spread non-equilibrium state information by local operations. This thermalization mechanism can be demonstrated by the sequence $[\hat{O}^\dagger \hat{O}(t)]^N$, where $\hat{O}$ is a local operator, $\hat{O}(t) = e^{i\hat{H}t} \hat{O} e^{-i\hat{H}t}$, $\hat{H}$ is the system Hamiltonian, and $N$ denotes the number of repetitions. We begin by preparing a non-equilibrium initial state with an inhomogeneous particle number distribution in a one-dimensional Hubbard model. As particles propagate and interact within the lattice, the system evolves into a highly entangled quantum state, where the entanglement entropy satisfies a volume law, yet the information of the initial state remains well preserved. The local operator $\hat{O}$ erases part of the information in the entangled state, altering the interference of the system wavefunction and the disentangling process during time-reversed evolution. Repeatedly applying $\hat{O}^\dagger \hat{O}(t)$ leads to a monotonic increase in the entanglement entropy until it saturates at a steady value. By incorporating this information erasure mechanism into the one-dimensional Hubbard model, our numerical simulations demonstrate that in a completely isolated system, a thermalization process emerges. Finally, we discuss the feasibility of implementing related quantum simulation experiments on superconducting quantum processors.</p>

            <p>Ultracold atoms trapped in optical lattices have emerged as a scalable and promising platform for quantum simulation and computation. However, gate speeds remain a significant limitation for practical applications. In this work, we employ quantum optimal control to design fast, collision-based two-qubit gates within a superlattice based on a Fermi-Hubbard description, reaching errors in the range of $10^{-3}$ for realistic parameters. Numerically optimizing the lattice depths and the scattering length, we effectively manipulate hopping and interaction strengths intrinsic to the Fermi-Hubbard model. Our results provide five times shorter gate durations by allowing for higher energy bands in the optimization, suggesting that standard modeling with a two-band Fermi-Hubbard model is insufficient for describing the dynamics of fast gates and we find that four to six bands are required. Additionally, we achieve non-adiabatic gates by employing time-dependent lattice depths rather than using only fixed depths. The optimized control pulses not only maintain high efficacy in the presence of laser intensity and phase noise but also result in negligible inter-well couplings.</p>

While envariance has traditionally been studied within the framework of local unitary operations, we extend the analysis to consider non-unitary local operations. First, we investigate the conditions imposed on operators acting on pure bipartite entanglement to attain envariance. We show that the local operations must take a direct-sum form in their Kraus operator representations, establishing decoherence-free subspaces. Furthermore, we prove that this also holds for the multipartite scenario. As an immediate consequence, we demonstrate that environment-assisted shortcuts to adiabaticity cannot be achieved through non-unitary operations. In addition, we show that the static condition of the eternal black hole in AdS/CFT is violated when the CFTs are coupled to the external baths.</p>

            <p>We study operator growth in many-body systems with on-site spins larger than $1/2$, considering both non-integrable and integrable regimes. Specifically, we compute Lanczos coefficients in the one- and two-dimensional Ising models for spin values $S=1/2$, $1$, and $3/2$, and observe asymptotically linear growth $b_n \sim n$. On the integrable side, we investigate the Potts model and find square-root growth $b_n \sim \sqrt{n}$. Both results are consistent with the predictions of the Universal Operator Growth Hypothesis. To analyze operator dynamics in this setting, we employ a generalized operator basis constructed from tensor products of shift and clock operators, extending the concept of Pauli strings to higher local dimensions. We further report that the recently introduced formalism of equivalence classes of Pauli strings can be naturally extended to this setting. This formalism enables the study of simulable Heisenberg dynamics by identifying dynamically isolated operator subspaces of moderate dimensionality. As an example, we introduce the Kitaev-Potts model with spin-$1$, where the identification of such a subspace allows for exact time evolution at a computational cost lower than that of exact diagonalization.</p>

            <p>The amazing quantum effect of `entanglement' was discovered in the 1935 thought experiment by Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen (`EPR'). The ensuing research opened up fundamental questions and led to experiments that proved that quantum theory cannot be completed by local hidden variables. Remarkably, EPR did not discuss how to create the entanglement in their thought experiment. Here I add this part. What is required in the original EPR thought experiment is a simple elastic particle collision, an unbalanced mass ratio of e.g. 1:3 and initial states that are position and momentum squeezed, respectively. In the limiting case of infinite squeeze factors, the measurement of the position or momentum of one particle allows an absolutely precise conclusion to be drawn about the value of the same quantity of the other particle. The EPR idea has never been tested in this way. I outline a way to do this.</p>

            <p>We consider the implementation of a unitary gate on a qubit system S via a global energy-preserving operation acting on S and an auxiliary system B that can be seen as a battery. We derive a simple, asymptotically exact expression for the implementation error as a function of the battery state, which we refer to as the it Unitary Defect. Remarkably, this quantity is independent of the specific gate being implemented, highlighting a universal property of the battery itself. We show that minimizing the unitary defect, under given physical constraints on the battery state, is mathematically equivalent to solving a Lagrangian optimization problem, often corresponding to finding the ground state of a one-dimensional quantum system. Using this mapping, we identify optimal battery states that achieve the highest precision under constraints on energy, squared energy, number of levels and Quantum Fisher Information. Overall, our results provide an efficient method for establishing bounds on the physical requirements needed to implement a unitary gate via energy-preserving operations and for determining the corresponding optimal protocols.</p>

We apply this approach to analyze the robustness of Grover's search algorithm in the presence of coherent errors. Our results characterizes quantitative scaling relations between the error strength, algorithm runtime, and success probability, offering practical guidelines for the design of resilient quantum protocols.

            <p>The Quantum Diamond Microscope (QDM) is an emerging magnetic imaging tool enabling noninvasive characterization of electronic circuits through spatially mapping current densities. In this work, we demonstrate wafer-level current sensing of a current mirror circuit composed of 16 amorphous-indium-gallium-zinc oxide (a-IGZO) thin-film transistors (TFTs). a-IGZO TFTs are promising for flexible electronics due to their high performance. Using QDM, we obtain two-dimensional (2D) magnetic field images produced by DC currents, from which accurate current density maps are extracted. Notably, QDM measurements agree well with conventional electrical probing measurements, and enable current sensing in internal circuit paths inaccessible via conventional methods. Our results highlight QDM's capability as a noninvasive diagnostic tool for the characterization of emerging semiconductor technologies, especially oxide-based TFTs. This approach provides essential insights to fabrication engineers, with potential to improve yield and reliability in flexible electronics manufacturing.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement detection via third-order local invariants from randomized measurements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giovanni Scala, Anindita Bera, Gniewomir Sarbicki</p>
            <p>We compute all third-order local invariants accessible via randomised measurements and employ them to derive separability criteria. The reconstruction of the invariants yields experimentally accessible entanglement criteria for multipartite states with arbitrary local dimensions. The results show that third-order invariants capture inter-subsystem correlations beyond second-order spectral criteria within more feasible entanglement detection protocols than full tomography. As an example, Werner states in $d=3$ the entanglement is detected for $p>\frac 12$ at the second-order correlations, and it is improved to $p>\frac 1{\sqrt[3]{10}}$ at the third-order.</p>

            <h2>Optically tunable linear and nonlinear enhancement of index of refraction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elif Ozturk, Hira Asif, Mehmet Gunay, Mehmet Emre Tasgin, Ramazan Sahin</p>
            <p>Control of optical properties of materials by tuning their refractive index can revolutionize the current state-of-the-art technology to manipulate light propagation in the high loss media. Here we demonstrate active optical tuning of the plasmonic analog of \textit{enhancement of index of refraction} (EIR) in both linear and nonlinear regimes using a quantum mechanical approach. By employing a pump-probe scheme, we investigate the tuning of refractive index of the probe field by varying amplitude and phase of the pump source. In contrast to classical approach used in \cite{Panahpour2019}, we formulate both first- and second-order quantization to analyze nonlinear enhancement in the refractive index by modulating the response function of probe field. This approach enables indirect tuning of nonlinear modes and coherent control of the probe pulse under the coupling of linear plasmonic modes supported by two L-shaped nano-ellipsoids. Varying the pump amplitude not only shows a significant enhancement in the EIR in both regimes but also effectively suppresses optical losses with zero dispersion at the system's resonance frequency. Additionally, tuning pump phase induces a spectral shift in the frequency of the probe field which open new ways for active tuning of epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) materials. Our approach offers all-optical tuning of nonlinear refractive index which is essential for quantum technological applications. It also provides coherent control of optical properties of plasmonic nanostructures with applications in loss-compensated propagation and zero-index to high-refractive-index plasmonic metamaterials, as well as photonic switches.</p>

            <p>High-precision mobile gravity gradiometers are very useful in geodesy and geophysics. Atom gravity gradiometers (AGGs) could be among the most accurate mobile gravity gradiometers but are currently constrained by the trade-off between portability and sensitivity. Here, we present a high-sensitivity mobile AGG featuring an ultra-compact sensor head with a volume of only 94 L. In the laboratory, it achieves a sensitivity of 77 E/$\sqrt{Hz}$ (1 E=1$\times10^{-9}$/s$^2$) and a long-term stability of better than 0.5 E. We integrated the instrument in a minivan, enabling efficient mobile field surveys with excellent maneuverability in confined spaces. Using this vehicular system, we surveyed the gravitational field over a set of subsurface structures within a small wooded area, successfully resolving their structural signatures with a signal-to-noise ratio of 57 and quantifying the water depth in a reservoir with an accuracy of $\pm$0.23 m. Compared with previous observations using a CG-5 gravimeter, the superior spatial resolution inherent in gradiometry is clearly demonstrated. This work paves the way for bring AGGs to practical field applications.</p>

            <h2>On the excitability of two-level atoms by spectrally encoded single-photon wave packets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hamid Reza Naeij</p>
            <p>Single-photon wave packets are utilized as quantum information carriers within quantum information science and quantum communication applications. Here, we analyze the time-dependent interaction of a two-level atom with a spectrally encoded single-photon wave packet and obtain the excitation probability of the atom based on the Heisenberg-Langevin equations. Our results show that the spectral encoding process causes the single-photon wave packet to spread in the time domain, and the intensity of the wave packet decreases. Therefore, an encoded single-photon wave packet excites a two-level atom much weaker than an uncoded one. These results are crucial for understanding how encoded quantum light interacts with quantum nodes in realistic quantum networks. In particular, they reveal limitations and trade-offs in using spectrally encoded photons for secure, multiplexed quantum communication. The findings offer insights into optimizing encoding strategies for efficient atom-photon interactions and contribute to the development of scalable and secure quantum networking protocols.</p>

            <p>Realizing scalable quantum interconnects necessitates the integration of solid-state quantum memories with foundry photonics processes. While prior photonic integration efforts have relied upon specialized, laboratory-scale fabrication techniques, this work demonstrates the monolithic integration of a quantum memory platform with low-loss foundry photonic circuits via back-end-of-line deposition. We deposited thin films of titanium dioxide ($\mathrm{TiO_2}$) doped with erbium (Er) onto silicon nitride nanophotonic waveguides and studied Er optical coherence at sub-Kelvin temperatures with photon echo techniques. We suppressed optical dephasing through ex-situ oxygen annealing and optimized measurement conditions, which yielded an optical coherence time of 64 $\mu$s (a 5 kHz homogeneous linewidth) and slow spectral diffusion of 27 kHz over 4 ms, results that are comparable to state-of-the-art erbium devices. Combined with second-long electron spin lifetimes and demonstrated electrical control of Er emission, our findings establish Er:$\mathrm{TiO_2}$ on foundry photonics as a manufacturable platform for ensemble and single-ion quantum memories.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xian-Hao Wei, Xi-Wang Luo, Mu Yang, Yu-Wei Liao, Jin-Shi Xu, Guang-Can Guo, Zheng-Wei Zhou</p>
            <p>Recent research in 2-dimensional (2D) topological matter has generalized the notion of edge states from chiral to antichiral configurations with the same propagating direction at parallel edges, revealing a rich variety of robust transport phenomena. Here, we propose that antichiral hinge states can emerge in a 3D higher-order topological insulator/semimetal, where two surface/bulk Dirac points are connected by the hinge states. The band dispersion can be controlled and tilted independently for each hinge using properly designed tunnelings, resulting in tunable antichiral hinge states with programmable propagation direction and velocity. Moreover, we propose experimental realization schemes based on a 1D coupled cavity array with additional synthetic dimensions represented by the photonic orbital angular momentum and frequency. We innovatively introduce both longitudinal and transversal electro-optic modulators to generate the desired tunable tunnelings along the synthetic dimensions, which significantly reduce the experimental complexity by eliminating the need for beam splittings and auxiliary cavities. The tunable antichiral hinge states are confirmed by the photonic transmission spectra. Our work presents the robust and tunable antichiral hinge-state transports which paves the way for exploring novel topological matter and their device applications.</p>

            <h2>A Solvable Semi-infinite Fock-state-lattice SSH Model: the Stable Topological Zero Mode and the Non-Hermitian Bound Effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xing Yao Mi, Yong-Chun Liu, Zhi Jiao Deng, Chun Wang Wu, Ping Xing Chen</p>
            <p>Fock-state lattice (FSL) offers a powerful quantum simulator for topological phenomena due to the unbounded scalability and ease of implementation. Nevertheless, the unique topological properties induced by its site-dependent coupling have remained elusive, mainly due to the challenge of handling an infinite state space without translational symmetry. Here, we rigorously analyze the topological features of a semi-infinite FSL-based Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, in both Hermitian and non-Hermitian realms, by mapping it to the solvable Jaynes-Cummings (JC) model via a unitary displacement transformation. We find a more stable topological zero mode than the conventional SSH model, originating from the bound state at the inherent domain wall under anisotropic conditions. With gain and loss introduced, we predict a non-Hermitian bound effect (NHBE), i. e., any state overlapping with the bound state will quickly stabilize to the domain wall, with the minimal stabilization time occurring in the vicinity of exceptional point (EP). The paritytime (PT ) phase transition can be observed by the oscillating-to-steady crossover of dynamics in the subspace orthogonal to the bound state. Our work takes the first step towards exploring unique topological properties in infinite anisotropic topological models based on the promising FSL simulator.</p>

            <p>Entanglement is central to quantum technologies such as cryptography, sensing, and computing. Photon pairs generated via nonlinear optical processes are excellent for preparing entangled states due to their long coherence times and compatibility with fiber optic networks. Steady progress in nanofabrication has positioned lithium niobate-on-insulator (LNOI) as a leading platform for monolithic integration of photon pair sources into optical circuits, leveraging its strong second-order nonlinearity. Here, we present a reconfigurable photonic integrated circuit on LNOI, which combines two on-chip photon pair sources with programmable interferometers, enabling generation of entangled states. The pair sources achieve a source brightness of MHz nm$^{-1}$ mW$^{-1}$ while maintaining a coincidence-to-accidental ratio above 100. We successfully interfere the two sources with $99 \pm 0.7$ % visibility, demonstrating the indistinguishability required for producing entanglement on-chip. We show preparation of any of the maximally entangled Bell states with fidelity above 90 % verified by quantum state tomography. These results establish LNOI as a compelling, scalable platform to explore integrated quantum photonic technologies enabled by high-brightness sources of entangled quantum states.</p>

            <p>We present a systematic study of the properties of systems composed of $N$ two-level quantum emitters coupled to a single cavity mode, for light-matter interaction strengths ranging from the weak to the ultrastrong and deep-strong coupling regimes. Beginning with an analysis of the energy spectrum as a function of the light-matter coupling strength, we examine systems with varying numbers of emitters, from a pair to large collections, approaching the thermodynamic limit ($N \to \infty$). Additionally, we explore the emission properties of these systems under incoherent excitation of the emitters, employing a general theoretical framework for open cavity-QED systems, which is valid across all light-matter interaction regimes and preserves gauge invariance within truncated Hilbert spaces. Furthermore, we study the influence of the emitter-environment interaction on the spectral properties of the system. Specifically, when each emitter interacts independently with its own reservoir, we observe the emergence of an emission peak at the cavity's resonant frequency for even values of $N$. Our analysis also clarify the evolution of the system as the number of emitters increases, ultimately converging towards an equivalent system composed of two interacting single-mode bosonic fields.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benjamin F. Schiffer, Dominik S. Wild, Nishad Maskara, Mikhail D. Lukin, J. Ignacio Cirac</p>
            <p>Quantum phase estimation plays a central role in quantum simulation as it enables the study of spectral properties of many-body quantum systems. Most variants of the phase estimation algorithm require the application of the global unitary evolution conditioned on the state of one or more auxiliary qubits, posing a significant challenge for current quantum devices. In this work, we present an approach to quantum phase estimation that uses only locally controlled operations, resulting in a significantly reduced circuit depth. At the heart of our approach are efficient routines to measure the complex phase of the expectation value of the time-evolution operator, the so-called Loschmidt echo, for both circuit dynamics and Hamiltonian dynamics. By tracking changes in the phase during the dynamics, the routines trade circuit depth for an increased sampling cost and classical postprocessing. Our approach does not rely on reference states and is applicable to any efficiently preparable state, regardless of its correlations. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the sample complexity and illustrate the results with numerical simulations. Our methods offer a practical pathway for measuring spectral properties in large many-body quantum systems using current quantum devices.</p>

A prerequisite for such devices is a coherent interaction between nitrogen vacancy (NV) electron spins.

Here, we design and implement a robust, easy to implement entangling gate between NV spins in diamond and quantify the influence of multiple error sources on the gate performance. Experimentally, we demonstrate a record gate fidelity of $F=(96.0 \pm 2.5)$ % under ambient conditions.

            <h2>Non-Gaussian Noise Magnetometry Using Local Spin Qubits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonathan B. Curtis, Amir Yacoby, Eugene Demler</p>
            <p>Atomic scale qubits, as may be realized in nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, offer the opportunity to study magnetic field noise with nanometer scale spatial resolution. Using these spin qubits, one can learn a great deal about the magnetic-field noise correlations, and correspondingly the collective-mode spectra, in quantum materials and devices. However, to date these tools have been essentially restricted to studying Gaussian noise processes -- equivalent to linear-response. In this work we will show how to extend these techniques beyond the Gaussian regime and show how to unambiguously measure higher-order magnetic noise cumulants in a local, spatially resolved way. We unveil two protocols for doing this; the first uses a single spin-qubit and different dynamical decoupling sequences to extract non-Markovian and non-Gaussian spin-echo noise. The second protocol uses two-qubit coincidence measurements to study spatially non-local cumulants in the magnetic noise. We then demonstrate the utility of these protocols by considering a model of a bath of non-interacting two-level systems, as well as a model involving spatially correlated magnetic fluctuations near a second-order Ising phase transition. In both cases, we highlight how this technique can be used to measure in a real many-body system how fluctuation dynamics converge towards the central limit theorem as a function of effective bath size. We then conclude by discussing some promising applications and extensions of this method.</p>

            <p>One of the fundamental problems of quantum statistical physics is how an ideally isolated quantum system can ever reach thermal equilibrium behavior despite the unitary time evolution of quantum-mechanical systems. Here, we study, via explicit time evolution for the generic model system of an interacting, trapped Bose gas with discrete single-particle levels, how the measurement of one or more observables subdivides the system into observed and non-observed Hilbert subspaces and the tracing over the non-measured quantum numbers defines an effective, thermodynamic bath, induces the entanglement of the observed Hilbert subspace with the bath, and leads to a bi-exponential approach of the entanglement entropy and of the measured observables to thermal equilibrium behavior as a function of time. We find this to be more generally fulfilled than in the scenario of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), namely for both local particle occupation numbers and non-local density correlation functions, and independent of the specific initial quantum state of the time evolution.</p>

            <p>In most lattice models, gap closing typically occurs at high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone. In the transverse field Ising model with cluster interaction, besides the gap closing at high-symmetry points, the gap closing at the quantum phase transition between paramagnetic and cluster phases of the model can be moved by tuning the strength of the cluster interaction. We take advantage of this property to examine the nonequilibrium dynamics of the model in the framework of dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) after a noiseless and noisy ramp of the transverse magnetic field. The numerical results show that DQPTs always happen if the starting or ending point of the quench field is restricted between two critical points. In other ways, there is always critical sweep velocity above which DQPTs disappear. Our finding reveals that noise modifies drastically the dynamical phase diagram of the model. We find that the critical sweep velocity decreases by enhancing the noise intensity and scales linearly with the square of noise intensity for weak and strong noise. Moreover, the region with multi-critical modes induced in the dynamical phase diagram by noise. The sweep velocity under which the system enters the multi-critical modes (MCMs) region increases by enhancing the noise and scales linearly with the square of noise intensity</p>

            <p>Quantum processors require rapid and high-fidelity simultaneous measurements of many qubits. While superconducting qubits are among the leading modalities toward a useful quantum processor, their readout remains a bottleneck. Traditional approaches to processing measurement data often struggle to account for crosstalk present in frequency-multiplexed readout, the preferred method to reduce the resource overhead. Recent approaches to address this challenge use neural networks to improve the state-discrimination fidelity. However, they are computationally expensive to train and evaluate, resulting in increased latency and poor scalability as the number of qubits increases. We present an alternative machine learning approach based on next-generation reservoir computing that constructs polynomial features from the measurement signals and maps them to the corresponding qubit states. This method is highly parallelizable, avoids the costly nonlinear activation functions common in neural networks, and supports real-time training, enabling fast evaluation, adaptability, and scalability. Despite its lower computational complexity, our reservoir approach is able to maintain high qubit-state-discrimination fidelity. Relative to traditional methods, our approach achieves error reductions of up to 50% and 11% on single- and five-qubit datasets, respectively, and delivers up to 2.5x crosstalk reduction on the five-qubit dataset. Compared with recent machine-learning methods, evaluating our model requires 100x fewer multiplications for single-qubit and 2.5x fewer for five-qubit models. This work demonstrates that reservoir computing can enhance qubit-state discrimination while maintaining scalability for future quantum processors.</p>

            <p>X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is a leading technique for understanding structural changes in advanced battery materials such as lithium-excess cathodes. However, extracting critical information like oxidation states from the experimental spectra requires expensive and time-consuming simulations. Building upon a recent proposal to simulate XAS using quantum computers, this work proposes a highly-optimized implementation of the time-domain algorithm for X-ray absorption. Among a host of improvements to Hamiltonian representation, circuit implementation, and measurement strategies, three optimizations are key to the efficiency of the algorithm. The first is the use of product formulas with the compressed double factorized form of the Hamiltonian. The second is recognizing that for spectroscopy applications, it is sufficient to control the error in the eigenvalues of the (approximate) Hamiltonian being implemented by the product formula, rather than the generic error on the full time evolution operator. Using perturbation theory to estimate this eigenvalue error, we find that significantly fewer Trotter steps are needed than expected from the time evolution error bound. The third is the choice of an optimized distribution of samples that takes advantage of the exponentially decaying Lorentzian kernel. Through constant factor resource estimates, we show that a challenging model Li$_4$Mn$_2$O cluster system with 18 spatial orbitals and 22 electrons in the active space can be simulated with 100 logical qubits and less than $4 \times 10^8$ T gates per circuit. Finally, the algorithm is implemented on a simulator, and the reconstructed spectrum is verified against a classical computational reference. The low cost of our algorithm makes it attractive to use on fault-tolerant quantum devices to accelerate the development and commercialization of high-capacity battery cathodes.</p>

Starting from a target frequency-domain filter, we employ the dynamical-invariant framework to derive the continuous driving fields that enact the chosen spectral response on a qubit. This approach, Quantum Invariant Filtering (QIF), maps arbitrary finite-impulse responses, including multi-band and phase-sensitive profiles, into experimentally feasible Hamiltonian modulations. Implemented on a single nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond, the method realizes the prescribed passbands with high fidelity, suppresses noise, and preserves coherence for milliseconds, two orders of magnitude longer than Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill sequences, while remaining robust to 50% drive-amplitude errors. Our results establish QIF as a broadly applicable framework for enhanced quantum control and sensing across diverse physical platforms, including superconducting qubits, trapped ions, and nuclear magnetic resonance systems.</p>

            <h2>Strategies for generating separable photon triplets in waveguides and ring resonators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gisell Lorena Osorio, Milica Banic, Nicolás Quesada</p>
            <p>Photon triplet sources exhibit non-Gaussian features, a key property for applications in quantum computing and quantum information. However, spectral correlations can limit the performance and detection efficiency of these systems. Motivated by this, we present a theoretical analysis of the spectral correlations of photon triplets generated through spontaneous third-order parametric down-conversion in photonic devices, and discuss strategies to quantify and minimize them. We propose two strategies to minimize spectral correlations: dispersion engineering in waveguides and pump engineering in resonators. We apply these strategies in two realistic source designs, namely a high-index-contrast optical fiber taper and a silicon nitride microring resonator. Finally, we discuss detection strategies for probing non-Gaussian features of the triplet state. We find that it is feasible to achieve few-mode generation of photon triplets using state-of-the-art experimental systems, a crucial step toward practical applications of photon triplet sources in quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>The recently proposed Clifford augmented density matrix renormalization group (CA-DMRG) method seamlessly integrates Clifford circuits with matrix product states, and takes advantage of the expression power from both. CA-DMRG has been shown to be able to achieve higher accuracy than standard DMRG on commonly used lattice models, with only moderate computational overhead compared to the latter. In this work, we propose an efficient scheme in CA-DMRG to deal with \textit{ab initio} quantum chemistry Hamiltonians, and apply it to study several molecular systems. Our numerical results show that CA-DMRG can reach several orders of magnitude higher accuracy than DMRG using the same bond dimension, pointing out a promising route to push the boundary of solving \textit{ab initio} quantum chemistry with strong static correlations.</p>

            <p>The quantum Rabi model (QRM), composed of a qubit interacting with a quantized photonic field, is a cornerstone of quantum optics. The QRM with dominant unitary dynamics has been demonstrated in circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED) systems, but an open QRM with a strong photonic dissipation has not been experimentally explored. We here present the first experimental demonstration of such an open system in circuit QED, featuring a controlled competition between the coherent qubit-field interaction and the photonic dissipation. We map out the photon number distributions of the dissipative resonator for different coupling strengths in the steady state. We further observe the variation of the photon number during the system's evolution toward the steady state with fixed control parameters. The results demonstrate that the system's behavior is significantly modified by photonic dissipation.</p>

            <p>Quantum physics with its unique features enables parameter estimation with precisions beyond the capability of classical sensors, a phenomenon known as quantum-enhanced sensing. Quantum criticality has been identified as a resource for achieving such an enhancement. Despite immense theoretical progress in characterizing criticality-enhanced sensing, experimental implementations of such systems have been extremely challenging. This is due to the complexity of ground-state preparation and the long time required to reach the steady state near the critical points. Here we experimentally demonstrate criticality-enhanced quantum sensitivity in a non-Hermitian topological system. Our photonic quantum walk setup supports two distinct topological phase transitions at which quantum-enhanced sensitivity is observed even at the transient times, where the system has not yet reached its steady state. Indeed, our theoretical analysis shows that the detected enhancement is a direct implication of the steady-state behavior. The merit of our setup is also captured through Bayesian inference which shows excellent estimation and precision. Our experiment showcases the leveraging of quantum criticality and non-Hermitian physics for achieving quantum-enhanced sensitivity.</p>

            <p>Optical technology emerges as a highly promising platform for quantum computing, driven by its enormous potential for large-scale ultrafast computation and its integration with telecom technology. There have been intensive investigations ongoing into the development of optical quantum computers, however, they are limited to small-scale, special-purpose, or low-quality systems. Error correction for fault tolerance is still very challenging, making a full-scale fault-tolerant quantum computer a long-term goal. However, practical testbeds for quantum computers, without the difficulty in error correction, are in high demand. Here we present an innovative analog optical quantum computer utilising continuous variables. Our analog optical quantum computer is based on sequential measurements of time-domain-multiplexed large-scale two-dimensional entanglement. Accumulated Gaussian noise and spurious bias caused by the imperfection of analog computing can be suppressed through careful calibration and repeated trials without complicated error correction. Our system achieves a hundred analog inputs and operates at a clock frequency of 100 MHz with a comprehensive full-stack architecture featuring a cloud interface and a Python software development kit (SDK) for enhanced accessibility and scalability. We demonstrate the detailed characterisation of our optical quantum computer and quantum state sorting as its example application. This development marks a significant step forward in the exploration of analog quantum computing, with a potential to accelerate both fundamental research and practical applications such as fast and large-scale optical neural networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hana Vargová</p>
            <p>We rigorously analyze the global tripartite entanglement in a Heisenberg trimer with mixed spins-($1$,$1/2$,$1$) under varying exchange couplings between dissimilar and identical spins, magnetic fields, and temperatures. The global tripartite entanglement is quantified using the geometric mean of all three bipartite contributions, evaluated through negativity. We precisely map the regions of parameter space in which the trimer system exhibits spontaneous global entanglement. In addition, we classify the nature of the tripartite entangled states based on the distribution of reduced bipartite negativities among the spin dimers in the trimer. We further examine the thermal stability of global tripartite entanglement throughout the full parameter space. Special attention is given to the theoretical prediction of thermal robustness in a real three-spin complex, [Ni(bapa)(H$_2$0)]$_2$Cu(pba)(ClO$_4$)$_2$, where bapa stands for bis($3$-aminopropyl)amine, and pba denotes $1$,$3$-propylenebis(oxamato), which serves as an experimental realization of the mixed-spin ($1$,$1/2$,$1$) Heisenberg trimer. Notably, global entanglement in this system is predicted to persist up to approximately $100$ K and magnetic fields approaching $210$ T. Moreover, we uncover a thermally induced activation of robust global entanglement in regions where the ground state is biseparable. The magnitude of this thermal entanglement is remarkably high, nearly reaching a value of $1/2$, which has not been reported before. Finally, we propose a connection between the theoretically predicted tripartite entanglement, quantified via negativity derived from the density matrix, and the quantities measured directly or indirectly from various experiments.</p>

We analyze the normal phase, where a classical limit with two degrees of freedom can be derived using a mean-field approximation. Our study presents a detailed investigation of the loss of integrability in the two-photon Dicke model, employing both quantum and classical diagnostics. These results allow us to explore various dynamical features of the system, including the onset of chaos and the existence of mixed phase-space behavior.</p>

            <p>We study the quantum dynamics of multiple two-level atoms (qubits) in a waveguide quantum electrodynamics system, with a focus on modified superradiance effects between two or four atoms with finite delay times. Using a numerically exact matrix product approach, we explore both Markovian and non-Markovian regimes, and highlight the significant influence of time-delayed feedback effects and the clear breakdown of assuming instantaneous coupling dynamics. We first show a system composed of two spatially separated qubits, prepared in a doubly excited state (both fully excited), and provide a comprehensive study of how delayed feedback influences the collective system decay rates, as well as the quantum correlations between waveguide photons, atoms, and between atom and photons. The system is then extended to include two additional qubits located next to the initial ones (four qubits in total), and we demonstrate, by manipulating the initial excitations and the time-delay effects, how long-term quantum correlations and light-matter entangled states can be established.</p>

            <p>As quantum computing matures and moves toward broader accessibility through cloud-based platforms, ensuring the authenticity and integrity of quantum computations becomes an urgent concern. In this work, we propose a strategy to leverage the byproducts of quantum error correction (QEC) to verify hardware identity and authenticate quantum computations for ``free'', without introducing any additional quantum computations or measurements. By treating syndrome measurements as a source of metadata, we embed verification seamlessly into standard QEC protocols and eliminate the need for separate challenge-response pairs. We validate our approach using multiple error-correcting codes, quantum states, and circuit compilation strategies on several generations of IBM quantum computers. Our classifiers achieve 99\% accuracy with only 500 shots in distinguishing among five backends. Overall, we re-purpose the intrinsic overhead of error correction to be a mechanism for securing quantum computation.</p>

            <h2>Rigorous Maximum Likelihood Estimation for Quantum States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kuchibhotla Aditi, Stephen Becker</p>
            <p>Existing quantum state tomography methods are limited in scalability due to their high computation and memory demands, making them impractical for recovery of large quantum states. In this work, we address these limitations by reformulating the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) problem using the Burer-Monteiro factorization, resulting in a non-convex but low-rank parameterization of the density matrix. We derive a fully unconstrained formulation by analytically eliminating the trace-one and positive semidefinite constraints, thereby avoiding the need for projection steps during optimization. Furthermore, we determine the Lagrange multiplier associated with the unit-trace constraint a priori, reducing computational overhead. The resulting formulation is amenable to scalable first-order optimization, and we demonstrate its tractability using limited-memory BFGS (L-BFGS). Importantly, we also propose a low-memory version of the above algorithm to fully recover certain large quantum states with Pauli-based POVM measurements. Our low-memory algorithm avoids explicitly forming any density matrix, and does not require the density matrix to have a matrix product state (MPS) or other tensor structure. For a fixed number of measurements and fixed rank, our algorithm requires just $\mathcal{O}(d \log d)$ complexity per iteration to recover a $d \times d$ density matrix. Additionally, we derive a useful error bound that can be used to give a rigorous termination criterion. We numerically demonstrate that our method is competitive with state-of-the-art algorithms for moderately sized problems, and then demonstrate that our method can solve a 20-qubit problem on a laptop in under 5 hours.</p>

            <p>Quantum random access memory (QRAM) enables efficient classical data access for quantum computers -- a prerequisite for many quantum algorithms to achieve quantum speedup. Despite various proposals, the experimental realization of QRAM remains largely unexplored. Here, we experimentally investigate the circuit-based bucket-brigade QRAM with a superconducting quantum processor. To facilitate the experimental implementation, we introduce a hardware-efficient gate decomposition scheme for quantum routers, which effectively reduces the depth of the QRAM circuit by more than 30% compared to the conventional controlled-SWAP-based implementation. We further propose an error mitigation method to boost the QRAM query fidelity. With these techniques, we are able to experimentally implement the QRAM architectures with two and three layers, achieving query fidelities up to 0.800 $\pm$ 0.026 and 0.604$\pm$0.005, respectively. Additionally, we study the error propagation mechanism and the scalability of our QRAM implementation, providing experimental evidence for the noise resilience nature of the bucket-brigade QRAM architecture.

            <p>We propose an effective method for cooling two non-degenerate mechanical resonators by routing thermal noise flow in a four-mode optomechanical plaquette. The thermal noise flow between the mechanical resonators can be fully suppressed by addressing the overall loop phase in the plaquette, irrespective of their thermal temperatures. We find that optimal mechanical cooling, even down to the ground state, can be realized in this regime. The thermal noise routing, achieved by dissipation engineering at optomechanical interfaces, provides a valuable and complementary approach to conventional coherent dark-mode control theory. It can be generalized to nonreciprocal control of phonon transport and mechanical cooling, and may find applications in optomechanical networks with complex thermal environments.</p>

            <p>The RSA cryptosystem, which relies on the computational difficulty of prime factorization, faces growing challenges with the advancement of quantum computing. In this study, we propose a quantum annealing based approach to integer factorization using both high order unconstrained binary optimization (HUBO) and constrained quadratic model (CQM) formulations. We begin by modeling binary multiplication with explicit carry propagation, translating this into a HUBO representation and subsequently reducing it to a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization form compatible with current quantum solvers. To address scalability limitations, we implement a CQM approach with constraint relaxation and global product consistency. While the HUBO model successfully factors small semiprimes, it exhibits exponential memory growth, making it impractical for inputs larger than 10 bits. In contrast, the CQM model achieves accurate factorization of semiprimes up to 60 bits including N = 1152921423002469787 demonstrating significantly improved scalability. Experimental results further show that applying global product constraints enhances factorization accuracy and consistency across all tested instances. This work highlights both the promise and current limitations of quantum-assisted factorization and establishes a foundation for evaluating RSA security in the emerging quantum era.</p>

            <p>Quantum versus classical separation plays a central role in understanding the advantages of quantum computation. In this paper, we present the first exponential separation between quantum and bounded-error randomized communication complexity in a variant of the Number-on-Forehead (NOF) model. Namely, the three-player Simultaneous Number-on-Forehead model. Specifically, we introduce the Gadgeted Hidden Matching Problem and show that it can be solved using only $O(\log n)$ simultaneous quantum communication. In contrast, any simultaneous randomized protocol requires $\Omega(n^{1/16})$ communication. On the technical side, a key obstacle in separating quantum and classical communication in NOF models is that all known randomized NOF lower bound tools, such as the discrepancy method, typically apply to both randomized and quantum protocols. In this regard, our technique provides a new method for proving randomized lower bounds in the NOF setting and may be of independent interest beyond the separation result.</p>

            <p>Solid-state color centers embedded in diamond, silicon carbide (SiC) and other host-matrices offer a promising platform for nanoscale quantum sensing. Sometimes a relatively strong transverse zero-field splitting (ZFS) is introduced in a color center due to its local strain and low symmetry of the host structure. While clock transitions induced by transverse zero-field splitting (ZFS) serve as a method to prolong the coherence time, the Zeeman sub-levels of solid-state color centers become insensitive to first-order magnetic field signals, thereby limiting their utility as magnetometers. In this work, we address this challenge and achieve wide band AC field detection spanning from hundreds of kHz to hundreds of MHz by utilizing a combination of orthogonal microwaves and phase modulation at different frequencies. Our control method effectively suppresses the system noise and the amplitude fluctuation of the driving field, which extends the coherence time of the quantum system.</p>

            <p>The quest for universal superconducting quantum computing is hindered by noise and errors. It has been proven that Quantum Error Correction (QEC) codes will lay at the foundation of fault tolerant quantum computing. However, cosmic-ray induced correlated errors, which are the most detrimental events that can impact superconducting quantum computers, are yet to be efficiently tackled. In order to reach fault tolerance, we must also develop radiation aware methods to complement QEC. In this paper, we propose the first algorithm to effectively exploit syndrome information for the efficient detection of radiation events in superconducting quantum devices at runtime. We perform a thorough analysis of simulated Rotated Surface codes injecting over 11 million physics-modeled radiation-induced faults. We consider the properties of the X and Z check bases, the impact of code distance, and the decoder's time to solution constraints. Our technique detects $100\%$ of injected faults, regardless of the impact's position. Moreover, we accurately identify both the radiation impact centre and the area affected, with an overhead lower than $0.3\%$ the decoding time. Additionally, we use the fault identification information to propose a radiation fault correction technique that improves of up to $20\%$ the output correctness compared to existing decoders.</p>

This construction uniquely eliminates the need for trusted third parties, pre-shared secrets, or authenticated classical channels for public key distribution, making a significant departure from symmetric protocols like quantum key distribution. We provide a rigorous security analysis, proving the scheme's unforgeability against adaptive chosen-message attacks by quantum adversaries. The proof proceeds by a formal reduction, demonstrating that a successful forgery would imply an efficient quantum algorithm for the QMA-complete Consistency of Quantum Marginal Problem~(QMP). We further analyze the efficiency of verification using partial quantum state tomography, establishing the protocol's theoretical robustness and outlining a path towards practical implementation</p>

            <p>We theoretically investigate the collective emission of one and two circular arrays of two-level atoms surrounding an optical nanofiber. We show that the radiation eigenmodes of a single ring selectively couple to specific guided modes of the fiber, according to their symmetry, and study how the physical parameters of the system control their nature. In particular, we identify situations in which the emission toward radiation modes is highly suppressed with respect to fiber-guided modes while the lifetime of the atomic excitation is enhanced. We further address the case of two identical nanorings positioned at a distance from each other along the nanofiber. By contrast to free-space configurations, the rings can exchange excitations even at large separation through nanofiber guided modes resulting in enhanced sub- and super-radiance with respect to the single-ring case. Our findings suggest that the ring configuration is promising for the implementation of efficient and versatile light-matter nanofiber-based interfaces and the achievement of waveguide quantum electrodynamics.</p>

In this study, we overcome this challenge by utilizing a geometric measure known as concurrence fill, which quantifies genuine multipartite entanglement using the area associated with the underlying concurrence triangle. Firstly, the concurrence fill for three-qubit pure states is reformulated using three tangle and partial tangles. This yields a representation that is more tractable and operational. Using this formulation, we derive a criterion to classify GHZ and W class of states. Next, we analyse the rank-2 mixture of generalized GHZ and W class of states. Furthermore, we derive the concurrence fill for the eigenstates of the corresponding mixture and obtain an upper bound for mixed states with zero tangle.</p>

            <p>Parameterized quantum circuits represent promising architectures for machine learning applications, yet many lack clear connections to classical models, potentially limiting their ability to translate the wide success of classical neural networks to the quantum realm. We examine a specific type of quantum neural network (QNN) built exclusively from SWAP test circuits, and discuss its mathematical equivalence to a classical two-layer feedforward network with quadratic activation functions under amplitude encoding. Our analysis across classical real-world and synthetic datasets reveals that while this architecture can successfully learn many practical tasks, it exhibits fundamental expressivity limitations due to violating the universal approximation theorem, particularly failing on harder problems like the parity check function. To address this limitation, we introduce a circuit modification using generalized SWAP test circuits that effectively implements classical neural networks with product layers. This enhancement enables successful learning of parity check functions in arbitrary dimensions which we analytically argue to be impossible for the original architecture beyond two dimensions regardless of network size. Our results establish a framework for enhancing QNN expressivity through classical task analysis and demonstrate that our SWAP test-based architecture offers broad representational capacity, suggesting potential promise also for quantum learning tasks.</p>

            <h2>Towards an Experimental Device-Independent Verification of Indefinite Causal Order</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Carla M. D. Richter, Michael Antesberger, Huan Cao, Philip Walther, Lee A. Rozema</p>
            <p>In classical physics, events follow a definite causal order: the past influences the future, but not the reverse. Quantum theory, however, permits superpositions of causal orders -- so-called indefinite causal orders -- which can provide operational advantages over classical scenarios. Verifying such phenomena has sparked significant interest, much like earlier efforts devoted to refuting local realism and confirming the quantum entanglement. To date, demonstrations of indefinite causal order have all been based a process called the quantum switch and have relied on device-dependent or semi-device-independent protocols. A recent theoretical development introduced a Bell-like inequality that allows for fully device-independent verification of indefinite causal order in a quantum switch. Here we implement this verification by experimentally violating this inequality. In particular, we measure a value of $1.8427 \pm 0.0038$, which is 24 standard deviations above the classical bound of $1.75$. Our work presents the first implementation of a device-independent protocol to verify indefinite causal order, albeit in the presence of experimental loopholes. This represents an important step towards the device-independent verification of an indefinite causal order, and provides a context in which to identify loopholes specifically related to the verification of indefinite causal order.</p>

            <h2>Space-time tradeoff for sparse quantum state preparation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jingquan Luo, Guanzhong Li, Lvzhou Li</p>
            <p>In this work, we investigate the trade-off between the circuit depth and the number of ancillary qubits for preparing sparse quantum states. We prove that any $n$-qubit $d$-spare quantum state (i.e., it has only $d$ non-zero amplitudes) can be prepared by a quantum circuit with depth $O\left(\frac{nd \log m}{m \log m/n} + \log nd\right)$ using $m\geq 6n$ ancillary qubits, which achieves the current best trade-off between depth and ancilla number. In particular, when $m = \Theta({\frac{nd}{\log d}})$, our result recovers the optimal circuit depth $\Theta(\log nd)$ given in \hyperlink{cite.zhang2022quantum}{[Phys. Rev. Lett., 129, 230504(2022)]}, but using significantly fewer gates and ancillary qubits.</p>

            <p>We propose a robust approach to spin squeezing with local interactions that approaches the Heisenberg limit of phase sensitivity. To generate the requisite entanglement, we generalize the paradigmatic two-axis countertwisting Hamiltonian -- akin to squeezing by parametric amplification -- to systems with power-law interactions, incorporating a Heisenberg coupling that aids in spreading correlations and protects the collective spin coherence. The resulting time to approach the Heisenberg limit scales sublinearly with particle number in 2D dipolar and 3D van der Waals interacting systems. Our protocol is robust to disorder and density fluctuations, and can be implemented in near-term experiments with molecules, Rydberg atoms, and solid-state spins.</p>

            <p>Noise is a hindering factor for current-era quantum computers. In this study, we experimentally validate the theoretical relationships between control noise and qubit state fidelity. The experiment comprises a 10$\times$10 site optical tweezer array stochastically loaded with single rubidium-85 atoms. A global microwave field is used to manipulate the state of the hyperfine qubits. With precise control of the time-dependent amplitude of the microwave drive, we apply control signals featuring artificial noise. We systematically analyze the impact of various noise profiles on the fidelity distribution of the quantum states. The measured fidelities are compared against theoretical predictions made using the stochastic Schr{ö}dinger equation. Our results show a good agreement between the experimentally measured and theoretically predicted results. This validation is consequential, as the model provides critical information on noise identification and optimal control protocols in NISQ-era quantum systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bai-Ting Liu, Peng Qian, Zhan Cao, Dong E. Liu</p>
            <p>Majorana zero modes (MZMs) are non-Abelian quasiparticles with the potential to serve as topological qubits for fault-tolerant quantum computing due to their ability to encode quantum information nonlocally. In multi-Majorana systems configured into two separated subsystems, nontrivial quantum correlations persist, but the presence of trivial Andreev bound states (ABSs) can obscure this nonlocality if MZM preparation fails. To address this, we propose a protocol using an entanglement witness based solely on parity measurements to distinguish the nonlocal characteristics of MZM systems. Our framework, which is experimentally implementable, achieves a detection probability of approximately 18% in a 6-site system and demonstrates robustness under environmental noise, albeit with a reduced detection rate in the resence of quasiparticle contamination.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Prem Kumar, K. P. Athulya, Sibasish Ghosh</p>
            <p>The spin-boson model is a widely used model for understanding the properties of a two-level open quantum system. Accurately describing its dynamics often requires going beyond the weak system-environment coupling approximation. However, calculating the higher-order generators of such a dynamics, with a system-environment coupling that is not too weak, has been known to be challenging, both numerically and analytically. This work presents the analytical derivation of the complete fourth-order time-convolutionless (TCL) generator for a generic spin-boson model, accurate up to 4th order in the system-environment coupling parameter, under the assumption that the environmental spectral density is an odd function of frequency. In the case of a semiconductor double-quantum-dot system, our results reveal corrections to the dynamics that may become physically significant in some parameter regimes. Furthermore, we report that the widely used second-order TCL master equation tends to overestimate the non-Markovianity of a dynamics over a large parameter regime. Within the regime of its applicability, our results provide a computational advantage over numerically exact techniques. The accuracy of the fourth-order TCL generator is rigorously benchmarked against specialized analytical calculations done for the Ohmic spectral density with Drude cutoff and against the numerically exact Hierarchical Equations of Motion technique.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ravishankar Ramanathan, Yuan Liu, Yutian Wu</p>
            <p>The question of security of practical device-independent protocols against no-signalling adversaries, the ultimate form of cryptographic security, has remained open. A key ingredient is to identify how the entropy in the raw outputs of a Bell test accumulates over $n$ sequential runs (termed time-ordered no-signalling) against a no-signalling adversary. Previous numerical and analytical investigations for small $n$ ($\leq 5$) had suggested that the min-entropy might not accumulate linearly in contrast to the case of quantum adversaries. Here we point out that despite the findings for small $n$, the min-entropy does in fact accumulate linearly for large $n$. We illustrate the difference in randomness accumulation against quantum and no-signalling adversaries with the paradigmatic example of the Chained Bell test for which we analytically derive the min-entropy. Finally, we illustrate the power of the no-signalling adversary by providing a class of attacks that allow an eavesdropper to perfectly guess the outputs of one player in general bipartite Pseudotelepathy games.</p>

            <h2>Quantum-corrected Floquet dynamics in the Rabi model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> E. K. Twyeffort, A. D. Armour</p>
            <p>Semiclassical descriptions of the dynamics of a few-level system coupled to a mode of the electromagnetic field which effectively reduce the contribution of the field to a time-dependent term in the Hamiltonian of the few-level system are widely used. For example, such an approach is typically taken in quantum control applications. However, the underlying quantum character of the field will lead to corrections to the semiclassical dynamics which, given sufficient time, can lead to significant changes. Here we develop an approach for calculating these quantum corrections systematically, building on the time-dependent Floquet dynamics that emerges in the semiclassical limit. Using the Rabi model of a spin--field system as an illustrative example, we obtain approximate analytic expressions for the first-order quantum corrections to the semiclassical dynamics of the spin for a range of initial field states. These expressions describe the initial stages of the full quantum dynamics accurately, though they eventually fail for sufficiently long times. Our work has relevance both for understanding the fundamental properties of emergent semiclassical behavior and as a potential tool for assessing corrections to semiclassical control techniques.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Valentine Nyirahafashimana, Nurisya Mohd Shah, Umair Abdul Halim, Mohamed Othman</p>
            <p>We construct rotated logical states by applying rotation operators to stabilizer states, extending the logical basis and modifying stabilizer generators. Rotation operators affect the effective code distance $d_R$, which decays exponentially with rotation angles $(\theta, \phi)$, influencing error correction performance. We quantify the scaling behavior of logical error rates under circuit-level noise, comparing standard depolarizing (SD) and superconducting-inspired (SI) noise models with small and large rotations. Our findings show that the rotated code scales as $0.68d_R (0.65d_R)$ for SD and $0.81d_R (0.77d_R)$ for SI, with small rotation angles leading to a steeper decay of logical error rates. At a physical error rate $p_{phy}$ of $10^{-4}$, logical errors decrease exponentially with $d_R$, particularly under SI noise, which exhibits stronger suppression. The threshold error rates for rotated logical states are compared with previous results, demonstrating improved resilience against noise. By extending the logical state basis, rotation-based encoding increases error suppression beyond traditional stabilizer codes, offering a promising approach to advancing quantum error correction.</p>

            <p>One of the key challenges in quantum machine learning is finding relevant machine learning tasks with a provable quantum advantage. A natural candidate for this is learning unknown Hamiltonian dynamics. Here, we tackle the supervised learning version of this problem, where we are given random examples of the inputs to the dynamics as classical data, paired with the expectation values of some observable after the time evolution, as corresponding output labels. The task is to replicate the corresponding input-output function. We prove that this task can yield provable exponential classical-quantum learning advantages under common complexity assumptions in natural settings. To design our quantum learning algorithms, we introduce a new method, which we term \textit{\subroutine}~algorithm for parametrized circuit functions, and which may be of independent interest. Furthermore, we discuss the limitations of generalizing our method to arbitrary quantum dynamics while maintaining provable guarantees. We explain that significant generalizations are impossible under certain complexity-theoretic assumptions, but nonetheless, we provide a heuristic kernel method, where we trade-off provable correctness for broader applicability.</p>

Here we give a complete characterization of the set $B_n$ of complex values that $n$-th order invariants can take, resolving some recently proposed conjectures. We show that $B_n$ is equal to the range of invariants arising from pure states described by Gram matrices of circulant form. We show that both ranges are equal to the $n$-th power of the complex unit $n$-gon, and are therefore convex, which provides a simple geometric intuition. Finally, we show that any Bargmann invariant of order $n$ is realizable using either qubit states, or circulant qutrit states.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Omid Faizy, Norbert Wehn, Paul Lukowicz, Maximilian Kiefer-Emmanouilidis</p>
            <p>Quantum arithmetic computation requires a substantial number of scratch qubits to stay reversible. These operations necessitate qubit and gate resources equivalent to those needed for the larger of the input or output registers due to state encoding. Quantum Hamiltonian Computing (QHC) introduces a novel approach by encoding input for logic operations within a single rotating quantum gate. This innovation reduces the required qubit register $ N $ to the size of the output states $ O $, where $ N = \log_2 O $. Leveraging QHC principles, we present reversible half-adder and full-adder circuits that compress the standard Toffoli + CNOT layout [Vedral et al., PRA, 54, 11, (1996)] from three-qubit and four-qubit formats for the Quantum half-adder circuit and five sequential Fredkin gates using five qubits [Moutinho et al., PRX Energy 2, 033002 (2023)] for full-adder circuit; into a two-qubit, 4$\times $4 Hilbert space. This scheme, presented here, is optimized for classical logic evaluated on quantum hardware, which due to unitary evolution can bypass classical CMOS energy limitations to certain degree. Although we avoid superposition of input and output states in this manuscript, this remains feasible in principle. We see the best application for QHC in finding the minimal qubit and gate resources needed to evaluate any truth table, advancing FPGA capabilities using integrated quantum circuits or photonics.</p>

            <h2>Fault Tolerance by Construction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benjamin Rodatz, Boldizsár Poór, Aleks Kissinger</p>
            <p>A key challenge in fault-tolerant quantum computing is synthesising and optimising circuits in a noisy environment, as traditional techniques often fail to account for the effect of noise on circuits. In this work, we propose a framework for designing fault-tolerant quantum circuits that are correct by construction. The framework starts with idealised specifications of fault-tolerant gadgets and refines them using provably sound basic transformations. To reason about manipulating circuits while preserving their error correction properties, we define fault equivalence; two circuits are considered fault-equivalent if all undetectable faults on one circuit have a corresponding fault on the other. This guarantees that the effect of undetectable faults on both circuits is the same. We argue that fault equivalence is a concept that is already implicitly present in the literature. Many problems, such as state preparation and syndrome extraction, can be naturally expressed as finding an implementable circuit that is fault-equivalent to an idealised specification. To utilize fault equivalence in a computationally tractable manner, we adapt the ZX calculus, a diagrammatic language for quantum computing. We restrict its rewrite system to not only preserve the underlying linear map but also fault equivalence, i.e. the circuit's behaviour under noise. Enabled by our framework, we verify, optimise and synthesise new and efficient circuits for syndrome extraction and cat state preparation. We anticipate that fault equivalence can capture and unify different approaches in fault-tolerant quantum computing, paving the way for an end-to-end circuit compilation framework.</p>

            <p>We investigate the performance of two quantum error-correcting codes, the surface code and the Bacon-Shor code, for implementation with spin qubits in silicon. In each case, we construct a logical qubit using a planar array of quantum dots, exploring two encoding schemes: one based solely on single-electron Zeeman qubits (Loss-DiVincenzo qubits), and a hybrid approach combining Zeeman and singlet-triplet qubits. For both codes, we evaluate key performance metrics, including logical state preparation fidelity and cycle-level error correction performance, using state-of-the-art experimental parameters. Our results show that the hybrid encoding consistently outperforms the pure Zeeman-qubit implementation. By identifying the dominant error mechanisms that limit quantum error correction performance, our study highlights concrete targets for improving spin qubit hardware and provides a path toward scalable fault-tolerant architectures. In particular, we find that the logical error rate is not limited by memory errors, but rather by gate errors, especially 1- and 2-qubit gate errors.</p>

            <h2>Tighter Error Bounds for the qDRIFT Algorithm</h2>

            <p>Randomized algorithms such as qDRIFT provide an efficient framework for quantum simulation by sampling terms from a decomposition of the system's generator. However, existing error bounds for qDRIFT scale quadratically with the norm of the generator, limiting their efficiency for large-scale closed or open quantum system simulation. In this work, we refine the qDRIFT error bound by incorporating Jensen's inequality and a careful treatment of the integral form of the error. This yields an improved scaling that significantly reduces the number of steps required to reach a fixed simulation accuracy. Our result applies to both closed and open quantum systems, and we explicitly recover the improved bound in the Hamiltonian case. To demonstrate the practical impact of this refinement, we apply it to three settings: quantum chemistry simulations, dissipative transverse field Ising models, and Hamiltonian encoding of classical data for quantum machine learning. In each case, our bound leads to a substantial reduction in gate counts, highlighting its broad utility in enhancing randomized simulation techniques.</p>

            <p>Emergent quantum computing technologies are widely expected to provide novel approaches in the simulation of quantum chemistry. Despite rapid improvements in the scale and fidelity of quantum computers, high resource requirements make the execution of quantum chemistry experiments challenging. Typical experiments are limited in the number of qubits used, incur a substantial shot cost, or require complex architecture-specific optimization and error mitigation techniques. In this paper, we propose a conceptually simple benchmarking approach involving the use of multi-ancilla quantum phase estimation. Our approach is restricted to very small chemical systems, and does not scale favorably beyond molecular systems that can be described with $2$ qubits; however, this restriction allows us to generate circuits that scale quadratically in gate count with the number of qubits in the readout register. This enables the execution of quantum chemistry circuits that act on many qubits, while producing meaningful results with limited shot counts. We use this technique (with $200$ shots per experiment) to calculate the ground state energy of molecular hydrogen to $50$ bits of precision ($8.9 \times 10^{-16}$ hartree) on a $56$-qubit trapped-ion quantum computer, negating Trotter error. Including Trotter error, we obtain between $32$ and $36$ bits of precision ($1.5 * 10^{-10}$ and $6.0 * 10^{-11}$ hartree respectively), vastly exceeding chemical accuracy ($1.6 * 10^{-3}$ hartree) against Full Configuration Interaction. We consider application of the approach to deeper circuits, and discuss potential as a benchmark task for near-term quantum devices.</p>

            <p>We construct positional numeral systems that work natively over nonderived polyadic $\left( m,n\right) $-rings whose addition takes $m$ arguments and multiplication takes $n$. In such rings, the length of an admissible additive word and a multiplicative tower are not arbitrary (as in the binary case), but "quantized". Our main contributions are the following. Existence: every commutative $\left( m,n\right) $-ring admits a base-$p$ place-value expansion that respects the word length constraint in terms of numbers of operation compositions $\ell_{mult}=\ell_{add}(m-1)+1$. Lower bound: the minimum number of digits is greater than or equal to the arity of addition $m$. Representability gap: for $m,n\geq3$ only a proper subset of ring elements possess finite expansions, characterized by congruence-class arity shape invariants $I^{(m)}$ and $J^{(n)}$. Mixed-base "polyadic clocks": allowing a different base at each position enlarges the design space quadratically in the digit count. Catalogues: explicit tables for the integer rings $\mathbb{Z}_{4,3}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_{6,5}$ illustrate how ordinary integers lift to distinct polyadic variables. These results lay the groundwork for faster arity-aware arithmetic, exotic coding schemes, and hardware that exploits operations beyond the binary pair.</p>

            <p>The thermodynamic limit is foundational to statistical mechanics, underlying our understanding of many-body phases. It assumes that, as the system size grows infinitely at fixed density of particles, unambiguous macroscopic phases emerge that are independent of the system's boundary shape. We present explicit quantum spin and dimer Hamiltonians whose ground states violate this principle. Our construction relies on the previous mathematical work on classical dimers on the Aztec diamond and the square-octagon fortress, where geometry-dependent phase behaviors are observed in the infinite-size limit. We reverse engineer quantum spin Hamiltonians on the square and the square-octagon lattices whose ground states at the Rokhsar-Kivelson points are described by classical dimer coverings. On diamond-shaped domains, we find macroscopic boundary regions exhibiting distinct quantum phases from those on square-shaped domains. We study the nature of these phases by calculating the dimer-dimer and vison correlators and adapt Kasteleyn matrix based analytical and numerical methods for computing the vison correlator, which are significantly more efficient than standard Monte Carlo techniques. Our results show that the square-octagon lattice supports a single gapped short-range entangled phase, with exponentially decaying dimer correlators and a constant vison correlator. When the same model is considered on a diamond-shaped domain, an additional ordered phase emerges near the corners, where the dimers are in a staggered pattern.</p>

            <p>The kicked Ising model has been studied extensively as a model of quantum chaos. Bertini, Kos, and Prosen studied the system in the thermodynamic limit, finding an analytic expression for the spectral form factor, $K(t)$, at the self-dual point with periodic boundary conditions. The spectral form factor is the 2nd moment of the trace of the time evolution operator, and we study the higher moments of this random variable in the kicked Ising model. A previous study of these higher moments by Flack, Bertini, and Prosen showed that, surprisingly, the trace behaves like a real Gaussian random variable when the system has periodic boundary conditions at the self dual point. By contrast, we investigate the model with open boundary conditions at the self dual point and find that the trace of the time evolution operator behaves as a complex Gaussian random variable as expected from random matrix universality based on the circular orthogonal ensemble. This result highlights a surprisingly strong effect of boundary conditions on the statistics of the trace. We also study a generalization of the spectral form factor known as the Loschmidt spectral form factor and present results for different boundary conditions.</p>

            <p>Recently, it has been shown that a slow-light augmented unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer (SLAUMZI) can be used to enhance significantly the sensitivity of measuring the frequency shift of a laser, compared to the conventional technique of heterodyning with a reference laser. Here, we show that a similar enhancement can be realized using a slow-light augmented Fabry-Perot Cavity (SLAFPC), due to the fact that an FPC is inherently unbalanced, since different bounces of the field traverse different path lengths before interfering with the other bounces. We show how the degree of enhancement in sensitivity depends on the spectral width of the laser and the finesse of the FPC. We also show how the sensitivity enhancement factor (SEF) for the SLAFPC is much larger than the same for the SLAUMZI for comparable conditions and the same group index, under lossless conditions. In general, the effect of the loss caused by the medium that produces the slow-light process is more prominent for the SLAFPC than the SLAUMZI. However, if the attenuation per pass can be kept low enough while producing a high group index, using cold atoms for generating the slow-light effect, for example, then the SEF for the SLAFPC can be much higher than that for the SLAUMZI. For potentially realizable conditions, we show that an SEF of ~1.4*10^5 can be achieved using a SLAFPC.</p>

            <h2>Effects of acceleration on interatomic interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shijing Cheng, Wenting Zhou, Hongwei Yu</p>
            <p>The Unruh effect establishes a fundamental equivalence between acceleration and thermality by demonstrating that a uniformly accelerated ground-state detector undergoes excitation as if immersed in a thermal bath. In this paper, we investigate how acceleration influences the interaction between two ground-state atoms that are synchronously and uniformly accelerated in vacuum with proper acceleration $a$ and coupled to a fluctuating electromagnetic field. We find that the resulting interaction potential comprises both diagonal components $(\delta E)^{jk}$ with $j=k$, which are present in both inertial and acceleration cases, and off-diagonal components $(\delta E)^{jk}$ with $j\neq k$, which arise exclusively due to acceleration and vanish in the inertial case. The dependence of each component on acceleration and interatomic separation $L$ generally differs. For small accelerations, the leading-order diagonal components of the van der Waals (vdW) and Casimir-Polder (CP) interaction potentials remain unchanged from their inertial counterparts, exhibiting the standard scaling behaviors $\sim L^{-6}$ and $\sim L^{-7}$, respectively. In contrast, the off-diagonal components scale as $\sim a^2L^{-4}$ in the vdW subregions and $\sim a^2L^{-5}$ in the CP subregion. However, when the acceleration becomes sufficiently large, both diagonal and off-diagonal components of the vdW and CP interaction potentials are significantly modified, giving rise to entirely new interaction behaviors that deviate from those observed in the inertial case, whether in vacuum or thermal environments, indicating a breakdown of the acceleration-thermality equivalence established by the Unruh effect for single detectors.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Artificial Intelligence for Secure Autonomous Vehicle Navigation: An Architectural Proposal</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hemanth Kannamarlapudi, Sowmya Chintalapudi</p>
            <p>Navigation is a very crucial aspect of autonomous vehicle ecosystem which heavily relies on collecting and processing large amounts of data in various states and taking a confident and safe decision to define the next vehicle maneuver. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture based on Quantum Artificial Intelligence by enabling quantum and AI at various levels of navigation decision making and communication process in Autonomous vehicles : Quantum Neural Networks for multimodal sensor fusion, Nav-Q for Quantum reinforcement learning for navigation policy optimization and finally post-quantum cryptographic protocols for secure communication. Quantum neural networks uses quantum amplitude encoding to fuse data from various sensors like LiDAR, radar, camera, GPS and weather etc., This approach gives a unified quantum state representation between heterogeneous sensor modalities. Nav-Q module processes the fused quantum states through variational quantum circuits to learn optimal navigation policies under swift dynamic and complex conditions. Finally, post quantum cryptographic protocols are used to secure communication channels for both within vehicle communication and V2X (Vehicle to Everything) communications and thus secures the autonomous vehicle communication from both classical and quantum security threats. Thus, the proposed framework addresses fundamental challenges in autonomous vehicles navigation by providing quantum performance and future proof security.

            <h2>Band engineering aided by topological edge state proximity effects: Inducing anti-chirality in graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ricardo Y. Díaz-Bonifaz, Carlos Ramírez</p>
            <p>In this work we analyze infinite graphene nanoribbons subjected to non-uniform magnetic fields that produce topological domain walls in the quantum Hall regime. We show how the proximity between edge states from neighboring domains modifies the band structure due to the state coupling near the domain walls. The proximity-induced band deformations produce phenomena such as bulk-like dispersion that coexist with Landau levels and valley-polarized current paths. It is shown that edge state coupling can be enhanced by continuously varying the magnetic field between two non-trivial topological phases. The mechanism by which neighboring edge states modify the band structure is addressed by tracking their wave-functions over isolated bands and by analyzing the magnetic confinement potential near the domain wall. By calculating the local current density, we show that the coexistence of topological edge states with bulk-like dispersion can lead to the appearance of anti-chirality, in which co-propagating currents appear in the edges while the rest of the nanoribbon is occupied with bulk states. The appearance of anti-chirality is justified by comparing the proposed non-uniform magnetic field profile with an anti-chiral modified Haldane model.</p>

            <p>We study the creation of an optical centrifuge for the controlled rotation of levitated nanorotors within an optical tweezer. The optical centrifuge is created by rapidly rotating the linear polarization of the tightly focused optical field used to form an optical trap. We show that nanorotors, formed by anisotropic nanoparticles levitated within the trap, can be accelerated to well-defined rotational rates in excess of 100 MHz over durations of hundreds of microseconds. The initial conditions required for stable acceleration, based on optical trap properties and the anisotropic susceptibility of the nanorotor are established, and confirmed by numerical simulations. We also present initial experiments that have developed tools for the rapid angular acceleration of the polarization vector of the linearly polarized beam that is required to create the centrifuge. We show that over the acceleration durations in the 100 $\upmu$s range, high rotational speeds could be achieved in modest vacuum.</p>

            <h2>Validity of generalized Gibbs ensemble in a random matrix model with a global $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adway Kumar Das</p>
            <p>$\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry is ubiquitous in quantum mechanical systems where it drives various phase transitions and emergent physics. To understand the role of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry in the thermalization of a local observable in a disordered system, we consider random symmetric centrosymmetric (SC) matrices where the exchange symmetry is conserved. Such a conservation law splits the Hilbert space into decoupled subspaces such that the energy spectrum of a SC matrix is a superposition of two pure spectra. After discussing the known results on the correlations of such mixed spectrum, we consider different initial states and analytically compute the entire time evolution of their survival probability and associated timescales. We show that there exist certain initial states which do not decay over a very long timescales such that a measure zero fraction of random SC matrices exhibit spontaneous symmetry breaking. Later, we show that thermalization is violated for a generic local observable in case of the SC matrices, where the generalized Gibbs ensemble accurately captures the equilibrium expectation values.</p>

            <p>The non-Hermitian bulk-boundary correspondence features an interplay between the non-Hermitian skin effect and anomalous boundary-mode behavior. Whereas the skin effect is known to manifest itself in quantum dynamics in the form of chiral damping, it has remained less clear what impact the boundary modes may have. Here we derive experimentally accessible signatures of the boundary modes. We also establish clear criteria, based on the effective generalized Brillouin zone, that determine when bulk and boundary effects can be dynamically discerned using the Liouvillian separation gap. This leads to telltale signatures in both stable regimes -- where particle number remains finite -- and in the unstable regimes -- where a macroscopic boundary mode population occurs.</p>

The first scheme of the detector employs the nondipole transitions between Rydberg states induced by twisted radio photons. The second scheme involves the array of Rydberg-atom based antennas, every antenna measuring the dipole transitions excited by plane radiowaves comprising the twisted one.</p>

            <p>Disorder can be applied to transform conducting to insulating states by localizing individual quantum particles. The interplay between disorder and interactions in many-particle systems leads to a richer tapestry of quantum phase transitions. Here, we report the measurement in an ultracold lattice gas of a disorder-induced transition from a state with small disorder-independent compressibility to a state for which compressibility increases with disorder. At zero temperature this is the transition from a Mott insulator (MI) to a Bose glass (BG), both of which are insulating states. This transformation is observed using measurements of core compressibility. By determining how double occupancy changes with atom number, we identify the threshold disorder strength required to switch from disorder-independent MI-like to disorder-dependent BG-like compressible behavior.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seth Lloyd, Michele Reilly</p>
            <p>Merely by existing, all physical systems contain information, and physical dynamics transforms and processes that information. This note investigates the information processing power of living systems. Living systems harvest free energy from the sun, from geothermal sources, and from each other. They then use that free energy to drive the complex set of chemical interactions that underlie life. All molecules -- be they simple molecules such as water, or complex molecules such as DNA -- register information via their chemical composition. When these molecules undergo chemical reactions, that information is transformed and processed. These chemical transformations can be thought of as elementary logical operations: such bio-ops include the absorption of a photon in a chromophore during photosynthesis, the formation or breaking of covalent, hydrogen, and van der Waals bonds in the process of metabolism and reproduction, or the release of a neurotransmitter molecule when a synapse fires in the brain. This paper estimates the total number of bio-ops that have been, and are being performed, by life on earth. We find that the current number of bio-ops performed by all life on earth is around $10^{33}-10^{35}$ bio-ops per second. The cells in an individual human being perform around $10^{20}-10^{22}$ bio-ops per second, comparable to the information processing power of all the computers, cell phones, and server farms on earth. Depending on how one defines a neural operation, at most a few percent of human bio-ops take place in the firing of neurons and synapses in the brain. Over the course of life on earth, about $10^{50}-10^{52}$ bio-ops have taken place.</p>

            <p>Quantum computers represent a new computational paradigm with steadily improving hardware capabilities. In this article, we present the first study exploring how current quantum computers can be used to classify different neutrino event types observed in neutrino telescopes. We investigate two quantum machine learning approaches, Neural Projected Quantum Kernels (NPQKs) and Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs), and find that both achieve classification performance comparable to classical machine learning methods across a wide energy range. By introducing a moment-of-inertia-based encoding scheme and a novel preprocessing approach, we enable efficient and scalable learning with large neutrino astronomy datasets. Tested on both simulators and the IBM Strasbourg quantum processor, the NPQK achieves a testing accuracy near 80 percent, with robust results above 1 TeV and close agreement between simulation and hardware performance. A simulated QCNN achieves approximately a 70 percent accuracy over the same energy range. These results underscore the promise of quantum machine learning for neutrino astronomy, paving the way for future advances as quantum hardware matures.</p>

            <h2>Obtaining continuum physics from dynamical simulations of Hamiltonian lattice gauge theories</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christopher F. Kane, Siddharth Hariprakash, Christian W. Bauer</p>
            <p>Taking the continuum limit is essential for extracting physical observables from quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories. Achieving the correct continuum limit requires careful control of all systematic uncertainties, including those arising from approximate implementations of the time evolution operator. In this work, we review existing approaches based on renormalization techniques, and point out their limitations. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a new general framework -- the Statistically-Bounded Time Evolution (SBTE) protocol -- for rigorously controlling the impact of approximate time evolution on the continuum limit. The central insight is that, since exact time evolution introduces no UV divergences, errors from approximate evolution can be treated as a source of systematic uncertainty that can be neglected if reduced below the working statistical uncertainty. We show that, using the SBTE protocol, which prescribes driving the approximate time evolution error below the working statistical uncertainty, leads to a simplified renormalization procedure. Furthermore, we show that, due to the existence of rigorous error bounds, one can guarantee a priori that such errors are negligible and do not affect the continuum limit. Ultimately, our protocol lays the foundation for performing systematic and fair comparisons between different simulation algorithms for lattice gauge theory simulations.</p>

            <p>Dipole-dipole interaction (DDI) possesses characteristics different from the conventional isotropic s-wave interaction in Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), the interplay of DDI with spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and rotation may induce novel quantum properties. We systematically analyze the effects of the DDI, Weyl-like SOC, rotation and trap anharmonicity in the ground state of two-componen BECs. The interplay of these factors leads to a kaleidoscope of quantum states of quantum defects and quantum droplets in lattice, wheel and ring forms of distributions, with transitions of topology of density and a critical behavior in varying the parameters. We also show a bunch of exotic spin topological structures, including centric vortex surrounded by layers of spin flows, compound topological structure of edge defect, and various coexistence states of skyrmions with different topological charge. In particular, we find quarter skyrmions and other possible fractional skyrmions. Rashba-type SOC and Weyl-like SOC are compared as well. Our study implies that one can manipulate both the density topology and the spin topological structure via these tunable parameters in BECs. The abundant variations of the topological structures and particularly the revealed critical behavior may provide various quantum resources for potential applications in quantum metrology.</p>

            <p>We perform the first quantum computation of parton distribution function (PDF) with a real quantum device by calculating the PDF of the lightest positronium in the Schwinger model with IBM quantum computers. The calculation uses 10 qubits for staggered fermions at five spatial sites and one ancillary qubit. The most critical and challenging step is to reduce the number of two-qubit gate depths to around 500 so that sensible results start to emerge. The resulting lightcone correlators have excellent agreement with the classical simulator result in central values, although the error is still large. Compared with classical approaches, quantum computation has the advantage of not being limited in the accessible range of parton momentum fraction $x$ due to renormalon ambiguity, and the difficulty of accessing non-valence partons. A PDF calculation with 3+1 dimensional QCD near $x=0$ or $x=1$ will be a clear demonstration of the quantum advantage on a problem with great scientific impact.</p>

            <p>Magnets have recently emerged as promising candidates for quantum computing, particularly using topologically-protected nanoscale spin textures. While the quantum dynamics of such spin textures has been theoretically studied, direct experimental evidence of their non-classical behavior remains an open challenge. To address this, we propose to employ Brillouin light scattering (BLS) as a method to probe the quantum nature of skyrmions in frustrated magnets. We show that, for a specific geometry, classical skyrmions produce symmetric sidebands in the BLS spectrum, whereas quantum skyrmions exhibit a distinct asymmetry arising from vacuum fluctuations of their rotation. By studying the photon-skyrmion interaction, we calculate the BLS spectrum using a quantum master equation and show that sideband asymmetry serves as a robust witness of energy level quantization. We find that this asymmetry is pronounced at low temperatures, and can be controlled by input laser power. These findings establish a concrete protocol for the optical detection of non-classical features in spin textures, paving the way for exploring their role in quantum applications.</p>

            <p>We present the quantum-selected configuration interaction-tailored coupled-cluster (QSCI-TCC) method, a hybrid quantum-classical scheme that tailors coupled-cluster (CC) theory with a quantum-selected configuration interaction (QSCI) wave function. QSCI provides a scalable, shot-efficient approach to reconstructing the many-electron state prepared on quantum hardware on a classical computer. The resulting active-space CI coefficients, which are free from additive shot noise, are mapped to fixed cluster amplitudes within the tailored coupled-cluster framework, after which a conventional CC calculation optimizes the remaining amplitudes. This workflow embeds static (strong) correlation from the quantum device and subsequently recovers dynamical (weak) correlation, yielding a balanced description of both. The method is classically simulated and applied to the simultaneous O-H bond dissociation in H$_2$O and the triple-bond dissociation in N$_2$. QSCI-TCC and its perturbative-triples variant, QSCI-TCC(T), provide accurate results even where CCSD or CCSD(T) begin to break down. Shot-count tests for the N$_2$ (6e, 6o) active space demonstrate that, with the (c) correction, chemically sufficient precision ($\leq 1$ kcal/mol) is achieved with only $1.0 \times 10^5$ shots in the strongly correlated regime ($r=2.2$ Å) -- an order of magnitude fewer than required by an earlier matchgate-shadows implementation [J. Chem. Theory Comput., 20, 5068 (2024)]. By pairing resource-efficient quantum sampling with the CC theory, QSCI-TCC provides a promising pathway to quantum-chemical calculations of classically intractable systems.</p>

            <h2>Probing dynamical axion quasiparticles with two-photon correlations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Boyanovsky</p>
            <p>Dynamical axion (quasi) particles are emergent collective excitations in topological magnetic insulators that break parity and time reversal invariance or in Weyl semimetals. They couple to electromagnetism via a topological Chern-Simons term, leading to their decay into two photons. We extend the Weisskopf-Wigner formulation of atomic spontaneous emission to the quantum field theory of dynamical axion quasiparticles, allowing us to obtain the quantum two-photon state emerging from axion decay in real time. This state features \emph{hyperentanglement} in momentum and polarization with a distinct polarization pattern, a consequence of the parity and time reversal breaking of the axion-photon interaction. Polarization aspects of this two-photon state are studied by introducing quantum Stokes operators. Whereas the two-photon quantum state features vanishing \emph{averages} of the degree of polarization and polarization asymmetry, there are non-trivial momentum correlations of the Stokes operators. In particular momentum correlations of the \emph{polarization asymmetry} can be obtained directly from coincident momentum and polarization resolved two photon detection. Correlations of Stokes operators are directly related to momentum and polarization resolved Hanbury-Brown Twiss second order coherences. This relationship suggests two-photon correlations as a direct probe of dynamical axion quasiparticles. Similarities and differences with parametrically down converted photons and other systems where spontaneous emission yield hyperentangled two photon states are recognized, suggesting experimental avenues similar to tests of Bell inequalities to probe dynamical axion quasiparticles with coincident two photon detection.</p>

            <p>We present a general framework for engineering two-dimensional (2D) sub-wavelength topological optical lattices using spatially dependent atomic dark states in a $\Lambda$-type configuration of the atom-light coupling. By properly designing the spatial profiles of the laser fields inducing coupling between the atomic internal states, we show how to generate sub-wavelength Kronig-Penney-like geometric scalar potential accompanied by narrow and strong patches of the synthetic magnetic field localized in the same areas as the scalar potential. These sharply peaked magnetic fluxes are compensated by a smooth background magnetic field of opposite sign, resulting in zero net flux per unit cell while still enabling topologically nontrivial band structures. Specifically, for sufficiently narrow peaks, their influence is minimum, and the behavior of the system in a remaining smooth background magnetic field resembles the Landau problem, allowing for the formation of nearly flat energy bands with unit Chern numbers. Numerical analysis confirms the existence of ideal Chern bands and the robustness of the topological phases against non-adiabatic effects and losses. This makes the scheme well-suited for simulating quantum Hall systems and fractional Chern insulators in ultracold atomic gases, offering a new platform for exploring strongly correlated topological phases with high tunability.</p>

            <p>A theory of quantum gravity consists of a gravitational framework which, unlike general relativity, takes into account the quantum character of matter. In spite of impressive advances, no fully satisfactory, self-consistent and empirically viable theory with those characteristics has ever been constructed. A successful semiclassical gravity model, in which the classical Einstein tensor couples to the expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor of quantum matter fields, would, at the very least, constitute a useful stepping stone towards quantum gravity. However, not only no empirically viable semiclassical theory has ever been proposed, but the self-consistency of semiclassical gravity itself has been called into question repeatedly over the years. Here, we put forward a fully self-consistent, empirically viable semiclassical gravity framework, in which the expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor of a quantum field, evolving via a relativistic objective collapse dynamics, couples to a fully classical Einstein tensor. We present the general framework, a concrete example, and briefly explore possible empirical consequences of our model.</p>

            <p>Nonlocality, manifested by the violation of Bell inequalities, indicates entanglement within a joint quantum system. A natural question is how much entanglement is required for a given nonlocal behavior. Here, we explore this question by quantifying entanglement using a family of generalized Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt-type Bell inequalities. Given a Bell-inequality violation, we derive analytical lower bounds on the entanglement of formation, a measure related to entanglement dilution. The bounds also lead to an analytical estimation of the negativity of entanglement. In addition, we consider one-way distillable entanglement tied to entanglement distillation and derive tight numerical estimates. With the additional assumptions of qubit-qubit systems, we find that the relationship between entanglement and measurement incompatibility is not simply a trade-off under a fixed nonlocal behavior. Furthermore, we apply our results to two realistic scenarios -- non-maximally entangled and Werner states. We show that one can utilize the nonlocal statistics by optimizing the Bell inequality for better entanglement estimation.</p>

            <p>Quantum criticality often lies beyond the scope of the conventional Landau paradigm, and a unifying framework has yet to emerge, due in part to the wide variety of quantum orders. We propose a geometric approach to quantum phase transitions (QPTs) that shifts focus from microscopic order to the competition between non-commuting operators. This competition is encoded in the boundary geometry of their expectation values, defining a quantum observable space (QOS). We show that QPTs occur at zero-curvature points on the QOS boundary, signaling maximal commutativity and suggesting an underlying integrable structure at criticality.</p>

            <h2>Bootstrapping entanglement in quantum spin systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiaju Zhang, Arash Jafarizadeh, M. A. Rajabpour</p>
            <p>In this paper, we employ the bootstrap method, a technique that relies on consistency relations instead of direct diagonalization, to determine the expectation values in quantum many-body systems. We then use these values to assess the entanglement content of the system. Our work extends the bootstrap approach to quantum many-body systems, rather than single-body or few-body systems, concentrating on the well-known Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model with both transverse and longitudinal external magnetic fields. In the bootstrap method we solve the LMG model with up to 16 sites. Unlike previous studies that have focused mainly on ground-state properties, our methodology allows for the calculation of a broad range of properties, including energy spectrum, angular momentum, concurrence, tangle, residual tangle, and quantum Fisher information (QFI), for all eigenstates or a particular sector of the eigenstates, without referring to the explicit wavefunctions of these states. We show that this approach offers not only a new computational methodology but also a comprehensive view of both bipartite and multipartite entanglement properties across the entire spectrum of eigenstates. Specifically, we demonstrate that states typically found in the central region of the spectrum exhibit greater multipartite entanglement, as indicated by larger QFI values, compared to states at the edges of the spectrum. In contrast, concurrence displays the opposite trend. This observed behavior is in line with the monogamy principle governing quantum entanglement.</p>

            <h2>Logical Noise Bias in Magic State Injection</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicholas Fazio, Robin Harper, Stephen D. Bartlett</p>
            <p>Fault-tolerant architectures aim to reduce the noise of a quantum computation. Despite such architectures being well studied a detailed understanding of how noise is transformed in a fault-tolerant primitive such as magic state injection is currently lacking. We use numerical simulations of logical process tomography on a fault-tolerant gadget that implements a logical $T = Z(\pi/4)$ gate using magic state injection, to understand how noise characteristics at the physical level are transformed into noise characteristics at the logical level. We show how, in this gadget, a significant phase ($Z$) bias can arise in the logical noise, even with unbiased noise at the physical level. While the magic state injection gadget intrinsically induces biased noise, with extant phase bias being further amplified at the logical level, we identify noisy error correction circuits as a key limiting factor in the circuits studied on the magnitude of this logical noise bias. Our approach provides a framework for assessing the detailed noise characteristics, as well as the overall performance, of fault-tolerant logical primitives.</p>

            <p>Weak coin flipping is a cryptographic primitive in which two mutually distrustful parties generate a shared random bit to agree on a winner via remote communication. While a stand-alone secure weak coin flipping protocol can be constructed from noiseless quantum communication channels, its composability remains unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate that no weak coin flipping protocol can be abstracted as a simple black-box resource with composable security. Despite this, we also establish the overall stand-alone security of quantum weak coin flipping protocols under composition in sequential order.</p>

            <h2>Efficient Magic State Distillation by Zero-Level Distillation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomohiro Itogawa, Yugo Takada, Yutaka Hirano, Keisuke Fujii</p>
            <p>Magic state distillation (MSD) is an essential element for universal fault-tolerant quantum computing, which distills a high-fidelity magic state from noisy magic states using ideal (error-corrected) Clifford operations. For ideal Clifford operations, it needs to be performed on the logical qubits and hence incurs a large spatiotemporal overhead, which is one of the major bottlenecks for the realization of fault-tolerant quantum computers (FTQCs). Here we propose zero-level distillation, which prepares a high-fidelity logical magic state at the physical level, namely zero level, using physical qubits and nearest-neighbor two-qubit gates on a square lattice. We develop a zero-level distillation circuit and show that distillation can be made even more efficient than the conventional sophisticated approaches with logical level distillations. The key idea involves the Knill et al.-type distillation using the Steane code and its careful mapping to the square-lattice architecture with error detection. The distilled magic state on the Steane-code state is then teleported or converted to surface codes. We numerically find that the error rate of the logical magic state scales as approximately $100 \times p^{2}$ in terms of the physical error rate $p$. For example, with a physical error rate of $p = 10^{-4}$ ($10^{-3}$), the logical error rate is reduced to $p_{L} = 10^{-6}$ ($10^{-4}$), resulting in an improvement of 2 (1) orders of magnitude. This contributes to reducing both space and time overhead for early FTQC as well as full-fledged FTQC combined with conventional multilevel distillation protocols.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiace Sun, Lixue Cheng, Shi-Xin Zhang</p>
            <p>Stabilizer states, which are also known as the Clifford states, have been commonly utilized in quantum information, quantum error correction, and quantum circuit simulation due to their simple mathematical structure. In this work, we apply stabilizer states to tackle quantum many-body ground state problems and introduce the concept of stabilizer ground states. We establish an equivalence formalism for identifying stabilizer ground states of general Pauli Hamiltonians. Moreover, we develop an exact and linear-scaled algorithm to obtain stabilizer ground states of 1D local Hamiltonians and thus free from discrete optimization. This proposed equivalence formalism and linear-scaled algorithm are not only applicable to finite-size systems, but also adaptable to infinite periodic systems. The scalability and efficiency of the algorithms are numerically benchmarked on different Hamiltonians. Finally, we demonstrate that stabilizer ground states are promising tools for not only qualitative understanding of quantum systems, but also cornerstones of more advanced classical or quantum algorithms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nana Liu, Qisheng Wang, Mark M. Wilde, Zhicheng Zhang</p>
            <p>Matrix geometric means between two positive definite matrices can be defined from distinct perspectives - as solutions to certain nonlinear systems of equations, as points along geodesics in Riemannian geometry, and as solutions to certain optimisation problems. We devise quantum subroutines for the matrix geometric means, and construct solutions to the algebraic Riccati equation - an important class of nonlinear systems of equations appearing in machine learning, optimal control, estimation, and filtering. Using these subroutines, we present a new class of quantum learning algorithms, for both classical and quantum data, called quantum geometric mean metric learning, for weakly supervised learning and anomaly detection. The subroutines are also useful for estimating geometric Rényi relative entropies and the Uhlmann fidelity, in particular achieving optimal dependence on precision for the Uhlmann and Matsumoto fidelities. Finally, we provide a BQP-complete problem based on matrix geometric means that can be solved by our subroutines.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lance Lampert, Srikar Gadamsetty, Shantanu Chaudhary, Yiting Pei, Jiahao Chen, Elyana Crowder, Dragomir Davidović</p>
            <p>Perturbative master equations are essential for modeling open quantum systems but often exhibit late-time divergences when environmental correlations decay algebraically. In this work, we analyze the time-convolutionless (TCL) master equation, expanded to order 2n and demonstrate that, while van Kampens cumulants suppress early-time secular growth, they ultimately diverge at long times. To overcome this, we introduce a resummation technique based on the Hadamard trick, which incorporates time integrals directly into the bath spectral density via element-wise multiplication. This approach establishes a maximum expansion order, nmax, and defines a precision limit of the asymptotic states. The resummed master equation features renormalized Bohr frequencies that capture decoherence and spectral overlap effects. In the unbiased spin-boson model, this results in secular inflation of the generator at a temperature-independent rate equal to the decoherence rate and a finite validity time. For exponentially decaying correlations, the method recovers a proper Markovian limit below a critical coupling threshold.</p>

            <p>In 1935, Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen argued that quantum mechanics is incomplete based on the assumption that local actions cannot influence elements of reality at a distant location (local realism). In this work, using a recently defined quantum reality quantifier, we show that Alice's local quantum operations can be correlated with the erasure of the reality of observables in Bob's causally disconnected laboratory. To this end, we implement a modified optical quantum eraser experiment, ensuring that Alice's and Bob's measurements remain causally disconnected. Using an entangled pair of photons and quantum state tomography, we experimentally verify that, even with the total absence of any form of classical communication, the choice of quantum operation applied by Alice on her photon is correlated with the erasure of a spatial element of reality of Bob's photon. Our results reveal that Bob's photon can entangle two extra non-interacting degrees of freedom, thus confirming that Bob's photon path is not an element of physical reality.</p>

            <p>Elastic scattering of a twisted (Bessel) electron beam by CO$_2$ molecules is studied theoretically at high energies. The molecule's structure is optimized using coupled cluster theory and density functional theory with correlation-consistent and Pople basis sets. Coulomb potentials are used in the static approximation. The differential and total scattering cross-sections are computed in the first Born approximation. All cross-sections are orientation-averaged using a passive rotational averaging technique. The scattering is studied by the impact of the twisted beam with topological charges in the range $m_l$ = 1 and $m_l$ = 20. The cross sections are, in addition, averaged over the target's impact parameters, which accounts for the cross sections of a large distribution of CO$_2$ molecules. Finally, the molecule's total cross-section by plane waves and twisted beams is reported. The proposed methodology can be applied to study any polyatomic molecule, regardless of its structure.</p>

            <h2>Nonequilibrium Quasiparticles in Superconducting Circuits: Energy Relaxation, Charge and Flux Noise</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> José Alberto Nava Aquino, Rogério de Sousa</p>
            <p>The quasiparticle density observed in low-temperature superconducting circuits is several orders of magnitude larger than the value expected at thermal equilibrium. The tunneling of this excess of quasiparticles across Josephson junctions is recognized as one of the main loss and decoherence mechanisms in superconducting qubits. Here we present a unified impedance theory that accounts for quasiparticle energy loss in circuit regions both far and near (across) junctions. Our theory leverages the recent experimental demonstration that the excess quasiparticles are in \emph{quasiequilibrium} [T. Connolly et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. $\textbf{132}$, 217001 (2024)] and uses a generalized fluctuation-dissipation theorem to predict the amount of charge and flux noise generated by them. We compute the resulting energy relaxation time $T_1$ in transmon qubits with and without junction asymmetric gap engineering, and show that quasiparticles residing away from junctions can play a dominant role in the former case. They also may provide an upper limit for resonator quality factors if the density of amorphous two-level systems is reduced. In addition, we show that charge noise from quasiparticles leads to flux noise that is logarithmic-in-frequency, giving rise to a ``nearly white" contribution that is comparable to the flux noise observed in flux qubits. This contrasts with amorphous two-level systems, whose associated flux noise is shown to be superOhmic. \Addition{We discuss how this quasiparticle flux noise can limit $T_2^{*}$ coherence times in flux-tunable qubits. The final conclusion is that asymmetric gap engineering can greatly reduce noise and increase coherence times in superconducting qubits.</p>

While the previous work was based on symmetry arguments, here we present a fully quantum theory for the SaS scattering that properly explains, quantitatively describes, and provides a means to predict its spectral and polarization properties (for diamond). We also explore the possibilities offered by such system, designing an entanglement map based on changes in the light-matter system. In particular, we show how the broadband polarization entanglement, that emerges from the interference between electronic and phononic degrees of freedom in the SaS scattering, depends on parameters such as Stokes-anti-Stokes Raman shift, scattering geometry and laser bandwidth, opening the avenue of exploration of such phenomenon in information processing.</p>

            <h2>Time Derivatives of Weak Values</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xavier Oriols</p>
            <p>The time derivative of a physical property often gives rise to another meaningful property. Since weak values provide empirical insights that cannot be derived from expectation values, this paper explores what physical properties can be obtained from the time derivative of weak values. It demonstrates that, in general, the time derivative of a gauge-invariant weak value is neither a weak value nor a gauge-invariant quantity. Two conditions are presented to ensure that the left- or right-time derivative of a weak value is also a gauge-invariant weak value. Under these conditions, a local Ehrenfest-like theorem can be derived for weak values giving a natural interpretation for the time derivative of weak values. Notably, a single measured weak value of the system's position provides information about two additional unmeasured weak values: the system's local velocity and acceleration, through the first- and second-order time derivatives of the initial weak value, respectively. These findings also offer guidelines for experimentalists to translate the weak value theory into practical laboratory setups, paving the way for innovative quantum technologies. An example illustrates how the electromagnetic field can be determined at specific positions and times from the first- and second-order time derivatives of a weak value of position.</p>

We suggest using search-based methods together with machine learning to accelerate quantum algorithms, exemplified in the Quantum Eigensolver use case.

We evaluated our preliminary approach on 20-, 24- and 28-qubit systems by optimising the Eigensolver's hyperparameters. These models predict hyperparameter values, leading to a 0.12% reduction in error when tested on 28-qubit systems. However, due to inconclusive results with 20- and 24-qubit systems, we suggest further examination of the training data based on Hamiltonian characteristics. In future work, we plan to train machine learning models to optimise other aspects or subroutines of quantum algorithm execution beyond its hyperparameters.</p>

            <p>Due to the inherently probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, each experimental realization of a dynamical quantum system may yield a different measurement outcome, especially when the system is coupled to an environment that causes dissipation. Although it is in principle possible that some quantum trajectories lead to exotic highly entangled quantum states, the probability of observing these trajectories is usually extremely low. In this work, we show how to maximize the probability of generating highly entangled states, including maximally entangled cat states, in an ensemble of atoms experiencing superradiant decay. To this end, we analyze an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian which governs the dynamics between the quantum jumps associated with photon emission. A key result of our study is that, in order to maximally enhance the probability of cat state generation, the initial state needs to be non-classical. This can be achieved e.g. with one-axis twisting in a cavity-QED system.</p>

            <p>Real-to-complex spectral transitions and the associated spontaneous symmetry breaking of eigenstates are central to non-Hermitian physics, yet a comprehensive and universal theory that precisely describes the underlying physical mechanisms for each individual state remains elusive. Here, we resolve the mystery by employing the complex path integral formalism and developing a generalized Gutzwiller trace formula. These methodologies enable us to establish a universal quantum-classical correspondence that precisely links the real or complex nature of individual energy levels to the symmetry properties of their corresponding semiclassical orbits. Specifically, in systems with a general $\eta$-pseudo-Hermitian symmetry, real energy levels are quantized along periodic orbits that preserve the corresponding classical $S_\eta$ symmetry. In contrast, complex conjugate energy levels arise from semiclassical orbits that individually break the $S_\eta$ symmetry but together form $S_\eta$-symmetric pairs. This framework provides a unified explanation for the spectral behaviors in various continuous non-Hermitian models and for the $\mathcal{PT}$ transition in two-level systems. Besides, we demonstrate that the exceptional point is inherently a quantum phenomenon, as it cannot be described by a single classical orbit. Our work uncovers the physical mechanism of non-Hermitian symmetry breaking and introduces a new perspective with broad implications for the control and application of non-Hermitian phenomena.</p>

            <p>The arrays of nonlinear waveguides are a powerful integrated photonics platform for studying and manipulating quantum states of light. Also, they are a valuable resource for various quantum technologies. In this work, we employed a supermode approach to obtain an analytic solution to the evolution of degenerate biphoton states in arrays of nonlinear waveguides. The solution accounts for arrays of an arbitrary number of waveguides and coupling profiles. In addition, it provides an explicit analytic expression without the need of computationally-expensive steps. Actually, it only relies on the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the coupling matrix. In general, this needs to be performed numerically, but there are relevant instances in which analytic expressions are available. Thus, in certain cases, the procedure proposed here does not require the use of any numerical method. We analyze the general properties of the solution and show some application examples. Particularly, simple solutions that can be obtained by special symmetric injection profiles, the results for small arrays, and the properties of the propagation when only the center waveguide is pumped in a symmetric odd array. In addition, we present a proof-of-principle example on how to use the analytic solution to tackle inversion problems. That is, obtaining the initial conditions required to achieve a desired quantum state -- which is a valuable technological application. A relevant aspect of the method presented here is its scalability for large arrays due to the lack of resource-intensive steps -- both for the direct and inverse problems.</p>

            <p>Efficient estimation of nonlinear functions of quantum states is crucial for various key tasks in quantum computing, such as entanglement spectroscopy, fidelity estimation, and feature analysis of quantum data. Conventional methods using state tomography and estimating numerous terms of the series expansion are computationally expensive, while alternative approaches based on a purified query oracle impose practical constraints. In this paper, we introduce the quantum state function (QSF) framework by extending the SWAP test via linear combination of unitaries and parameterized quantum circuits. Our framework enables the implementation of arbitrarily normalized degree-$n$ polynomial functions of quantum states with precision $\varepsilon$ using $\mathcal{O}(n/\varepsilon^2)$ copies. We further apply QSF for developing quantum algorithms for fundamental tasks, including entropy, fidelity, and eigenvalue estimations. Specifically, for estimating von Neumann entropy, quantum relative entropy, and quantum state fidelity, where $\kappa$ and $\gamma$ represent the minimal nonzero eigenvalue and normalized factor, respectively, we achieve a sample complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\gamma^2/(\varepsilon^2\kappa))$. Our work establishes a concise and unified paradigm for estimating and realizing nonlinear functions of quantum states, paving the way for the practical processing and analysis of quantum data.</p>

            <p>Quantum physics can be extended into the complex domain by considering non-Hermitian Hamiltonians that are $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric. These exhibit exceptional points (EPs) where the eigenspectrum changes from purely real to purely imaginary values and have useful properties enabling applications such as accelerated entanglement generation and the delay of the sudden death of entanglement in noisy systems. An interesting question is whether similar beneficial effects can be achieved away from EPs, since this would extend the available parameter space and make experiments more accessible. We investigate this by considering a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric optomechanical system but also consider what happens when two-mode squeezing interactions are included, taking us into the pseudo-Hermitian regime. The addition of squeezing is motivated by an attempt to extend the lifetime of the system's entanglement. While this does not prove to be the case, rich dynamics are nonetheless observed in both the pseudo-Hermitian and $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric systems, including the sudden death and revival of entanglement under certain conditions. In both cases, we find that the sudden disappearance of entanglement can be mitigated at EPs, and also show that the revival of entanglement is quite robust to thermal noise in a group of parameters away from the EPs. This investigation extends our understanding of non-Hermitian systems and opens a new perspective for the development of quantum devices in non-Hermitian systems even away from EPs.</p>

            <p>We propose a new systematic construction of CSS-T codes from any given CSS code using a map $\phi$. When $\phi$ is the identity map $I$, we retrieve the construction of [1] and use it to prove the existence of asymptotically good binary CSS-T codes, resolving a previously open problem in the literature, and of asymptotically good quantum LDPC CSS-T codes. We analyze the structure of the logical operators corresponding to certain non-Clifford gates supported by the quantum codes obtained from this construction ($\phi = I$), concluding that they always result in the logical identity. An immediate application of these codes in dealing with coherent noise is discussed. We then develop a new doubling transformation for obtaining triorthogonal codes, which generalizes the doubling construction presented in [2]. Our approach permits using self-orthogonal codes, instead of only doubly-even codes, as building blocks for triorthogonal codes. This broadens the range of codes available for magic state distillation.</p>

            <p>Quantum machine learning is a rapidly advancing discipline that leverages the features of quantum mechanics to enhance the performance of computational tasks. Quantum reservoir processing, which allows efficient optimization of a single output layer without precise control over the quantum system, stands out as one of the most versatile and practical quantum machine learning techniques. Here we experimentally demonstrate a quantum reservoir processing approach for continuous-variable state reconstruction on a bosonic circuit quantum electrodynamics platform. The scheme learns the true dynamical process through a minimum set of measurement outcomes of a known set of initial states. We show that the map learnt this way achieves high reconstruction fidelity for several test states, offering significantly enhanced performance over using a map calculated based on an idealised model of the system. This is due to a key feature of reservoir processing which accurately accounts for physical non-idealities such as decoherence, spurious dynamics, and systematic errors. Our results present a valuable tool for robust bosonic state and process reconstruction, concretely demonstrating the power of quantum reservoir processing in enhancing real-world applications.</p>

            <p>We develop the algebraic method based on the Lie algebra of quadratic combinations of left and right superoperators associated with matrices to study the Lindblad dynamics of multimode bosonic systems coupled a thermal bath and described by the Liouvillian superoperator that takes into account both dynamical (coherent) and environment mediated (incoherent) interactions between the modes. Our algebraic technique is applied to transform the Liouvillian into the diagonalized form by eliminating jump superoperators and solve the spectral problem. The temperature independent effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, $\hat{H}_{eff}$, is found to govern both the diagonalized Liouvillian and the spectral properties. It is shown that the Liouvillian exceptional points are represented by the points in the parameter space where the matrix, $H$, associated with $\hat{H}_{eff}$ is non-diagonalizable. We use our method to derive the low-temperature approximation for the superpropagator and to study the special case of a two mode system representing the photonic polarization modes. For this system, we describe the geometry of exceptional points in the space of frequency and relaxation vectors parameterizing the intermode couplings and, for a single-photon state, evaluate the time dependence of the speed of evolution as a function of the angles characterizing the couplings and the initial state.</p>

            <p>A remarkable characteristic of quantum computing is the potential for reliable computation despite faulty qubits. This can be achieved through quantum error correction, which is typically implemented by repeatedly applying static syndrome checks, permitting correction of logical information. Recently, the development of time-dynamic approaches to error correction has uncovered new codes and new code implementations. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate three time-dynamic implementations of the surface code, each offering a unique solution to hardware design challenges and introducing flexibility in surface code realization. First, we embed the surface code on a hexagonal lattice, reducing the necessary couplings per qubit from four to three. Second, we walk a surface code, swapping the role of data and measure qubits each round, achieving error correction with built-in removal of accumulated non-computational errors. Finally, we realize the surface code using iSWAP gates instead of the traditional CNOT, extending the set of viable gates for error correction without additional overhead. We measure the error suppression factor when scaling from distance-3 to distance-5 codes of $\Lambda_{35,\text{hex}} = 2.15(2)$, $\Lambda_{35,\text{walk}} = 1.69(6)$, and $\Lambda_{35,\text{iSWAP}} = 1.56(2)$, achieving state-of-the-art error suppression for each. With detailed error budgeting, we explore their performance trade-offs and implications for hardware design. This work demonstrates that dynamic circuit approaches satisfy the demands for fault-tolerance and opens new alternative avenues for scalable hardware design.</p>

            <h2>Extendible quantum measurements and limitations on classical communication</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vishal Singh, Theshani Nuradha, Mark M. Wilde</p>
            <p>Unextendibility of quantum states and channels is inextricably linked to the no-cloning theorem of quantum mechanics, it has played an important role in understanding and quantifying entanglement, and more recently it has found applications in providing limitations on quantum error correction and entanglement distillation. Here we generalize the framework of unextendibility to quantum measurements and define $k$-extendible measurements for every integer $k\ge 2$. Our definition provides a hierarchy of semidefinite constraints that specify a set of measurements containing every measurement that can be realized by local operations and one-way classical communication. Furthermore, the set of $k$-extendible measurements converges to the set of measurements that can be realized by local operations and one-way classical communication as $k\to \infty$. To illustrate the utility of $k$-extendible measurements, we establish a semidefinite programming upper bound on the one-shot classical capacity of a channel, which outperforms the best known efficiently computable bound from [Matthews and Wehner, IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 60, pp. 7317-7329 (2014)] and also leads to efficiently computable upper bounds on the $n$-shot classical capacity of a channel.</p>

            <h2>An unholy trinity: TFNP, polynomial systems, and the quantum satisfiability problem</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marco Aldi, Sevag Gharibian, Dorian Rudolph</p>
            <p>The theory of Total Function NP (TFNP) and its subclasses says that, even if one is promised an efficiently verifiable proof exists for a problem, finding this proof can be intractable. Despite the success of the theory at showing intractability of problems such as computing Brouwer fixed points and Nash equilibria, subclasses of TFNP remain arguably few and far between. In this work, we define two new subclasses of TFNP borne of the study of complex polynomial systems: Multi-homogeneous Systems (MHS) and Sparse Fundamental Theorem of Algebra (SFTA). The first of these is based on Bézout's theorem from algebraic geometry, marking the first TFNP subclass based on an algebraic geometric principle. At the heart of our study is the computational problem known as Quantum SAT (QSAT) with a System of Distinct Representatives (SDR), first studied by [Laumann, Läuchli, Moessner, Scardicchio, and Sondhi 2010]. Among other results, we show that QSAT with SDR is MHS-complete, thus giving not only the first link between quantum complexity theory and TFNP, but also the first TFNP problem whose classical variant (SAT with SDR) is easy but whose quantum variant is hard. We also show how to embed the roots of a sparse, high-degree, univariate polynomial into QSAT with SDR, obtaining that SFTA is contained in a zero-error version of MHS. We conjecture this construction also works in the low-error setting, which would imply SFTA is contained in MHS.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate coherent manipulation of the nuclear degrees of freedom of ultracold ground-state strontium 87 atoms, thus providing a toolkit for fully exploiting the corresponding large Hilbert space as a quantum resource and for quantum simulation experiments with SU(N)-symmetric matter. By controlling the resonance conditions of Raman transitions with a tensor light shift, we can perform rotations within a restricted Hilbert space of two isolated spin states among the 2F+1 = 10 possible states. These manipulations correspond to engineering unitary operations deriving from generators of the SU(N) algebra beyond what can be done by simple spin precession. We present Ramsey interferometers involving an isolated pair of Zeeman states with no measurable decoherence after 3 seconds. We also demonstrate that one can harvest the large spin degrees of freedom as a qudit resource by implementing two interferometer schemes over four states. The first scheme senses in parallel multiple external fields acting on the atoms, and the second scheme simultaneously measures multiple observables of a collective atomic state - including non-commuting ones. Engineering unitary transformations of the large spin driven by other generators than the usual spin-F representation of the SU(2) group offers new possibilities from the point of view of quantum metrology and quantum many-body physics, notably for the quantum simulation of large-spin SU(N)-symmetric quantum magnetism with fermionic alkaline-earth atoms.</p>

            <p>H. Lamb considered the classical dynamics of a vibrating particle embedded in an elastic medium before the development of quantum theory. Lamb was interested in how the back-action of the elastic waves generated can damp the vibrations of the particle. We propose a quantum version of Lamb's model. We show that this model is exactly solvable by using a multimode Bogoliubov transformation. We find that the exact system ground state is a multimode squeezed vacuum state, and we obtain the exact Bogoliubov frequencies by numerically solving a nonlinear integral equation. A closed-form expression for the damping rate of the particle is obtained, and it agrees with the result obtained by perturbation theory. The model provides a solvable example of the damped quantum harmonic oscillator.</p>

            <p>Accurately characterizing the properties of structured reservoirs is a key challenge in quantum systems and is of great importance for advances in quantum metrology and sensing. In this work, we employ a two-level system (qubit) as a probe, which is coupled to a structured reservoir consisting of an ancilla qubit and a Markovian environment modeled as a thermal bath. By exploiting non-Markovian dynamics, we systematically investigate the effectiveness of different interaction types between the probe and ancilla for estimating critical parameters, including temperature, ancilla frequency, and system-bath coupling strength. We quantify the precision of parameter estimation using quantum Fisher information (QFI) and analyze the system dynamics in both transient and steady-state regimes. Our findings demonstrate that non-Markovianity substantially enhances parameter estimation in the transient regime, with specific interactions facilitating sustained information backflow and yielding higher QFI values. However, the performance of these interactions is contingent on the parameter under estimation and the operational regime. For instance, certain interactions become prominent in the transient regime but exhibit diminished utility in the steady state, whereas others maintain their effectiveness even at equilibrium. These results stress the importance of judiciously selecting interactions adapted to specific estimation objectives and operational regimes.</p>

The entanglement is created by the interaction beyond the Standard Model such as axionlike particle or physics motivated by string theory such as extra dimensions in the context of gravity.

            <p>Fast execution of complex quantum circuit simulations are crucial for verification of theoretical algorithms paving the way for their successful execution on the quantum hardware. However, the main stream CPU-based platforms for circuit simulation are well-established but slower. Despite this, adoption of GPU platforms remains limited because different hardware architectures require specialized quantum simulation frameworks, each with distinct implementations and optimization strategies. Therefore, we introduce Q-Gear, a software framework that transforms Qiskit quantum circuits into Cuda-Q kernels. By leveraging Cuda-Q seamless execution on GPUs, Q-Gear accelerates both CPU and GPU based simulations by respectively two orders of magnitude and ten times with minimal coding effort. Furthermore, Q-Gear leverages Cuda-Q configuration to interconnect GPUs memory allowing the execution of much larger circuits, beyond the memory limit set by a single GPU or CPU node. Additionally, we created and deployed a Podman container and a Shifter image at Perlmutter (NERSC/LBNL), both derived from NVIDIA public image. These public NERSC containers were optimized for the Slurm job scheduler allowing for close to 100% GPU utilization. We present various benchmarks of the Q-Gear to prove the efficiency of our computation paradigm.</p>

            <h2>Thirty-six officers, artisanally entangled</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Gross, Paulina Goedicke</p>
            <p>A perfect tensor of order $d$ is a state of four $d$-level systems that is maximally entangled under any bipartition. These objects have attracted considerable attention in quantum information and many-body theory. Perfect tensors generalize the combinatorial notion of orthogonal Latin squares (OLS). Deciding whether OLS of a given order exist has historically been a difficult problem. The case $d=6$ proved particularly thorny, and was popularized by Leonhard Euler in terms of a putative constellation of "36 officers". It took more than a century to show that Euler's puzzle has no solution. After yet another century, its quantum generalization was resolved in the affirmative: 36 entangled officers can be suitably arranged. However, the construction and verification of known instances relies on elaborate computer codes. In this paper, we present the first human-made order-$6$ perfect tensors. We decompose the Hilbert space $(\mathbb{C}^6)^{\otimes 2}$ of two quhexes into the direct sum $(\mathbb{C}^3)^{\otimes 2}\oplus(\mathbb{C}^3)^{\otimes 3}$ comprising superpositions of two-qutrit and three-qutrit states. Perfect tensors arise when certain Clifford unitaries are applied separately to the two sectors. Technically, our construction realizes solutions to the perfect functions ansatz recently proposed by Rather. Generalizing an observation of Bruzda and Życzkowski, we show that any solution of this kind gives rise to a two-unitary complex Hadamard matrix, of which we construct infinite families. Finally, we sketch a formulation of the theory of perfect tensors in terms of quasi-orthogonal decompositions of matrix algebras.</p>

            <p>Optical Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) offers the potential for unprecedented angular resolution in both astronomical imaging and precision measurements. Classical approaches, however, face significant limitations due to photon loss, background noise, and the requirements for dynamical delay lines over large distances. This document surveys recent developments in quantum-enabled VLBI, which aim to address these challenges using entanglement-assisted protocols, quantum memory storage, and nonlocal measurement techniques. While its application to astronomy is well known, we also examine how these techniques may be extended to geodesy -- specifically, the monitoring of Earth's rotation. Particular attention is given to quantum-enhanced telescope architectures, including repeater-based long baseline interferometry and quantum error-corrected encoding schemes, which offer a pathway toward high-fidelity optical VLBI. To aid the discussion, we also compare specifications for key enabling technologies to current state-of-the-art experimental components, including switching rates, gate times, entanglement distribution rates, and memory lifetimes. By integrating quantum technologies, future interferometric networks may achieve diffraction-limited imaging at optical and near-infrared wavelengths, surpassing the constraints of classical techniques and enabling new precision tests of astrophysical and fundamental physics phenomena.</p>

            <p>Quantum error correction (QEC) is required for large-scale computation, but incurs a significant resource overhead. Recent advances have shown that by jointly decoding logical qubits in algorithms composed of transversal gates, the number of syndrome extraction rounds can be reduced by a factor of the code distance $d$, at the cost of increased classical decoding complexity. Here, we reformulate the problem of decoding transversal circuits by directly decoding relevant logical operator products as they propagate through the circuit. This procedure transforms the decoding task into one closely resembling that of a single-qubit memory propagating through time. The resulting approach leads to fast decoding and reduced problem size while maintaining high performance. Focusing on the surface code, we prove that this method enables fault-tolerant decoding with minimum-weight perfect matching, and benchmark its performance on example circuits including magic state distillation. We find that the threshold is comparable to that of a single-qubit memory, and that the total decoding run time can be, in fact, less than that of conventional lattice surgery. Our approach enables fast correlated decoding, providing a pathway to directly extend single-qubit QEC techniques to transversal algorithms.</p>

Thus we construct the general matrix form of such representations based on the magnetic translations of the diagonal subgroup $HW_{2^n} \otimes HW_{2^n}$.

            <p>The irreversible entropy increase described by the second law of thermodynamics is fundamentally tied to thermalization and the emergence of equilibrium. In the first part of our work (Ref: arXiv.2503.04152), we constructed an isolated gas system model and numerically demonstrated irreversible growth of entanglement entropy caused by erasure of spread non-equilibrium state information. Here, we mathematically prove that for a typical macroscopic system in a non-equilibrium state $|\phi_0\rangle$, the quantum state $|\phi'_0\rangle = \hat{O}(t)|\phi_0\rangle$ will inevitably evolve toward equilibrium. Our work demonstrates that the second law of thermodynamics, and consequently the ergodic hypothesis in statistical physics, can be understood and proven from a quantum information perspective. From this perspective, the second law can be stated as: In typical macroscopic physical systems, the spreading and erasure of non-equilibrium information is inevitable.</p>

            <p>Autonomous quantum thermal machines are particularly suited to understand how correlations between thermal baths, a load, and a thermal machine affect the overall thermodynamic functioning of the setup. Here, we show that by tuning the operating temperatures and the magnitude of the coupling between machine and load, the thermal machine can operate in four modes: engine, accelerator, heater, or refrigerator. In particular, we show that as we increase the coupling strength, the engine mode is suppressed, and the refrigerator mode is no longer attainable, leaving the heater as the most pronounced functioning modality, followed by the accelerator. This regime switching can be amplified by quantum effects, such as the bosonic enhancement factor for a harmonic oscillator load, which modifies the effective machine-load coupling, making the thermodynamic functioning sensitive to the initial preparation of the load.</p>

            <p>We investigate photon-mediated magnon-magnon coupling between spatially separated Yttrium Iron Garnet (YIG) and permalloy (NiFe) thin films placed on a planar hexagonal ring resonator. We observe clear signatures of magnon-magnon interaction in the absence of direct dipolar interaction between the magnetic films. Notably, the coupling strength between the hexagonal ring resonator and the permalloy film increases with the thickness of the YIG film, despite a fixed permalloy film thickness, suggesting the presence of an indirect interaction channel mediated by resonator photons. To support these findings, we present a theoretical model that accurately reproduces the observed transmission spectra and reveals a nontrivial interdependence between the individual coupling strengths of YIG and permalloy to the resonator. These results underscore the importance of indirect interactions and potential crosstalk pathways in designing hybrid magnonic systems and scalable quantum architectures, while demonstrating the feasibility of cost-effective, planar configurations for experimental implementation. These insights are valuable for advancing low-loss, coherent information transfer in hybrid quantum devices.</p>

            <p>Quantum guessing games offer a structured approach to analyzing quantum information processing, where information is encoded in quantum states and extracted through measurement. An additional aspect of this framework is the influence of partial knowledge about the input on the optimal measurement strategies. This kind of side information can significantly influence the guessing strategy and earlier work has shown that the timing of such side information, whether revealed before or after the measurement, can affect the success probabilities. In this work, we go beyond this established distinction by introducing the concept of metainformation. Metainformation is information about information, and in our context it is knowledge that additional side information of certain type will become later available, even if it is not yet provided. We show that this seemingly subtle difference between having no expectation of further information versus knowing it will arrive can have operational consequences for the guessing task. Our results demonstrate that metainformation can, in certain scenarios, enhance the achievable success probability up to the point that post-measurement side information becomes as useful as prior-measurement side information, while in others it offers no benefit. By formally distinguishing metainformation from actual side information, we uncover a finer structure in the interplay between timing, information, and strategy, offering new insights into the capabilities of quantum systems in information processing tasks.</p>

            <p>Quantum contextuality is known as the fundamental feature of quantum mechanics. It is not clear whether contextuality fully reveals the nonclassical aspects of quantum mechanics. To answer this question, we propose a mathematical framework based on logic algebra to compare classical and quantum experiments. With the framework, we precisely characterize the contextuality and nonclassicality, reveal that the former is a sufficient but not necessary condition for the latter, and present a type of quantum experiments which exhibit nonclassicality without contextuality. We also point out that the property of quantum systems is captured by the projector generators. Therefore, it is possible to witness quantum contextuality with simplified measurement configurations. For example, we show that 12 projectors witness the Kochen-Specker contextuality, and 3 measurements are sufficient to witness the quantum contextuality, as compared to the 4 presented in the compatibility graph approach.</p>

            <p>We analyze the impact of spatial non-locality and losses in the electromagnetic response of graphene on the Casimir-Lifshitz interaction. To this purpose, we calculate the Casimir-Lifshitz force (CLF) between a gold sphere and a graphene-coated SiO$_2$ plane and compare our finding with the recent experiment in PRL {\bf 126}, 206802 (2021) and PRB {\bf 104}, 085436 (2021). We calculated the CLF using three different models for the electromagnetic response of graphene: electric conductivity using a non-local and lossy Kubo model, electric conductivity using the local and lossy Kubo model, and the non-local and lossless polarization operator model. The relation between these three models has been recently explored in PRB {\bf 111}, 115428 (2025). We show that, for the parameters of the available experiments, the theoretical predictions for the Casimir-Lifshitz force using the three models are practically identical (having a relative differences smaller than $10^{-3}$). This implies that for those given experiments, both non-local and lossy effects in the graphene response are completely negligible. We also find that this experiment cannot distinguish between the Drude and Plasma prescriptions for the involved materials (gold and graphene). Our findings are relevant for present and future comparisons with experimental measurement of the Casimir-Lifshitz force involving graphene structures. Indeed, we show that an extremely simple local Kubo model for the electric conductivity, explicitly depending on Dirac mass, chemical potential, losses and temperature, is largely enough for a totally comprehensive comparison with typical experimental configurations. We also show how the Polarization tensor must be used and modified in general, for phenomena needing a more fine response function, i.e. requiring both the spatial non-locality and losses.</p>

            <p>This work proposes a minimal model extending the duality between classical statistical spin systems and fermionic systems beyond the case of free fermions. A Jordan-Wigner transformation applied to a two-dimensional tensor network maps the partition sum of a classical statistical mechanics model to a Grassmann variable integral, structurally similar to the path integral for interacting fermions in two dimensions. The resulting model is simple, featuring only two parameters: one governing spin-spin interaction (dual to effective hopping strength in the fermionic picture), the other measuring the deviation from the free fermion limit. Nevertheless, it exhibits a rich phase diagram, partially stabilized by elements of topology, and featuring three phases meeting at a tricritical point. Besides the interpretation as a spin and fermionic system, the model is closely related to loop gas and vertex models and can be interpreted as a parity-preserving (non-unitary) circuit. Its minimal construction makes it an ideal reference system for studying non-linearities in tensor networks and deriving results by means of duality.</p>

We demonstrate our methodology both with a fermionic model with spin-orbit coupling, as well as with many-body spin models with long-range exchange and anisotropic exchange interactions. We show that our approach enables performing Hamiltonian extraction in the presence of significant noise, providing a strategy to perform Hamiltonian learning with experimental observables in atomic-scale quantum magnets. Our results establish a strategy to perform Hamiltonian learning by exploiting the impact of impurities in complex quantum many-body states.</p>

Previous studies have demonstrated their capability to detect scalar and vector ULDM candidates, yet their potential for probing spin-2 ULDM remains unexplored. In this work, we address this gap by investigating the sensitivity of atom interferometers to spin-2 ULDM across several frameworks for massive gravity, including the Lorentz-invariant Fierz-Pauli case and two distinct Lorentz-violating scenarios. We show that coherent oscillations of the spin-2 ULDM field induce measurable phase shifts in atom interferometers through three coupling mechanisms: scalar interactions that modify atomic energy levels, and vector and tensor effects that alter the propagation of both atoms and light. We demonstrate that these multifaceted interactions enable atom interferometers to probe a range of ULDM properties and mass scales that are inaccessible to laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors. Our results establish the potential of atom interferometers to open a new experimental frontier for spin-2 dark matter detection.</p>

            <h2>Rydberg Atomic Quantum Receivers for Multi-Target DOA Estimation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tierui Gong, Chau Yuen, Chong Meng Samson See, Mérouane Debbah, Lajos Hanzo</p>
            <p>Quantum sensing technologies have experienced rapid progresses since entering the `second quantum revolution'. Among various candidates, schemes relying on Rydberg atoms exhibit compelling advantages for detecting radio frequency signals. Based on this, Rydberg atomic quantum receivers (RAQRs) have emerged as a promising solution to classical wireless communication and sensing. To harness the advantages and exploit the potential of RAQRs in wireless sensing, we investigate the realization of the direction of arrival (DOA) estimation by RAQRs. Specifically, we first conceive a Rydberg atomic quantum uniform linear array (RAQ-ULA) aided wireless receiver for multi-target DOA detection and propose the corresponding signal model of this sensing system. Our model reveals that the presence of the radio-frequency local oscillator in the RAQ-ULA creates sensor gain mismatches, which degrade the DOA estimation significantly by employing the classical Estimation of Signal Parameters via Rotational Invariant Techniques (ESPRIT). To solve this sensor gain mismatch problem, we propose the Rydberg atomic quantum ESPRIT (RAQ-ESPRIT) relying on our model. Lastly, we characterize our scheme through numerical simulations, where the results exhibit that it is capable of reducing the estimation error of its classical counterpart on the order of $> 400$-fold and $> 9000$-fold in the PSL and SQL, respectively.</p>

            <h2>Critical Limitations in Quantum-Selected Configuration Interaction Methods</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peter Reinholdt, Karl Michael Ziems, Erik Rosendahl Kjellgren, Sonia Coriani, Stephan P. A. Sauer, Jacob Kongsted</p>
            <p>Quantum Selected Configuration Interaction (QSCI) methods (also known as Sample-based Quantum Diagonalization, SQD) have emerged as promising near-term approaches to solving the electronic Schr{ö}dinger equation with quantum computers. In this work, we perform numerical analysis to show that QSCI methods face critical limitations that severely hinder their practical applicability in chemistry. Using the nitrogen molecule and the iron-sulfur cluster [2Fe-2S] as examples, we demonstrate that while QSCI can, in principle, yield high-quality configuration interaction (CI) expansions similar to classical SCI heuristics in some cases, the method struggles with inefficiencies in finding new determinants as sampling repeatedly selects already seen configurations. This inefficiency becomes especially pronounced when targeting high-accuracy results or sampling from an approximate ansatz. In cases where the sampling problem is not present, the resulting CI expansions are less compact than those generated from classical heuristics, rendering QSCI an overall more expensive method. Our findings suggest a significant drawback in QSCI methods when sampling from the ground-state distribution as the inescapable trade-off between finding sufficiently many determinants and generating compact, accurate CI expansions. This ultimately hinders utility in quantum chemistry applications, as QSCI falls behind more efficient classical counterparts.</p>

            <p>Ultracold atoms, typically manipulated by scalar beams with uniform polarization, have propelled advances in quantum simulation, computation, and metrology. Yet, vector beams (VBs) -- structured light with spatially varying polarization -- remain unexplored in this context, despite their enhanced tunability and broad optical applications. Here, we demonstrate a novel scheme to generate synthetic gauge fields in ultracold atoms via VB-mediated coupling of internal states. This approach enables angular stripe phases across an expanded parameter range, achieving a three-order-of-magnitude enhancement in the phase diagram and facilitating experimental observation. We further present an all-optical method to create topologically nontrivial giant skyrmions in spin space, with tunable topology governed by VB parameters. Our findings establish VBs as powerful tools for quantum control and the exploration of exotic quantum states and phases.</p>

            <p>Moiré and super-moiré materials provide exceptional platforms to engineer exotic correlated quantum matter. The vast number of sites required to model moiré systems in real space remains a formidable challenge due to the immense computational resources required. Super-moiré materials push this requirement to the limit, where millions or even billions of sites need to be considered, a requirement beyond the capabilities of conventional methods for interacting systems. Here, we establish a methodology that allows solving correlated states in systems reaching a billion sites, that exploits tensor-network representations of real-space Hamiltonians and self-consistent real-space mean-field equations. Our method combines a tensor-network kernel polynomial method with quantics tensor cross interpolation algorithm, enabling us to solve exponentially large models, including those whose single particle Hamiltonian is too large to be stored explicitly. We demonstrate our methodology with super-moiré systems featuring spatially modulated hoppings, many-body interactions and domain walls, showing that it allows access to self-consistent symmetry broken states and spectral functions of real-space models reaching a billion sites. Our methodology provides a strategy to solve exceptionally large interacting problems, providing a widely applicable strategy to compute correlated super-moiré quantum matter.</p>

            <h2>Real state transfer on edge perturbed graphs with generalized clusters</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hiranmoy Pal</p>
            <p>We study the existence of real state transfer in edge-perturbed graphs containing generalized clusters, where the Hamiltonian is taken to be either the adjacency matrix, the Laplacian matrix, or the signless Laplacian matrix of an associated weighted graph. This framework provides a unified approach for constructing new graphs that exhibit perfect real state transfer, building on known examples with this property. A central observation is that the evolution of certain quantum states depends solely on the local structure of the underlying graph. In particular, we construct an infinite family of graphs with maximum valency five that exhibit perfect pair state transfer-under each of the aforementioned matrices-between the same pair of states at the same time, despite being non-regular. Additionally, we identify instances of perfect pair state transfer in edge-perturbed graphs, including complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs, blow-up graphs, and related structures. We also examine various graph operations-such as the sequential join, complement, Cartesian product, lexicographic product, and corona product-that generate new families of graphs exhibiting perfect real state transfer with respect to all three choices of the Hamiltonian.</p>

            <p>Bethe strings are bound states of constituent particles in a variety of interacting many-body one-dimensional (1D) integrable quantum models relevant to magnetism, nanophysics, cold atoms and beyond. As emergent fundamental excitations, they are predicted to collectively reshape observable equilibrium and dynamical properties. Small individual Bethe strings have recently been observed in quantum magnets and superconducting qubits. However, creating states featuring intermixtures of many, including large, strings remains an outstanding experimental challenge. Here, using nearly integrable ultracold Bose gases, we realize such intermixtures of Bethe strings out of equilibrium, by dynamically tuning interactions from repulsive to attractive. We measure the average binding energy of the strings, revealing the presence of bound states of more than six particles. We find further evidence for them in the momentum distribution and in Tan's contact, connected to the correlated density. Our data quantitatively agree with predictions from generalized hydrodynamics (GHD). Manipulating intermixtures of Bethe strings opens new avenues for understanding quantum coherence, nonlinear dynamics and thermalization in strongly-interacting 1D systems.</p>

Through rigorous dimensional reduction, we derive the first complete Schrödinger and Klein-Gordon equations incorporating non-perturbative geometric interactions-resolving ambiguities in constrained quantization. Crucially, extrinsic curvature of the ambient manifold governs emergent low-dimensional quantum phenomena. Remarkably, this mechanism generates scalar field masses matching Kaluza-Klein spectra while eliminating periodic compactification requirements. Geometric induction concurrently produces Higgs mechanism potentials. Particle masses emerge solely from submanifold embedding geometry, with matter-field couplings encoded in curvature invariants. This enables experimental access to higher-dimensional physics at all energy scales through geometric induction.</p>

            <p>In recent years, various techniques have been explored for the verification of quantum circuits, including the use of barrier certificates, mathematical tools capable of demonstrating the correctness of such systems. These certificates ensure that, starting from initial states and applying the system's dynamics, the system will never reach undesired states. In this paper, we propose a methodology for synthesizing such certificates for quantum circuits using a scenario-based approach, for both finite and infinite time horizons. In addition, our approach can handle uncertainty in the initial states and in the system's dynamics. We present several case studies on quantum circuits, comparing the performance of different types of barrier certificate and analyzing which one is most suitable for each case.</p>

            <p>We propose an extension of Schrödinger's equation that incorporates the macroscopic measurement-induced wavefunction collapse phenomenon. Our approach relies on a hybrid between Bohm-de Broglie pilot-wave and objective collapse theories. The Bohmian particle is guided by the wavefunction and, conversely, the wavefunction gradually localizes towards the particle's position. As long as the particle can visit any state, as in a typical microscopic system, the localization effect does not favor any particular quantum state and, on average, the usual Schrödinger-like time evolution results. However, when the wavefunction develops spatially well-separated lobes, as would happen during a macroscopic measurement, the Bohmian particle can remain trapped in one lobe, and the wavefunction eventually localizes there. The end result, in macroscopic systems, is a wavefunction collapse that is consistent with Born's rule. We illustrate the theory with a simple double-slit experiment simulation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander S. Carney, Juan S. Salcedo-Gallo, Salil K. Bedkihal, Mattias Fitzpatrick</p>
            <p>Exceptional points (EPs), spectral singularities arising in non-Hermitian dynamical systems, have drawn widespread attention for their potential to enhance sensor capability by leveraging characteristic square-root frequency splitting. However, the advantages of EP sensors have remained highly contested, primarily due to their inherent hypersensitivity to model errors and loss of precision arising from eigenbasis collapse, quantified by the Petermann noise factor. Recently, it has been suggested that practical sensor implementations should instead utilize transmission peak degeneracies (TPDs), which exhibit square-root transmission splitting while maintaining a complete eigenbasis, potentially mitigating the Petermann noise around EPs. This work presents a microwave magnon-photon dimer with near-universal tunability across all relevant parameters, which we use to investigate various TPDs experimentally. We demonstrate that two-dimensional EP and TPD configurations based on coupled oscillators can be unified into a general theory and experimental framework utilizing synthetic gauge fields, which we present and validate through careful experiments on two representative TPDs. We also introduce practical metrics to quantify the performance and robustness of TPDs beyond just the Petermann noise factor. Our formalism and experimental methods unify previous EP and TPD configurations and may lead to the realization of robust TPD-enhanced sensors.</p>

            <p>By utilizing a unitary transformation, we derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for the degeneracy between the even- and odd-parity energy states of the spin-boson model (SBM). Employing the Rayleigh quotient of matrix algebra, we rigorously prove that the ground state energy of the SBM is lower than the systems lowest possible degenerate energy and possesses a definite parity. Based on the necessary and sufficient conditions for parity breaking, we provide an analytical expression for the parity-breaking critical value, which is closely related to the expansion order and computational accuracy. This expression reproduces the SBM phase diagram obtained by quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) and logarithmic discretization numerical renormalization group (NRG) methods. However, this phase diagram does not characterize the ground state of the system.</p>

            <p>We analyze the tree-level generation of entanglement through some key scattering processes in massless quantum electrodynamics on canonical noncomutative spacetime with space-space type of noncommutativity. The fermions in the noncommutative theory will be zero charge fermions. The scattering processes we shall study do not occur in ordinary Minkowski spacetime. We shall use the concurrence to characterize the amount of entanglement generated through a given scattering process. We shall show that, at tree-level, the concurrence for the scattering of two photons of opposite helicity is given by the same expression as in the case of the scattering of gluons in ordinary Minkowski spacetime. Thus, maximal entanglement is achieved if and only if the polar scattering angle is equal to $\pi/2$. We also compute the concurrence for the head-on collision in the laboratory reference frame of two fermions of opposite helicity to obtain the same result as in the case of photon scattering. Finally, we shall study a type of collision at right angles in the laboratory frame of fermions with opposite helicity. We show that in the latter case the concurrence depends on energy of the incoming fermions, the noncommutativity matrix $\theta^{ij}$, the polar, $\theta$, and azimuth angle, $\phi$, of the zero-momentum frame of the incoming fermions. In this latter case we see that when $\theta=\pi/2$ there are values of $\phi$ for which no entanglement is generated.</p>

Key to this long-unsolved question is to test whether a given physical system has non-classical features. Here we connect recently proposed witnesses of non-classicality, based on information-theoretic ideas, with the theory of temporal entanglement. We provide a protocol to witness the non-classicality of a system by probing it with a qubit: we show that, assuming a general conservation law, violating temporal Bell inequalities on the qubit probe implies the non-classicality of the system under investigation. We also perform proof-of-principle experimental emulations of the proposed witness of non-classicality, using a three qubit Nuclear Magnetic Resonance quantum computer. Our result is robust, as it relies on minimal assumptions, and remarkably it can be applied in a broad range of contexts, from quantum biology to quantum gravity.</p>

            <p>Equilibrium and nonequilibrium states of matter can exhibit fundamentally different behavior. A key example is the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class in two spatial dimensions (2D KPZ), where microscopic deviations from equilibrium give rise to macroscopic scaling laws without equilibrium counterparts. While extensively studied theoretically, direct experimental evidence of 2D KPZ scaling has remained limited to interface growth so far. Here, we report the observation of universal scaling consistent with the KPZ universality class in 2D exciton-polariton condensates -- quantum fluids of light that are inherently driven and dissipative, thus breaking equilibrium conditions. Using momentum-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy as well as space- and time-resolved interferometry, we probe the phase correlations across microscopically different systems, varying drive conditions in two distinct lattice geometries. Our analysis reveals correlation dynamics and scaling exponents in excellent agreement with 2D KPZ predictions. These results establish exciton-polariton condensates as a robust experimental platform for exploring 2D nonequilibrium universality quantitatively, and open new avenues for investigating the emergence of coherence in interacting quantum systems far from equilibrium.</p>

            <p>Trying to export ab initio polaritonic chemistry onto emerging quantum computers raises fundamental questions. A central one is how to efficiently represent both fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom on the same platform, in order to develop computational strategies that can accurately capture strong electron-photon correlations at a reasonable cost for implementation on near-term hardware. Given the hybrid fermion-boson nature of polaritonic problem, one may legitimately ask: should we rely exclusively on conventional qubit-based platforms, or consider alternative computational paradigms? To explore this, we investigate in this work three strategies: qubit-based, qudit-based, and hybrid qubit-qumode approaches. For each platform, we design compact, physically motivated quantum circuit ansätze and integrate them within the state-averaged variational quantum eigensolver to compute multiple polaritonic eigenstates simultaneously. A key element of our approach is the development of compact electron-photon entangling circuits, tailored to the native capabilities and limitations of each hardware architecture. We benchmark all three strategies on a cavity-embedded H$_{2}$ molecule, reproducing characteristic phenomena such as light-induced avoided crossings. Our results show that each platform achieves comparable accuracy in predicting polaritonic eigen-energies and eigenstates. However, with respect to quantum resources required the hybrid qubit-qumode approach offers the most favorable tradeoff between resource efficiency and accuracy, followed closely by the qudit-based method. Both of which outperform the conventional qubit-based strategy. Our work presents a hardware-conscious comparison of quantum encoding strategies for polaritonic systems and highlights the potential of higher-dimensional quantum platforms to simulate complex light-matter systems.</p>

            <h2>When do molecular polaritons behave like optical filters?</h2>

            <p>This review outlines several linear optical effects featured by molecular polaritons arising in the collective strong light-matter coupling regime. Under weak laser irradiation and when the single-molecule light-matter coupling can be neglected (often in the limit when the number of molecules per photon mode is large), we show that the excited-state molecular dynamics under collective strong coupling can be exactly replicated without the cavity using a shaped (or ``filtered'') laser, whose field amplitude is enhanced by the cavity quality factor, shining on the bare molecules. As a consequence, the absorption within a cavity can be understood as the overlap between the polariton transmission and the bare molecular absorption, suggesting that polaritons act in part as optical filters. This framework demystifies and provides a straightforward explanation for a large class of experiments and theoretical models in molecular polaritonics, highlighting that the same effects can be achieved without the cavity with shaped laser pulses. With a few modifications, this simple conceptual picture can also be adapted to understand the incoherent nonlinear response of polaritonic systems. This review establishes a clear distinction between polaritonic phenomena that can be fully explained through classical linear optics and those that require a quantum electrodynamics approach. It also highlights the need to differentiate between effects that necessitate polaritons (i.e., hybrid light-matter states) and those that can occur in the weak coupling regime. We further discuss that certain quantum optical effects like fluorescence can be partially described as optical filtering, whereas some others like cavity-induced Raman scattering go beyond this. Further exploration in these areas is needed to uncover novel polaritonic phenomena beyond optical filtering.</p>

            <p>The plausible resolution of the Casimir puzzle implying that the dissipative Drude model is not applicable in the area of transverse electric evanescent waves is discussed. Calculations show that for the propagating waves, as well for the evanescent waves with transverse magnetic polarization, the Drude model can beused in calculations of the Casimir force by the Lifshitz theory with no contradictions with the measurement data. The lateral component of magnetic field of the magnetic dipole oscillating near a metallic surface is computed for the parameters of experiment in preparation which is aimed to directly check the validity of the Drude model in the area of transverse electric evanescent waves. By comparing with the case of graphene, whose dielectric response is spatially nonlocal and possesses the double pole at zero frequency, it is hypothesized that the success of the dissipationless plasma model in this area is also caused by the presence of a double pole.</p>

            <h2>Long-Range Entangling Operations via Josephson Junction Metasurfaces</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mustafa Bakr</p>
            <p>We present a framework for implementing two-qubit entangling operations between distant superconducting qubits using a space-time modulated Josephson junction metasurface. By modulating the surface in both space and time, we engineer sidebands with controllable wavevectors that selectively couple target qubits. The metasurface acts as a reconfigurable coupling medium, where the interaction strength is determined by engineered transmission coefficients rather than by exponentially decaying near-field coupling, thus reducing the dependence on physical proximity. We investigated the implementation of two-qubit interactions via iSWAP gates driven resonantly through the metasurface and controlled phase gates via geometric phase accumulation. Simulations show entangling fidelity exceeding 98% maintained over centimeter scale separations.</p>

            <p>Recent studies have shown long-distance entanglement using NV centers, atoms, and quantum dots with single-photon time-bin encoding. We propose a method to entangle remote superconducting qubits via microwave-optical transduction using multi-time-bin states. By adapting conventional entanglement swapping techniques, fidelity improves from 0.75 to $0.98$ in transduction systems, and 0.66 to 0.89 in noisy channels. The protocol mitigates thermal noise without relying on purification and offers a practical path toward scalable, heterogeneous quantum systems.</p>

            <p>The universality of quantum theory has been questioned ever since it was proposed. Key to this long-unsolved question is to test whether a given physical system has non-classical features. Here we connect recently proposed witnesses of non-classicality, based on information-theoretic ideas, with the theory of temporal entanglement. We provide a protocol to witness the non-classicality of a system by probing it with a qubit: we show that, assuming a general conservation law, violating temporal Bell inequalities on the qubit probe implies the non-classicality of the system under investigation. We also perform proof-of-principle experimental emulations of the proposed witness of non-classicality, using a three qubit Nuclear Magnetic Resonance quantum computer. Our result is robust, as it relies on minimal assumptions, and remarkably it can be applied in a broad range of contexts, from quantum biology to quantum gravity.</p>

            <p>Equilibrium and nonequilibrium states of matter can exhibit fundamentally different behavior. A key example is the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class in two spatial dimensions (2D KPZ), where microscopic deviations from equilibrium give rise to macroscopic scaling laws without equilibrium counterparts. While extensively studied theoretically, direct experimental evidence of 2D KPZ scaling has remained limited to interface growth so far. Here, we report the observation of universal scaling consistent with the KPZ universality class in 2D exciton-polariton condensates -- quantum fluids of light that are inherently driven and dissipative, thus breaking equilibrium conditions. Using momentum-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy as well as space- and time-resolved interferometry, we probe the phase correlations across microscopically different systems, varying drive conditions in two distinct lattice geometries. Our analysis reveals correlation dynamics and scaling exponents in excellent agreement with 2D KPZ predictions. These results establish exciton-polariton condensates as a robust experimental platform for exploring 2D nonequilibrium universality quantitatively, and open new avenues for investigating the emergence of coherence in interacting quantum systems far from equilibrium.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement through high-energy scattering in noncommutative quantum electrodynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Carmelo P. Martin</p>
            <p>We analyze the tree-level generation of entanglement through some key scattering processes in massless quantum electrodynamics on canonical noncomutative spacetime with space-space type of noncommutativity. The fermions in the noncommutative theory will be zero charge fermions. The scattering processes we shall study do not occur in ordinary Minkowski spacetime. We shall use the concurrence to characterize the amount of entanglement generated through a given scattering process. We shall show that, at tree-level, the concurrence for the scattering of two photons of opposite helicity is given by the same expression as in the case of the scattering of gluons in ordinary Minkowski spacetime. Thus, maximal entanglement is achieved if and only if the polar scattering angle is equal to $\pi/2$. We also compute the concurrence for the head-on collision in the laboratory reference frame of two fermions of opposite helicity to obtain the same result as in the case of photon scattering. Finally, we shall study a type of collision at right angles in the laboratory frame of fermions with opposite helicity. We show that in the latter case the concurrence depends on energy of the incoming fermions, the noncommutativity matrix $\theta^{ij}$, the polar, $\theta$, and azimuth angle, $\phi$, of the zero-momentum frame of the incoming fermions. In this latter case we see that when $\theta=\pi/2$ there are values of $\phi$ for which no entanglement is generated.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raphael Holzinger, Susanne F. Yelin</p>
            <p>Determining the peak photon emission time and rate for an ensemble of $N$ quantum systems undergoing collective superradiant decay typically requires tracking the time evolution of the density operator, a process with computational costs scaling exponentially with $N$. We present compact, analytic formulas for evaluating the peak emission rate and time for initially fully excited quantum emitter ensembles, valid for any geometric configuration and emitter type. These formulas rely solely on the variance of the eigenvalues of a real symmetric $N \times N$ matrix, which describes collective dissipation. We demonstrate the versatility of these results across various environments, including free space, solid-state, and waveguide reservoirs. For large $N$ the formulas simplify further to depend on just two parameters: average nearest-neighbor spacing and emitter number. Finally, we present scaling laws and bounds on the spatial size of emitter ensembles, such that superradiance is maintained, independent of emitter number or density.</p>

            <p>Trying to export ab initio polaritonic chemistry onto emerging quantum computers raises fundamental questions. A central one is how to efficiently represent both fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom on the same platform, in order to develop computational strategies that can accurately capture strong electron-photon correlations at a reasonable cost for implementation on near-term hardware. Given the hybrid fermion-boson nature of polaritonic problem, one may legitimately ask: should we rely exclusively on conventional qubit-based platforms, or consider alternative computational paradigms? To explore this, we investigate in this work three strategies: qubit-based, qudit-based, and hybrid qubit-qumode approaches. For each platform, we design compact, physically motivated quantum circuit ansätze and integrate them within the state-averaged variational quantum eigensolver to compute multiple polaritonic eigenstates simultaneously. A key element of our approach is the development of compact electron-photon entangling circuits, tailored to the native capabilities and limitations of each hardware architecture. We benchmark all three strategies on a cavity-embedded H$_{2}$ molecule, reproducing characteristic phenomena such as light-induced avoided crossings. Our results show that each platform achieves comparable accuracy in predicting polaritonic eigen-energies and eigenstates. However, with respect to quantum resources required the hybrid qubit-qumode approach offers the most favorable tradeoff between resource efficiency and accuracy, followed closely by the qudit-based method. Both of which outperform the conventional qubit-based strategy. Our work presents a hardware-conscious comparison of quantum encoding strategies for polaritonic systems and highlights the potential of higher-dimensional quantum platforms to simulate complex light-matter systems.</p>

            <p>We report on the experimental characterization of various types of spin-exchange interactions between two individual atoms, where pseudo-spin degrees of freedom are encoded in different Rydberg states. For the case of the direct dipole-dipole interaction between states of opposite parity, such as between $nS$ and $nP$, we investigate the effects of positional disorder arising from the residual atomic motion, on the coherence of spin-exchange oscillations. We then characterize an indirect dipolar spin exchange, i.e., the off-diagonal part of the van der Waals effective Hamiltonian that couples the states $nS$ and $(n+1)S$. Finally, we report on the observation of a new type of dipolar coupling, made resonant using addressable light-shifts and involving four different Rydberg levels: this exchange process is akin to electrically induced Förster resonance, but featuring local control. It exhibits an angular dependence distinct from the usual $1-3\cos^2(\theta)$ form of the resonant dipolar spin-exchange.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dominik Vuina, Robin Schäfer, David M. Long, Anushya Chandran</p>
            <p>Dynamical constraints in many-body quantum systems can lead to Hilbert space fragmentation, wherein the system's evolution is restricted to small subspaces of Hilbert space called Krylov sectors. However, unitary dynamics within individual sectors may also be slow or non-ergodic, which limits experiments' ability to measure the properties of the entire sector. We show that additional controlled dephasing reliably mixes the system within a single Krylov sector, and that simple observables can differentiate these sectors. For example, in the strongly interacting XXZ chain with dephasing, the spin imbalance between even and odd sublattices distinguishes sectors. For appropriate choices of initial states, the imbalance begins positive, decays to a negative minimum value at intermediate times, and eventually returns to zero. The minimum reflects the average imbalance of the Krylov sector associated to the initial state. We compute the size of the minimum analytically in the limit of strong interactions, and validate our results with simulations at experimentally relevant interaction strengths.</p>

            <p>Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) promise near-term quantum advantage, yet parametrized quantum states commonly built from the digital gate-based approach often suffer from scalability issues such as barren plateaus, where the loss landscape becomes flat. We study an analog VQA ansätze composed of $M$ quenches of a disordered Ising chain, whose dynamics is native to several quantum simulation platforms. By tuning the disorder strength we place each quench in either a thermalized phase or a many-body-localized (MBL) phase and analyse (i) the ansätze's expressivity and (ii) the scaling of loss variance. Numerics shows that both phases reach maximal expressivity at large $M$, but barren plateaus emerge at far smaller $M$ in the thermalized phase than in the MBL phase. Exploiting this gap, we propose an MBL initialisation strategy: initialise the ansätze in the MBL regime at intermediate quench $M$, enabling an initial trainability while retaining sufficient expressivity for subsequent optimization. The results link quantum phases of matter and VQA trainability, and provide practical guidelines for scaling analog-hardware VQAs.</p>

            <p>Despite growing interest, there is a scarcity of known predictions in the regime where both quantum and relativistic effects become observable. Here, we investigate a combined atom-field system in a curved spacetime, focusing specifically on gravitational-wave backgrounds. We show that a plane gravitational wave modifies spontaneous emission from a single atom, both in terms of sidebands in the spectrum and directionality of the emission. While the total decay rate remains unchanged, implying that no information about the gravitational wave is stored in the atomic internal state alone, the wave leaves imprints on the evolution of the composite atom-field system. To quantify how well this effect can be measured, we analyze both the classical Fisher information associated with photon number measurements and the quantum Fisher information. Our analysis indicates that the effect could be measured in state-of-the-art cold-atom experiments and points to spontaneous emission as a potential probe of low-frequency gravitational waves.</p>

We quantify the multipartite entanglement of the state by the quantum Fisher information and demonstrate that the DQPT belongs to a different universality class than the ground-state phase transition. Furthermore, we perform a spectral analysis of the DQPT and demonstrate that it is a genuine nonequilibrium transition arising from the constructive interference of excited states of the system during the many-body dynamics.

            <p>Quantum information theory, particularly its entropic formulations, has made remarkable strides in characterizing quantum systems and tasks. However, a critical dimension remains underexplored: computational efficiency. While classical computational entropies integrate complexity and feasibility into information measures, analogous concepts have yet to be rigorously developed in the quantum setting. In this work, we lay the basis for a new quantum computational information theory. Such a theory will allow studying efficient -- thus relevant in practice -- manipulation of quantum information. We introduce two innovative entropies: quantum computational min- and max-entropies (along with their smooth variants). Our quantum computational min-entropy is both the fully quantum counterpart of the classical unpredictability entropy, as well as the computational parallel to the quantum min-entropy. We establish a series of essential properties for this new entropy, including data processing and a chain rule. The quantum computational max-entropy is defined via a duality relation and gains operational meaning through an alternative formulation that we derive. Notably, it captures the efficiency of entanglement distillation with the environment, restricted to local quantum circuits of bounded size. With the introduction of our computational entropies and their study, this work marks a critical step toward a quantum information theory that incorporates computational elements.</p>

            <h2>Entangled Unruh-DeWitt detectors amplify quantum coherence</h2>

            <p>We explore the quantum coherence between a pair of entangled Unruh-DeWitt detectors, interacting with a quantum field, using a nonperturbative approach in a (3+1)-dimensional Minkowski spacetime with instantaneous switching ($\delta$-switching). It is intriguing to observe that for a maximally entangled state, increasing the coupling strength enhances the detectors' initial quantum coherence while simultaneously causing a monotonic decrease in their initial entanglement. This reveals a remarkable phenomenon: through nonperturbative interactions, entangled Unruh-DeWitt detectors can exhibit a dual effect-amplifying quantum coherence while degrading quantum entanglement. This finding stands in stark contrast to previous studies based on perturbative methods or Gaussian switching functions, which generally concluded that interactions between detectors and the field lead to a simultaneous degradation of quantum coherence and entanglement due to environmental decoherence. Notably, while initially separable detectors successfully harvest quantum coherence from the vacuum, entanglement extraction remains fundamentally prohibited. These contrasting behaviors underscore the fundamental distinction between coherence and entanglement as quantum resources, and highlight their complementary roles in field-detector interactions.</p>

            <p>Multipass cells are critical components in a variety of quantum technologies, including atomic magnetometers and optical quantum memories, due to their ability to achieve long optical paths within compact volumes. In optical magnetometry, increasing the optical depth through multipass geometries enhances sensitivity by reducing photon shot noise and enabling quantum nondemolition (QND) detection. In this work, we present a novel recirculating multipass alkali cell that improves the active-to-cell volume ratio and minimizes beam spot overlap, thereby addressing spin noise limitations inherent in conventional cylindrical Herriott cavity designs. We develop and validate an analytical model based on the ABCD matrix method to predict beam spot positions, sizes, and astigmatism effects, with results confirmed through Zemax simulations. In addition, we introduce a general analytical model for analyzing spin correlation noise in multipass alkali cells, incorporating both astigmatism and spatial intensity distribution-features not addressed in existing models. By deriving the spin noise time-correlation function and spectrum, we reveal how power intensity profiles contribute to spin diffusion noise. Our analysis demonstrates that the recirculating cell offers improved beam coverage, reduced spot overlap, and enhanced spin correlation-particularly when using concave mirrors with longer focal lengths. Furthermore, we show that avoiding tightly focused, high-intensity regions can significantly suppress spin diffusion noise. These findings establish the recirculating cell design as a practical and high-performance solution for advancing the precision of atomic sensors and other multipass cavity-based quantum devices.</p>

            <p>Preparation of high-fidelity logical magic states has remained as a necessary but daunting step towards building a large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computer. One approach is to fault-tolerantly prepare a magic state in one code and then switch to another, a method known as code switching. We experimentally demonstrate this protocol on an ion-trap quantum processor, yielding a logical magic state encoded in an error-correcting code with state-of-the-art logical fidelity. Our experiment is based on the first demonstration of code-switching between color codes, from the fifteen-qubit quantum Reed-Muller code to the seven-qubit Steane code. We prepare an encoded magic state in the Steane code with $82.58\%$ probability, with an infidelity of at most $5.1(2.7) \times 10^{-4}$. The reported infidelity is lower than the leading infidelity of the physical operations utilized in the protocol by a factor of at least $2.7$, indicating the quantum processor is below the pseudo-threshold. Furthermore, we create two copies of the magic state in the same quantum processor and perform a logical Bell basis measurement for a sample-efficient certification of the encoded magic state. The high-fidelity magic state can be combined with the already-demonstrated fault-tolerant Clifford gates, state preparation, and measurement of the 2D color code, completing a universal set of fault-tolerant computational primitives with logical error rates equal or better than the physical two-qubit error rate.</p>

            <p>In particle physics, axions and axion-like particles are ubiquitous. Remarkably, ultra-light axions could constitute dark matter or dark energy. Therefore, it is important to detect axions experimentally. In the presence of a magnetic field, a photon can be converted into an axion, and vice versa. Utilizing the conversion phenomenon, several methods for detecting axions have been proposed. To improve detectability, it is desirable to use quantum sensing. However, since the conversion process is usually treated as classical wave dynamics, it is unclear how to incorporate quantum effects such as entanglement. In this work, we formulate the photon-axion conversion in a quantum field theoretical manner. As a result, we succeed in evaluating the conversion probability from a photon quantum state to an axion quantum state. In particular, it turns out that squeezed coherent states with N photons added can significantly enhance the conversion probability.</p>

            <p>Quantum speed limits are usually regarded as fundamental restrictions, constraining the amount of computation that can be achieved within some given time and energy. Complementary to this intuition, here we show that these limitations are also of operational value: they enable the secure generation of certified randomness. We consider a prepare-and-measure scenario with some (experimentally determined or promised) upper bound on the energy uncertainty of the average prepared quantum state, but without any further assumptions on the devices, Hilbert space or Hamiltonian. Given that we can freely choose the time at which to apply the untrusted preparation procedure, we show that this scenario admits the generation of randomness that is secure against adversaries with additional classical information. We show how to determine the amount of certified randomness given the observed correlations, discuss how interactions with the environment are taken into account, and sketch a conceivable experimental implementation. Remarkably, even single-mode coherent states admit this kind of certification of non-zero randomness in some parameter regimes, reinforcing ongoing approaches to demonstrate versions of nonclassicality in the simple harmonic oscillator. Our results extend existing efforts to devise semi-device-independent protocols grounded in reasonable physical assumptions, and they contribute to the understanding of time-energy uncertainty relations via their operational consequences.</p>

            <p>Encoding quantum information to protect it from errors is essential for performing large-scale quantum computations. Performing a universal set of quantum gates on encoded states demands a potentially large resource overhead and minimizing this overhead is key for the practical development of large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computers. We propose and experimentally implement a magic-state preparation protocol to fault-tolerantly prepare a pair of logical magic states in a [[6,2,2]] quantum error-detecting code using only eight physical qubits. Implementing this protocol on H1-1, a 20 qubit trapped-ion quantum processor, we prepare magic states with experimental infidelity $7^{+3}_{-1}\times 10^{-5}$ with a $14.8^{+1}_{-1}\%$ discard rate and use these to perform a fault-tolerant non-Clifford gate, the controlled-Hadamard (CH), with logical infidelity $\leq 2.3^{+9}_{-9}\times 10^{-4}$. Notably, this significantly outperforms the unencoded physical CH infidelity of $10^{-3}$. Through circuit-level stabilizer simulations, we show that this protocol can be self-concatenated to produce extremely high-fidelity magic states with low space-time overhead in a [[36,4,4]] quantum error correcting code, with logical error rates of $6\times 10^{-10}$ ($5\times 10^{-14}$) at two-qubit error rate of $10^{-3}$ ($10^{-4}$) respectively.</p>

            <p>We use a quantum-logic spectroscopy (QLS) protocol to control the quantum state of a CaH+ ion in a cryogenic environment, in which reduced thermal radiation extends rotational state lifetimes by an order of magnitude over those at room temperature. By repeatedly and adaptively probing the molecule, detecting the outcome of each probe via an atomic ion, and using a Bayesian update scheme to quantify confidence in the molecular state, we demonstrate state preparation and measurement (SPAM) in a single quantum state with infidelity less than $6\times10^{-3}$ and measure Rabi flopping between two states with greater than 99% contrast. The protocol does not require any molecule-specific lasers and the detection scheme is non-destructive. To our knowledge, this result represents the highest SPAM fidelity of a single molecular quantum state demonstrated to date.</p>

            <h2>Quantum simulation of fermionic non-Abelian lattice gauge theories in $(2+1)$D with built-in gauge protection</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gaia De Paciani, Lukas Homeier, Jad C. Halimeh, Monika Aidelsburger, Fabian Grusdt</p>
            <p>Recent advancements in the field of quantum simulation have significantly expanded the potential for applications, particularly in the context of lattice gauge theories (LGTs). Maintaining gauge invariance throughout a simulation remains a central challenge, especially for large-scale non-Abelian LGTs with dynamical matter, which are particularly complex in terms of engineering for experiments. Gauge-symmetry breaking is inevitable in established rishon-based schemes for alkaline-earth-like atoms (AELAs) and controlling the magnitude of its effect is an open challenge. Here, we first construct a minimal model to quantum simulate non-Abelian LGTs ensuring that the gauge constraints are met and explicitly derive their unambiguous non-Abelian nature. Second, we present a proposal for a novel gauge protection scheme using native interactions in AELAs enabling the simulation of toy models of non-Abelian $U(2)$ LGTs with dynamical fermionic matter in $(2+1)$ dimensions on large scales. Due to the simplicity of the gauge protection mechanism, based on a Zeeman shift in combination with superexchange interactions, our scheme can be naturally included in other rishon-based quantum simulation protocols. Third, we extend our approach to a fully scalable, hybrid digital-analog simulator for $U(N)$ LGTs based on Rydberg AELA with variable rishon number. The proposed general mechanism for gauge protection provides a promising path towards the long-awaited simulation of non-Abelian LGTs relevant to particle physics.</p>

            <h2>Coherence measure of ensembles with nonlocality without entanglement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ayan Patra, Shiladitya Mal, Aditi Sen De</p>
            <p>Irreversibility between preparation and discrimination processes is manifested in the indistinguishability of orthogonal product states via local operations and classical communication (LOCC). Characterizing quantum properties for sets of states according to their local distinguishing property is one of the avenues to explain the surprising results obtained in the LOCC indistinguishability domain. We propose a measure based on the $l_1$ norm of coherence to quantitatively assess the quantumness of ensembles composed of orthogonal product states. Furthermore, to establish a hierarchy among different product ensembles, we establish a relationship between the coherence-based measure of an ensemble and the optimal success probability of distinguishing states within the ensemble using LOCC, constrained by a limited amount of classical communication and projective measurements, in the framework of minimum error state discrimination.</p>

            <p>Quantum illumination leverages entangled lights to detect the presence of low-reflectivity objects within a thermal environment. In a related vein, quantum parameter estimation utilizes nonclassical probes to precisely determine unknown system parameters. Although both fields have been studied extensively, their performances have traditionally been assessed using different figures of merit: signal-to-noise ratio for QI and quantum Fisher information for parameter estimation. In this paper, we reveal the intrinsic connection between these two measures in the context of target detection, thereby providing explicit operational criteria for identifying optimal measurements. We further apply this relationship to various target detection protocols that employ exotic non-Gaussian states derived from coherent states and two-mode squeezed vacuum states.</p>

            <p>This tutorial offers a quick, hands-on introduction to solving Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) models on currently available quantum computers and their simulators. We cover both IBM and D-Wave machines: IBM utilizes a gate-circuit architecture, and D-Wave is a quantum annealer. We provide examples of three canonical problems and two models from practical applications. The tutorial is structured to bridge the gap between theory and practice: we begin with an overview of QUBOs, explain their relevance and connection to quantum algorithms, introduce key quantum computing concepts, provide the foundations for two quantum heuristics, and provide detailed implementation guides. An associated GitHub repository provides the codes in five companion notebooks. In addition to reaching undergraduate and graduate students in computationally intensive disciplines, this article aims to reach working industry professionals seeking to explore the potential of near-term quantum applications. As our title indicates, this tutorial is intended to be a starting point in a journey towards solving more complex QUBOs on quantum computers.</p>

            <p>Quantum computers have leaped from the theoretical realm into a race to large-scale implementations. This is due to the promise of revolutionary speedups, where achieving such speedup requires designing an algorithm that harnesses the structure of a problem using quantum mechanics. Yet many quantum programming languages today require programmers to reason at a low level of physics notation and quantum gate circuitry. This presents a significant barrier to entry for programmers who have not yet built up an intuition about quantum gate semantics, and it can prove to be tedious even for those who have. In this paper, we present Qwerty, a new quantum programming language that allows programmers to manipulate qubits more expressively than gates and trace programs without bra-ket notation. Due to its novel basis type and easy interoperability with Python, Qwerty is a powerful framework for high-level quantum-classical computation.</p>

            <p>Rydberg atoms efficiently link photons between the radio-frequency (RF) and optical domains. They furnish a medium in which the presence of an RF field imprints on the transmission of a probe laser beam by altering the coherent coupling between atomic quantum states. The immutable atomic energy structure underpins quantum-metrological RF field measurements and has driven intensive efforts to realize inherently self-calibrated sensing devices. Here we investigate spectroscopic signatures owing to the angular momentum quantization of the atomic states utilized in an electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT) sensing scheme for linearly polarized RF fields. Specific combinations of atomic terms are shown to give rise to universal, distinctive fingerprints in the detected optical fields upon rotating the RF field polarization. Using a dressed state picture, we identify two types of atomic angular momentum ladders that display strikingly disparate spectroscopic signatures, including the complementary absence or presence of a central spectral EIT peak. Our study adds important insights into the prospects of Rydberg atomic gases for quantum metrological electric field characterization. In particular, it calls into question prevailing interpretations of SI-traceable Rydberg atom electrometers.</p>

The global operations can be realized by applying the microwave and the local operations can be realized by the locally addressing lasers, which yields the ac-Stark shift. Since our engineered Hamiltonian contains bond-dependent DM interactions, we expect the emergence of quantum skyrmions in the ground state.</p>

            <p>Recent advances in semiconductor spin qubits have achieved linear arrays exceeding ten qubits. Moving to two-dimensional (2D) qubit arrays is a critical next step to advance towards fault-tolerant implementations, but it poses substantial fabrication challenges, particularly because enabling control of nearest-neighbor entanglement requires the incorporation of interstitial exchange gates between quantum dots in the qubit architecture. In this work, we present a 2D array of silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) quantum dots with tunable interdot coupling between all adjacent dots. The device is characterized at 4.2 K, where we demonstrate the formation and isolation of double-dot and triple-dot configurations. We show control of all nearest-neighbor tunnel couplings spanning up to 30 decades per volt through the interstitial exchange gates and use advanced modeling tools to estimate the exchange interactions that could be realized among qubits in this architecture.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> An-Jun Liu, Bryan K. Clark</p>
            <p>The ground state of second-quantized quantum chemistry Hamiltonians is key to determining molecular properties. Neural quantum states (NQS) offer flexible and expressive wavefunction ansatze for this task but face two main challenges: highly peaked ground-state wavefunctions hinder efficient sampling, and local energy evaluations scale quartically with system size, incurring significant computational costs. In this work, we overcome these challenges by introducing a suite of algorithmic enhancements, which includes efficient periodic compact subspace construction, truncated local energy evaluations, improved stochastic sampling, and physics-informed modifications. Applying these techniques to the neural network backflow (NNBF) ansatz, we demonstrate significant gains in both accuracy and scalability. Our enhanced method surpasses traditional quantum chemistry methods like CCSD and CCSD(T), outperforms other NQS approaches, and achieves competitive energies with state-of-the-art ab initio techniques such as HCI, ASCI, FCIQMC, and DMRG. A series of ablation and comparative studies quantifies the contribution of each enhancement to the observed improvements in accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, we investigate the representational capacity of the ansatz, finding that its performance correlates with the inverse participation ratio (IPR), with more delocalized states being more challenging to approximate.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we investigate the effects of Lorentz violation on correlations harvesting, specifically focusing on the harvested entanglement and harvested mutual information between two Unruh-DeWitt detectors interacting with a quantum field in the Lorentz-violating BTZ-like black hole spacetime. Our findings reveal that Lorentz symmetry breaking has contrasting impacts on entanglement harvesting and mutual information harvesting in BTZ backgrounds: it enhances mutual information harvesting while suppressing entanglement harvesting. This phenomenon suggests that the increase in total correlations in Lorentz-violating vector field backgrounds with gravitational coupling is predominantly driven by classical components, with quantum correlations contributing less to the overall mutual information. These results indicate that Lorentz violation, as a quantum property of spacetime, may impose intrinsic constraints on the quantum information capacity encoded in spacetime due to competition among quantum degrees of freedom for resources. Furthermore, Lorentz symmetry breaking expands the \textit{entanglement shadow} region, further demonstrating its disruptive effect on quantum correlations.</p>

Such state preparation is essential for quantum algorithms that process large classical inputs, including matrix inversion and linear system solvers.

            <p>We propose a hybrid variational framework that enhances Neural Quantum States (NQS) with a Normalising Flow-based sampler to improve the expressivity and trainability of quantum many-body wavefunctions. Our approach decouples the sampling task from the variational ansatz by learning a continuous flow model that targets a discretised, amplitude-supported subspace of the Hilbert space. This overcomes limitations of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and autoregressive methods, especially in regimes with long-range correlations and volume-law entanglement. Applied to the transverse-field Ising model with both short- and long-range interactions, our method achieves comparable ground state energy errors with state-of-the-art matrix product states and lower energies than autoregressive NQS. For systems up to 50 spins, we demonstrate high accuracy and robust convergence across a wide range of coupling strengths, including regimes where competing methods fail. Our results showcase the utility of flow-assisted sampling as a scalable tool for quantum simulation and offer a new approach toward learning expressive quantum states in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces.</p>

            <p>Single-photon sources are used in numerous quantum technologies, from sensing and imaging to communication, making the accurate modeling of their emissions essential. In this work, we propose a statistical framework for describing single-photon emission processes and implement estimators for the exponential distribution to quantify this phenomenon. Our approach provides a reliable method for estimating the radiative decay time, represented by the inverse rate parameter, which is crucial in quantum optics applications. We explore several statistical estimators, including maximum likelihood estimation, minimum-variance unbiased estimator, and best linear unbiased estimator. To validate our theoretical methods, we test the proposed estimators on experimental data, demonstrating their applicability in real-world settings. We also evaluate the performance of these estimators when dealing with censored data, a frequent limitation in photon emission experiments. The analysis allows us to track the performance of the proposed estimators as the amount of available data decreases, providing insights into their reliability for modeling single-photon emission events under limited resources.</p>

By applying quantum optimal control methods, we demonstrate that such a protocol emerges naturally in a variety of settings, without requiring assumptions on the form of the control fields. Examples include Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state preparation in Ising spin chains and two-dimensional Rydberg atom arrays, as well as the generation of quantum spin liquid states in frustrated Rydberg lattices.

            <p>A photonic quantum memory capable of simultaneously storing multiple qubits and subsequently recalling any randomly selected subset of the qubits, is essential for large-scale quantum networking and computing. Such functionality, akin to classical Random-Access Memory (RAM), has proven difficult to implement due to the absence of a versatile random-access mechanism and limited multimode capacity in existing quantum memory protocols. A potential path to developing the quantum analog to RAM is offered by photon-echo protocols in rare-earth ion-doped materials, such as Revival Of Silenced Echo. These can utilize optical rephasing pulses to selectively read-out frequency multiplexed photonic qubits within an inhomogeneously broadened optical transition. However, the conventional non-adiabatic nature of the rephasing pulses requires intense, short-duration pulses, impeding their fidelity and multimode capacity. To address these critical limitations, we introduce an alternate protocol that employs Rapid Adiabatic Passage (RAP) rephasing pulses, to realize quantum memory, which invokes phase-imprints to suppress undesirable echoes. Using the optical transitions of a $^{171}{\rm Yb}^{3+}$:${\rm Y}_2{\rm SiO}_5$ crystal, we demonstrate the storage and retrieval of multiple intricate spectro-temporally photonic modes and achieve optical random access memory across eight distinct spectral modes. This protocol yields greatly enhanced mode-mapping versatility while substantially lowering the required rephasing pulse intensity, providing a more efficient and reliable approach for high-fidelity qubit storage and retrieval.</p>

            <p>To date, realization of a continuous-wave active atomic clock has been elusive primarily due to parasitic heating from spontaneous emission while repumping the atoms. Here, we propose a solution to this problem by replacing the random emission with coupling to an auxiliary cavity, making repumping a fully collective process. While it is known that collective two-level models do not possess a generic lasing threshold, we show this restriction is overcome with multi-level atoms since collective pumping and decay can be performed on distinct transitions. Using relevant atomic parameters, we find this system is capable of producing an $\mathcal{O}$(100 $\mu$Hz)-linewidth continuous-wave superradiant laser. Our principal result is the potential for an operating regime with cavity length vibration sensitivity below $\mathcal{O}(10^{-14} / g)$, including a locus of parameter values where it completely vanishes even at steady-state.</p>

Concurrently, the emergence of programmable quantum computers, coupled with the expectation that large-scale fault-tolerant machines will follow in the near to medium-term future, has led to much speculation about the prospect of quantum machine learning (QML), namely machine learning (ML) solutions which take advantage of quantum properties to outperform their classical counterparts.

In this chapter, we introduce the fundamentals of QML and provide a brief overview of the recent progress and future trends in the field of QML. We highlight key opportunities for achieving quantum advantage in ML tasks, as well as describe some open challenges currently facing the field of QML. Specifically in the context of cybersecurity, we introduce the potential for QML in defence and security-sensitive applications, where it has been predicted that the seamless integration of quantum computing into ML will herald the development of robust and reliable QML systems, resilient against sophisticated threats arising from data manipulation and poisoning.</p>

            <p>Non-Hermitian systems have shown promising potential for realizing quantum information tasks that lack counterparts in the Hermitian realm. Understanding the dynamical characteristics of non-Hermitian systems as reflected in information-theoretic quantities is essential for advancing their applications. Here we investigate dynamics of trace distance and concurrence, which quantify information flow and entanglement, respectively, in non-Hermitian qubit systems exhibiting either parity-time or anti-parity-time symmetry. We identify dynamical fingerprints from the system density matrix which provide a unified explanation to the common oscillation and relaxation dynamics shared by trace distance and concurrence observed in existing studies. We further investigate the fate of dynamical fingerprints under the impact of pure dephasing. Surprisingly, we find that pure dephasing can slow down the inherent relaxation of information flow and entanglement in non-Hermitian systems with unbroken anti-parity-time symmetry, suggesting a passive environment-assisted information protection in this class of non-Hermitian systems. Our findings enhance our understanding of dynamical non-Hermitian systems and have specific relevance to their information-oriented applications.</p>

            <p>The learning of the physical world relies on sensing and data post-processing. When the signals are weak, multi-dimensional and correlated, the performance of learning is often bottlenecked by the quality of sensors, calling for integrating quantum sensing into the learning of such physical-layer data. An example of such a learning scenario is the stochastic quadrature displacements of electromagnetic fields, modeling optomechanical force sensing, radiofrequency photonic sensing, microwave cavity weak signal sensing and other applications. We propose a unified protocol that combines machine learning with interferometric photon counting to reduce noise and reveal correlations. By applying variational quantum learning with multimode programmable quantum measurements, we enhance signal extraction. Our results show that multimode interferometric photon counting outperforms conventional homodyne detection proposed in prior works for tasks like principal component analysis (PCA) and cross-correlation analysis (CCA), even below vacuum noise levels. To further enhance the performance, We also integrate entanglement-enhanced modules, in the form of squeezed state distribution and anti-squeezing at detection, into the protocol. Combining the multimode interferometric photon counting and multipartite entanglement, the proposed protocol provides a powerful toolbox for learning weak signals.</p>

By adjusting the direction of the magnetic field, the frequency shift of a magnon mode can be tuned from positive to negative due to the Barnett effect. This effect leads to a significant difference in the system stability and is responsible for the nonreciprocal quantum coherence. We examine how the input power, magnomechanical and magnon-photon coupling rates, decay rates of both the cavity photon modes and the magnon modes influence the quantum coherence. Through careful tuning of system parameters, nearly perfect nonreciprocity can be achieved. Our results provide a controllable mechanism for direction-dependent quantum coherence, with potential applications in nonreciprocal quantum devices and information processing.</p>

            <p>Trying to export ab initio polaritonic chemistry onto emerging quantum computers raises fundamental questions. A central one is how to efficiently represent both fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom on the same platform, in order to develop computational strategies that can accurately capture strong electron-photon correlations at a reasonable cost for implementation on near-term hardware. Given the hybrid fermion-boson nature of polaritonic problem, one may legitimately ask: should we rely exclusively on conventional qubit-based platforms, or consider alternative computational paradigms? To explore this, we investigate in this work three strategies: qubit-based, qudit-based, and hybrid qubit-qumode approaches. For each platform, we design compact, physically motivated quantum circuit ansätze and integrate them within the state-averaged variational quantum eigensolver to compute multiple polaritonic eigenstates simultaneously. A key element of our approach is the development of compact electron-photon entangling circuits, tailored to the native capabilities and limitations of each hardware architecture. We benchmark all three strategies on a cavity-embedded H$_{2}$ molecule, reproducing characteristic phenomena such as light-induced avoided crossings. Our results show that each platform achieves comparable accuracy in predicting polaritonic eigen-energies and eigenstates. However, with respect to quantum resources required the hybrid qubit-qumode approach offers the most favorable tradeoff between resource efficiency and accuracy, followed closely by the qudit-based method. Both of which outperform the conventional qubit-based strategy. Our work presents a hardware-conscious comparison of quantum encoding strategies for polaritonic systems and highlights the potential of higher-dimensional quantum platforms to simulate complex light-matter systems.</p>

            <p>Using the Kramers-Wannier transfer matrix method we studied several decorated Ising chains. The exact expressions for thermodynamic characteristics, including the ground state characteristics, were obtained. We considered a number of modeling chains with different signs and absolute values of exchange constants for the nearest- and the next-nearest neighbors. For these models we calculated the magnetization curves. The critical values of magnetic fields and corresponding magnetization plateau parameters were obtained. Analytic expressions for the ground state entropy were obtained for the chains with different interaction constants. The dependencies of the number of states with minimum energy (the degeneration of the ground state) as the function of the number of particles were found. It was shown that these dependencies are expressed in terms of well-known numerical sequences - Lucas numbers and Pell numbers, which, in the limit of a large number of particles, are proportional to the powers of the golden and silver sections. Therefore, the ground state entropy (per particle) of the systems under consideration can be described in terms of these sections and, therefore, is nonzero.</p>

            <h2>Inequality for von Neumann entropy change under measurement and dissipation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kohei Kobayashi</p>
            <p>We derive a universal inequality that provides a lower bound on the ensemble-averaged von Neumann entropy change in a quantum system subject to continuous measurement and dissipation. Our result clarifies how entropy production is fundamentally constrained by three distinct contributions: (i) the non-Hermitian structure of the dissipation operator, (ii) the standard variance associated with measurement-induced fluctuations, and (iii) a generalized quantum variance reflecting the noncommutativity between the measurement observable and the quantum state. This third term vanishes when the state and observable commute, and thus represents a purely quantum contribution arising from coherence disturbance and measurement backaction. The derived inequality generalizes classical information-thermodynamic relations, such as the Sagawa--Ueda inequality, to the quantum regime, providing a new perspective on the trade-offs between information acquisition, control, and entropy production in continuously monitored open quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>Multimode Bosonic State Tomography with Single-Shot Joint Parity Measurement of a Trapped Ion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Honggi Jeon, Jiyong Kang, Wonhyeong Choi, Kyunghye Kim, Jaehun You, Taehyun Kim</p>
            <p>The full characterization of a continuous-variable quantum system is a challenging problem. For the trapped-ion system, a number of methods of reconstructing the quantum states have been developed, including the measurement of the Q quasi-probability function and the density matrix elements in the Fock basis, but these approaches are often slow and difficult to scale to multi-mode states. Here, we demonstrate a novel and powerful scheme for reconstructing a continuous-variable quantum state that uses the direct single-shot measurement of the joint parity of the phonon states of a trapped ion. We drive a spin-dependent bichromatic beam-splitter interaction that coherently exchanges phonons between different harmonic oscillator modes of the ion. This interaction encodes the joint parity information into the relative phase between the two spin states, enabling measurement of the combined phonon-number parity across multiple modes in a single shot. Leveraging this capability, we directly measure multi-mode Wigner quasi-probability distributions to perform quantum state tomography of an entangled coherent state, and show that the generated state is non-positive under partial transpose, confirming its entanglement. We further show that the single-shot joint parity measurement can be used to detect parity-flip errors in real time. By post-selecting the parity measurement outcomes, we experimentally demonstrate the extension of the bosonic state lifetime, effectively implementing an error mitigation technique. Lastly, we identify the various sources of error affecting the fidelity of the spin-dependent beam-splitter operation and study the feasibility of high fidelity operations. The interaction studied in this work can be easily extended to more than two modes, and is highly relevant to continuous-variable quantum computing and quantum metrology.</p>

            <h2>Beyond Dicke superradiance: Universal scaling of the peak emission rate</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raphael Holzinger, Susanne F. Yelin</p>
            <p>In quantum optics, superradiance is a phenomenon in which a system of $N$ fully excited quantum emitters radiate intense flashes of light during collective decay. However, computing its peak intensity for many spatially separated emitters remained challenging due to the exponential growth of the underlying Hilbert space with system size $N$. Derived from exact numerics, we present an analytically compact and easily computable formula for the peak photon emission rate of fully excited quantum emitter systems undergoing superradiant decay. The result applies to emitter configurations in any geometry and reveals a universal behavior: spatially extended quantum systems have a geometry-dependent optimal emitter number and always reach a peak photon emission rate that increases only linearly with $N$. Our results encompass quantum systems ranging from cold atomic gases and neutral-atom arrays to molecular aggregates and solid-state materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guang-Yu Zhang, Zhi-Hao Liu, Jie-Qiao Liao, Xun-Wei Xu</p>
            <p>Multiphoton blockade provides an efficient way to achieve entangled photon sources and leads to wide applications in modern quantum technologies. Here, we propose a scheme to realize multiphoton blockade by a multi-tone drive. Specifically, we demonstrate two-photon and three-photon blockades in a single-mode optical Kerr resonator using a two-tone and a three-tone drive, respectively. In comparison with the single-tone drive, except for the blockade of the $(n+1)$th photon excitation due to large detuning, the key mechanism in this scheme is the sequently resonant excitations of all the $m$-photon states ($m\leq n$) by the $n$-tone drive, which lead to the enhancement of photon generation and the demonstration of multiphoton blockade in the weak driving regime. Moreover, the photon distribution within the system can be adjusted on demand by tuning the relative amplitudes of the driving fields for different frequencies. The scheme can be extended to other bosonic systems and be applied to demonstrate other multiphoton physical effects.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fadwa Benabdallah, M. Y. Abd-Rabbou, Mohammed Daoud</p>
            <p>This research investigates the dynamics of entanglement and uncertainty-induced nonlocality in a spin-1/2 Ising-Heisenberg diamond chain subjected to local non-Markovian decoherence channels. By examining amplitude damping and random telegraph noise in both zero and finite temperature regimes, the study reveals nuanced distinctions in the degradation and revival of quantum correlations. The interplay between intrinsic spin couplings, thermal effects, and memory-induced coherence backflow highlights the complex behavior of quantum resources under realistic noise conditions. Concurrence emerges as a sensitive marker of entanglement recovery in dephasing environments, while uncertainty-induced nonlocality proves more resilient in high-temperature or dissipative regimes. The analysis further demonstrates that moderate thermal activation and external magnetic fields can nontrivially enhance or suppress quantum features depending on system parameters. These findings offer a detailed perspective on the robustness and complementarity of different quantum correlation measures, providing guiding principles for the design of thermally stable and noise-resilient quantum information protocols.</p>

As a consequence, we revealed that Quantum Time Crystal Computing lower the accuracy of Quantum Reservoir Computing and improved the accuracy of Quantum Neural Network and Variational Quantum Kolmogorov-Arnold Network.

            <h2>Distinguishing Quantum and Classical Gravity via Non-Stationary Test Mass Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenjie Zhong, Yubao Liu, Yiqiu Ma</p>
            <p>Classical gravity theory predicts a state-dependent gravitational potential for a quantum test mass, leading to nonlinear Schrodinger-Newton (SN) state evolution that contrasts with quantum gravity. Testing the effect of SN evolution can provide evidence for distinguishing quantum gravity and classical gravity, which is challenging to realize in the stationary optomechanical systems as analyzed in previous works [Phys. Rev. D 107, 024004 (2023), Phys. Rev. D 111, 062004 (2025)]. This work is devoted to analyzing the possibility of capturing the signature of SN theory during the non-stationary evolution of the test mass under the optomechanical measurement, where the second-order moments of a test mass can exhibit a distinctive oscillatory behavior. We show that this feature manifest in the non-stationary noise spectrum of outgoing light as additional peaks structures, although resolving these structures in practical experiments requires a larger number of repetitive trials with our sampling parameters, which is cost-prohibitive. To address this issue, we further employ statistical inference methods to extract more comprehensive information, thereby reducing the required number of experimental repetitions. Through Mock-Data simulations, we demonstrate that only 10 experimental trials of 40 seconds each are sufficient to reduce the false alarm rate for distinguishing between the two models to below one percent.</p>

            <p>Quantum two-way time transfer (Q-TWTT) leveraging energy-time entangled biphotons has achieved sub-picosecond stability but faces fundamental distance limitations due to the no-cloning theorem's restriction on quantum amplification. To overcome this challenge, we propose a cascaded Q-TWTT architecture employing relay stations that generate and distribute new energy-time entangled biphotons after each transmission segment. Theoretical modeling reveals sublinear standard deviation growth (merely N increase for N equidistant segments), enabling preservation of sub-picosecond stability over extended distances. We experimentally validate this approach using a three-station cascaded configuration over 200 km fiber segments, demonstrating strong agreement with theory. Utilizing independent Rb clocks at end and relay stations with online frequency skew correction, we achieve time stabilities of 3.82 ps at 10 s and 0.39 ps at 5120 s. The consistency in long-term stability between cascaded and single-segment configurations confirms high-precision preservation across modular quantum networks. This work establishes a framework for long-distance quantum time transfer that surpasses the no-cloning barrier, providing a foundation for future quantum-network timing infrastructure.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Fidelity Estimation in the Resource Theory of Nonstabilizerness</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiping Liu, Kun Wang, Xin Wang</p>
            <p>Quantum fidelity estimation is essential for benchmarking quantum states and processes on noisy quantum devices. While stabilizer operations form the foundation of fault-tolerant quantum computing, non-stabilizer resources further enable universal quantum computation through state injection. In this work, we propose several efficient fidelity estimation protocols for both quantum states and channels within the resource theory of nonstabilizerness, focusing on qudit systems with odd prime dimensions. Our protocols require measuring only a constant number of phase-space point operator expectation values, with operators selected randomly according to an importance weighting scheme tailored to the target state. Notably, we demonstrate that mathematically defined nonstabilizerness measures--such as Wigner rank and mana--quantify the sample complexity of the proposed protocols, thereby endowing them with a clear operational interpretation in the fidelity estimation task. This connection reveals a fundamental trade-off: while fidelity estimation for general quantum states and channels requires resources that scale exponentially with their nonstabilizerness, the task remains tractable for states and channels that admit efficient classical simulation.</p>

            <p>We propose a communication game in the sequential measurement scenario, involving a sender and two receivers with restricted collaboration among the latter parties. In the framework of the prepare-transform-measure scenario, we find a prominent quantum advantage in the receiver's decoding of the message originally encoded by the sender. We show that an optimal trade-off between the success probabilities of the two receivers enables self-testing of the sender's state preparation, the first receiver's instruments, and the measurement device of the second receiver. Our protocol enables a more robust certification of the unsharp measurement parameter of the first receiver compared to the protocol without collaboration among the receivers. We further generalize our game to higher-dimensional systems, revealing greater quantum advantage with an increase in dimensions.</p>

            <p>Higher-dimensional quantum systems (qudits) offer advantages in information encoding, error resilience, and compact gate implementations, and naturally arise in platforms such as superconducting and solid-state systems. However, realistic conditions such as non-Markovian noise, non-ideal pulses, and beyond rotating wave approximation (RWA) dynamics, pose significant challenges for controlling and characterizing qudits. In this work, we present a machine-learning-based graybox framework for the control and noise characterization of qudits with arbitrary dimension, extending recent methods developed for single-qubit systems. Additionally, we introduce a local analytic expansion that enables interpretable modelling of the noise dynamics, providing a structured and efficient way to simulate system behaviour and compare different noise models. This interpretability feature allows us to to understand the mechanisms underlying successful control strategies; and opens the way for developing methods for distinguishing noise sources with similar effects. We demonstrate high-fidelity implementations of both global unitary operations as well as two-level subspace gates. Our work establishes a foundation for scalable and interpretable quantum control techniques applicable to both NISQ devices and finite-dimensional quantum systems, enhancing the performance of next-generation quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>We propose a Michelson-type interferometric protocol for testing the quantum nature of gravity through testing the phenomenology of semi-classical gravity theory, which predicts a state-dependent Schrodinger-Newton (SN) evolution of the test mass. The protocol's feature lies in utilizing the asymmetry of two interferometric arms induced by SN self-gravity to create cross-talk between the common and differential motion of the test masses. This cross-talk is imprinted as a clean binary signature in the correlation measurements of the interferometer's output light fields. Our results demonstrate that, when assisted by 10 dB squeezed input states, 3 hours of aggregated measurement data can provide sufficient signal-to-noise ratio to conclusively test the SN theory in 1 Kelvin environment. This shows the strong feasibility of using such interferometric protocols to test if gravity operates quantum-mechanically.</p>

            <p>Quantum neural networks have emerged as promising quantum machine learning models, leveraging the properties of quantum systems and classical optimization to solve complex problems in physics and beyond. However, previous studies have demonstrated inevitable trainability issues that severely limit their capabilities in the large-scale regime. In this work, we propose a quantum recurrent embedding neural network (QRENN) inspired by fast-track information pathways in ResNet and general quantum circuit architectures in quantum information theory. By employing dynamical Lie algebras, we provide a rigorous proof of the trainability of QRENN circuits, demonstrating that this deep quantum neural network can avoid barren plateaus. Notably, the general QRENN architecture resists classical simulation as it encompasses powerful quantum circuits such as QSP, QSVT, and DQC1, which are widely believed to be classically intractable. Building on this theoretical foundation, we apply our QRENN to accurately classify quantum Hamiltonians and detect symmetry-protected topological phases, demonstrating its applicability in quantum supervised learning. Our results highlight the power of recurrent data embedding in quantum neural networks and the potential for scalable quantum supervised learning in predicting physical properties and solving complex problems.</p>

            <p>Quantum-classical hybrid algorithms offer a promising strategy for tackling computationally challenging problems, such as the maximum independent set (MIS) problem that plays a crucial role in areas like network design and data analysis. This study experimentally demonstrates that a Rydberg quantum-classical hybrid algorithm, termed as quantum-enhanced simulated annealing (QESA), provides a computational time advantage over standalone simulated annealing (SA), a classical heuristic optimization method. The performance of QESA is evaluated based on the approximation ratio and the Hamming distance, relative to the graph size. The analysis shows that QESA outperforms standalone SA by leveraging a warm-start input derived from two types of Rydberg atomic array experimental data: quench evolution (QE) (implemented on the Quera Aquila machine) and adiabatic quantum computing (AQC) (using the experimental dataset archieved in K. Kim et al., Scientific Data 11, 111 (2024). Based on these results, an estimate is provided for the maximum graph size that can be handled within a one-day computational time limit on a standard personal computer.

            <p>Quantum chemistry is a promising application of future quantum computers, but the requirements on qubit count and other resources suggest that modular computing architectures will be required. We introduce an implementation of a quantum chemistry algorithm that is distributed across several computational modules: the distributed unitary selective coupled cluster (dUSCC). We design a packing scheme using the pseudo-commutativity of Trotterization to maximize the parallelism while optimizing the scheduling of all inter-module gates around the buffering of inter-module Bell pairs. We demonstrate dUSCC on a 3-cluster (H$_4$)$_3$ chain and show that it naturally utilizes the molecule's structure to reduce inter-module latency. We show that the run time of dUSCC is unchanged with inter-module latency up to $\sim$20$\times$ slower than intra-module gates in the (H$_4$)$_3$ while maintaining chemical accuracy. dUSCC should be "free" in the weakly entangled systems, and the existence of "free" dUSCC can be found efficiently using classical algorithms. This new compilation scheme both leverages pseudo-commutativity and considers inter-module gate scheduling, and potentially provides an efficient distributed compilation of other Trotterized algorithms.</p>

The other one implies the existence of initial conditions evolving towards symmetry-breaking equilibrium states. If it spreads across an entire spectral region, then this region gives rise to a symmetry-breaking phase.

            <p>Quantum computation offers significant potential for accelerating the simulation of molecules and materials through algorithms such as quantum phase estimation (QPE). However, the expected speedup in ground-state energy estimation depends critically on the ability to efficiently prepare an initial state with high overlap with the true ground state. For strongly correlated molecules such as iron-sulfur clusters, this overlap is demonstrated to decay exponentially with system size. To alleviate this problem, we introduce an efficient classical algorithm to find entanglement-minimized orbitals (EMOs) using spin-adapted matrix product states (MPS) with small bond dimensions. The EMO basis yields a more compact ground-state representation, significantly easing initial state preparation for challenging systems. Our algorithm improves initial state overlap by nearly an order of magnitude over prior orbital optimization approaches for an iron-sulfur cluster with four irons, and is scalable to larger systems with many unpaired electrons, including the P-cluster and FeMo-cofactor in nitrogenase with eight transition metal centers. For these systems, we achieve substantial enhancements on initial state overlap by factors of $O(10^2)$ and $O(10^5)$, respectively, compared to results obtained using localized orbitals. Our results show that initial state preparation for these challenging systems requires far fewer resources than prior estimates suggested.</p>

We show that these channels are degradable for all $x$, leading to a closed-form, single-letter capacity formula that does not require regularization. Besides full decoherence, we extend our analysis to block-decohering channels, where decoherence occurs within orthogonal or overlapping subspaces. This family interpolates between identity channels and classical-quantum channels.

            <p>We theoretically demonstrate via numerical modeling that fully degenerate triple-photon states generated by three-mode spontaneous parametric down-conversion can be categorized into four distinct states: 0-phase, $\pi$/2-phase, $\pi$-phase, and 3$\pi$/2-phase squeezed states. Using quantum relative entropy and Wigner negativity as quantitative measures, we show that the nonGaussianity and nonclassicality of these squeezed states increase with the increase of interaction strength. Analogous to Gaussian scenarios, these squeezed states serve as basic building blocks for deterministic preparation of two-mode non-Gaussian states. We study the correlation properties of two-mode state generated by interfering 0-phase and $\pi$-phase squeezed states on a beam splitter, and reveal its entanglement at 3rd and 6th-order moments using the positive partial transposition criterion based on higher-order covariance matrices. In particular, by adjusting the intensities of the two input beams, the entanglement of the two output modes at the 3rd- and 6th-order moments can be dynamically modulated. Our results highlight the nonclassical nature of fully degenerate triple-photon states and establish a pathway for preparing non-Gaussian entanglement based on such states.</p>

            <p>Quantum computing (QC) holds the potential to solve classically intractable problems. Although there has been significant progress towards the availability of quantum hardware, a software infrastructure to integrate them is still missing. We present Q-AIM (Quantum Access Infrastructure Management) to fill this gap. Q-AIM is a software framework unifying the access and management for quantum hardware in a vendor-independent and open-source fashion. Utilizing a dockerized micro-service architecture, we show Q-AIM's lightweight, portable, and customizable nature, capable of running on different hosting paradigms ranging from small personal computing devices to cloud servers and dedicated server infrastructure. Q-AIM exposes a single entry point into the host's infrastructure, providing secure and easy interaction with quantum computers on different levels of abstraction. With a minimal memory footprint, the container is optimized for deployment on even the smallest server instances, reducing costs and instantiation overhead while ensuring seamless scalability to accommodate increasing demands. Q-AIM intends to equip research groups and facilities purchasing and hosting their own quantum hardware with a tool simplifying the process from procurement to operation and removing non-research related technical redundancies.</p>

            <p>Holonomies are of great interest to quantum computation and simulation. The geometrical nature of these entities offers increased stability to quantum gates. Furthermore, symmetries of particle physics are naturally reflected in holonomies, making them ideally suited for quantum simulation of quantum chromodynamics and grand unified theories. Yet, practically designing quantum holonomies with the required properties and scale is challenging. Here, we construct a new class of holonomies by increasing the particle number. We show that multi-particle holonomies can even exist in systems devoid of any single-particle holonomies. We present a comprehensive framework for multi-particle quantum holonomies and experimentally realize various two-particle holonomies in integrated photonics. Our results enable particle number to be harnessed as a design parameter, offering increased freedom in constructing holonomies for quantum computation and simulation.</p>

            <h2>A Two-stage Optimization Method for Wide-range Single-electron Quantum Magnetic Sensing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shiqian Guo, Jianqing Liu, Thinh Le, Huaiyu Dai</p>
            <p>Quantum magnetic sensing based on spin systems has emerged as a new paradigm for detecting ultra-weak magnetic fields with unprecedented sensitivity, revitalizing applications in navigation, geo-localization, biology, and beyond. At the heart of quantum magnetic sensing, from the protocol perspective, lies the design of optimal sensing parameters to manifest and then estimate the underlying signals of interest (SoI). Existing studies on this front mainly rely on adaptive algorithms based on black-box AI models or formula-driven principled searches. However, when the SoI spans a wide range and the quantum sensor has physical constraints, these methods may fail to converge efficiently or optimally, resulting in prolonged interrogation times and reduced sensing accuracy. In this work, we report the design of a new protocol using a two-stage optimization method. In the 1st Stage, a Bayesian neural network with a fixed set of sensing parameters is used to narrow the range of SoI. In the 2nd Stage, a federated reinforcement learning agent is designed to fine-tune the sensing parameters within a reduced search space. The proposed protocol is developed and evaluated in a challenging context of single-shot readout of an NV-center electron spin under a constrained total sensing time budget; and yet it achieves significant improvements in both accuracy and resource efficiency for wide-range D.C. magnetic field estimation compared to the state of the art.</p>

            <h2>Quantum algorithm for solving generalized eigenvalue problems with application to the Schrödinger equation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Grzegorz Rajchel-Mieldzioć, Szymon Pliś, Emil Zak</p>
            <p>Accurate computation of multiple eigenvalues of quantum Hamiltonians is essential in quantum chemistry, materials science, and molecular spectroscopy. Estimating excited-state energies is challenging for classical algorithms due to exponential scaling with system size, posing an even harder problem than ground-state calculations. We present a quantum algorithm for estimating eigenvalues and singular values of parameterized matrix families, including solving generalized eigenvalue problems that frequently arise in quantum simulations. Our method uses quantum amplitude amplification and phase estimation to identify matrix eigenvalues by locating minima in the singular value spectrum. We demonstrate our algorithm by proposing a quantum-computing formulation of the pseudospectral collocation method for the Schrödinger equation. We estimate fault-tolerant quantum resource requirements for the quantum collocation method, showing favorable scaling in the size of the problem $N$ (up to $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{N})$) compared to classical implementations with $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$, for certain well-behaved potentials. Additionally, unlike the standard collocation method, which results in a generalized eigenvalue problem requiring matrix inversion, our algorithm circumvents the associated numerical instability by scanning a parameterized matrix family and detecting eigenvalues through singular value minimization. This approach is particularly effective when multiple eigenvalues are needed or when the generalized eigenvalue problem involves a high condition number. In the fault-tolerant era, our method may thus be useful for simulating high-dimensional molecular systems with dense spectra involving highly excited states, such as those encountered in molecular photodynamics or quasi-continuum regimes in many-body and solid-state systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marco Maronese, Francesco Ferrari, Matteo Vandelli, Daniele Dragoni</p>
            <p>Quantum neural networks (QNNs), as currently formulated, are near-term quantum machine learning architectures that leverage parameterized quantum circuits with the aim of improving upon the performance of their classical counterparts. In this work, we show that some desired properties attributed to these models can be efficiently reproduced without necessarily resorting to quantum hardware. We indeed study the expressibility of parametrized quantum circuit commonly used in QNN applications and contrast it to those of two classes of states that can be efficiently simulated classically: matrix-product states (MPS), and Clifford-enhanced MPS (CMPS), obtained by applying a set of Clifford gates to MPS. In addition to expressibility, we assess the level of primary quantum resources, entanglement and non-stabilizerness (a.k.a. "magic"), in random ensembles of such quantum states, tracking their convergence to the Haar distribution. While MPS require a large number of parameters to reproduce an arbitrary quantum state, we find that CMPS approach the Haar distribution more rapidly, in terms of both entanglement and magic. Our results indicate that high expressibility in QNNs is attainable with purely classical resources.</p>

            <h2>Blocklet concatenation: Low-overhead fault-tolerant protocols for fusion-based quantum computation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Litinski</p>
            <p>We introduce a construction for protocols for fault-tolerant quantum computing based on code concatenation and transversal gates. These protocols can be interpreted as families of quantum circuits of low-weight stabilizer measurements without strict locality constraints, effectively implementing concatenated codes. However, we primarily study these protocols in the context of photonic fusion-based quantum computing (FBQC), where they yield families of fusion networks with constant-sized resource states. Their high erasure thresholds relative to their resource-state cost establish them as promising candidates to replace surface codes in the context of FBQC. Examples include protocol families using 8-, 10- and 12-qubit resource states, with erasure thresholds of 13.8%, 19.1% and 11.5%, and footprint-per-logical-qubit scaling as $\mathcal{O}(d)$, $\mathcal{O}(d^{1.46})$ and $\mathcal{O}(d^{0.58})$, respectively, where $d$ is the code distance. We also present techniques for performing logical operations, decoding, and implementing the protocols in photonic hardware. Although we focus on photonic FBQC, these ideas may also be of interest in other settings.</p>

            <p>Neutral atoms in optical tweezer arrays possess broad applicability for quantum information science, in computing, simulation, and metrology. Among atomic species, Ytterbium-171 is unique as it hosts multiple qubits, each of which is impactful for these distinct applications. Consequently, this atom is an ideal candidate to bridge multiple disciplines, which, more broadly, has been an increasingly effective strategy within the field of quantum science. Realizing the full potential of this synergy requires high-fidelity generation and transfer of many-particle entanglement between these distinct qubit degrees of freedom, and thus between these distinct applications. Here we demonstrate the creation and coherent mapping of entangled quantum states across multiple qubits in Ytterbium-171 tweezer arrays. We map entangled states onto the optical clock qubit from the nuclear spin qubit or the Rydberg qubit. We coherently transfer up to 20 atoms of a $Z_2$-ordered Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state from the interacting Rydberg manifold to the metastable nuclear spin manifold. The many-body state is generated via a novel disorder-robust pulse in a two-dimensional ladder geometry. We further find that clock-qubit-based spin detection applied to Rydberg and nuclear spin qubits facilitates atom-loss-detectable qubit measurements and $>90\%$ Rydberg decay detection. This enables mid-circuit and delayed erasure detection, yielding an error-detected two-qubit gate fidelity of $99.78(4)\%$ in the metastable qubits as well as enhanced GHZ state fidelities in analog preparation. These results establish a versatile architecture that advances multiple fields of quantum information science while also establishing bridges between them.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sheron Blair, Francesco Arzani, Giulia Ferrini, Alessandro Ferraro</p>
            <p>Continuous-variable (CV) systems have shown remarkable potential for quantum computation, particularly excelling in scalability and error correction through bosonic encoding. Within this framework, the foundational notion of computational universality was introduced in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 82, 1784 (1999)], and has proven especially successful since it allows for the identification of finite sets of universal CV gates independent of the encoding scheme. However, achieving the critical objective of fault-tolerant computation requires some form of encoding, and to date there has been no proof that these universal CV gates can lead to encoded fault tolerance. We present compelling evidence in this direction by utilizing the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) encoding. Specifically, we numerically optimize the generation of GKP states from vacua using circuits comprised solely of universal CV gates. We demonstrate that these states can be attained with sufficient quality to exhibit error probabilities lower than the threshold needed to achieve a fault-tolerant memory via concatenated GKP-stabilizer codes.</p>

            <h2>Purely quantum memory in closed systems observed via imperfect measurements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jorge Tabanera-Bravo, Aljaž Godec</p>
            <p>The detection and quantification of non-Markovianity, a.k.a. memory, in quantum systems is a central problem in the theory of open quantum systems. There memory is as a result of the interaction between the system and its environment. Little is known, however, about memory effects induced by imperfect measurements on closed systems, where an entanglement with the environment is not possible. We investigate the emergence and characteristics of memory in closed systems observed via imperfect stroboscopic quantum measurements yielding coarse-grained outcomes. We consider ideal and two kinds of imperfect measurements: von Neumann measurements--the analogue of classical lumping--which destroy any coherence in the system, and genuinely quantum-lumping Lüders measurements preserving certain quantum correlations. Whereas the conditions for Markov dynamics under von Neumann lumping are the same as for classical dynamics, quantum-lumping requires stronger conditions, i.e. the absence of any detectable coherence. We introduce the concept of purely quantum memory having no classical counterpart. We illustrate our results with a quantum walk on a lattice and discuss their implications for dissipative dynamics and decoherence effects induced by more realistic measurements.</p>

            <p>Implementing large-scale quantum algorithms with practical advantage will require fault-tolerance achieved through quantum error correction, but the associated overhead is a significant cost. The overhead can be reduced by engineering physical qubits with fewer errors, and by shaping the residual errors to be more easily correctable. In this work, we demonstrate quantum error correcting codes and logical qubit circuits in a metastable ${}^{171}$Yb qubit with a noise bias towards erasure errors, that is, errors whose location can be detected separate from any syndrome information. We show that dephasing errors on the nuclear spin qubit during coherent transport can be strongly suppressed, and implement robust entangling gates that maintain a high fidelity in the presence of gate beam inhomogeneity or pointing error. We demonstrate logical qubit encoding in the $[[4,2,2]]$ code, with error correction during decoding based on mid-circuit erasure measurements despite the fact that the code is too small to correct any Pauli errors. Finally, we demonstrate logical qubit teleportation between multiple code blocks with conditionally selected ancillas based on mid-circuit erasure checks, which is a key ingredient for leakage-robust error correction with neutral atoms.</p>

            <h2>Numerical Derivatives, Projection Coefficients, and Truncation Errors in Analytic Hilbert Space With Gaussian Measure</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. W. AlMasri</p>
            <p>We introduce the projection coefficients algorithm, a novel method for determining the leading terms of the Taylor series expansion of a given holomorphic function from a graph perspective, while also analyzing the associated truncation errors. Let $ f(z) $ be a holomorphic function, and let $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle$ denote the inner product defined over an analytic Hilbert space equipped with a Gaussian measure. The derivatives $ f^{(n)}(z) $ at a point $ z_0 $ can be computed theoretically by evaluating an inner product of the form $ f^{(n)}(z_0) = \frac{\langle z^n, f(z) \rangle}{C}, $ where $ C $ is a normalization constant. Specifically, in the Bargmann space (the analytic Hilbert space with a Gaussian weight and orthogonal monomials), this constant is $ \pi $. This result assumes that $ f(z) $ is a holomorphic function of a single complex variable. The accuracy of the computed derivative values depends on the precision and reliability of the numerical routines used to evaluate these inner products. The projection coefficients offer valuable insights into certain properties of analytic functions, such as whether they are odd or even, and whether the $ n $-th derivatives exist at a given point $ z_0 $. Due to its relevance to quantum theory, our approach establishes a correspondence between quantum circuits derived from quantum systems and the theory of analytic functions. This study lays the groundwork for further applications in numerical analysis and approximation theory within Hilbert spaces equipped with Gaussian measures. Additionally, it holds potential for advancing fields such as quantum computing, reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) methods -- which are widely used in support vector machines (SVM) and other areas of machine learning -- and probabilistic numerics.</p>

This is achieved treating the long range interactions as switched on by the quench and performing the derivation within the basis of asymptotic states of the short range interacting pre-quench theory. In this way we analytically determine the post-quench state and the one-point functions of local observables such as the order parameter. One implication is that, as in the short range case, some oscillations induced by the quench remain undamped at large times under conditions specified by the theory. This explains, in particular, why such undamped oscillations have been numerically observed also in presence of long range interactions.</p>

            <p>We study the dynamics of quantum matter interacting with time-energy entangled photons. We consider the stimulation of a collective mode of a two-dimensional material by means of one of the two partners of a time-energy entangled pair of photons. Using an exactly solvable model, we analyze the out-of-equilibrium properties of both light and matter degrees of freedom, and show how entanglement in the incident photons deeply modifies relevant time scales of the light-matter interaction process. We find that entanglement strongly suppresses the delay between the transmission and absorption events, which become synchronous in the limit of strongly entangled wave packets. By comparing numerical simulations with analytic modeling, we trace back this behavior to the representation of entangled wave packets in terms of a superposition of multiple train pulses containing an increasing number of ultrashort non-entangled packets. As a result, we show that the entangled driving allows the creation of a matter excitation on a time scale shorter than the temporal width of the pulse. Eventually, by analyzing temporal correlations of the excited matter degrees of freedom, we show that driving with entangled photons imprints characteristic temporal correlations of time-energy entangled modes in the matter degree of freedom.</p>

            <p>We study the possibility of discriminating between metric theories within the Parametrized Post-Newtonian formalism. In this approach, the two-dimensional quantum state of a massive quantum clock becomes, after propagating at low speed and in a weak gravitational field, a function of the post-Newtonian parameters and thus a signature of a metric theory. To discriminate among metric theories, we resort to quantum-state discrimination strategies such as minimum error and unambiguous state discrimination. In particular, we show that it is possible to refute the hypothesis that a particular metric theory describes spacetime with a single detection event and that it is possible to discriminate with certainty between two different metrics, also with a single detection event. In general, the success probability of the discrimination strategy is a harmonic function of the product of the difference of the proper time corresponding to each quantum clock state, the energy difference between the energy eigenstates of the quantum clock, the propagation length, and speed. It is thus possible to find suitable length and speed scales such that the success probability is close to one by selecting a quantum system with the highest energy difference and the largest natural lifetime. According to this, atomic nuclei such as thorium are considered the most suitable quantum clocks.</p>

This enables detection of individual molecules up to the resolution of the sub-micron lattice spacing. Our approach provides direct access to the density distribution of small samples of molecules, allowing us to obtain precise measurements of density-dependent collisional losses. Further, by mapping two internal states of the molecule to different atomic species, we demonstrate simultaneous detection of the position and rotational state of individual molecules. Finally, we implement local addressing of the sample using a focused beam to induce a spatially-dependent light shift on the rotational transitions of the molecules.</p>

            <p>Quantum networks (QNs) transmit delicate quantum information across noisy quantum channels. Crucial applications, like quantum key distribution (QKD) and distributed quantum computation (DQC), rely on efficient quantum information transmission. Learning the best path between a pair of end nodes in a QN is key to enhancing such applications. This paper addresses learning the best path in a QN in the online learning setting. We explore two types of feedback: "link-level" and "path-level". Link-level feedback pertains to QNs with advanced quantum switches that enable link-level benchmarking. Path-level feedback, on the other hand, is associated with basic quantum switches that permit only path-level benchmarking. We introduce two online learning algorithms, BeQuP-Link and BeQuP-Path, to identify the best path using link-level and path-level feedback, respectively. To learn the best path, BeQuP-Link benchmarks the critical links dynamically, while BeQuP-Path relies on a subroutine, transferring path-level observations to estimate link-level parameters in a batch manner. We analyze the quantum resource complexity of these algorithms and demonstrate that both can efficiently and, with high probability, determine the best path. Finally, we perform NetSquid-based simulations and validate that both algorithms accurately and efficiently identify the best path.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vincent Pouthier, Saad Yalouz</p>
            <p>We study the quantum dynamics of a strongly correlated electron pair in a one-dimensional lattice, focusing on the occurrence of local dissociation/pairing mechanisms induced by a site energy defect. To this end, we simulate the time evolution of two interacting electrons on a finite-size chain governed by an extended Hubbard Hamiltonian including on-site Coulomb repulsion $ U $ and nearest-neighbor interaction $V$, along with single-electron hopping $J$. By introducing a local site energy defect with amplitude $ \Delta $, we show that a transition between spatially paired/dissociated electrons can occur in the vicinity of this site. Such mechanisms arise in a strongly correlated regime with non-zero nearest neighbor Coulomb interactions and under the conditions $ (U \sim V \sim \Delta) \gg J$. To rationalize these phenomena, we reformulate the two-electron dynamics of the original Hubbard chain as an effective single-particle problem on a two-dimensional network. Within this framework, we show that the pairing/dissociation dynamics are driven by resonances between two distinct families of two-electron eigenstates: $(i)$ states with two spatially well-separated electrons with one located at the site defect, and $(ii)$ states with locally bound electron located away from the defect. At resonance, these states hybridize, allowing transitions from locally paired to dissociated electrons (and vice versa) in the vicinity of the defect. These results provide new insights into exotic pairing phenomena in strongly correlated electronic systems and may have implications for the design of tunable many-body states in low-dimensional quantum materials.</p>

            <p>The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm is a cornerstone computational method for studying quantum many-body systems, renowned for its accuracy and adaptability. Despite DMRG's broad applicability across fields such as materials science, quantum chemistry, and quantum computing, numerous independent implementations have been developed. This survey maps the rapidly expanding DMRG software landscape, providing a comprehensive comparison of features among 35 existing packages. We found significant overlap in features among the packages when comparing key aspects, such as parallelism strategies for high-performance computing and symmetry-adapted formulations that enhance efficiency. This overlap suggests opportunities for modularization of common operations, including tensor operations, symmetry representations, and eigensolvers, as the packages are mostly independent and share few third-party library dependencies where functionality is factored out. More widespread modularization and standardization would result in reduced duplication of efforts and improved interoperability. We believe that the proliferation of packages and the current lack of standard interfaces and modularity are more social than technical. We aim to raise awareness of existing packages, guide researchers in finding a suitable package for their needs, and help developers identify opportunities for collaboration, modularity standardization, and optimization. Ultimately, this work emphasizes the value of greater cohesion and modularity, which would benefit DMRG software, allowing these powerful algorithms to tackle more complex and ambitious problems.</p>

            <p>Relativistic quantum metrology provides a framework within which we can quantify the quality of measurement and estimation procedures while accounting for both quantum and relativistic effects. The chief measure for describing such procedures is the Fisher information, which quantifies how sensitive a given estimation is to a variance of some underlying parameter. Recently, the Fisher information has been used to quantify the spacetime information accessible to two-level quantum particle detectors. We have previously shown that such a system is capable of discerning black hole mass for static black holes in 2+1 dimensions. Here, we extend these results to the astrophysically interesting case of rotating black holes and show that the Fisher information is also sensitive to the rotation of a black hole.</p>

            <h2>Energy as a Primitive Ontology for the Physical World</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J.E. Horvath, B.B. Martins</p>
            <p>We reanalyze from a modern perspective the bold idea of G. Helm, W. Ostwald, P. Duhem and others that energy is the fundamental entity composing the physical world. We start from a broad perspective reminding the search for a fundamental ``substance'' (perhaps better referred to as ous\'ıa, the original Greek word) from the pre-Socratics to the important debate between Ostwald and Boltzmann about the energy vs. atoms at the end of the 19th century. While atoms were eventually accepted (even by Ostwald himself), the emergence of Quantum Mechanics and Relativity were crucial to suggest that the dismissal of energy in favor of atoms was perhaps premature, and should be revisited. We discuss how the so-called primitive ontology programme can be implemented with energy as the fundamental entity, and why fields (and their quanta, particles) should rather be considered as non-fundamental. We sketch some of the difficulties introduced by the attempt to include gravitation in the general scheme.</p>

            <h2>Operators of Dirac's theory with mass and axial chemical potential</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ion I. Cotaescu</p>
            <p>The Dirac equation with mass and axial chemical potential is solved analytically obtaining the mode spinors and corresponding projection operators giving the spectral representations of the principal conserved operators. In this framework, the odd partner of the Pryce spin operator is defined for the first time showing how these operators may be combined for defining the particle and antiparticle spin and polarization operators of Dirac's theory of massive fermions either in the free case or in the presence of the axial chemical potential. The quantization procedure is applied in both these cases obtaining two distinct operator algebras in which the particle and antiparticle spin and polarization operators take canonical forms. In this approach statistical operators with independent particle and antiparticle vortical chemical potentials may be constructed.</p>

            <h2>Studying Maximal Entanglement and Bell Nonlocality at an Electron-Ion Collider</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei Qi, Zijing Guo, Bo-Wen Xiao</p>
            <p>In this paper, we propose to test quantum entanglement and Bell nonlocality at an Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). By computing the spin correlations in quark-antiquark pairs produced via photon-gluon fusion, we find that longitudinally polarized photons produce maximal entanglement at leading order, while transversely polarized photons generate significant entanglement near the threshold and in the ultra-relativistic regime. Compared to hadron colliders, the EIC provides a cleaner experimental environment for measuring entanglement through the $\gamma^\ast g \to q\bar{q}$ channel, offering a strong signal and a promising avenue to verify Bell nonlocality. This study extends entanglement measurements to the EIC, presenting new opportunities to explore the interplay of quantum information phenomena and hadronic physics in the EIC era.</p>

            <h2>Fragmentation of a trapped multiple-species bosonic mixture</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> O. E. Alon, L. S. Cederbaum</p>
            <p>We consider a multiple-species mixture of interacting bosons, $N_1$ bosons of mass $m_1$, $N_2$ bosons of mass $m_2$, and $N_3$ bosons of mass $m_3$ in a harmonic trap of frequency $\omega$. The corresponding intraspecies interaction strengths are $\lambda_{11}$, $\lambda_{22}$, and $\lambda_{33}$, and the interspecies interaction strengths are $\lambda_{12}$, $\lambda_{13}$, and $\lambda_{23}$. When the shape of all interactions are harmonic, this is the generic multiple-species harmonic-interaction model which is exactly solvable. We start by solving the many-particle Hamiltonian and concisely discussing the ground-state wavefunction and energy in explicit forms as functions of all parameters, the masses, numbers of particles, and the intraspecies and interspecies interaction strengths. We then move to compute explicitly the reduced one-particle density matrices for all the species and diagonalize them, thus generalizing the treatment in [J. Chem. Phys. {\bf 161}, 184307 (2024)]. The respective eigenvalues determine the degree of fragmentation of each species. As applications, we focus on aspects that do not appear for the respective single-species and two-species systems. For instance, placing a mixture of two kinds of bosons in a bath made by a third kind, and controlling the fragmentation of the former by coupling to the latter. Another example exploits the possibility of different connectivities (i.e., which species interacts with which species) in the mixture, and demonstrates how the fragmentation of species $3$ can be manipulated by the interaction between species $1$ and species $2$, when species $3$ and $1$ do not interact with each other. We thereby highlight properties of fragmentation that only appear in the multiple-species mixture. Further applications are briefly discussed.</p>

In this work, we quantitatively analyzed the dependence of the first Shapiro step height of the junction array at 50 GHz on the parameter spread of 10,000 Josephson junctions by numerical simulation with resistively shunted junction model. The results indicate an upper limit spread of the critical current and resistance of the Josephson junctions. Specifically, to keep the maximum first Shapiro step above 0.88 mA, the critical current standard deviation, $\sigma$, should not exceed 25%, and for it to stay above 0.6 mA, the resistance standard deviation should not exceed 1.5%.</p>

            <p>Symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases are short-range entangled quantum states characterized by anomalous edge behavior, a manifestation of the bulk-boundary correspondence for topological phases. Moreover, the Li-Haldane conjecture posits that the entanglement spectrum exhibits the same anomaly as the physical edge spectrum, thereby serving as an entanglement-based fingerprint for identifying topological phases. In this work, we extend the entanglement-based diagnostic tools by demonstrating that the edge anomaly is manifested not only in the entanglement spectrum but also in the reduced density matrix itself, a phenomenon we refer to as the mixed state anomaly. Focusing on the two-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ SPT phase, we show that this anomaly is subtly encoded in symmetry-twisted mixed states, leading to a topological contribution to the disorder parameter beyond the area law, as well as a spontaneous-symmetry-breaking type long-range order when time reversal symmetry is present.</p>

In a 25-layer array, cooperative response leads to over a thirtyfold increase in the effective optical wavelength within the medium, almost eliminating optical phase accumulation, with potential applications in spectroscopy and optical manipulation of quantum emitters. Crucially, the near-zero refractive index arises from first-principles microscopic theory, rather than being imposed through continuous phenomenological effective-medium model - providing conceptually important insight into the emergence of macroscopic electromagnetism from atomic-scale interactions.</p>

            <p>Deep neural networks have been shown to achieve exceptional performance for computer vision tasks like image recognition, segmentation, and reconstruction or denoising. Here, we evaluate the ultimate performance limits of deep convolutional neural network models for image reconstruction, by comparing them against the standard quantum limit set by shot-noise and the Heisenberg limit on precision. We train U-Net models on images of natural objects illuminated with coherent states of light, and find that the average mean-squared error of the reconstructions can surpass the standard quantum limit, and in some cases reaches the Heisenberg limit. Further, we train models on well-parameterized images for which we can calculate the quantum Cramér-Rao bound to determine the minimum possible measurable variance of an estimated parameter for a given probe state. We find the mean-squared error of the model predictions reaches these bounds calculated for the parameters, across a variety of parameterized images. These results suggest that deep convolutional neural networks can learn to become the optimal estimators allowed by the laws of physics, performing parameter estimation and image reconstruction at the ultimate possible limits of precision for the case of classical illumination of the object.</p>

In these states, the outer electron is dynamically localized at large distances by pendulum-like oscillations of the inner electron across the nucleus. A complementary simple molecular-like adiabatic model offers a clear interpretation of the correlated two-electron motion and suggests that the series is a general feature of highly doubly excited states of atoms and molecules.</p>

            <p>Macroscopic coherence is an important feature of quantum many-body systems exhibiting collective behaviors, with examples ranging from atomic Bose-Einstein condensates, and quantum liquids to superconductors. Probing many-body coherence in a dynamically unstable regime, however, presents an intriguing and outstanding challenge in out-of-equilibrium quantum many-body physics. Here, we experimentally study the first- and second-order coherence of degenerate quasi-one-dimensional (1D) Bose gases quenched from repulsive to modulationally unstable attractive interaction regimes. The resulting dynamics, monitored by in-situ density and matter-wave interference imaging, reveals phase-coherent density wave evolutions arising from the interplay between noise-amplified density modulations and dispersive shock waves of broad interest within nonlinear physics. At longer times, the gases become phase-scrambled, exhibiting a finite correlation length. Interestingly, following an interaction quench back to the repulsive regime, we observe that quasi-long-range coherence can be spontaneously re-established. This captivating rephasing dynamics can be attributed to the nucleation and annihilation of density defects in the quasi-1D geometry. These results shed light on out-of-equilibrium phase coherence in quantum many-body systems in a regime where beyond mean-field effects may arise and theoretical approaches have not been well-established.</p>

            <p>Optimization of quantum programs or circuits is a fundamental problem in quantum computing and remains a major challenge. State-of-the-art quantum circuit optimizers rely on heuristics and typically require superlinear, and even exponential, time. Recent work proposed a new approach that pursues a weaker form of optimality called local optimality. Parameterized by a natural number $\Omega$, local optimality insists that each and every $\Omega$-segment of the circuit is optimal with respect to an external optimizer, called the oracle. Local optimization can be performed using only a linear number of calls to the oracle but still incurs quadratic computational overheads in addition to oracle calls. Perhaps most importantly, the algorithm is sequential. In this paper, we present a parallel algorithm for local optimization of quantum circuits. To ensure efficiency, the algorithm operates by keeping a set of fingers into the circuit and maintains the invariant that a $\Omega$-deep circuit needs to be optimized only if it contains a finger. Operating in rounds, the algorithm selects a set of fingers, optimizes in parallel the segments containing the fingers, and updates the finger set to ensure the invariant. For constant $\Omega$, we prove that the algorithm requires $O(n\lg{n})$ work and $O(r\lg{n})$ span, where $n$ is the circuit size and $r$ is the number of rounds. We prove that the optimized circuit returned by the algorithm is locally optimal in the sense that any $\Omega$-segment of the circuit is optimal with respect to the oracle.</p>

In this work, we consider applications of the ESPRIT algorithm primarily to extend real-time dynamical data from simulations of quantum systems. We evaluate ESPRIT's performance in the presence of noise and compare it to other extrapolation methods. We demonstrate its ability to extract information from short-time dynamics to reliably predict long-time behavior and determine the minimum time interval required for accurate results. We discuss how this insight can be leveraged in numerical methods that propagate quantum systems in time, and show how ESPRIT can predict infinite-time values of dynamical observables, offering a purely data-driven approach to characterizing quantum phases.</p>

            <p>Given a classical query algorithm as a decision tree, when does there exist a quantum query algorithm with a speed-up over the classical one? We provide a general construction based on the structure of the underlying decision tree, and prove that this can give us an up-to-quadratic quantum speed-up. In particular, we obtain a bounded-error quantum query algorithm of cost $O(\sqrt{s})$ to compute a Boolean function (more generally, a relation) that can be computed by a classical (even randomized) decision tree of size $s$. Lin and Lin [ToC'16] and Beigi and Taghavi [Quantum'20] showed results of a similar flavor, and gave upper bounds in terms of a quantity which we call the "guessing complexity" of a decision tree. We identify that the guessing complexity of a decision tree equals its rank, a notion introduced by Ehrenfeucht and Haussler [Inf. Comp.'89] in the context of learning theory. This answers a question posed by Lin and Lin, who asked whether the guessing complexity of a decision tree is related to any complexity-theoretic measure. We also show a polynomial separation between rank and randomized rank for the complete binary AND-OR tree. Beigi and Taghavi constructed span programs and dual adversary solutions for Boolean functions given classical decision trees computing them and an assignment of non-negative weights to its edges. We explore the effect of changing these weights on the resulting span program complexity and objective value of the dual adversary bound, and capture the best possible weighting scheme by an optimization program. We exhibit a solution to this program and argue its optimality from first principles. We also exhibit decision trees for which our bounds are asymptotically stronger than those of Lin and Lin, and Beigi and Taghavi. This answers a question of Beigi and Taghavi, who asked whether different weighting schemes could yield better upper bounds.</p>

            <p>The evaluation of the Jones polynomial at roots of unity is a paradigmatic problem for quantum computers. In this work we present experimental results obtained from existing noisy quantum computers for special cases of this problem, where it is classically tractable. Our approach relies on the reduction of the problem of evaluating the Jones polynomial of a knot at lattice roots of unity to the problem of computing quantum amplitudes of qudit stabiliser circuits, which are classically efficiently simulatable. More specifically, we focus on evaluation at the fourth root of unity, which is a lattice root of unity, where the problem reduces to evaluating amplitudes of qubit stabiliser circuits. To estimate the real and imaginary parts of the amplitudes up to additive error we use the Hadamard test, yielding non-Clifford circuits that nevertheless we can always efficiently compute the correct output of. Hence, we further argue that this setup defines a standard benchmark for near-term noisy quantum processors. Additionally, we study the benefit of performing quantum error mitigation with the method of zero noise extrapolation.</p>

These heuristic optimization techniques are employed for adapting the topology and the parameters of a set of electrical circuits to find the suitable architecture matching the required energy levels and relevant transition matrix elements. We analyze the performance of the optimizer on one-dimensional single- and multi-loop circuits to design ladder ($\Xi$) and lambda ($\Lambda$) three-level system with specific transition matrix elements. As expected, attaining both the required energy spectrum and the needed selection rules is challenging for single-loop circuits, but they can be accurately obtained even with just two loops. Additionally, we show that our multi-loop circuits are robust under random fluctuation in their circuital parameters, i.e. under eventual fabrication flaws. Developing an optimization algorithm for automatized circuit quantization opens an avenue to engineering superconducting circuits with specific symmetry to be used as modules within large-scale setups, which may allow us to mitigate the well-known current errors observed in the first generation of quantum processors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nhat A. Nghiem, Xianfeng David Gu, Tzu-Chieh Wei</p>
            <p>Topological data analysis has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing large-scale data. An abstract simplicial complex, in principle, can be built from data points, and by using tools from homology, topological features could be identified. Given a simplex, an important feature is called the Betti numbers, which roughly count the number of `holes' in different dimensions. Calculating Betti numbers exactly can be $\#$P-hard, and approximating them can be NP-hard, which rules out the possibility of any generic efficient algorithms and unconditional exponential quantum speedup. Here, we explore the specific setting of a triangulated manifold. In contrast to most known methods to estimate Betti numbers, which rely on homology, we exploit the `dual' approach, namely, cohomology, combining the insight of the Hodge theory and de Rham cohomology. Our proposed algorithm can calculate its $r$-th normalized Betti number $\beta_r/|S_r|$ up to some additive error $\epsilon$ with running time $\mathcal{O}\Big(\frac{\log(|S_r^K| |S_{r+1}^K|)}{\epsilon^2} \log (\log |S_r^K|) \big( r\log |S_r^K| \big) \Big)$, where $|S_r|$ is the number of $r$-simplexes in the given complex. For the estimation of $r$-th Betti number $\beta_r$ to a chosen multiplicative accuracy $\epsilon'$, our algorithm has complexity $ \mathcal{O}\Big(\frac{\log(|S_r^K| |S_{r+1}^K|)}{\epsilon'^2} \big( \frac{ \Gamma}{\beta_r}\big)^2 (\log |S_r^K|) \log \big( r\log |S_r^K| \big) \Big)$, where $\Gamma \leq |S_r^K|$ can be chosen. A detailed analysis is provided, showing that our cohomology framework can even perform exponentially faster than previous homology methods in several regimes. In particular, our method is most effective when $\beta_r \ll |S_r^K|$, which can offer more flexibility and practicability than existing quantum algorithms that achieve the best performance in the regime $\beta_r \approx |S_r^K|$.</p>

The three QSL times are attainable for any given initial state in the sense that there exists a dynamics driving the initial state to evolve along the geodesic. We numerically compare the tightness of the three QSL times, which typically promises a tighter QSL time if optimizing the alternative function.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guido Giachetti, Nicolò Defenu</p>
            <p>In general, classical fully-connected systems are known to undergo violent relaxation. This phenomenon refers to the relaxation of observables to stationary, non-thermal, values on a finite timescale, despite their long-time dynamics being dominated by mean-field effects in the thermodynamic limit. Here, we analyze the ``quantum" violent relaxation by studying the dynamics of generic many-body systems with two-body, all-to-all, interactions in the thermodynamic limit. We show that, in order for violent relaxation to occur very specific conditions on the spectrum of the mean-field effective Hamiltonian have to be met. These conditions are hardly met and ``quantum" violent relaxation is observed rarely with respect to its classical counterpart. Our predictions are validated by the study of a spin model which, depending on the value of the coupling, shows a transition between violent-relaxation and a generic prethermal phase. We also analyze a spin version of the quantum Hamiltonian-Mean-Field model, which is shown not to exhibit violent-relaxation. Finally, we discuss how the violent-relaxation picture emerges back in the classical limit. Our results demonstrate how, even in the mean-field regime, quantum effects have a rather dramatic impact on the dynamics, paving the way to a better understanding of light-matter coupled systems.</p>

            <p>Quantum hypothesis testing (QHT) has been traditionally studied from the information-theoretic perspective, wherein one is interested in the optimal decay rate of error probabilities as a function of the number of samples of an unknown state. In this paper, we study the sample complexity of QHT, wherein the goal is to determine the minimum number of samples needed to reach a desired error probability. By making use of the wealth of knowledge that already exists in the literature on QHT, we characterize the sample complexity of binary QHT in the symmetric and asymmetric settings, and we provide bounds on the sample complexity of multiple QHT. In more detail, we prove that the sample complexity of symmetric binary QHT depends logarithmically on the inverse error probability and inversely on the negative logarithm of the fidelity. As a counterpart of the quantum Stein's lemma, we also find that the sample complexity of asymmetric binary QHT depends logarithmically on the inverse type II error probability and inversely on the quantum relative entropy, provided that the type II error probability is sufficiently small. We then provide lower and upper bounds on the sample complexity of multiple QHT, with it remaining an intriguing open question to improve these bounds. The final part of our paper outlines and reviews how sample complexity of QHT is relevant to a broad swathe of research areas and can enhance understanding of many fundamental concepts, including quantum algorithms for simulation and search, quantum learning and classification, and foundations of quantum mechanics. As such, we view our paper as an invitation to researchers coming from different communities to study and contribute to the problem of sample complexity of QHT, and we outline a number of open directions for future research.</p>

This approach enables the estimation of time-local master equations, including their possible negative decay rates, by maximizing a likelihood function subject to dynamical constraints. We discuss L$\ell$QT for the dephasing dynamics of single qubits in detail, which allows for a neat understanding of the importance of including multiple snapshots of the quantum evolution in the likelihood function, and how these need to be distributed in time depending on the noise characteristics. By a detailed comparative study employing both frequentist and Bayesian approaches, we assess the accuracy and precision of L$\ell$QT of a dephasing quantum dynamical map that goes beyond the Lindblad limit, focusing on two different microscopic noise models that can be realised in either trapped-ion or superconducting-circuit architectures. We explore the optimization of the distribution of measurement times to minimize the estimation errors, assessing the superiority of each learning scheme conditioned on the degree of non-Markovinity of the noise, and setting the stage for future experimental designs of non-Markovian quantum tomography.</p>

            <h2>Multivariate Fidelities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Theshani Nuradha, Hemant K. Mishra, Felix Leditzky, Mark M. Wilde</p>
            <p>The main contribution of our paper is to introduce a number of multivariate quantum fidelities and show that they satisfy several desirable properties that are natural extensions of those of the Uhlmann and Holevo fidelities. We propose three variants that reduce to the average pairwise fidelity for commuting states: average pairwise $z$-fidelities, the multivariate semi-definite programming (SDP) fidelity, and a multivariate fidelity inspired by an existing secrecy measure. The second one is obtained by extending the SDP formulation of the Uhlmann fidelity to more than two states. All three of these variants satisfy the following properties: (i) reduction to multivariate classical fidelities for commuting states, (ii) the data-processing inequality, (iii) invariance under permutations of the states, (iv) its values are in the interval $[0,1]$; they are faithful, that is, their values are equal to one if and only if all the states are equal, and they satisfy orthogonality, that is their values are equal to zero if and only if the states are mutually orthogonal to each other, (v) direct-sum property, (vi) joint concavity, and (vii) uniform continuity bounds under certain conditions. Furthermore, we establish inequalities relating these different variants, indeed clarifying that all these definitions coincide with the average pairwise fidelity for commuting states. Lastly, we introduce another multivariate fidelity called multivariate log-Euclidean fidelity, which is a quantum generalization of the Matusita multivariate fidelity. We also show that it satisfies most of the desirable properties listed above, it is a function of a multivariate log-Euclidean divergence, and has an operational interpretation in terms of quantum hypothesis testing with an arbitrarily varying null hypothesis.</p>

            <p>Subwavelength atomic arrays feature strong light-induced dipole-dipole interactions, resulting in subradiant collective resonances characterized by narrowed linewidths. In this work, we present a sideband cooling scheme for atoms trapped in subwavelength arrays that utilizes these narrow collective resonances. Working in the Lamb-Dicke regime, we derive an effective master equation for the atomic motion by adiabatically eliminating the internal degrees of freedom of the atoms, and validate its prediction with numerical simulations of the full system. Our results demonstrate that subradiant resonances enable the cooling of ensembles of atoms to temperatures lower than those achievable without dipole interactions, provided the atoms have different trap frequencies. Remarkably, narrow collective resonances can be sideband-resolved even when the individual atomic transition is not. In such scenarios, ground-state cooling becomes feasible solely due to light-induced dipole-dipole interactions. This approach could be utilized for future quantum technologies based on dense ensembles of emitters, and paves the way towards harnessing many-body cooperative decay for enhanced motional control.</p>

            <h2>Measurement-induced phase transition in free bosons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kazuki Yokomizo, Yuto Ashida</p>
            <p>The competition between quantum many-particle dynamics and continuous monitoring can lead to measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPTs). So far, MIPTs have been extensively explored in fermionic or spin systems. To examine the possibility of an MIPT in bosonic systems, we study the entanglement structure in continuously monitored free bosons with long-range couplings. When the measurement is local, we find that no MIPTs occur because the substantial entanglement generated by the long-range coupling overcomes the entanglement destruction due to the measurement. In contrast, we show that the nonlocal measurement can efficiently suppress the entanglement generation, leading to an MIPT where the bipartite entanglement entropy exhibits the subvolume-to-area law phase transition as the measurement strength is increased. Our numerical results indicate that the critical point should be described by a certain conformal field theory, while the transition does not belong to a conventional universality class such as Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless class.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giulia Rubino, Karen V. Hovhannisyan, Paul Skrzypczyk</p>
            <p>Work is a process-based quantity, and its measurement typically requires interaction with a measuring device multiple times. While classical systems allow for non-invasive and accurate measurements, quantum systems present unique challenges due to the influence of the measuring device on the final value of work. As recent studies have shown, among these challenges is the impossibility of formulating a universal definition of work that respects energy conservation for coherent quantum systems and is compatible with the Jarzynski equality - a fluctuation relation linking the equilibrium free energy difference to the non-equilibrium work. Here we overcome this challenge by introducing a genuinely quantum, positive correction to the Jarzynski equality stemming from imposing energy conservation. When sufficiently large, this correction forces quantum work to violate the second law more often. Moreover, we construct modified two-point measurement (TPM) schemes for work along with circuit implementations for them. These measurement schemes correctly certify energy conservation and remain consistent with our quantum-corrected fluctuation relation.</p>

We illustrate that our method works for heralded single-photon and weak attenuated sources. We also study the influence of noise in our experimental implementation and show that post-selection imparts additional robustness to the scheme against noise. We further demonstrate that fringe visibility from post-selection interferometry can be used to quantify the transmittance of the imperfect absorber. An interesting link between the interrogation and weak values of nonunitary operators is also highlighted.</p>

            <p>The dynamics of a quantum-many body system subject to measurements is naturally described by an ensemble of quantum trajectories, which can feature measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPTs). This phenomenon cannot be revealed through ensemble-averaged observables, but it requires the ability to discriminate each trajectory separately, making its experimental observation extremely challenging. We explore the fate of MIPTs under an observer's reduced ability to discriminate each measurement outcome. This introduces uncertainty in the state of the system, causing observables to probe a restricted subset of trajectories rather than a single one. By introducing an exactly-solvable Liouvillian model, we examine how long-time spatial correlations are influenced by varying degrees of trajectory averaging. We compute exactly the correlation matrix, Liouvillian gap, and entanglement negativity to demonstrate that averaging over multiple realizations introduces an effective finite lengthscale, beyond which long-range correlations are suppressed. This suggests that partial averaging over trajectories conceals the critical features of individual realizations, thereby blurring away the signatures of distinct measurement-induced phases.</p>

            <p>Entangled photons are crucial resources for quantum information processing. Here, we present an ultrabright polarization-entangled photon source based on a periodically poled lithium niobate waveguide designed for practical quantum communication networks. Using a 780 nm pump laser, the source achieves a pair generation rate of 2.4 $\times 10^{10}$ pairs/s/mW. Remarkably, the entangled photons are bright enough to be detected by a power meter, reaching a power of 17.9 nW under a pump power of 3.2 mW. We demonstrate the practicality of the source by conducting quantum key distribution experiments over long-distance fiber links. Wavelength-division multiplexing was employed to enhance the key generation, and nonlocal dispersion compensation was implemented to ensure precise timing coincidence measurements across a broad spectral range. By utilizing nine pairs of wavelength channels, the system achieved the applicable secure key rates of up to 440.80 bits/s over 200 km with a 62 dB loss and extended the maximum secure key generation distance to 404 km. These results demonstrate the potential of wavelength-multiplexed polarization-entangled photon sources for high-speed, long-distance quantum communication, positioning them as key components for future large-scale quantum networks.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Register Machine: Efficient Implementation of Quantum Recursive Programs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhicheng Zhang, Mingsheng Ying</p>
            <p>Quantum recursive programming has been recently introduced for describing sophisticated and complicated quantum algorithms in a compact and elegant way. However, implementation of quantum recursion involves intricate interplay between quantum control flow and recursive procedure calls. In this paper, we aim at resolving this fundamental challenge and develop a series of techniques to efficiently implement quantum recursive programs. Our main contributions include: 1. We propose a notion of quantum register machine, the first quantum architecture (including an instruction set) that provides instruction-level support for quantum control flow and recursive procedure calls at the same time. 2. Based on quantum register machine, we describe the first comprehensive implementation process of quantum recursive programs, including the compilation, the partial evaluation of quantum control flow, and the execution on the quantum register machine. 3. As a bonus, our efficient implementation of quantum recursive programs also offers automatic parallelisation of quantum algorithms. For implementing certain quantum algorithmic subroutine, like the widely used quantum multiplexor, we can even obtain exponential parallel speed-up (over the straightforward implementation) from this automatic parallelisation. This demonstrates that quantum recursive programming can be win-win for both modularity of programs and efficiency of their implementation.</p>

            <p>Currently envisaged tests for probing the quantum nature of the gravitational interaction in the low-energy regime typically focus either on the quantized center-of-mass degrees of freedom of two spherically-symmetric test masses or on the rotational degrees of freedom of non-symmetric masses under a gravitational interaction in the Newtonian limit. In contrast, here we investigate the interaction between the angular momenta of spherically-symmetric test masses considering the general relativistic correction related to frame-dragging that leads to an effective dipolar interaction between the angular momenta. In this approach, the mass of the probes is not directly relevant; instead, their angular momentum plays the central role. We demonstrate that, while the optimal entangling rate is achieved with a maximally delocalized initial state, significant quantum correlations can still arise between two rotating systems even when each is initialized in an eigenstate of rotation. Additionally, we examine the robustness of the generated entanglement against typical sources of noise and observe that our combination of angular momentum and spherically-symmetric test-masses mitigates the impact of many common noise sources.</p>

            <p>A separable version of Ky Fan's majorization relation is proven for a sum of two operators that are each a tensor product of two positive semi-definite operators. In order to prove it, upper bounds are established for the relevant largest eigenvalue sums in terms of the optimal values of certain linear programs. The objective function of these linear programs is the dual of the direct sum of the spectra of the summands. The feasible sets are bounded polyhedra determined by positive numbers, called alignment terms, that quantify the overlaps between pairs of largest eigenvalue spaces of the summands. By appealing to geometric considerations, tight upper bounds are established on the alignment terms of tensor products of positive semi-definite operators. As an application, the spin alignment conjecture in quantum information theory is affirmatively resolved to the 2-letter level. Consequently, the coherent information of platypus channels is additive to the 2-letter level.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement scaling and criticality of infinite-size quantum many-body systems in continuous space addressed by a tensor network approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rui Hong, Hao-Wei Cui, An-Chun Ji, Shi-Ju Ran</p>
            <p>Simulating strongly-correlated quantum systems in continuous space belongs to the most challenging and long-concerned issues in quantum physics. This work investigates the quantum entanglement and criticality of the ground-state wave-functions of infinitely-many coupled quantum oscillators (iCQOs). The essential task involves solving a set of partial differential equations (Schrödinger equations in the canonical quantization picture) with infinitely-many variables, which currently lacks valid methods. By extending the imaginary-time evolution algorithm with translationally-invariant functional tensor network, we simulate the ground state of iCQOs with the presence of two- and three-body couplings. We determine the range of coupling strengths where there exists a real ground-state energy (dubbed as physical region). With two-body couplings, we reveal the logarithmic scaling law of entanglement entropy (EE) and the polynomial scaling law of correlation length against the virtual bond dimension $\chi$ at the dividing point of physical and non-physical regions. These two scaling behaviors are signatures of criticality, according to the previous results in quantum lattice models, but were not reported in continuous-space quantum systems. The scaling coefficients result in a central charge $c=1$, indicating the presence of free boson conformal field theory (CFT). We further show that the presence of three-body couplings, for which there are no analytical or numerical results, breaks down the CFT description at the dividing point. Our work reveals the scaling behaviors of EE in continuous-space quantum many-body systems. These results provide strong numerical evidence supporting the efficiency of TN in representing continuous-space quantum wave-functions in the thermodynamic limit and offer an efficient approach to studying entanglement properties and criticality in continuous space.</p>

            <h2>Generalizing the matching decoder for the Chamon code</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zohar Schwartzman-Nowik, Benjamin J. Brown</p>
            <p>Different choices of quantum error-correcting codes can reduce the demands on the physical hardware needed to build a quantum computer. To achieve the full potential of a code, we must develop practical decoding algorithms that can correct errors that have occurred with high likelihood. Matching decoders are very good at correcting local errors while also demonstrating fast run times that can keep pace with physical quantum devices. We implement variations of a matching decoder for a three-dimensional, non-CSS, low-density parity check code known as the Chamon code, which has a non-trivial structure that does not lend itself readily to this type of decoding. The non-trivial structure of the syndrome of this code means that we can supplement the decoder with additional steps to improve the threshold error rate, below which the logical failure rate decreases with increasing code distance. We find that a generalized matching decoder that is augmented by a belief-propagation step prior to matching gives a threshold of 10.5% for depolarizing noise.</p>

            <h2>A Classical Analogue of Entanglement for a Kicked Top</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bilal Khalid, Sabre Kais</p>
            <p>It is widely believed that quantum mechanics cannot exhibit chaos, since unitarity of time evolution ensures that distances between quantum states are preserved. However, a parallel argument can be constructed in classical mechanics that would seem to deny the existence of classical chaos too. The argument works by describing classical states as probability distributions in phase space and showing that the inner product between distributions on phase space is preserved under Liouvillian dynamics. Thus, the more faithful classical analogy of a quantum state is not a single phase space trajectory but is instead a phase space distribution, and chaos in such states must be identified by some statistical signatures instead of exponential separation of nearby states. The search for these signatures is the primary goal in quantum chaos research. However, this perspective also naturally motivates the search for classical analogues of these signatures, to reveal the inner machinery of chaos in quantum systems. One widely recognized signature of chaos in quantum systems is the dynamical generation of entanglement. Chaos in the classical system is correlated with a greater entanglement production in the corresponding quantum system. One of the most well-studied examples of this is the kicked top model. In this paper, we construct a classical analogue of bipartite entanglement in terms of the mutual information between phase space distributions of subsystems and find completely analogous signatures of chaos as those found in entanglement for the kicked top Hamiltonian.</p>

            <p>We present an application of the affine covariant integral quantization (ACIQ) (this http URL, 5, 901, 2020, this http URL, 7.1, 2020) to quantum mechanics on the punctured plane. The associated four-dimensional phase space is identified with the similitude group SIM(2), which comprises translations, rotations, and dilations of the plane. Due to the topology of the punctured plane, our quantization procedure gives rise to an affine vector potential. This potential can be interpreted as the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) gauge field produced by an infinite solenoid. This observation supports a reinterpretation of the AB effect: it emerges from the topological constraint imposed by the impenetrable coil rather than from an externally applied classical gauge field. In addition to this gauge structure, ACIQ also generates a repulsive, centrifugal-like scalar potential, a feature already encountered when applying ACIQ to motion on the half-line, whose phase space is the open half-plane. These results provide a new perspective on the AB effect, highlighting the central roles of topology and symmetry in quantum mechanics.</p>

This work can serve as a bridge to more advanced quantum mechanical concepts. For instance, analyses of this setup in terms of entanglement have a rich history and can be used to test the predictions of quantum mechanics versus local realism (e.g., as in Hardy's Paradox).</p>

Based on the CP, we propose a highly sensitive temperature sensor with a mechanical resonator quadratically coupled to an optical mode. We find that the sensitivity of the temperature sensor can be enhanced by several orders of magnitude as the driving strength approaches the CP, and the sensitivity of the temperature sensor remains high in the low-temperature limit. Our work provides an effective way to realize highly sensitive temperature sensing at ultra-low temperature in the QOM systems.</p>

            <p>Precise qubit control in the presence of spatio-temporally correlated noise is pivotal for transitioning to fault-tolerant quantum computing. Generically, such noise can also have non-Gaussian statistics, which hampers existing non-Markovian noise spectroscopy protocols. By utilizing frame-based characterization and a novel symmetry analysis, we show how to achieve higher-order spectral estimation for noise-optimized circuit design. Remarkably, we find that the digitally driven qubit dynamics can be solely determined by the complexity of the applied control, rather than the non-perturbative nature of the non-Gaussian environment. This enables us to address certain non-perturbative qubit dynamics more simply. We delineate several complexity bounds for learning such high-complexity noise and demonstrate our single and two-qubit digital characterization and control using a series of numerical simulations. Our results not only provide insights into the exact solvability of (small-sized) open quantum dynamics but also highlight a resource-efficient approach for optimal control and possible error reduction techniques for current qubit devices.</p>

            <p>Quantum batteries, as highly efficient energy storage devices, have garnered significant research interest. A key challenge in their development is to maximize the extractable energy (ergotropy) when operating within a finite-temperature reservoir. To address this, we applied quantum feedback control to the charger and investigated the effects of fermionic and bosonic thermal reservoirs on the performance of quantum batteries, including stored energy, ergotropy, and charging efficiency, in an open environment. Our findings reveal that, regardless of the type of thermal reservoir, the system exhibits optimal charging parameters. In particular, in a fermionic thermal reservoir, increasing the environmental temperature enhances battery performance, enabling stable and efficient charging. In contrast, within a bosonic thermal reservoir, higher temperatures hinder energy storage and extraction, significantly reducing charging efficiency. Additionally, we explored the impact of battery size and found that, under a fermionic reservoir, increasing the battery size appropriately can further improve performance.</p>

            <p>The limitations of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices have motivated the development of Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs), which are designed to potentially achieve quantum advantage for specific tasks. Quantum Architecture Search (QAS) algorithms play a critical role in automating the design of high-performance Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PQCs) for VQAs. However, existing QAS approaches struggle with large search spaces, leading to substantial computational overhead when optimizing large-scale quantum circuits. Extensive empirical analysis reveals that circuit topology has a greater impact on quantum circuit performance than gate types. Based on this insight, we propose the Topology-Driven Quantum Architecture Search (TD-QAS) framework, which first identifies optimal circuit topologies and then fine-tunes the gate types. In the fine-tuning phase, the QAS inherits parameters from the topology search phase, eliminating the need for training from scratch. By decoupling the large search space into separate topology and gate-type components, TD-QAS avoids exploring gate configurations within low-performance topologies, thereby significantly reducing computational complexity. Numerical simulations across various tasks, under both noiseless and noisy conditions, validate the effectiveness of the TD-QAS framework. This framework advances standard QAS algorithms by enabling the identification of high-performance quantum circuits while minimizing computational demands. These findings indicate that TD-QAS deepens our understanding of VQAs and offers broad potential for the development of future QAS algorithms.</p>

Here, we demonstrate a marker-free, femtosecond laser writing technique to generate individual quantum emitters within photonic structures. Characterization of 28 defect centers, laser-written at the centers of pre-existing solid immersion lens structures, showed offsets relative to the photonic structure's center of 260~nm in the x-direction and 60~nm in the y-direction, with standard deviations of $\pm 170$~nm and $\pm 90$~nm, respectively, resulting in an average 4.5 times enhancement of the optical collection efficiency.

            <p>As quantum devices scale to larger numbers of qubits, entangling gates between distant stationary qubits will help provide flexible, long-range connectivity in modular architectures. In this work, we present protocols for implementing long-range two-qubit gates mediated by either Fock-state or time-bin qubits -- photonic encodings that are both compatible with the coplanar waveguide resonators commonly used in circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED). These protocols become deterministic in the limit of vanishing photon loss. Additionally, photon loss can be heralded, signaling a failed two-qubit gate attempt. We model the loss of a time-bin qubit to a dielectric environment consisting of an ensemble of two-level systems (TLSs), which are believed to be the dominant mechanism for dielectric loss in circuit QED architectures. The backaction (on the stationary qubits) associated with the loss of the time-bin qubit is strongly suppressed in a non-Markovian regime where the temporal separation of the time bins is short compared to the dielectric environment's correlation time. This result suggests strategies based on a combination of materials-fabrication and time-bin-qubit optimization for ensuring that the loss of a time-bin qubit is not only heralded, but also approximately backaction-free.</p>

            <h2>A Necessary and Sufficient Condition for Quantum Realizability of Correlations for Arbitrary Normalized Observables in the Clauser--Horne--Shimony--Holt Setup</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryosuke Nogami, Jaeha Lee</p>
            <p>We establish a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a quantum state that reproduces given correlation values in the Clauser--Horne--Shimony--Holt (CHSH) setup for any fixed normalized observables. This result addresses a fundamental question shared by both local realism and quantum mechanics: under what conditions a given set of observed data can be reproduced by a physical model. While previous studies have mainly addressed conditions for correlations achievable without specifying the measurement settings, our result gives a finer characterization by treating the observables as fixed in advance. The resulting quantum condition strengthens previously known constraints, such as Tsirel'son's inequalities and the Tsirel'son--Landau inequality, by characterizing statistical constraints explicitly for each specified set of observables. In particular, we show that our condition applies to Bell's original scenario and reveals that whether Bell's original inequality is violated depends sensitively on the chosen observables. More broadly, this perspective offers new insights into how quantum violations of local realism depend on the measurement settings.</p>

            <h2>A classical proof of quantum knowledge for multi-prover interactive proof systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anne Broadbent, Alex B. Grilo, Nagisa Hara, Arthur Mehta</p>
            <p>In a proof of knowledge (PoK), a verifier becomes convinced that a prover possesses privileged information. In combination with zero-knowledge proof systems, PoKs play an important role in security protocols such as in digital signatures and authentication schemes, as they enable a prover to demonstrate possession of certain information (such as a private key or a credential), without revealing it. A PoK is formally defined via the existence of an extractor, which is capable of reconstructing the key information that makes a verifier accept, given oracle access to any accepting prover. We extend this concept to the setting of a single classical verifier and multiple quantum provers and present the first statistical zero-knowledge (ZK) PoK proof system for problems in QMA. To achieve this, we establish the PoK property for the ZK protocol of Broadbent, Mehta, and Zhao (TQC 2024), which applies to the local Hamiltonian problem. More specifically, we construct an extractor which, given oracle access to a provers' strategy that leads to high acceptance probability, is able to reconstruct the ground state of a local Hamiltonian. Our result can be seen as a new form of self-testing, where, in addition to certifying a pre-shared entangled state, the verifier also certifies that a prover has access to a quantum system, in particular, a ground state; this indicates a new level of verification for a proof of quantumness.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhaohui Yang, Dawei Ding, Chenghong Zhu, Jianxin Chen, Yuan Xie</p>
            <p>Variational quantum algorithms (VQA) based on Hamiltonian simulation represent a specialized class of quantum programs well-suited for near-term quantum computing applications due to its modest resource requirements in terms of qubits and circuit depth. Unlike the conventional single-qubit (1Q) and two-qubit (2Q) gate sequence representation, Hamiltonian simulation programs are essentially composed of disciplined subroutines known as Pauli exponentiations (Pauli strings with coefficients) that are variably arranged. To capitalize on these distinct program features, this study introduces PHOENIX, a highly effective compilation framework that primarily operates at the high-level Pauli-based intermediate representation (IR) for generic Hamiltonian simulation programs. PHOENIX exploits global program optimization opportunities to the greatest extent, compared to existing SOTA methods despite some of them also utilizing similar IRs. Experimental results demonstrate that PHOENIX outperforms SOTA VQA compilers across diverse program categories, backend ISAs, and hardware topologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ewan McCulloch, J. Alexander Jacoby, Curt von Keyserlingk, Sarang Gopalakrishnan</p>
            <p>Chaotic quantum systems at finite energy density are expected to act as their own heat baths, rapidly dephasing local quantum superpositions. We argue that in fact this dephasing is subexponential for chaotic dynamics with conservation laws in one spatial dimension: all local correlation functions decay as stretched exponentials or slower. The stretched exponential bound is saturated for operators that are orthogonal to all hydrodynamic modes. This anomalous decay is a quantum coherent effect, which lies beyond standard fluctuating hydrodynamics; it vanishes in the presence of extrinsic dephasing. Our arguments are general, subject principally to the assumption that there exist zero-entropy charge sectors (such as the particle vacuum) with no nontrivial dynamics: slow relaxation is due to the persistence of regions resembling these inert vacua, which we term "voids". In systems with energy conservation, this assumption is automatically satisfied because of the third law of thermodynamics.</p>

            <p>Understanding the optical response of a high-kinetic-inductance microwave resonator is crucial for applications ranging from single-photon detection to quantum transduction between microwave and optical domains, which is gaining significant attention for scaling up quantum computers. However, interactions between the pump light and the superconducting resonator often induce unintended resonance frequency shifts and linewidth broadening. In this study, we measure the local optical response of a NbTiN nanowire resonator using a laser-scanning microwave spectroscopy system integrated with a dilution refrigerator. The optical response of the resonator shows correlation with the resonance modes and position, which is attributed to the two-level system around the resonator. These findings not only contribute to the design and understanding of quantum transducers and single-photon detectors, but also to the understandings of catastrophic high-energy particle irradiation events that generate unintended phonons in quantum devices.</p>

In particular, we demonstrate that the least radiant state in this sector is well described by a coherent superposition of all possible quantum dimer coverings: a resonating valence bond (RVB) liquid state. We discuss possible strategies to probe this exotic state, along with their limitations and challenges. Finally, we show that such a quantum dimer covering can also emerge as the ground state of the coherent Hamiltonian describing a 2D atomic array coupled to a photonic band-gap material.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peng Zhao, Guming Zhao, Shaowei Li, Chen Zha, Ming Gong</p>
            <p>The fluxonium qubit has emerged as a promising candidate for superconducting quantum computing due to its long coherence times and high-fidelity gates. Nonetheless, further scaling up and improving performance remain critical challenges for establishing fluxoniums as a viable alternative to transmons. A key obstacle lies in developing scalable coupling architectures. In this work, we introduce a scalable fluxonium architecture that enables decoupling of qubit states while maintaining tunable couplings between non-computational states. Beyond the well-studied ZZ crosstalk, we identify that always-on interactions involving non-computational levels can significantly degrade the fidelities of initialization, control, and readout in large systems, thereby impeding scalability. Based on two possible physical realizations of the architecture, we demonstrate that the issue can be mitigated by implementing tunable couplings for fluxonium plasmon transitions, meanwhile enabling fast, high-fidelity gates with passive ZZ suppression. This comparative analysis enables us to establish general principles for realizing the architecture while understanding and addressing implementation-specific challenges.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zihao Gong, Saikat Guha</p>
            <p>Quick detection of transmittance changes in optical channel is crucial for secure communication. We demonstrate that pre-shared entanglement using two-mode squeezed vacuum states significantly reduces detection latency compared to classical and entanglement-augmented coherent-state probes. The change detection latency is inversely proportional to the quantum relative entropy (QRE), which goes to infinity in the absence of thermal noise, suggesting idealized instantaneous detection. However, in realistic scenarios, we show that QRE scales logarithmically with the inverse of the thermal noise mean photon number. We propose a receiver that achieves this scaling and quantify its performance gains over existing methods. Additionally, we explore the fundamental trade-off between communication capacity and change detection latency, highlighting how pre-shared entanglement enhances both.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Atulya Mahesh, Swastik Mittal, Frank Mueller</p>
            <p>Cutting edge classical computing today relies on a combination of CPU-based computing with a strong reliance on accelerators. In particular, high-performance computing (HPC) and machine learning (ML) rely heavily on acceleration via GPUs for numerical kernels. In the future, acceleration via quantum devices may complement GPUs for kernels where algorithms provide quantum advantage, i.e., significant speedups over classical algorithms. Computing with quantum kernels mapped onto quantum processing units (QPUs) requires seamless integration into HPC and ML. However, quantum offloading onto HPC/cloud lacks open-source software infrastructure. For classical algorithms, parallelization standards, such as OpenMP, MPI, or CUDA exist. In contrast, a lack of quantum abstractions currently limits the adoption of quantum acceleration in practical applications creating a gap between quantum algorithm development and practical HPC integration. Such integration needs to extend to efficient quantum offloading of kernels, which further requires scheduling of quantum resources, control of QPU kernel execution, tracking of QPU results, providing results to classical calling contexts and coordination with HPC scheduling. This work proposes CONQURE, a co-execution environment for quantum and classical resources. CONQURE is a fully open-source cloud queue framework that presents a novel modular scheduling framework allowing users to offload OpenMP quantum kernels to QPUs as quantum circuits, to relay results back to calling contexts in classical computing, and to schedule quantum resources via our CONQURE API. We show our API has a low overhead averaging 12.7ms in our tests, and we demonstrate functionality on an ion-trap device. Our OpenMP extension enables the parallelization of VQE runs with a 3.1X reduction in runtime.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robert Mattes, Albert Cabot, Federico Carollo, Igor Lesanovsky</p>
            <p>Quantum systems in nonequilibrium conditions, where coherent many-body interactions compete with dissipative effects, can feature rich phase diagrams and emergent critical behavior. Associated collective effects, together with the continuous observation of quanta dissipated into the environment -- typically photons -- allow to achieve quantum enhanced parameter estimation. However, protocols for tapping this enhancement typically involve intricate measurements on the combined system-environment state. Here we show that many-body quantum enhancement can in fact be obtained through classical measurements, such as photon counting and homodyne detection. We illustrate this in detail for a class of open spin-boson models which can be realized in trapped-ion or cavity QED setups. Our findings highlight a route towards the design of systems that enable a practical implementation of quantum enhanced metrology through continuous classical measurements.</p>

            <h2>Thermalization and irreversibility of an isolated quantum system II</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xue-Yi Guo</p>
            <p>The irreversible entropy increase described by the second law of thermodynamics is fundamentally tied to thermalization and the emergence of equilibrium. In the first part of our work (Ref: arXiv.2503.04152), we constructed an isolated gas system model and numerically demonstrated irreversible growth of entanglement entropy caused by erasure of spread non-equilibrium state information. Here, we mathematically prove that for a typical macroscopic system in a non-equilibrium state $|\phi_0\rangle$, the quantum state $|\phi'_0\rangle = \hat{O}(t)|\phi_0\rangle$ will inevitably evolve toward equilibrium. Our work demonstrates that the second law of thermodynamics, and consequently the ergodic hypothesis in statistical physics, can be understood and proven from a quantum information perspective. From this perspective, the second law can be stated as: In typical macroscopic physical systems, the spreading and erasure of non-equilibrium information is inevitable.</p>

            <p>We propose a scheme to generate bipartite and tripartite entanglements of three magnon modes in a three-cavity system using a nonlinear optical parametric amplifier (OPA). The three magnon modes in three YIG spheres are respectively placed inside three cavities near the maximum magnetic fields of the cavities and coupled to cavity modes via linear magnetic dipole interaction. Additionally, linear coupling interaction exists between two cavities. Using experimentally feasible parameters, we demonstrate that OPA can prepare the three magnon modes in a steady-state entangled state, bipartite and tripartite entanglements increase with the nonlinear interaction strength of OPA. An alternative approach to enhance quantum entanglement involves multiplexed OPA inputs. By employing individual OPA for each cavity, we observe a significant improvement in entanglement generation. All the entanglements are robust against bath temperature.</p>

            <p>In this work, we show that parallel repetition of public-coin interactive arguments reduces the soundness error at an exponential rate even in the post-quantum setting. Moreover, we generalize this result to hold for threshold verifiers, where the parallel repeated verifier accepts if and only if at least $t$ of the executions are accepted (for some threshold $t$). Prior to this work, these results were known only when the cheating prover was assumed to be classical. We also prove a similar result for three-message private-coin arguments. Previously, Bostanci, Qian, Spooner, and Yuen (STOC 2024) proved such a parallel repetition result in the more general setting of quantum protocols, where the verifier and communication may be quantum. We consider only protocols where the verifier is classical, but obtain a simplified analysis, and for the more general setting of threshold verifiers.</p>

            <p>We study how rapidly the direction of time becomes operationally detectable from mesoscopic data when state-weights may be positive or negative. In contrast with classical Markov processes -- where forward evolution is instantly distinguishable from its reverse -- signed dynamics can render the arrow of time undetectable during an initial interval. Assume the generator of the signed dynamics is a symmetric signed Laplacian with a single linear invariant and a phase-space Second Law holds in the form of non-decreasing Rényi-$2$ entropy. Drawing on recent results on eventual exponential positivity of signed Laplacians (Chen et al., 2021), we define a test that correctly identifies the direction of thermodynamic time if conducted over a time interval of length at least $\tau$. We go on to prove that the test cannot deliver an incorrect conclusion if conducted over a shorter interval. Dropping symmetry, we exhibit a superquantum example where $\tau = +\infty$, so that the arrow of time remains permanently undetectable under our test.</p>

            <h2>Superactivation of Bell nonlocality in pure anyonic states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cheng-Qian Xu, Wenhao Ye, Li You</p>
            <p>Standard quantum information theory is founded on the assumption that multi-party state space possesses a tensor product structure. Anyons, as quasiparticles in two-dimensional systems, exhibit unique entanglement properties that differ from the conventional quantum systems, resulting from the absence of a tensor product structure in their state spaces. This motivates us to investigate the relationship between Bell nonlocality and entanglement in anyonic states. Specifically, we find that certain pure anyonic states with non-zero anyonic entanglement entropy (AEE) are local, yet exhibit nonlocality when subjected to collective measurements on multiple copies-a phenomenon known as superactivation of nonlocality, which is typically observed in conventional mixed states. To analyze this, we decompose the total entanglement of anyonic states into two components: one from the tensor product structure and the other representing residual contributions. By studying their asymptotic behavior, we find that the former gradually increases and approaches the AEE while the latter diminishes with the number of copies. Crucially, the entanglement component associated with the tensor product structure demonstrates a significant correlation with nonlocality, which explains the observed superactivation of nonlocality. Our findings provide new insights into the connection between entanglement and nonlocality in anyonic systems.</p>

            <p>Developing sensors with large particle numbers $N$ that can resolve subtle physical effects is a central goal in precision measurement science. Entangled quantum sensors can surpass the standard quantum limit (SQL), where the signal variance scales as $1/N$, and approach the Heisenberg limit (HL) with variance scaling as $1/N^2$. However, entangled states are typically more sensitive to noise, especially common-mode noise such as magnetic field fluctuations, control phase noise, or vibrations in atomic interferometers. We propose a two-node entanglement-enhanced quantum sensor network for differential signal estimation that intrinsically rejects common-mode noise while remaining robust against local, uncorrelated noise. This architecture enables sensitivities approaching the Heisenberg limit. We investigate two state preparation strategies: (i) unitary entanglement generation analogous to bosonic two-mode squeezing, yielding Heisenberg scaling; and (ii) dissipative preparation via collective emission into a shared cavity mode, offering a $\sqrt{N}$ improvement over the SQL. Numerical simulations confirm that both protocols remain effective under realistic conditions, supporting scalable quantum-enhanced sensing in the presence of dominant common-mode noise.</p>

            <p>This work introduces a novel model of quantum entities as physical, spatially extended wavefields, forming the basis for a realist framework for quantum measurement and collapse. Unlike interpretations that postulate hidden variables, observer-induced effects, ad hoc stochastic elements, or multiverse branching, this model derives the Born rule as a consequence of local physical interactions - involving kinetic energy transfer at or above a threshold - acting on an extended wavefield. Central to the model is a reinterpretation of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle - not as a statistical or epistemic limitation, but as a dynamical relation between kinetic energy transfer and wavefield contraction. This framework yields testable predictions about how weak, intermediate, and strong quantum interactions modulate spatial localization - predictions consistent with existing experimental findings. The upshot is a unified, falsifiable alternative to prevailing interpretations, and a foundation for a broader research program in wavefield interaction mechanics.</p>
