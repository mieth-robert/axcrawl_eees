            <h2>Higher-order nonclassicality criteria for photon-subtracted and photon-added states via the normalization constant</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jhordan Santiago</p>
            <p>We show that any nonclassicality criterion based on factorial moments, including several higher-order parameters such as the Mandel $Q^{(\ell)}$ parameter, the Lee antibunching function $d^{(\ell-1)}_h$, and the Agarwal--Tara parameter $A_3$, can be computed straightforwardly for photon-subtracted and photon-added states by performing operator reordering of the factorial moments. Within this approach, all relevant quantities depend solely on the normalization constant of the given state.</p>

            <h2>Testing Single Photon Entanglement using Self-Referential Measurements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Kun, Teodor Strömberg, Borivoje Dakić, Philip Walther, Lee A. Rozema</p>
            <p>Entanglement does not always require one particle per party. It was predicted some thirty years ago that a single photon traversing a beam splitter could violate a Bell inequality. Although initially debated, single-photon nonlocality was eventually demonstrated via homodyne measurements. Here, we present an alternate realisation that avoids the complexity of homodyne measurements and potential loopholes in their implementation. We violate a Bell inequality by performing joint measurements on two copies of the same single-photon entangled state, where one photon acts as a phase reference for the other, making it self-referential. We observe CHSH parameters of $2.71\pm 0.09$ and $2.23\pm 0.07$, depending on the joint measurements implemented. This offers a new perspective on single-photon nonlocality and a more accessible experimental route, potentially applicable to general mode-entangled states in diverse platforms.</p>

            <h2>A scalable advantage in multi-photon quantum machine learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yong Wang, Zhenghao Yin, Tobias Haug, Ciro Pentangelo, Simone Piacentini, Andrea Crespi, Francesco Ceccarelli, Roberto Osellame, Philip Walther</p>
            <p>Photons are promising candidates for quantum information technology due to their high robustness and long coherence time at room temperature. Inspired by the prosperous development of photonic computing techniques, recent research has turned attention to performing quantum machine learning on photonic platforms. Although photons possess a high-dimensional quantum feature space suitable for computation, a general understanding of how to harness it for learning tasks remains blank. Here, we establish both theoretically and experimentally a scalable advantage in quantum machine learning with multi-photon states. Firstly, we prove that the learning capacity of linear optical circuits scales polynomially with the photon number, enabling generalization from smaller training datasets and yielding lower test loss values. Moreover, we experimentally corroborate these findings through unitary learning and metric learning tasks, by performing online training on a fully programmable photonic integrated platform. Our work highlights the potential of photonic quantum machine learning and paves the way for achieving quantum enhancement in practical machine learning applications.</p>

            <h2>Experimental signatures of a $σ_zσ_x$ beam-splitter interaction between a Kerr-cat and transmon qubit</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Josiah Cochran, Haley M. Cole, Hebah Goderya, Zhuoqun Hao, Yao-Chun Chang, Theo Shaw, Aikaterini Kargioti, Shyam Shankar</p>
            <p>Quantum error correction (QEC) requires ancilla qubits to extract error syndromes from data qubits which store quantum information. However, ancilla errors can propagate back to the data qubits, introducing additional errors and limiting fault-tolerance. In superconducting quantum circuits, Kerr-cat qubits (KCQs), which exhibit strongly biased noise, have been proposed as ancillas to suppress this back-action and enhance QEC performance. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a beamsplitter interaction between a KCQ and a transmon, realizing an effective $\sigma_z\sigma_x$ coupling that can be employed for parity measurements in QEC protocols. We characterize the interaction across a range of cat sizes and drive amplitudes, confirming the expected scaling of the interaction rate. These results establish a step towards hybrid architectures that combine transmons as data qubits with noise-biased bosonic ancillas, enabling hardware-efficient syndrome extraction and advancing the development of fault-tolerant quantum processors.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Sensing using Geometrical Phase in Qubit-Oscillator Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nishchay Suri, Zhihui Wang, Tanay Roy, Davide Venturelli, Wibe Albert de Jong</p>
            <p>We present a quantum sensing protocol for coupled qubit-oscillator systems that surpasses the standard quantum limit (SQL) by exploiting a geometrical phase. The signal is encoded in the geometrical phase that is proportional to the area enclosed in oscillator phase space. This area is amplified through squeezing, enabling sensitivities beyond the SQL. Our method is independent of oscillator's initial state, amenable to sensing with high-temperature or logical error-corrected states. The protocol shows robustness to qubit Markovian noise and preserves its state-independence, underscoring its practicality for next-generation quantum metrology. We demonstrate application to force sensing beyond the SQL in longitudinally coupled systems, and to high-precision measurements of couplings and pulse calibration surpassing SQL in dispersively coupled circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) architectures.</p>

            <h2>Nonlinear Optical Quantum Communication with a Two-Dimensional Perovskite Light Source</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shuyue Feng, Zijian Gan, Camryn J. Gloor, Wei You, Andrew M. Moran</p>
            <p>Two-dimensional organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite (2D-OIHP) quantum wells are emerging as promising light sources for quantum communication technologies, owing to their ability to generate polarization-encoded optical signals. In this work, we explore how nonlinear optical phenomena can be exploited for quantum information applications, demonstrating the versatility that arises from resonant coupling among excited states. By tracking changes in the ellipticities of signal photons on femtosecond timescales in four-wave-mixing experiments, we first establish a method for information encoding based on exciton spin dynamics and biexciton correlations. Using single-photon detection, we then implement the BB84 quantum key distribution protocol by mapping these polarization states onto binary sequences. While the polarizations of weak coherent pulses are typically manipulated with optical elements in traditional quantum key distribution approaches, the intrinsic electronic structure and spin relaxation processes within the 2D-OIHP system determine the characteristics of the signal photons in our method. As a demonstration, an ASCII message consisting of 56 bits is transmitted through the polarization states of photons emitted by 2D-OIHP quantum wells. These results show that the information transmission efficiency depends strongly on contributions from biexciton states, highlighting the potential of spin-dependent nonlinear optical processes for quantum communication.</p>

            <h2>Switchable Dissipative Ising coupling Based on Three-Body Coupling in magnon systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xi-Wen Dou, Zheng-Yang Zhou, Ai-Xi Chen</p>
            <p>Magnonic systems present a compelling platform for quantum technology, owing to their strong capacity to form hybrid quantum systems via diverse couplings. To unlock the full potential of these systems, the engineering of flexible coupling between multiple magnon modes is essential. Here, we propose a method to realize switchable dissipative Ising coupling in magnon systems, leveraging the three-body coupling among photon, phonon, and magnon. This type of dissipative coupling is a critical component for constructing Ising machines designed to solve complex combinatorial optimization problems. By dynamically tuning the phase of a nonlinear mechanical pump, we demonstrate the realization of both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic dissipative interactions. The validity of the scheme is confirmed by numerical simulations, which also demonstrate its robustness against a strong uncontrollable part of dissipation. Our work provides a versatile tool that can facilitate the implementation of magnon-based quantum computing and the exploration of many-body magnon physics.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Simulation of Ligand-like Molecules through Sample-based Quantum Diagonalization in Density Matrix Embedding Framework</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ashish Kumar Patra, Anurag K. S. V., Sai Shankar P., Ruchika Bhat, Raghavendra V., Rahul Maitra, Jaiganesh G</p>
            <p>The accurate treatment of electron correlation in extended molecular systems remains computationally challenging using classical electronic structure methods. Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms offer a potential route to overcome these limitations; however, their practical deployment on existing quantum computers requires strategies that both reduce problem size and mitigate hardware noise. In this work, we combine Density Matrix Embedding Theory (DMET) with Sample-based Quantum Diagonalization (SQD) to compute ground-state energies of a set of natural ligand-like molecules in the minimal Slater Type Orbital (STO-3G) basis set. DMET provides a systematic fragmentation of a molecule into embedded impurity subproblems, while SQD enables construction and classical diagonalization of reduced configuration spaces through quantum sampling enhanced by iterative configuration recovery. The resulting embedded Hamiltonians are solved on IBM's Eagle R3 superconducting quantum hardware (IBM Sherbrooke). The DMET-SQD energies obtained for all systems considered exhibit strong agreement with DMET-FCI benchmark values within chemical accuracy (1 kcal/mol). These results demonstrate that sample-based quantum methods, when integrated with a robust embedding framework, can reliably extend quantum computation towards simulation of chemically relevant molecular systems, showcasing potential applications in the field of drug discovery.</p>

            <h2>Optimal Control for Rydberg multi-qubit operations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hossein Abedi, Mohammadsadegh Khazali, Klaus Mølmer</p>
            <p>Quantum computing algorithms can be decomposed into a universal set of elementary one- and two-qubit gates. Different physical implementations of quantum computing, however, employ interactions that permit direct conditional dynamics on multiple qubits in a single step. In this work, we leverage quantum optimal control techniques to design single continuous laser pulses that implement multi-qubit controlled-phase, -NOT and -swap (Fredkin) gates on Rydberg atom quantum processors. The identification of robust multi-qubit operations leads to reduced operation time and less decoherence, and the control field provides continuous protection of the atoms from environmental noise. Notably, we find that the controlled-swap (Fredkin) gate, implemented using this approach achieves 99.74\% fidelity while accounting for imperfections such as spontaneous emission, laser fluctuations, and Doppler dephasing.</p>

            <h2>Enhancing information retrieval in quantum-optical critical systems via quantum measurement backaction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cheng Zhang, Mauro Cirio, Xin-Qi Li, Pengfei Liang</p>
            <p>Continuous monitoring of open quantum-optical systems offers a promising route towards quantum-enhanced estimation precision. In such continuous-measurement-based sensing protocols, the ultimate precision limit is dictated, through the quantum Cramér-Rao bound, by the global quantum Fisher information associated with the joint system-environment state. Reaching this limit with established continuous measurement techniques in quantum optics remains an outstanding challenge. Here we present a sensing protocol tailored for open quantum-optical sensors that exhibit dissipative criticality, enabling them to significantly narrow the gap to the ultimate precision limit. Our protocol leverages a previously unexplored interplay between the quantum criticality and the quantum measurement backaction inherent in continuous general-dyne detection. We identify a performance sweet spot, near which the ultimate precision limit can be efficiently approached. Our protocol establishes a new pathway towards quantum-enhanced precision in open quantum-optical setups and can be extended to other sensor designs featuring similar dissipative criticality.</p>

            <h2>Superradiant decay in non-Markovian Waveguide Quantum Electrodynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rosa Lucia Capurso, Giuseppe Calajó, Simone Montangero, Saverio Pascazio, Francesco V. Pepe, Maria Maffei, Giuseppe Magnifico, Paolo Facchi</p>
            <p>An array of initially excited emitters coupled to a one-dimensional waveguide exhibits superradiant decay under the Born-Markov approximation, manifested as a coherent burst of photons in the output field. In this work, we employ tensor-network methods to investigate its non-Markovian dynamics induced by finite time delays in photon exchange among the emitters. We find that the superradiant burst breaks into a structured train of correlated photons, each intensity peak corresponding to a specific photon number. We quantify the emitter-photon and emitter-emitter entanglement generated during this process and show that the latter emerges in the long-time limit, as part of the excitation becomes trapped within the emitters' singlet subspace. We finally consider the decay of the system's most radiant state, the symmetric Dicke state, and show that time delay can lead to decay rates exceeding those predicted by the Markovian approximation.</p>

            <h2>Unifying Collective Effects in Emission, Absorption, and Transfer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adesh Kushwaha, Erik M. Gauger, Ivan Kassal</p>
            <p>Collective effects, such as superradiance and subradiance are central to emerging quantum technologies -- from sensing to energy storage -- and play an important role in light-harvesting. These effects enhance or suppress rates of dynamic processes (absorption, emission, and transfer) due to the formation of symmetric or antisymmetric collective states. However, collective effects in different contexts -- absorption, emission, and transfer -- have often been defined disparately, especially across different communities, leading to results that are not immediately transferable between different contexts. Here, we describe all three types of collective effects using a common Dicke framework that resolves the apparent discrepancies between different approaches. It allows us to generalise previously known collective effects involving spins into new ones involving aggregates of harmonic oscillators or other degrees of freedom. It also explains how collective effects can be engineered to be robust against both disorder and noise, paving the way for more resilient quantum devices.</p>

            <h2>Raising the Cavity Frequency in cQED</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raymond A. Mencia, Taketo Imaizumi, Igor A. Golovchanskiy, Andrea Lizzit, Vladimir E. Manucharyan</p>
            <p>The basic element of circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) is a cavity resonator strongly coupled to a superconducting qubit. Since the inception of the field, the choice of the cavity frequency was, with a few exceptions, been limited to a narrow range around 7 GHz due to a variety of fundamental and practical considerations. Here we report the first cQED implementation, where the qubit remains a regular transmon at about 5 GHz frequency, but the cavity's fundamental mode raises to 21 GHz. We demonstrate that (i) the dispersive shift remains in the conventional MHz range despite the large qubit-cavity detuning, (ii) the quantum efficiency of the qubit readout reaches 8%, (iii) the qubit's energy relaxation quality factor exceeds $10^7$, (iv) the qubit coherence time reproducibly exceeds $100~\mu\rm{s}$ and can reach above $300~\mu\rm{s}$ with a single echoing $\pi$-pulse correction. The readout error is currently limited by an accidental resonant excitation of a non-computational state, the elimination of which requires minor adjustments to the device parameters. Nevertheless, we were able to initialize the qubit in a repeated measurement by post-selection with $2\times 10^{-3}$ error and achieve $4\times 10^{-3}$ state assignment error. These results encourage in-depth explorations of potentially transformative advantages of high-frequency cavities without compromising existing qubit functionality.</p>

            <h2>Nonreciprocal transmission in a cavity-magnon system by rotational Sagnac effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhe-Qi Yang, Si-Qi Lin, Zhi-Rong Zhong</p>
            <p>Ultrahigh nonreciprocal transmission has been achieved in a cavity-magnon system, which consists of two whispering gallery modes (WGMs) and a single magnon mode within a magnetic insulator yttrium iron garnet sphere. The nonreciprocal frequency shift induced by the Sagnac effect enables unidirectional transmission of an input field, while suppressing propagation in the opposite direction, thereby facilitating nonreciprocal optical transmission. Within experimentally accessible parameter regimes, the optical isolation ratio can exceed 40 dB, representing the highest isolation ratio reported to date. Furthermore, applying squeezing to the magnon mode further enhances this isolation performance. Additionally, the directionality of light isolation can be reversed simply by modifying the rotation of the WGM cavity. These findings offer promising prospects for developing high-performance, tunable, and compact optical nonreciprocal devices.</p>

            <h2>Tunable Single-Photon Transport in a Multi-mode Waveguide via a $Λ$-Type Emitter</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yan Liu, Qing-Ao Xiang, Xin-Yuan Yang, Ji-Bing Yuan, Shi-Qing Tang, Xin-Wen Wang, Ya-Ju Song</p>
            <p>Precise control of photon transport in waveguide quantum electrodynamics is fundamental to advancing quantum information processing. We investigate the manipulation of single-photon scattering via a driven $\Lambda$-type emitter coupled to a rectangular waveguide, examining both single- and multi-mode regimes. Using the Lippmann-Schwinger formalism, we derive the scattering matrix and identify two distinct control mechanisms: Fano resonances induce complete reflection, and electromagnetically induce transparency (EIT) induce perfect transmission. In the single-mode regime, the external drive parameters-the detuning and Rabi frequency-precisely tune the positions and number of reflection peaks, allowing dynamic spectral engineering. In the multi-mode regime, quantum interference between modes governs the scattering dynamics. When the input photon is prepared in a specific coherent superposition, multi-mode effects restore single-mode-like behavior, enabling Fano-mediated complete reflection. Conversely, a single-mode input prevents complete reflection even at the Fano resonance, while EIT-driven transmission persists. These results demonstrate a versatile toolbox for photonic quantum control in multi-mode waveguides, paving the way for applications such as broadband dual-frequency filters and multi-mode spectrometers.</p>

            <h2>Escaping Barren Plateaus in Variational Quantum Algorithms Using Negative Learning Rate in Quantum Internet of Things</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ratun Rahman, Dinh C. Nguyen</p>
            <p>Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are becoming the primary computational primitive for next-generation quantum computers, particularly those embedded as resource-constrained accelerators in the emerging Quantum Internet of Things (QIoT). However, under such device-constrained execution conditions, the scalability of learning is severely limited by barren plateaus, where gradients collapse to zero and training stalls. This poses a practical challenge to delivering VQA-enabled intelligence on QIoT endpoints, which often have few qubits, constrained shot budgets, and strict latency requirements. In this paper, we present a novel approach for escaping barren plateaus by including negative learning rates into the optimization process in QIoT devices. Our method introduces controlled instability into model training by switching between positive and negative learning phases, allowing recovery of significant gradients and exploring flatter areas in the loss landscape. We theoretically evaluate the effect of negative learning on gradient variance and propose conditions under which it helps escape from barren zones. The experimental findings on typical VQA benchmarks show consistent improvements in both convergence and simulation results over traditional optimizers. By escaping barren plateaus, our approach leads to a novel pathway for robust optimization in quantum-classical hybrid models.</p>

These protocols are demonstrated by simulating transverse field Ising and XY models with superconducting qubits. In both analogue and digital implementations of the QKFE algorithms, we exhibit quantitative agreement of our quantum simulation experiments with the exact results. Our approach provides a general framework for computing thermodynamic potentials on programmable quantum devices, granting access to key thermodynamic properties such as entropy, heat capacity and criticality, with far-reaching implications for material design and drug development.</p>

            <h2>Evidence for unexpectedly low quasiparticle generation rates across Josephson junctions of driven superconducting qubits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Byoung-moo Ann, Sang-Jun Choi, Hee Chul Park, Sercan Deve, Robin Dekker, Gary A. Steele, Jaseung Ku, Seung-Bo Shim, Junho Suh</p>
            <p>Microwave drives applied to superconducting qubits (SCQs) are central to high-fidelity control and fast readout. However, recent studies find that even drives far below the superconducting gap frequency may cause drive-induced quasiparticle generation (QPG) across Josephson junctions (JJs), posing a serious concern for fault-tolerant superconducting quantum computing. Here, we find experimental evidence that the actual QPG rates in strongly driven SCQs are remarkably lower than expected. We apply intense drive fields through readout resonators, reaching effective qubit drive amplitudes up to 300 GHz. The nonlinear response of the resonators enables quantification of the energy loss from SCQs into their environments, including the contribution from QPG. Even when conservatively attributing all measured dissipation to QPG, the observed energy dissipation rates are far lower than expected from the ideal QPG model. Meanwhile, calculations incorporating high-frequency cutoffs (HFCs) near 17-20 GHz in the QPG conductance can explain the experiments. These HFCs yield QPG rates a few orders of magnitude smaller than those without HFCs, providing evidence that the QPG rates are lower than predicted by the ideal model. Our findings prevent overestimation of drive-induced QPG and provide crucial guidance for operating superconducting quantum processors. Identifying the microscopic origin of the discrepancy opens new material and device opportunities to further mitigate QPG.</p>

            <h2>Quantum relative entropy for unravelings of master equations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marcos Ruibal Ortigueira, Robert de Keijzer, Luke Visser, Oliver Tse, Servaas Kokkelmans</p>
            <p>This work explores connections between the quantum relative entropy of two faithful states $\rho,\sigma$ (i.e. full-rank density matrices) and the Kullback-Leibler divergences of classical measures $\mu,\nu$. Here, $\mu$ and $\nu$ are measures on the space of pure states, realizing $\rho$ and $\sigma$ respectively. The motivation for this result is to establish a notion of quantum relative entropy in the space of pure state distributions, which are the resulting objects of unravelings of the Lindblad equation, such as the stochastic Schrödinger equation. Our results show that the measures that achieve the minimal KL divergence are those supported on a (possibly non-orthogonal) common basis between $\rho$ and $\sigma$. Using the classical and quantum data-processing inequalities, our notion of quantum relative entropy is shown to be equivalent to the Belavkin-Staszewski entropy on states, revealing new insights on this quantity. Furthermore, the common basis is used to provide a novel proof of contraction of the relative entropy under Lindblad flow and offers insights into results from large deviation theory.</p>

We further establish a no-go theorem demonstrating that no universal measure of quantumness can exist in the absence of optimization. Finally, we substantiate our theoretical result through explicit examples involving both Gaussian and non-Gaussian states.</p>

            <p>Subwavelength atomic arrays offer a powerful platform for engineering cooperative light-matter interactions and enabling quantum metasurfaces. We demonstrate that a two-dimensional array of three-level atoms operating under electromagnetically induced transparency can function as a tunable dual-band atomic mirror, where two independently controllable reflection bands emerge from the collective optical responses mediated by dipole-dipole interactions. These resonances yield dual reflection bands with asymmetric linewidths, whose spectral positions and bandwidths can be tuned through the control-field parameters, dipole orientation, incident geometry, and lattice constant. We further identify the conditions under which additional diffraction orders emerge, which delineate the operational and tunable range of the atomic mirror via its collective-mode structure. This scheme provides a fully tunable dual-band atomic mirror operating across broad frequency and angular ranges, offering a practical and experimentally accessible pathway toward reconfigurable photonic elements in atomic-array platforms at low energy levels.</p>

            <h2>Algebraic power scaling in a slowly-quenched bosonic quantum battery</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Donny Dwiputra, Ahmad R. T. Nugraha, Sasfan A. Wella, Freddy Permana Zen</p>
            <p>Bosonic modes provide a promising platform for quantum batteries as a result of their unbounded energy spectrum. However, the energy that can be stored during a coherent charging process is limited due to coherent oscillations between the charger and battery. In this Letter, we show that by introducing a slow quench in the interaction between a coherently driven quadratic oscillator battery and a charger system, the maximum battery power ($P_{B,m}$) scales algebraically with the quench duration ($\tau_Q$), i.e., $P_{B,m} \propto \tau_Q^\alpha$, where $0<\alpha\leq2$ is a function of the quench ramp exponent. This finding implies that, counterintuitively, slower quenches lead to faster charging. Such a quench suppresses coherent energy oscillations between the battery and the charger, allowing an unbounded increase in power. Furthermore, we discuss the effect of charger dissipation, which imposes a finite limit on the maximum power. We also show that the temporal extensive scaling occurs in a broader context by mapping the system to a coherently driven Tavis-Cummings battery.</p>

            <h2>Efficient Identification of Permutation Symmetries in Many-Body Hamiltonians via Graph Theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saumya Shah, Patrick Rebentrost</p>
            <p>The computational cost of simulating quantum many-body systems can often be reduced by taking advantage of physical symmetries. While methods exist for specific symmetry classes, a general algorithm to find the full permutation symmetry group of an arbitrary Pauli Hamiltonian is notably lacking. This paper introduces a new method that identifies this symmetry group by establishing an isomorphism between the Hamiltonian's permutation symmetry group and the automorphism group of a coloured bipartite graph constructed from the Hamiltonian. We formally prove this isomorphism and show that for physical Hamiltonians with bounded locality and interaction degree, the resulting graph has a bounded degree, reducing the computational problem of finding the automorphism group to polynomial time. The algorithm's validity is empirically confirmed on various physical models with known symmetries. We further show that the problem of deciding whether two Hamiltonians are permutation-equivalent is polynomial-time reducible to the graph isomorphism problem using our graph representation. This work provides a general, structurally exact tool for algorithmic symmetry finding, enabling the scalable application of these symmetries to Hamiltonian simulation problems.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement and Minimal Hilbert Space in the Classical Dual States of Quantum Theory</h2>

            <p>A precise physical description and understanding of the classical dual content of quantum theory is necessary in many disciplines today: from concepts and interpretation to quantum technologies and computation. In this paper we investigate Quantum Entanglement with the new approach APL Quantum 2, 016104 (2025) on dual Classicalization. Thus, the results of this paper are twofold: Entanglement and Classicalization and the relationship between them. Classicalization truly occurs only under the action of the Metaplectic group Mp(n) (Minimal Representation group, double covering of the Symplectic group). Some of the results of this paper involves the computation and analysis of the entanglement for different types of coherent (coset and non coset) states and topologies: in the circle and the cylinder. We project the entangled wave functions onto the even (+) and odd (-) irreducible Hilbert Mp(n) subspaces, and compute their square norms: Entanglement Probabilities P++, P--, P+-, (eg in the same or in the different subspaces), and the Total sum of them, and more. These theoretical and conceptual results can be of experimental and practical real-world interest.</p>

            <h2>Quantum spectroscopy of topological dynamics via a supersymmetric Hamiltonian</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hiroshi Yamauchi, Satoshi Kanno, Yuki Sato, Hiroyuki Tezuka, Yoshi-aki Shimada, Eriko Kaminishi, Naoki Yamamoto</p>
            <p>Topological data analysis (TDA) characterizes complex dynamics through global invariants, but classical computation becomes prohibitive for high-dimensional data. We reinterpret time-domain dynamics as the eigenvalue spectrum of a supersymmetric (SUSY) Hamiltonian and thereby estimate topological descriptors through quantum spectroscopy. While zero modes correspond to Betti numbers, we show that low-lying excited states quantify the stability of topological features. Using a Takens embedding of the Lorenz system together with a resource-efficient quantum phase estimation implemented on IBM quantum hardware, we observe that the spectral gap of the SUSY Laplacian tracks the persistence of homological structures. Notably, the minimum of this spectral gap coincides with the onset of chaos, whereas its reopening reflects the geometric maturation of the attractor. Validated on small complexes yet offering an exponential advantage over classical diagonalization (from $O(N^3)$ to $\mathrm{poly}(\log N)$), this framework suggests that quantum hardware can function as a spectrometer for data topologies beyond classical reach.</p>

            <h2>Nonstabilizerness Estimation using Graph Neural Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vincenzo Lipardi, Domenica Dibenedetto, Georgios Stamoulis, Evert van Nieuwenburg, Mark H.M. Winands</p>
            <p>This article proposes a Graph Neural Network (GNN) approach to estimate nonstabilizerness in quantum circuits, measured by the stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE). Nonstabilizerness is a fundamental resource for quantum advantage, and efficient SRE estimations are highly beneficial in practical applications. We address the nonstabilizerness estimation problem through three supervised learning formulations starting from easier classification tasks to the more challenging regression task. Experimental results show that the proposed GNN manages to capture meaningful features from the graph-based circuit representation, resulting in robust generalization performances achieved across diverse scenarios. In classification tasks, the GNN is trained on product states and generalizes on circuits evolved under Clifford operations, entangled states, and circuits with higher number of qubits. In the regression task, the GNN significantly improves the SRE estimation on out-of-distribution circuits with higher number of qubits and gate counts compared to previous work, for both random quantum circuits and structured circuits derived from the transverse-field Ising model. Moreover, the graph representation of quantum circuits naturally integrates hardware-specific information. Simulations on noisy quantum hardware highlight the potential of the proposed GNN to predict the SRE measured on quantum devices.</p>

            <h2>Identifying genuine entanglement of lossy noisy very large scale continuous variable Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiao-yu Chen</p>
            <p>Genuine entanglement identification of large scale systems is crucial for quantum computation, quantum communication and quantum learning advantage. In contrast to experiments, where noisy intermediate-scale programmable photonic quantum processors have been developed, theoretically very limited results have been achieved for detecting genuine entanglement of continuous variable multipartite systems. We propose a quite general and efficient entanglement detection framework for all kinds of multipartite entanglement of continuous variable systems based on uncertainty relations and the sign matrix technique. Matrix criteria are demonstrated and can be applied to various entanglement depth and k-separability problems of multimode systems. We illustrate the genuine entanglement conditions of continuous variable Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states of more than a hundred million modes in a photon loss and noise environment.</p>

            <h2>Unrepeated White Rabbit Time Synchronisation over a 300 km Optical Fibre Link</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ben Amies-King, Marco Lucamarini</p>
            <p>White Rabbit (WR) technology provides a commercially-available off-the-shelf solution for time synchronisation with sub-nanosecond accuracy and picosecond-level precision over optical fibre links typically spanning tens of kilometres. Such high-performance time dissemination can support a variety of applications, including position, navigation and timing (PNT), financial transactions, metrology, as well as entanglement and quantum key distribution (QKD). Demonstrations of WR over significantly longer distances remain few and far between, particularly in scenarios where intermediate amplification is unavailable, such as stretches of long-haul underwater fibre. In this work, we report the longest unrepeated deployment of WR to date, achieving time synchronisation over a 300 km (51.34 dB) single-span optical fibre link, even in highly asymmetrical configurations, with 99.86% uptime, whilst maintaining picosecond-level precision and sub-nanosecond accuracy. This was achieved through careful selection and optimisation of the components deployed at the link's end points. By leveraging standard telecom fibre and off-the-shelf hardware, our results pave the way for a scalable and standardised timing backbone for large-scale quantum networks, offering a practical route toward time distribution in future heterogeneous quantum communication systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Florian Burger, Stephan Rinner, Andreas Gritsch, Kilian Sandholzer, Andreas Reiserer</p>
            <p>Quantum networks and the modular scaling of quantum computers require efficient spin-photon interfaces. This can be achieved with optical resonators that increase the local density of states, thereby enhancing the radiative decay of emitters on a specific transition. However, small mode volumes and high quality factors are required in this approach, which restricts the multiplexing capacity and necessitates precise tuning of the resonator frequency. Here, we demonstrate an alternative method that avoids these bottlenecks for up-scaling. Instead of strongly enhancing the emission on a selected transition, we suppress all other radiative decay channels by tailoring the photonic bandgap of a W1 silicon photonic crystal waveguide. In such a device, we can spectrally resolve and individually address tens of erbium dopants. We find that their emission is channeled to the desired transition, ensuring efficient collection. At the same time, their lifetimes are preserved or even extended compared to the bulk in a broad spectral range. Furthermore, the extended mode volume facilitates a low dopant concentration and thus a large spatial separation between the emitters, avoiding unwanted interactions that would limit their coherence. The demonstrated approach of inhibiting unwanted spontaneous emission can be combined with Purcell enhancement and applied to other leading spin-qubit platforms. It thus opens intriguing perspectives for photonic quantum technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yaoling Yang, Andrew Tanggara, Tobias Haug, Kishor Bharti</p>
            <p>Bosonic codes utilize the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space of harmonic oscillators to encode quantum information, offering a hardware-efficient approach to quantum error correction. Designing these codes requires precise geometric arrangements of quantum states in the phase space. Here, we introduce Quantum Cubature Codes (QCCs), a powerful and generalized framework for constructing bosonic codes based on superpositions of coherent states. This formalism utilizes cubature formulas from multivariate approximation theory, which connect the continuous geometry of the phase space to discrete, weighted point sets, ensuring the conditions for error correction are met. We demonstrate that this framework provides a unifying perspective, revealing that well-established codes, such as cat codes and the recently proposed quantum spherical codes (QSCs), are specific instances of QCCs corresponding to uniform weights on a single energy shell. The QCC formalism unlocks a vast new design space, encompassing non-uniform superpositions and multi-shell configurations. We leverage this framework to discover several new families of codes derived from Euclidean designs, allowing for greater geometric separation between logical states, which correlates with improved performance under photon loss. Numerical simulations under a pure-loss channel show that our multi-shell QCCs can outperform their single-shell counterparts by maximizing geometric separation with optimal energy at fixed pure-loss rate.</p>

            <p>Analog Quantum Simulators offer a route to exploring strongly correlated many-body dynamics beyond classical computation, but their predictive power remains limited by the absence of quantitative error estimation. Establishing rigorous uncertainty bounds is essential for elevating such devices from qualitative demonstrations to quantitative scientific tools. Here we introduce a general framework for bounded-error quantum simulation, which provides predictions for many-body observables with experimentally quantifiable uncertainties. The approach combines Hamiltonian and Lindbladian Learning--a statistically rigorous inference of the coherent and dissipative generators governing the dynamics--with the propagation of their uncertainties into the simulated observables, yielding confidence bounds directly derived from experimental data. We demonstrate this framework on trapped-ion quantum simulators implementing long-range Ising interactions with up to 51 ions, and validate it where classical comparison is possible. We analyze error bounds on two levels. First, we learn an open-system model from experimental data collected in an initial time window of quench dynamics, simulate the corresponding master equation, and quantitatively verify consistency between theoretical predictions and measured dynamics at long times. Second, we establish error bounds directly from experimental measurements alone, without relying on classical simulation--crucial for entering regimes of quantum advantage. The learned models reproduce the experimental evolution within the predicted bounds, demonstrating quantitative reliability and internal consistency. Bounded-error quantum simulation provides a scalable foundation for trusted analog quantum computation, bridging the gap between experimental platforms and predictive many-body physics. The techniques presented here directly extend to digital quantum simulation.</p>

            <h2>Hilbert space fragmentation in driven-dephasing Rydberg atom array</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tianyi Yan, Chun Hei Leung, Weibin Li</p>
            <p>We investigate the onset and mechanism of Hilbert space fragmentation (HSF) in a chain of strongly interacting Rydberg atoms subject to local dephasing. It is found that the emergence of multiple long-lived metastable states is fundamentally tied to HSF of the driven-dephasing Rydberg atom system. We demonstrate that the manifesting HSF is captured by a dephasing PXP model that supports multiple degenerate zero modes. These modes form disconnected, block-diagonal subspaces of maximally mixed states, which consist of many-body spin states sharing the same symmetry. A key result is the identification of the underlying symmetry in the HSF, where conserved quantities in each subspace are defined by the consecutive double excitation addressing operator. Moreover, we show explicitly that the number of the fragmented Hilbert space grows exponentially with the chain length, following a modified Fibonacci sequence. Our work provides insights into many-body dynamics under dynamical constraints and opens avenues for controlling and manipulating HSF in Rydberg atom systems.</p>

            <p>We examine the complementarity among coherence (visibility), predictability, and entanglement for qubit and qutrit systems subjected to noisy quantum channels. Using the system-path entanglement framework, analytical expressions for all three quantities are derived for two- and three-slit interferometric setups. The study first establishes the validity of the triality relation in ideal conditions and then investigates its behavior under amplitude and phase damping. We find that amplitude damping redistributes coherence and population imbalance without violating complementarity, while phase damping reduces coherence but leaves predictability unchanged. These results demonstrate that the complementarity relation remains preserved even in open quantum systems, highlighting its robustness against decoherence and providing a unified analytical understanding of noisy quantum interferometry in low-dimensional systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Malik Jirasek, Igor Lesanovsky, Albert Cabot</p>
            <p>Modern precision measurements, such as interferometry for detecting gravitational waves, rely on the estimation of optical phases encoded in light fields. Here, we propose to exploit the collectively enhanced output field of a driven-dissipative many-body open quantum system as a light source in order to improve the precision of estimating optical phases. Pronounced temporal correlations of such output fields benefit the sensitivity of measurement protocols, which we show theoretically by employing a boundary time crystal as a light source. The fundamental bound on the precision of such estimation shows scaling with system size that surpasses the Heisenberg limit and obeys the standard quantum limit in the measurement time. This scaling can be partially harnessed by a protocol, in which the phase shifted light field is guided into an auxiliary replica system, which serves as a detector that is sensitive to non-trivial temporal correlations of the light.</p>

            <p>The limited number of qubits per chip remains a critical bottleneck in quantum computing, motivating the use of distributed architectures that interconnect multiple quantum processing units (QPUs). However, executing quantum algorithms across distributed systems requires careful co-design of algorithmic primitives and hardware architectures to manage circuit depth and entanglement overhead. We identify multivariate trace estimation as a key subroutine that is naturally suited for distribution, and broadly useful in tasks such as estimating Rényi entropies, virtual cooling and distillation, and certain applications of quantum signal processing. In this work, we introduce COMPAS, an architecture that realizes multivariate trace estimation across a multi-party network of interconnected modular and distributed QPUs by leveraging pre-shared entangled Bell pairs as resources. COMPAS adds only a constant depth overhead and consumes Bell pairs at a rate linear in circuit width, making it suitable for near-term hardware. Unlike other schemes, which must choose between asymptotic optimality in circuit depth or GHZ width, COMPAS achieves both at once. Additionally, we analyze network-level errors and simulate the effects of circuit-level noise on the architecture.</p>

            <p>Out-of-equilibrium dynamics of non-integrable Hamiltonian many-body quantum systems are characterized by highly entangled wave functions. Near-maximal entanglement arises in systems exhibiting thermalization or pre-thermalization, where the system converges to a steady state with a fixed energy density. Classical simulation of the time dependence of such wave functions requires exponential resources. However, typical computations aim to estimate expectation values of local operators and correlation functions to some expected precision. For thermalizing systems at sufficiently high energy densities, such computations do not require storing the full wave function. Nonetheless, constructing classical algorithms for intermediate energy densities has remained a challenge. In this paper, we propose a heuristic approach to accelerate the convergence of Matrix Product State (MPS) simulations of expectation values applicable in a broad range of energy densities. We estimate the desired observables by rescaling the MPS results at low bond dimensions with a factor that depends only on the fidelity of the MPS wave function. Using this technique, we simulated the dynamics of the two-dimensional Transverse-Field Ising Model (TFIM) on a $7\times8$ grid with periodic boundary conditions, using a maximum bond dimension of $\chi = 4096$ on a single A100 GPU. We compared our results to similar TFIM simulations on a digital quantum processor.</p>

Here we give a remarkably simple construction of this channel, making its known properties -- and several new ones -- immediately transparent. In particular, we show that the channel also purifies non-i.i.d. states: it transforms any permutationally symmetric state into a uniform convex combination of permutationally symmetric purifications, each differing only by a tensor-product unitary acting on the purifying system. We then apply the channel to give a one-line proof of (a stronger version of) the recently established Uhlmann's theorem for quantum divergences.</p>

            <p>An accurate identification of Hamiltonian parameters is essential for modeling and control of open quantum systems. In this work, a novel data-driven method for inferring such parameters from first-moment dynamics is presented using an open 2D quantum harmonic oscillator as an example. The method relies on the discrete spectrum of the Koopman operator to obtain such parameters, which is obtained using the multichannel Hankel Alternative View of Koopman (mHAVOK) algorithm; a theoretical connection of such affirmation is presented. The method is tested on the expected value of noiseless quadratures, retrieving oscillation frequencies, damping rates, nonlinear Kerr shifts, qubit-photon coupling strengths of a Jaynes-Cummings interaction, and a modulated frequency of a time-dependent Hamiltonian. The majority of the recovered parameters remained within 5% of their true values. When compared to Fourier and matrix-pencil estimators, our approach yields lower errors for dynamics with strong dissipation. Overall, these findings suggest that Koopman operator theory provides a practical framework for studying quantum dynamical systems.</p>

            <p>We study covert communication and covert secret key generation with positive rates over quantum state-dependent channels. Specifically, we consider fully quantum state-dependent channels when the transmitter shares an entangled state with the channel. We study this problem setting under two security metrics. For the first security metric, the transmitter aims to communicate covertly with the receiver while simultaneously generating a covert secret key, and for the second security metric, the transmitter aims to transmit a secure message covertly and generate a covert secret key with the receiver simultaneously. Our main results include one-shot and asymptotic achievable positive covert-secret key rate pairs for both security metrics. Our results recover as a special case the best-known results for covert communication over state-dependent classical channels. To the best of our knowledge, our results are the first instance of achieving a positive rate for covert secret key generation and the first instance of achieving a positive covert rate over a quantum channel. Additionally, we show that our results are optimal when the channel is classical and the state is available non-causally at both the transmitter and the receiver.</p>

While these sectors cannot be distinguished by symmetry quantum numbers, we identify the emergent integrals of motion which characterize them.

            <p>We study information-theoretic inequalities for holographic correlation measures $J_W$ and $D_W$, establishing rigorous topological frameworks that prove monotonicity, monogamy, and strong superadditivity. While earlier work proposed bulk duals of classical correlation and quantum discord, their information-theoretic properties were unclear. We derive multiple inequalities involving entanglement wedge cross sections (EWCS) and show that monotonicity holds for both measured and unmeasured parties in $J_W$ and for the unmeasured party in $D_W$. Unlike their original counterparts, we find that $J_W$ is monogamous for both parties and obeys one-way strong superadditivity, whereas $D_W$ is polygamous for the unmeasured party in pure tripartite states. These results highlight distinctive features of holographic states and support a conjectured duality between $J_W$ and distillable entanglement. Motivated by the relation between EWCS and reflected entropy, we introduce boundary analogues $J_R$ and $D_R$, which serve as computable proxies for classical and quantum correlations without optimization. We analyze their inequalities, proving several and presenting counterexamples. Overall, we provide a systematic "zoo" of correlation inequalities in and beyond holography, clarifying connections among bulk geometry, discord-type correlations, and distillable entanglement.</p>

            <p>While for non-relativistic short-range interactions, the spread of information is local, remaining confined in an effective light cone, long-range interactions can generate either nonlocal (faster-than-ballistic) or local (ballistic) spread of correlations depending on the initial conditions. This makes long-range interactions a rich platform for controlling the spread of information. Here, we derive an effective Hamiltonian analytically and identify the specific interaction term that drives nonlocality in a wide class of long-range spin chains. This allows us to understand the conditions for the emergence of local behavior in the presence of nonlocal interactions and to identify a regime where the causal space-time landscape can be precisely designed. Indeed, we show that for large long-range interaction strength or large system size, initial conditions can be chosen in a way that allows a local perturbation to generate nonlocal signals at programmable distant positions, which then propagate within effective light cones. The possibility of engineering the emergence of nonlocal Lieb-Robinson-like light cones allows one to shape the causal landscape of long-range interacting systems, with direct applications to quantum information processing devices, quantum memories, error correction, and information transport in programmable quantum simulators.</p>

            <h2>Composite AdS geodesics for CFT correlators and timelike entanglement entropy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hardik Bohra, Allic Sivaramakrishnan</p>
            <p>We study how to recover timelike worldlines in AdS from CFT data as a toy model for holographically reconstructing realistic observers. We give a bulk extremization procedure that determines composite timelike-spacelike geodesics that connect timelike-separated boundary points. The total geodesic length matches the length extracted from CFT correlators at the timelike-separated points. We show agreement in Poincaré AdS, for generic boundary points in global AdS, and also for the BTZ solution, in which the timelike segment probes behind the horizon. We refine related methods to compute timelike entanglement entropy in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ and recover known results.</p>

            <h2>Quantum phase transitions of the anisotropic Dicke-Ising model in driven Rydberg arrays</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bao-Yun Dong, Ying Liang, Stefano Chesi, Xue-Feng Zhang</p>
            <p>We study the properties of a generalized Dicke-Ising model realized with an array of Rydberg atoms, driven by microwave electric fields and coupled to an optical cavity. As this platform allows for a precisely tunable anisotropy parameter, the model exhibits a rich landscape of phase transitions and critical phenomena, induced by the interplay of rotating-wave, counter-rotating-wave, and Ising interactions. We develop an improved quantum Monte Carlo algorithm based on the stochastic series expansion that explicitly tracks the Fock state of the quantum cavity. In the superradiant (SR) phase, this allows us to determine, through data collapse, the scaling laws of the photon number. We also demonstrate the vanishing of parity symmetry in finite-size simulations and show that the Rydberg blockade leads to a significant suppression of cavity occupation. Notably, stronger quantum fluctuations induced by the counter-rotating wave terms slightly favor the superradiant solid (SRS) phase over the Solid-1/2 state. Finally, we confirm that the SR phase transition and the transition from the Solid-1/2 to the SRS are second-order. In contrast, the transitions from the Solid-1/2 or SRS to the SR phase are both first-order for any value of the normalized anisotropy parameter.</p>

            <h2>Twisted (co)homology of non-orientable Weyl semimetals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thijs Douwes, Marcus Stålhammar</p>
            <p>The quasi-particle excitations in Weyl semimetals, known as Weyl fermions, are usually forced to emerge in charge-conjugate pairs by the Nielsen--Ninomiya theorem. When the Brillouin zone is non-orientable, this constraint is replaced by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ charge cancellation, as a result of the chirality becoming ill-defined on such manifolds; this results in configurations with seemingly non-zero total chirality. Here, we set out to explain this behaviour from a purely topological perspective, and provide a classification of non-orientable Weyl semimetal topology in terms of exact sequences of twisted (co)homology groups. This leads to several discoveries of direct physical importance: in particular, we recover the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ charge cancellation in a coordinate-independent way, allowing meaningful limits to be set on its physical interpretation. A detailed discussion is provided on a specific Klein bottle-like topology induced by a momentum-space glide symmetry, including a full review of the insulating and semimetallic invariants of the system and a classification of the surface states on the non-orientable boundary. Beyond this, we provide a complete survey of all possible non-orientable Brillouin zones and their associated invariants, and extend our formalism into the realm of non-Hermitian topological physics and inversion-symmetric Weyl semimetals. Our work exemplifies the vast potential of fundamental mathematical descriptions to not only aid the corresponding physical intuition, but also predict novel and hitherto overlooked phenomena of great relevance throughout the physics research forefront.</p>

            <h2>A programming language combining quantum and classical control</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kinnari Dave, Louis Lemonnier, Romain Péchoux, Vladimir Zamdzhiev</p>
            <p>The two main notions of control in quantum programming languages are often referred to as "quantum" control and "classical" control. With the latter, the control flow is based on classical information, potentially resulting from a quantum measurement, and this paradigm is well-suited to mixed state quantum computation. Whereas with quantum control, we are primarily focused on pure quantum computation and there the "control" is based on superposition. The two paradigms have not mixed well traditionally and they are almost always treated separately. In this work, we show that the paradigms may be combined within the same system. The key ingredients for achieving this are: (1) syntactically: a modality for incorporating pure quantum types into a mixed state quantum type system; (2) operationally: an adaptation of the notion of "quantum configuration" from quantum lambda-calculi, where the quantum data is replaced with pure quantum primitives; (3) denotationally: suitable (sub)categories of Hilbert spaces, for pure computation and von Neumann algebras, for mixed state computation in the Heisenberg picture of quantum mechanics.</p>

            <h2>Deconstructing symmetry breaking dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fumika Suzuki, Wojciech H. Zurek</p>
            <p>The Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) successfully predicts the density of topological defects deposited by the phase transitions, but it is not clear why. Its key conjecture is that, near the critical point of the second-order phase transition, critical slowing down will result in a period when the system is too sluggish to follow the potential that is changing faster than its reaction time. The correlation length at the freeze-out instant $\hat t$ when the order parameter catches up with the post-transition broken symmetry configuration is then decisive, determining when the mosaic of broken symmetry domains locks in topological defects. To understand why the KZM works so well we analyze Landau-Ginzburg model and show why temporal evolution of the order parameter plays such a key role. The analytical solutions we obtain suggest novel, hitherto unexplored, experimentally accessible observables that can shed light on symmetry breaking dynamics while testing the conjecture on which the KZM is based.</p>

            <h2>Accurate computation of the energy variance and $\langle\langle \mathcal{L}^\dagger \mathcal{L} \rangle\rangle$ using iPEPS</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emilio Cortés Estay, Naushad A. Kamar, Philippe Corboz</p>
            <p>Infinite projected entangled-pair states (iPEPS) provide a powerful tensor network ansatz for two-dimensional quantum many-body systems in the thermodynamic limit. In this paper we introduce an approach to accurately compute the energy variance of an iPEPS, enabling systematic extrapolations of the ground-state energy to the exact zero-variance limit. It is based on the contraction of a large cell of tensors using the corner transfer matrix renormalization group (CTRMG) method, to evaluate the correlator between pairs of local Hamiltonian terms. We show that the accuracy of this approach is substantially higher than that of previous methods, and we demonstrate the usefulness of variance extrapolation for the Heisenberg model, for a free fermionic model, and for the Shastry-Sutherland model. Finally, we apply the approach to compute $\langle \langle \mathcal{L}^\dagger \mathcal{L} \rangle \rangle$ for an open quantum system described by the Liouvillian $\mathcal{L}$, in order to assess the quality of the steady-state solution and to locate first-order phase transitions, using the dissipative quantum Ising model as an example.</p>

            <p>Entangled photons are fundamental resources for quantum communication, computing, and networking. Among them, polarization-entangled photon pairs play an important role due to their straightforward state manipulation and direct use in quantum key distribution, teleportation, and network protocols. However, realizing compact, efficient, and scalable polarization-entangled sources that meet the requirements of practical deployment remains a major challenge. Here, we present a simple yet high-performance on-chip polarization-entangled photon-pair source on thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN). Our device employs dual quasi-phase matching (D-QPM) that sequentially supports type-0 and type-I spontaneous parametric down-conversion in a single nanophotonic waveguide, eliminating the need for interferometers, polarization rotators, or other complex circuits. The source directly produces high-fidelity Bell states with broad bandwidth, high brightness, and low noise. Using this integrated platform, we realize wavelength-multiplexed entanglement distribution in a four-user quantum network deployed over metropolitan fiber links up to 50 km. These results establish a robust and scalable pathway toward practical quantum communication systems and multi-user quantum mesh networks based on integrated photonics.</p>

We demonstrate that the effect arises from nontrivial geometric tensors in quantum states, and can be scaled up with integer topological invariants. We further demonstrate that the effect fingerprints the multiband Hilbert-space geometry of underlying quantum states, as encoded in three-state geometric tensors. Our findings unravel the role of multistate geometry in viscoelastic phenomena, paving a path for experimental observation of uncharted nonlinear odd viscoelastic responses in quantum systems.</p>

            <p>The stabiliser fragment of quantum theory is a foundational building block for quantum error correction and the fault-tolerant compilation of quantum programs. In this article, we develop a sound, universal and complete denotational semantics for stabiliser operations which include measurement, classically-controlled Pauli operators, and affine classical operations, in which quantum error-correcting codes are first-class objects. The operations are interpreted as certain affine relations over finite fields. This offers a conceptually motivated and computationally-tractable alternative to the standard operator-algebraic semantics of quantum programs (whose time complexity grows exponentially as the state space increases in size). We demonstrate the power of the resulting semantics by describing a small, proof-of-concept assembly language for stabiliser programs with fully-abstract denotational semantics.</p>

            <h2>Algebraic Obstructions and the Collapse of Elementary Structure in the Kronecker Problem</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Soong Kyum Lee</p>
            <p>While Kronecker coefficients $g(\lambda,\mu,\nu)$ with bounded rows are polynomial-time computable via lattice-point methods, no explicit closed-form formulas have been obtained for genuinely three-row cases in the 87 years since Murnaghan's foundational work. This paper provides such formulas for the first time and identifies a universal structural boundary at parameter value 5 where elementary combinatorial patterns collapse. We analyze two independent families of genuinely three-row coefficients and establish that for $k \leq 4$, the formulas exhibit elementary structure: oscillation bounds follow the triangular-Hogben pattern, and polynomial expressions factor completely over $\mathbb{Z}$. At the critical threshold $k=5$, this structure collapses: the triangular pattern fails, and algebraic obstructions -- irreducible quadratic factors with negative discriminant -- emerge. We develop integer forcing, a proof technique exploiting the tension between continuous asymptotics and discrete integrality. As concrete results, we prove that $g((n,n,1)^3) = 2 - (n \mod 2)$ for all $n \geq 3$ -- the first explicit formula for a genuinely three-row Kronecker coefficient -- derive five explicit polynomial formulas for staircase-hook coefficients, and verify Saxl's conjecture for 132 three-row partitions.</p>

            <h2>Generation of concurrence in a generalized central spin model with a three-spin interacting environment</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adithya A. Vasista, Anushka Agrawal, Tanay Nag</p>
            <p>We consider the three-spin Ising model to study the effect of three-spin interacting term on bi-partitie entanglement between adjacent spins. The three-dominated disordered region has tri-partite entanglement causing a vanishingly small concurrence, while it acquires maximum value around the critical points. Considering the above model as an environment, we construct a generalized central spin model where two central spins, initially in an unentangled pure state, are coupled locally to two distinct sites of the environmental spin chain. We study the generation of mixed state entanglement between the central spins when the transverse field of the environment is kept fixed, and suddenly quenched, referring to equilibrium and non-equilibrium dynamics of the central spins, respectively. For the critical environment in the equilibrium, the concurrence shows a dip-revival structure governed by quasi-particle movement. In the non-equilibrium study, we find an initial growth of concurrence followed by a two-stage fall for the inter-phase quench which is governed by dynamic decoherence channels. The central spins are maximally entangled for a quench in the vicinity of a multicritical point, which arises due to three-spin interaction only. The concurrence becomes long-lived for an intra-phase quench, and this sustainability depends on the strength of the three-spin interaction. Therefore, the three-spin interaction indeed helps in generating bi-partite entanglement in the central spins.</p>

            <p>Spin qubits have proven to be a feasible candidate for quantum computation, and some realizations of spin qubits already benefit from advanced device manufacturing in the semiconductor industry. Compared to superconducting platforms, spin qubits can operate at higher temperatures from tens of millikelvin up to a few kelvin. However, recent experiments show a non-trivial and often non-monotonic dependence of the spin qubit frequency on the temperature, featuring a region of decreased sensitivity to temperature fluctuations. In this work, we aim to gain insight into the physics behind such temperature shifts in the low-temperature limit. Investigating the spin qubits' interaction with phonon modes of the host material, we can explain some of the key features of the observed behavior and estimate the temperature sweet spot for the qubit frequency shift.</p>

            <p>The response of a MoRe-based superconducting resonator operating near 5 K to pulsed infrared irradiation is investigated, and the underlying physical mechanisms are analyzed. The device exhibits a pronounced nonlinear response dominated by nonequilibrium quasiparticle dynamics rather than uniform thermal heating. Infrared pulses produce strong distortions of the resonance curve and a transient decrease in the resonance frequency, consistent with increased kinetic inductance caused by quasiparticle generation. The frequency shift scales approximately linearly with absorbed power, whereas the dissipation response saturates at higher powers, indicating the formation of a nonequilibrium steady-state quasiparticle population. These observations demonstrate a transition from a linear pair-breaking regime to a saturated dissipation regime, likely associated with a quasiparticle relaxation bottleneck or partial suppression of the smaller superconducting gap in MoRe. The results highlight the relevance of nonequilibrium processes in MoRe and confirm its potential for microwave kinetic-inductance detector applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elisa Vallini, Laura Foini, Silvia Pappalardi</p>
            <p>The Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) was developed as a framework for understanding how the principles of statistical mechanics emerge in the long-time limit of isolated quantum many-body systems. Since then, ETH has shifted the attention towards the study of matrix elements of physical observables in the energy eigenbasis. In this work, we revisit recent developments leading to the formulation of full ETH, a generalization of the original ETH ansatz that accounts for multi-point correlation functions. Using tools from free probability, we explore the implications of local rotational invariance, a property that emerges from the statistical invariance of observables under random basis transformations induced by small perturbations of the Hamiltonian. This approach allows us to make quantitative predictions and derive an analytical characterization of subleading corrections to matrix-element correlations, thereby refining the ETH ansatz. Moreover, our analysis links the statistical properties of matrix elements under random basis changes to the empirical averages over energy windows that are usually considered when dealing with a single instance of the ensemble. We validate our analytical predictions through comparison with numerical simulations in non-integrable Floquet systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Koustav Roy, Shahroze Shahab, Saurabh Basu</p>
            <p>Engineering dissipative dynamics in open quantum systems is under active focus, especially in topological settings where resilient edge modes are expected to exhibit decay rates distinct from the bulk. In this letter, we propose an efficient dynamical scheme to discern such long-lived excitations. Employing a Floquet-Lindblad framework, we explore how periodic driving reshapes the key features of a paradigmatic topological model, namely a Creutz ladder. Our results bear testimony to a drive-induced unipolar-bipolar transition in the Liouvillian skin effect, which gets dynamically manifested as a chiral-helical damping crossover. Such a transition effectively rescales the bulk localization length, giving rise to a polarization drift that we identify as a new invariant for efficient diagnosis of the nontrivial phases. As the transition becomes more gradual via tuning drive-rescaled parameters, we uncover signatures of a scale-free localization where skin and extended modes co-exist with distinct decay rates. The emergent hierarchy of the decay rates yields two disparate timescales: a chiral wavefront that rapidly empties the bulk followed by a long-lived regime dominated by robust edge modes. Overall, our results provide convincing evidence that periodic driving serves as a powerful handle to manipulate dissipative topological phases and dynamically isolate the boundary modes.</p>

The apparatus comprises four stages, each designed in-house. An oven heated to $\sim 500^\circ$C generates an atomic beam that is collimated by a capillary stack. The beam is sent into a passive, permanent-magnet-based Zeeman slower that reduces the atomic velocity to $30$ m/s. The slow atoms are captured in a magneto-optical trap (MOT) and cooled to $1.0(3)$ mK with a trapping time of $16(2)$ ms. Ground-state atoms in the cold gas are excited to high Rydberg states via resonant excitation through the intermediate $4s4p\, ^1P_1$ and $4s4d\, ^1D_2$ states. The MOT is operated at the center of an electrode stack, which serves to apply continuous and pulsed electric fields and field-ionize the Rydberg atoms for detection. We benchmark our MOT against previous implementations and find its performance consistent with state-of-the-art results in terms of temperature and trapping lifetime. Finally, we demonstrate Rydberg spectroscopy of calcium, confirming the system's suitability for ultracold Rydberg physics experiments.</p>

            <p>Pauli's exclusion principle forces fermions to occupy distinct quantum states, creating a filled region of momentum space at low temperature, the Fermi sea, whose topology governs the system's response to perturbations and the nature of its correlation functions. Recent theory predicts that for non-interacting fermions, the Euler characteristic of a $D$-dimensional Fermi sea -- the topological invariant that describes its shape -- is encoded in its ($D$+1)-point density correlations. Here we experimentally demonstrate this connection in a two-dimensional degenerate gas of neutral $^{6}$Li atoms using single-atom-resolved imaging. By measuring three- and four-point connected density correlations in real space, we directly extract topological invariants of the underlying Fermi sea, including the Euler characteristic. Our results are in remarkable agreement with ideal-gas predictions, despite the presence of sizeable interactions, and establish a new pathway for probing many-body topology through correlation measurements.</p>

            <p>We discuss some entanglement features associated with cubic non-Gaussian perturbations in single-field inflationary scenarios. We adopt standard momentum-space techniques to show how multipartite entanglement arises for inflationary perturbation modes, focusing on the dynamics of the comoving curvature perturbation. In particular, we quantify entanglement generation via the recently proposed Entanglement Distance, which introduces a geometric interpretation of quantum correlations in terms of the Fubini-Study metric. In the continuum limit, we show that the Entanglement Distance arising from displacement transformations is proportional to the total number of excitations in the quantum state for cubic perturbations, thus providing an upper bound on the von Neumann entanglement entropy of any reduced state compatible with such excitations. Within the interaction picture, we further observe that the quantum correlations arising from cubic gravitational interactions are typically much larger than the standard squeezing contribution, in agreement with previous studies focusing on von Neumann entropy generation across the Hubble horizon. We further show how the inflationary parameters affect the total amount of such correlations, highlighting in particular their dependence on the inflationary energy scales and the number of e-foldings during slow-roll.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Private Distributed Matrix Multiplication With Degree Tables</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohamed Nomeir, Alptug Aytekin, Lei Hu, Sennur Ulukus</p>
            <p>In this paper, we explore how quantum resources can be used to increase the rate of private distributed matrix multiplication (PDMM). In PDMM, a user who has two high-dimensional matrices, $A$ and $B$, and lacks the computational capabilities to apply matrix multiplication locally, divides the matrices $A$ and $B$ into $K$ and $L$ sub-blocks, respectively. Then, the user sends them to $N$ servers to apply the required multiplication privately from any $T$ servers. The goal is to reduce the number of servers needed to perform the required matrix multiplication. In the quantum setting, we allow the servers to share an entangled state and respond over quantum channels. Upon receiving the qudits, the user applies measurements to obtain the required multiplication. There are two main regimes in the PDMM literature: The high-privacy regime and the low-privacy regime where $T$ is less than $K$ and $L$. First, in the high-privacy regime, the state-of-the-art classical code is called the gap additive secure polynomial (GASP) code. We define a feasibility requirement in the quantum setting for the GASP code such that the highest performance is achieved when it is satisfied. When it is not satisfied, we address two main concerns. The first is to find a relation between the minimum privacy requirement and the dimensions of the two matrices needed for the feasibility condition to be satisfied. Second, we develop a new family of codes that can work in the quantum setting. Second, since GASP does not work efficiently in the low-privacy regimes compared to cyclic-addition degree tables (CAT) and discretely optimized GASP (DOG), we show that the feasibility condition developed for GASP can be adopted for both CAT and DOG codes as well. In addition, we propose another set of codes that can be used in the low privacy regime in the quantum setting when the feasibility requirement is not satisfied.</p>

            <p>Control of the temporal waveform and Fock state statistics of photons produced during spontaneous emission from single quantum emitters provides a crucial tool in the establishment of hybrid quantum systems, optimal state transfer and interferometric stability of network architectures based on flying qubits. We describe a method to generate photons of any temporal waveform from emitters of any lifetime. Our broadly applicable approach has only two requirements for a candidate qudit: (1) control of the phase-parity and (2) modulation of the amplitude of a field coupling a ground state to an excited manifold which produces a photon during relaxation. We detail how to find optimal excitation pulse shapes, both numerically and experimentally, by employing variational algorithms to feedback on atomic populations. Additionally, we develop Quantum Monte Carlo based tools to determine emission statistics and establish techniques for optimal post-selection to ensure maximum fidelity of photon generation protocols. We situate our work in the context of other prior research on bespoke single photon sources and networking including post-emission pulse shaping, temporal gating and cavity-based methods. In comparison, our free-space process has greater flexibility in producing any waveform, requires less infrastructure and can be readily applied across a wide domain of emitters of any frequency or lifetime. We demonstrate temporal waveform shaping in $^{174}$Yb$^+$ trapped ions. Using feedforward validation of photon waveforms, we estimate an achievable process fidelity of at least $\approx$0.996.</p>

            <h2>Globally optimal control of quantum dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Denys I. Bondar, Llorenc Balada Gaggioli, Georgios Korpas, Jakub Marecek, Jiri Vala, Kurt Jacobs</p>
            <p>Optimization of constrained quantum control problems powers quantum technologies. This task becomes very difficult when these control problems are nonconvex and plagued with dense local extrema. For such problems current optimization methods must be repeated many times to find good solutions, each time requiring many simulations of the system. Here, we present quantum control via polynomial optimization (QCPOP), a method that eliminates this problem by directly finding globally optimal solutions. The resulting increase in speed, which can be a thousandfold or more, makes it possible to solve problems that were previously intractable. This remarkable advance is due to global optimization methods recently developed for polynomial functions. We demonstrate the power of this method by showing that it obtains an optimal solution in a single run for a problem in which local extrema are so dense that gradient methods require thousands of runs to reach a similar fidelity. Since QCPOP is able to find the global optimum for quantum control, we expect that it will not only enhance the utility of quantum control by making it much easier to find the necessary protocols, but also provide a key tool for understanding the precise limits of quantum technologies. Finally, we note that the ability to cast quantum control as polynomial optimization resolves an open question regarding the computability of exact solutions to quantum control problems.</p>

In particular, we show how even non-local constraints can be efficiently implemented without expensive SWAP gates. We show how the presented tools can be used to optimize the total circuit depth and CNOT count of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm in the parity architecture and highlight the advantages of the flexible compilation using various examples. We derive the relation between the developed gate sequences and the traditional approach that uses SWAP gates. The result can be applied to improve the implementation of many other non-local operators.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Roeland ter Hoeven, Benjamin E. Niehoff, Sagar Sudhir Kale, Wolfgang Lechner</p>
            <p>Parity compilation is the challenge of laying out the required constraints for the parity mapping in a local way. We present the first constructive compilation algorithm for the parity architecture using plaquettes for arbitrary higher-order optimization problems. This enables adiabatic protocols, where the plaquette layout can natively be implemented, as well as fully parallelized digital circuits. The algorithm builds a rectangular layout of plaquettes, where in each layer of the rectangle at least one constraint is added. The core idea is that each constraint, consisting of any qubits on the boundary of the rectangle and some new qubits, can be decomposed into plaquettes with a deterministic procedure using ancillas. We show how to pick a valid set of constraints and how this decomposition works. We further give ways to optimize the ancilla count and show how to implement optimization problems with additional constraints.</p>

            <p>We present a fault-tolerant universal quantum computing architecture based on a code concatenation of biased-noise qubits and the parity architecture. The parity architecture can be understood as an LDPC code tailored specifically to obtain any desired logical connectivity from nearest-neighbor physical interactions. The code layout can be dynamically adjusted to algorithmic requirements on-the-fly. This allows for implementations with any desired code distance with a universal set of fault-tolerant gates. In addition to the previously explored tool-sets for concatenated cat codes, our approach features parallelizable interactions between arbitrary sets of qubits by directly addressing the parity qubits in the code. The proposed scheme enables codes with less physical qubit overhead compared to the repetition code with the same code distances, while requiring only weight-3 and weight-4 stabilizers and nearest-neighbor 2D square-lattice connectivity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marit O. E. Steiner, Julen S. Pedernales, Martin B. Plenio</p>
            <p>We explore the potential of levitating solids embedded with non-permanent, optically controllable electron spins, which can be used to hyperpolarize their nuclear spin environment with exceptionally long lifetimes. For example, pentacene-doped naphthalene, which will also serve as our prime example, can achieve bulk polarization exceeding $80\,\%$ at cryogenic temperatures with polarization lifetimes extending over weeks. These materials make a compelling case for applications such as matter-wave interferometry and novel uses of established NMR techniques. In that spirit, we design a multi-spin Stern-Gerlach-type interferometry protocol which, thanks to the homogeneous spin distribution and the absence of a preferential nuclear-spin quantization axis in such materials, avoids many of the limitations associated with solid state crystals hosting electronic spin defects, such as nanodiamonds containing NV centers. We assess the potential of our interferometer to enhance existing bounds on the free parameters of objective collapse models. Beyond matter-wave interferometry, we analyze the prospects for implementing magic angle spinning at frequencies surpassing the current standard in NMR, capitalizing on the exceptional rotational capabilities offered by levitation. Additionally, we outline a novel protocol for measuring spin ensemble polarization via the position of the nanoparticle and conduct an analysis of dominant noise sources, benchmarking the required isolation levels for various applications.</p>

            <h2>Anti-Concentration for the Unitary Haar Measure and Applications to Random Quantum Circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bill Fefferman, Soumik Ghosh, Wei Zhan</p>
            <p>We prove a Carbery-Wright style anti-concentration inequality for the unitary Haar measure, by showing that the probability of a polynomial in the entries of a random unitary falling into an $\varepsilon$ range is at most a polynomial in $\varepsilon$. Using it, we show that the scrambling speed of a random quantum circuit is lower bounded: Namely, every input qubit has an influence that is at least inverse exponential in depth, on any output qubit touched by its lightcone. Our result on scrambling speed works with high probability over the choice of a circuit from an ensemble, as opposed to just working in expectation. As an application, we give the first polynomial-time algorithm for learning log-depth random quantum circuits with Haar random gates up to polynomially small diamond distance, given oracle access to the circuit. Other applications of this new scrambling speed lower bound include: $\bullet$ An optimal $\Omega(\log \varepsilon^{-1})$ depth lower bound for $\varepsilon$-approximate unitary designs on any circuit architecture; $\bullet$ A polynomial-time quantum algorithm that computes the depth of a bounded-depth circuit, given oracle access to the circuit. Our learning and depth-testing algorithms apply to architectures defined over any geometric dimension, and can be generalized to a wide class of architectures with good lightcone properties.</p>

            <p>As quantum processing units (QPUs) scale toward hundreds of qubits, diagnosing noise-induced correlations (crosstalk) becomes critical for reliable quantum computation. In this work, we introduce Zero-Entropy Classical Shadows (ZECS), a diagnostic tool that uses information of a rank-one quantum state tomography (QST) reconstruction from classical shadow (CS) information to make a crosstalk diagnosis. We use ZECS on trapped ion and superconductive QPUs, including ionq_forte (36 qubits), ibm_brisbane (127 qubits), and ibm_fez (156 qubits), using from 1,000 to 6,000 samples. With these samples, we use the ZECS to characterize crosstalk among disjoint qubit subsets across the full hardware. This information is then used to select low-crosstalk qubit subsets on ibm_fez for executing the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) on a 20-qubit problem. Compared to the best qubit selection via Qiskit transpilation, our method improves solution quality by 10% and increases algorithmic coherence by 33%. ZECS offers a scalable and measurement-efficient approach to diagnosing crosstalk in large-scale QPUs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xuanhua Wang, Jie Su, Jin Wang</p>
            <p>Anomalous thermalization, particularly the crossings of temperature trajectories from different initial states termed Mpemba crossings (MPCs), have intrigued scientists for decades. While recent studies in quantum systems suggest that initial conditions play a decisive role in its emergence, they offer limited insight into MPCs in complex, highly nonequilibrium systems. In this study, we investigate temperature dynamics in the strongly coupled, quantum chaotic Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, which is dual to the low-energy dynamics of 2D dilaton gravity. Our findings reveal a dynamically driven nonequilibrium mechanism underlying MPCs during rapid thermalization, with implications for gravitational systems. We explore quench dynamics in SYK systems under three conditions: coupling to a single SYK thermal bath, coupling to two thermal baths at different temperatures, and dissipative SYKs modeled by the Lindblad equation. We find that strong system-bath coupling induces oscillating effective temperatures and trajectory crossings in transient states due to nonequilibrium statistics, phenomena absent in quasi-static thermodynamics and Lindbladian SYKs. These MPCs highlight a unique feature of anomalous thermalization of strongly coupled quantum chaotic systems driven far from equilibrium. Besides, the results also provide qualitative insights into the nonequilibrium thermodynamics of black holes strongly interacting with their environment, such as primordial black holes in the early universe.</p>

            <p>Characterizing the non-classical correlations of a complex many-body system is an important part of quantum technologies. A versatile tool for such a task is one that scales well with the size of the system and which can be both easily computed and measured. In this work we focus on graph states, that are promising platforms for quantum computation, simulation and metrology. We consider four topologies, namely the star graph states with edges, Turán graphs, $r$-ary tree graphs, and square grid cluster states, and provide a method to characterise their quantum content: the many-body Bell correlations, non-separability and entanglement depth for an arbitrary number of qubits. We also relate the strength of these many-body correlations to the usefulness of graph states for quantum sensing. Finally, we characterize many-body entanglement depth in graph states with up to $8$ qubits in $146$ classes non-equivalent under local transformations and graph isomorphisms. The technique presented is simple and does not make any assumptions about the multi-qubit state, so it could find applications wherever precise knowledge of many-body quantum correlations is required.</p>

            <h2>The composition rule for quantum systems is not the only possible one</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marco Erba, Paolo Perinotti</p>
            <p>Quantum theory provides a significant example of two intermingling hallmarks of science: the ability to consistently combine physical systems and study them compositely; and the power to extract predictions in the form of correlations. A striking consequence of this facet is the violation of Bell inequalities, which has been experimentally demonstrated via Bell tests, thus attesting a classical/quantum divide. The prediction of this phenomenon originates as quantum systems are prescribed to combine according to the composition postulate, i.e., the tensor-product rule. This rule has also an operationally salient formulation -- rather than just a purely mathematical one -- given in terms of discriminability of composite states via local measurements. Yet, both the theoretical and the empirical status of such a postulate have been constantly challenged over the decades: is it possible to deduce it from the remaining postulates? Here, this long-standing problem is solved by answering in the negative. A family of operational theories is presented, differing from standard quantum theory solely in their system-composition rule, while, at the same time, being indistinguishable from it via Bell-like or more general correlation experiments. Quantum theory is thus established to embody genuinely more than quantum correlations. As a result, foundational programmes based on single-system principles only, or on mere Bell-like correlations, are operationally incomplete. On the experimental side, ascertaining the independence of postulates is a fundamental step to adjudicate between quantum theory and alternative physical theories: hence, the composition postulate calls for experimental scrutiny independently of the other features of quantum theory.</p>

To implement this framework, we present a prethermal protocol that preserves order-two dynamical symmetry in a spin-ladder model, confirming the predicted relationships between the expectation values of local observables at distinct temporal points in the Floquet cycle, linked by this symmetry.</p>

            <p>Recent advances in quantum computing have brought us closer to realizing the potential of this transformative technology. While significant strides have been made in quantum error correction, many challenges persist, particularly in the realm of noise and scalability. Analogue quantum computing schemes, such as Analogue Hamiltonian Simulation and Quantum Annealing, offer a promising approach to address these limitations. By operating at a higher level of abstraction, these schemes can simplify the development of large-scale quantum algorithms. To fully harness the power of quantum computers, they must be seamlessly integrated with traditional high-performance computing (HPC) systems. While substantial research has focused on the integration of circuit-based quantum computers with HPC, the integration of analogue quantum computers remains relatively unexplored. This paper aims to bridge this gap by contributing in the following way: Comprehensive Survey: We conduct a comprehensive survey of existing quantum software tools with analogue capabilities. Readiness Assessment: We introduce a classification and rating system to assess the readiness of these tools for HPC integration. Gap Identification and Recommendations: We identify critical gaps in the landscape of analogue quantum programming models and propose actionable recommendations for future research and development.</p>

            <h2>Analytical results for laser models producing a beam with sub-Poissonian photon statistics and coherence scaling as the Heisenberg limit</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lucas A. Ostrowski, Travis J. Baker, Dominic W. Berry, Howard M. Wiseman</p>
            <p>Recent advances in laser theory have demonstrated that a quantum enhancement is possible for the production of coherence $\mathfrak{C}$ by a continuous-wave laser device. Curiously, natural families of laser models that achieve Heisenberg-limited scaling for coherence produce the most coherence when the beam exhibits sub-Poissonian photon statistics. In this work, we provide an analytical treatment of those novel families of laser models by specializing to a parameter regime that permits a linearization. We characterize the dynamics of each laser system, and find that some of the intuitions from standard laser theory may be applied here. Specifically, the intracavity number dynamics are well-described as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, while the intracavity phase dynamics are well-described in terms of a physically realizable ensemble of pure states, which evolve according to pure phase diffusion. Unlike a standard laser, however, we find that the pure states comprising the ensemble in the Heisenberg-limited lasers are substantially phase squeezed. From our dynamical analysis, we deduce various quantities of the beam for each laser family, including the first- and second-order Glauber coherence functions, intensity noise spectrum, Mandel-Q parameter and coherence $\mathfrak{C}$. In addition, inspired from these phase diffusion dynamics, we derive an upper bound on laser coherence $\mathfrak{C} \lesssim 1.1156 \mu^4$ -- which is tighter by a factor of $3/8$ when compared to that derived in [Baker et al., Nat. Phys. 17 179 (2021)] -- by making one of the assumptions of that paper slightly stronger.</p>

            <p>Conference key agreement aims to establish shared, private randomness among many separated parties in a network. Device-independent conference key agreement (DICKA) is a variant in which the source and the measurement devices used by each party need not be trusted. So far, DICKA protocols largely fall into two categories: those that rely on violating a joint Bell inequality using genuinely multi-partite entangled states, and those that concatenate many bipartite protocols. The question of whether a hybrid protocol exists, where a multi-partite Bell inequality can be violated using only bipartite entanglement, was asked by Grasselli et al. in [Quantum 7, 980, (2023)]. We answer this question affirmatively, by constructing an asymptotically secure DICKA protocol achieving the same rate as the concatenation of bipartite device-independent quantum key distribution, yet relying on a single joint Bell violation. Our results prompt further discussion on the benefits of multi-partite entanglement for DICKA over its bipartite alternative, and we give an overview of different arguments for near-term devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ze-Min Huang, Sebastian Diehl, Xiao-Qi Sun</p>
            <p>In open quantum systems, the interaction of the system with its environment gives rise to two types of symmetry: a strong one, where the system's symmetry charge is conserved exactly, and a weak one, where the system can exchange symmetry charge with the environment but still preserve symmetry at the ensemble level. While generic open quantum systems feature weak symmetries only, the symmetry protected topological response for bosonic/spin systems has only been considered in the stricter setup with additional strong symmetries. Here, we address the generic case and demonstrate that weak symmetries alone can protect topological responses that distinguish different phases of matter. For bosonic systems, focusing on one-dimensional mixed states described by locally purifiable density operators, we propose a quantized response characterizing qualitatively distinct phases. It is detectable via the decay behavior of different string order parameters. We illustrate our general results through a noisy Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki model. In particular, we show that the coupling to the environment can induce a phase transition to a state protected by weak symmetries, without a pure-state or strong-symmetry analog.</p>

            <p>Quantum Transformers integrate the representational power of classical Transformers with the computational advantages of quantum computing. Since 2022, research in this area has rapidly expanded, giving rise to diverse technical paradigms and early applications. To address the growing need for consolidation, this paper presents the first comprehensive, systematic, and in-depth survey of quantum Transformer models. First, we delineate the research scope, focusing on improving Transformer parts with quantum methods, and introduce foundational concepts in classical Transformers and quantum machine learning. Then we organize existing studies into two main paradigms: PQC-based and QLA-based, with PQC-based paradigm further divided into QKV-only Quantum Mapping, Quantum Pairwise Attention, Quantum Holistic Attention. and Quantum-Assisted Optimization, analyzing their core mechanisms and architectural traits. We also summarize empirical results that demonstrate preliminary quantum advantages, especially on small-scale tasks or resource-constrained settings. Following this, we examine key technical challenges, such as complexity-resource trade-offs, scalability and generalization limitations, and trainability issues including barren plateaus, and provide potential solutions, including quantumizing classical transformer variants with lower complexity, hybrid designs, and improved optimization strategies. Finally, we propose several promising future directions, e.g., scaling quantum modules into large architectures, applying quantum Transformers to domains with inherently quantum data (e.g., physics, chemistry), and developing theory-driven designs grounded in quantum information science. This survey will help researchers and practitioners quickly grasp the overall landscape of current quantum Transformer research and promote future developments in this emerging field.</p>

            <p>Superconducting qubits in today's quantum processing units are typically fabricated with angle-evaporated aluminum--aluminum-oxide--aluminum Josephson junctions. However, there is an urgent need to overcome the limited reproducibility of this approach when scaling up the number of qubits and junctions. Fabrication methods based on subtractive patterning of superconductor--insulator--superconductor trilayers, used for more classical large-scale Josephson junction circuits, could provide the solution but they in turn often suffer from lossy dielectrics incompatible with high qubit coherence. In this work, we utilize native aluminum oxide as a sidewall passivation layer for junctions based on aluminum--aluminum-oxide--niobium trilayers, and use such junctions in qubits. We design the fabrication process such that the few-nanometer-thin native oxide is not exposed to oxide removal steps that could increase its defect density or hinder its ability to prevent shorting between the leads of the junction. With these junctions, we design and fabricate transmon-like qubits and measure time-averaged coherence times up to 30 $\mu$s at a qubit frequency of 5 GHz, corresponding to a qubit quality factor of one million. Our process uses subtractive patterning and optical lithography on wafer scale, enabling high throughput in patterning. This approach provides a scalable path toward fabrication of superconducting qubits on industry-standard platforms.</p>

            <p>The discrepancy between quantum distinguishability in Hilbert space and classical distinguishability in probability space is expressed by the gap between the quantum and classical Fisher information matrices (QFIM and CFIM, respectively). This intrinsic quantum obstruction is generally not saturable and plays a central role in both fundamental insights and practical applications in modern quantum physics. Here, we develop a geometrical framework for this gap by introducing the notion of semi-classical geometric tensor (SCGT). We relate this quantity to the quantum geometric tensor (QGT), whose real part equals the QFIM. We prove the matrix inequality between QGT and SCGT, which sharpens the standard inequality between QFIM and CFIM and provides novel multiparameter information bounds: the real part of the SCGT reproduces the CFIM plus an additional nonnegative contribution capturing quantum obstruction. This further motivates a natural extension of the Berry phase to the semi-classical setting.</p>

            <p>To find practical application as photon sources for entangled optical resource states or as spin-photon interfaces in entangled networks, semiconductor emitters must produce indistinguishable photons with high efficiency and spectral stability. Nanophotonic cavity integration increases efficiency and bandwidth, but it also introduces environmental charge instability and spectral diffusion. Among various candidates, silicon colour centres have emerged as compelling platforms for integrated-emitter quantum technologies. Here we investigate the dynamics of spectral wandering in nanophotonics-coupled, individual silicon T centres using spectral correlation measurements. We observe that spectral fluctuations are driven predominantly by the near-infrared excitation laser, consistent with a power-dependent Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, and show that the spectrum is stable for up to 1.5 ms in the dark. We demonstrate a 35x narrowing of the emitter linewidth to 110 MHz using a resonance-check scheme and discuss the advantage for pairwise entanglement rates and optical resource state generators. Finally, we report laser-induced spin-mixing in the excited state and discuss potential mechanisms common to both phenomena. These effects must be considered in calibrating T centre devices for high-performance entanglement generation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhen Li, Xulong Wang, Rundong Cai, Kenji Shimomura, Zhesen Yang, Masatoshi Sato, Guancong Ma</p>
            <p>Exceptional points (EPs) are non-Hermitian singularities associated with the coalescence of individual eigenvectors accompanied by the degeneracy of their complex energies. Here, we report the discovery of a generalization to the concept of EP called exceptional deficiency (ED), which features the complete coalescence of two eigenspaces with identical but arbitrarily large dimensions and the coincidence of entire spectral continua. The characteristics of the ED are studied using one-way coupled Hermitian and non-Hermitian lattices. The ED can induce an anomalous absence and presence of non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) that transcends the topological bulk-edge correspondence of NHSE, resulting in unexpected synergistic skin-propagative dynamics. The conditions of the ED are also explored for unprecedented control of localization and propagation in non-Hermitian systems. These effects are experimentally observed using active mechanical lattices. The discovery of ED opens multiple new frontiers in non-Hermitian physics and can potentially resolve long-standing challenges in related applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mahima Yadav, Devvrat Tiwari, Subhashish Banerjee</p>
            <p>We investigate the spin-boson model's dynamical and thermodynamic features in the weak coupling regime using the weak coupling spin-boson (WCSB) and phase covariant (PC) master equations. Both unital (pure dephasing) and non-unital (dissipative) quantum channels are considered. On the dynamical side, we explore key quantum features including non-Markovianity, quantum speed limit, quantum coherence, and the system's steady-state behavior. Notably, the measures of non-Markovianity exhibit different behavior under WCSB and PC dynamics. From the quantum thermodynamic perspective, we conceptualize the spin-boson system as a quantum battery and analyze its performance through metrics such as energy, ergotropy, anti-ergotropy, and battery capacity. We further examine the roles of pure dephasing and dissipative processes in shaping the battery's performance. Our findings demonstrate the spin-boson model's versatility as a platform for efficient energy storage and transfer in quantum thermodynamic devices.</p>

            <h2>Field emission tunnelling as a window onto fundamental issues in quantum mechanics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Richard G. Forbes</p>
            <p>Field electron emission (FE) and electrostatic field ionization (ESFI) are quantum-mechanical tunnelling processes that provide basic theory for important technologies. However, the basic theories of FE and ESF1 are not yet completely understood. This paper attempts to identify related fundamental quantum mechanical issues, problems and relevances. The following topics have been identified as deserving closer investigation or discussion. (a) The implication that if a "real electron" cannot have negative kinetic energy, then this necessarily implies that a "real electron" is a distributed object rather than a point object. (b) The implication that the language we use to discuss quantum mechanics needs to be changed in order to avoid referring to the "position of a (point) electron". (c) The idea that "quantum mathematics" (i.e., the mathematics of quantum mechanics) has different utilisations, namely the "matter distribution" and "pathway choice" utilisations, with "measurement" being observed pathway choice. (d) Difficulties with the present formulations of the uncertainty principle and wave-particle duality. (e) Fundamental difficulties in the exact calculation of exchange-and-correlation effects in both FE and ESFI theory. (f) Conceptual problems associated with "seeing electrons" in the field electron (emission) microscope. (g) Field emission tunnelling and the arrow of time. (h) The choice between tunnelling-integral and overlap-integral formulations of tunnelling theory, and the apparent incompleteness of both types of formulation.</p>

            <h2>A mathematical justification to apply the secular approximation to the Redfield equation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Niklas J. Jung, Francesco Rosati, Gabriel L. Rath, Frank K. Wilhelm, Peter K. Schuhmacher</p>
            <p>Quantum master equations are widely used to describe the dynamics of open quantum systems. All these different master equations rely on specific approximations that may or may not be justified. Starting from a microscopic model, applying the standard Born and Markov approximations results in the Redfield equation that does not guarantee to preserve positivity. The latter is typically achieved by additionally applying the secular approximation resulting in a quantum master equation in Lindblad form. There are other ways to obtain an equation in Lindblad form, one of which is the recently proposed Universal Lindblad Equation. It has been shown that it is in the same equivalence class of approximations as the Redfield master equation although avoiding the heuristic secular approximation [arXiv:2004.01469]. In this work, we prove that the solutions of the master equation obtained by applying the secular approximation are also obtained by an approximation of the same order as the one performed to obtain the Redfield equation. We hereby provide a mathematical justification for the secular approximation. We show that the result of applying the secular approximation is obtained naturally by applying a self-consistency argument. This shows that the resulting master equation is also in the same equivalence class of approximations as the Redfield master equation and the Universal Lindblad Equation. We furthermore compare it to the Universal Lindblad Equation numerically and show numerical evidence that the master equation obtained through the secular approximation yields more accurate solutions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qi-Hong Cai, Xue-Hao Yu, Ma-Cheng Yang, Ao-Xiang Liu, Cong-Feng Qiao</p>
            <p>This study investigates the emergence of macroscopic classical behavior from quantum foundations via the entropic Leggett--Garg inequality. We introduce a geometric framework for deriving entropic Leggett--Garg inequalities with higher-order temporal correlations and demonstrate their advantages over conventional formulations. Numerical analyses show that entropic Leggett--Garg inequalities offer a robust and complementary criterion to standard approaches, providing a transparent information theoretic interpretation that facilitates the characterization of coherent quantum processes. By applying the WKB approximation, we prove that violations for maximally mixed states remain bounded by a constant in the macroscopic limit, indicating that macrorealism dominates in generic parameter regimes. We further explain previously reported maximal violations at specific parameter regimes as a consequence of the breakdown of the WKB approximation. Our findings indicate that quantum and classical descriptions remain macroscopically incompatible, while violations persist only in fine-tuned regimes, clarifying the conditions for detecting macroscopic quantum phenomena.</p>

            <h2>Exponential distillation of dominant eigenproperties</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bence Bakó, Tenzan Araki, Bálint Koczor</p>
            <p>Estimating observable expectation values in eigenstates of quantum systems has a broad range of applications and is an area where early fault-tolerant quantum computers may provide practical quantum advantage. We develop a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm that enables the estimation of an arbitrary observable expectation value in an eigenstate, given an initial state is supplied that has dominant overlap with the targeted eigenstate -- but may overlap with any other eigenstates. Our approach builds on, and is conceptually similar to purification-based error mitigation techniques; however, it achieves exponential suppression of algorithmic errors using only a single copy of the quantum state. The key innovation is that random time evolution is applied in the quantum computer to create an average mixed quantum state, which is then virtually purified with exponential efficacy. We prove rigorous performance guarantees and conclude that the complexity of our approach depends directly on the energy gap in the problem Hamiltonian and remarkably, can be compared to phase estimation combined with amplitude estimation in terms of its scaling with respect to a target precision. We demonstrate in a broad range of numerical simulations the applicability of our framework in near-term and early fault-tolerant settings. Furthermore, we demonstrate in a 100-qubit example that direct classical simulation of our approach enables the prediction of ground and excited state properties of quantum systems using tensor network techniques, which we recognize as a quantum-inspired classical approach.</p>

            <h2>Scaling of Superradiant Peak Emission in Spatially Extended Emitter Arrays</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raphael Holzinger, Susanne F. Yelin</p>
            <p>In quantum optics, superradiance is a phenomenon in which a system of $N$ fully excited quantum emitters radiate intense flashes of light during collective decay. However, computing its peak intensity exactly for many spatially separated emitters remains challenging due to the exponential growth of the underlying Hilbert space with system size $N$. Based on third-order cumulant expansion methods, we present general scaling laws for the expononent of the peak emission rate as a function of the emitter number in free-space emitter arrays and arrays coupled to one-dimensional waveguide reservoirs. We find, that for 1D chains in free-space the peak emission rate scales linearly with $N$, while for 2D and 3D arrays with finite emitter spacing it scales superlinearly but sub-quadratically. For emitter chains coupled to waveguide reservoirs we find that the peak emission rate scales quadratically with $N$.</p>

            <h2>Purely quantum memory in closed systems observed via imperfect measurements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jorge Tabanera-Bravo, Aljaž Godec</p>
            <p>The detection and quantification of non-Markovianity, a.k.a. memory, in quantum systems is a central problem in the theory of open quantum systems. There memory is as a result of the interaction between the system and its environment. Little is known, however, about memory effects induced by imperfect measurements on closed systems, where an entanglement with the environment is not possible. We investigate the emergence and characteristics of memory in closed systems observed via imperfect stroboscopic quantum measurements yielding coarse-grained outcomes. We consider ideal and two kinds of imperfect measurements: von Neumann measurements--the analogue of classical lumping--which destroy any coherence in the system, and genuinely quantum-lumping Lüders measurements preserving certain quantum correlations. Whereas the conditions for Markov dynamics under von Neumann lumping are the same as for classical dynamics, quantum-lumping requires stronger conditions, i.e. the absence of any detectable coherence. We introduce the concept of purely quantum memory having no classical counterpart. We illustrate our results with a quantum walk on a lattice and discuss their implications for dissipative dynamics and decoherence effects induced by more realistic measurements.</p>

            <h2>Certified randomness from quantum speed limits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Caroline L. Jones, Albert Aloy, Gerard Higgins, Markus P. Mueller</p>
            <p>Quantum speed limits are usually regarded as fundamental restrictions, constraining the amount of computation that can be achieved within some given time and energy. Complementary to this intuition, here we show that these limitations are also of operational value: they enable the secure generation of certified randomness. We consider a prepare-and-measure scenario with some (experimentally determined or promised) upper bound on the energy uncertainty of the average prepared quantum state, but without any further assumptions on the devices, Hilbert space or Hamiltonian. Given that we can freely choose the time at which to apply the untrusted preparation procedure, we show that this scenario admits the generation of randomness that is secure against adversaries with additional classical information. We show how to determine the amount of certified randomness given the observed correlations, discuss how interactions with the environment are taken into account, and sketch a conceivable experimental implementation. In particular, we show that single-mode coherent states admit this kind of certification of non-zero randomness in some parameter regimes, reinforcing existing demonstrations of nonclassicality in the simple harmonic oscillator. Our results extend earlier efforts to devise semi-device-independent protocols grounded in reasonable physical assumptions, and they contribute to the understanding of time-energy uncertainty relations via their operational consequences.</p>

            <h2>Einstein causality of quantum measurements in the Tomonaga-Schwinger picture</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samuel Fedida</p>
            <p>We investigate a generalisation to Lüders' rule à la Aharonov-Albert in those globally hyperbolic spacetimes which allow unitarily equivalent Hilbert spaces to be defined along Cauchy hypersurfaces, thus relying on the existence of an interaction picture à la Tomonaga-Schwinger. We show that under this rule and under the additional assumptions of the integrability and unitarity of the Tomonaga-Schwinger dynamics and the foliation-independence of rays on acausal Cauchy hypersurfaces, selective quantum measurements satisfy a state-independent anyonic commutation relation over spacelike-separated precompact regions. We highlight that this propagates to positive operator-valued measures, where the commutation is necessarily bosonic. In the instantaneous-measurement idealisation, this implies quantum no-signalling for non-selective measurements. We then examine Sorkin's impossible measurements and show that immediate contradictions can be averted as long as collapse-inducing measurements are irreversible. These results reaffirm the consistency of the Tomonaga-Schwinger picture of relativistic quantum theory, for which unitarity, integrability and foliation-independence of the states exclude superluminal signalling despite the ``instantaneity" of a side-cone measurement collapse rule. We finish by discussing the possibility of extending such results beyond the interaction picture.</p>

            <h2>Quantum thermal rectification via state-dependent two-photon dissipation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Tahir Naseem</p>
            <p>Controlling heat flow at the quantum level is essential for the development of next-generation thermal devices. We investigate thermal rectification in a quantum harmonic oscillator coupled to two thermal baths via both single-photon (linear) and two-photon (nonlinear) exchange processes. At low temperatures, rectification arises from a state-dependent suppression of two-photon emission: when the cold bath dominates, it drives the oscillator into low-occupancy states, inhibiting emission and creating a thermal bottleneck. At higher temperatures, rectification is governed by the asymmetric scaling of higher-order moments associated with two-photon absorption and emission. We systematically explore various bath coupling configurations and identify the conditions under which nonlinear dissipation leads to directional heat flow. Furthermore, we propose an implementation scheme based on coupling an auxiliary two-level system to the oscillator, enabling effective two-photon dissipation. These results contribute to the understanding of quantum heat transport in the presence of nonlinear dissipation and may support future efforts in nanoscale thermal rectification design.</p>

            <p>We revisit quantum tomography in an informationally incomplete scenario and propose improved state reconstruction methods using deep neural networks. In the first approach, the trained network predicts an optimal linear or quadratic reconstructor with coefficients depending only on the collection of (already taken) measurement operators. This effectively refines the undercomplete tomographic reconstructor based on pseudoinverse operation. The second, based on an LSTM recurrent network performs state reconstruction sequentially. It can also optimize the measurement sequence, which suggests a no-free-lunch theorem for tomography: by narrowing the state space, we gain the possibility of more efficient tomography by learning the optimal sequence of measurements. Numerical experiments for a 2-qubit system show that both methods outperform standard maximum likelihood estimation and also scale to larger 3- and 4-qubit systems. Our results demonstrate that neural networks can effectively learn the underlying geometry of multi-qubit states using this for their reconstruction.</p>

            <p>We study parametric oscillations of two capacitively coupled Kerr parametric oscillators (KPOs) with frequency-chirped two- and one-photon drives. The two-KPO system adiabatically evolves from the initial vacuum state to an oscillation state corresponding to a solution state in quantum-annealing applications. Frequency chirping dynamically changes the detuning between resonance and oscillation frequencies during parametric modulation and reduces unwanted population transfer to excited states caused by pure dephasing and photon loss. We observe that frequency chirping increases the success probability to obtain the solution state and that simulations taking into account pure dephasing reproduce experiments with and without frequency chirping. This study demonstrates the effectiveness and applicability of frequency chirping to a KPO-based quantum annealer.</p>

            <p>The Bennett-Brassard 1984 protocol (BB84 protocol) is one of the simplest protocols for implementing quantum key distribution (QKD). In the protocol, the sender and the receiver iteratively choose one of two complementary measurement bases. Regarding the basis choice by the receiver, a passive setup has been adopted in a number of its implementations including satellite QKD and time-bin encoding one. However, conventional theoretical techniques to prove the security of BB84 protocol are not applicable if the receiver chooses his measurement basis passively, rather than actively, with a biased probability, followed by the measurement with threshold detectors. Here we present a fully analytical security proof against coherent attacks for such a decoy-state BB84 protocol with receiver's passive basis choice and measurement with threshold detectors. The numerical simulations under practical situations show that the difference in secure key rate between the active and the passive implementations of the protocol is negligible except for long communication distances.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Leonardo Zambrano, Sergi Ramos-Calderer, Richard Kueng</p>
            <p>We present a two-step protocol for quantum measurement tomography that is light on classical co-processing cost and still achieves optimal sample complexity in the system dimension. Given measurement data from a known probe state ensemble, we first apply least-squares estimation to produce an unconstrained approximation of the POVM, and then project this estimate onto the set of valid quantum measurements. For a POVM with $L$ outcomes acting on a $d$-dimensional system, we show that the protocol requires $\mathcal{O}(d^3 L \ln(d)/\epsilon^2)$ samples to achieve error $\epsilon$ in worst-case distance, and $\mathcal{O}(d^2 L^2 \ln(dL)/\epsilon^2)$ samples in average-case distance. We further establish two almost matching sample complexity lower bounds of $\Omega(d^3/\epsilon^2)$ and $\Omega(d^2 L/\epsilon^2)$ for any non-adaptive, single-copy POVM tomography protocol. Hence, our projected least squares POVM tomography is sample-optimal in dimension $d$ up to logarithmic factors. Our method admits an analytic form when using global or local 2-designs as probe ensembles and enables rigorous non-asymptotic error guarantees. Finally, we also complement our findings with empirical performance studies carried out on a noisy superconducting quantum computer with flux-tunable transmon qubits.</p>

            <p>We present a quantum optimal control protocol to generate highly spin-squeezed states in Rydberg atom arrays coupled via Ising-type van der Waals interactions. Using gradient-based optimization techniques, we construct time-dependent pulse sequences that steer an initial product state toward highly entangled, spin-squeezed states with predefined magnetization and squeezing axes. We focus on the Wineland parameter $\xi_W^2$ to measure spin squeezing, and our approach achieves near-optimal spin squeezing in one-dimensional ring arrays of up to $N=8$ spins, significantly outperforming conventional quench dynamics for all system sizes studied. Remarkably, optimized pulse sequences can be directly scaled to larger arrays without additional optimization, achieving a squeezing parameter as low as $\xi_W^2 = 0.227$ in systems containing $N=50$ spins. This work demonstrates the potential of quantum optimal control methods for preparing highly spin-squeezed states, opening pathways to enhanced quantum metrology.</p>

            <p>In purely coherent transport on finite networks, destructive interference can significantly suppress transfer probabilities, which can only reach high values through careful fine-tuning of the evolution time or tailored initial-state preparations. We address this issue by investigating excitation transfer on a ring, modeling it as a locally monitored continuous-time chiral quantum walk. Chirality, introduced through time-reversal symmetry breaking, imparts a directional bias to the coherent dynamics and can lift dark states. Local monitoring, implemented via stroboscopic projective measurements at the target site, provides a practical detection protocol without requiring fine-tuning of the evolution time. By analyzing the interplay between chirality and measurement frequency, we identify optimal conditions for maximizing the asymptotic detection probability. The optimization of this transfer protocol relies on the spectral properties of the Perron-Frobenius operator, which capture the asymptotic non-unitary dynamics, and on the analysis of dark states. Our approach offers a general framework for enhancing quantum transport in monitored systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nengkun Yu, Jens Palsberg, Thomas Reps</p>
            <p>Reasoning about quantum programs remains a fundamental challenge, regardless of the programming model or computational paradigm. Despite extensive research, existing verification techniques are insufficient -- even for quantum circuits, a deliberately restricted model that lacks classical control, but still underpins many current quantum algorithms. Many existing formal methods require exponential time and space to represent and manipulate (representations of) assertions and judgments, making them impractical for quantum circuits with many qubits. This paper presents a logic for reasoning in such settings, called SAQR-QC. The logic supports {S}calable but {A}pproximate {Q}uantitative {R}easoning about {Q}uantum {C}ircuits, whence the name. SAQR-QC has three characteristics: (i) some (deliberate) loss of precision is built into it; (ii) it has a mechanism to help the accumulated loss of precision during a sequence of reasoning steps remain small; and (iii) most importantly, to make reasoning scalable, every reasoning step is local -- i.e., it involves just a small number of qubits. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SAQR-QC via two case studies: the verification of GHZ circuits involving non-Clifford gates, and the analysis of quantum phase estimation -- a core subroutine in Shor's factoring algorithm.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Techapon Kampu, Salvatore De Vincenzo</p>
            <p>Real solutions of the 1D Klein-Fock-Gordon (KFG) equation automatically cancel out the usual two-vector current density; consequently, the respective continuity equation is trivially satisfied, and a globally conserved quantity cannot be obtained. Additionally, distinguishing between impermeable and permeable boundary conditions (BCs) at a given point is not possible. We address these first-quantized conflicts by using the simplest nontrivial local observables, i.e., an energy density and an energy current density, which allows us to characterize a strictly neutral 1D KFG particle, i.e., a 1D KFG-Majorana (KFGM) particle, when it is confined to an interval and when it is restricted, e.g., in an interval with transparent walls. All the BCs for this system are extracted from the pseudo self-adjointness of the Feshbach-Villars (FV) Hamiltonian plus two Majorana conditions. We show that these energy densities can satisfy a continuity equation; in addition, they lead to a conserved quantity for all available impermeable and permeable BCs. Moreover, the energy current density can characterize all available BCs. Despite this, the two-vector constructed with these two densities is not Lorentz covariant. In contrast, the commonly used energy current density -- a component of the energy-momentum tensor of the system -- cannot characterize all the BCs. Additionally, this quantity and its respective energy density -- another component of the energy-momentum tensor -- may not lead to a conserved quantity. However, we obtain the conditions that must be satisfied by the BCs; thus, the abovementioned densities and those commonly used are equally satisfactory. For example, this occurs only for four impermeable BCs and a one-parameter set of permeable BCs. Our results highlight the important role played by the BCs when they are imposed on a system in which particles occupy a finite region.</p>

            <h2>Numerical implementation of the partial secular approximation and unified master equation in structured open quantum systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Antti Vaaranta, Marco Cattaneo</p>
            <p>The Markovian dynamics of open quantum systems is typically described through Lindblad equations, which are derived from the Redfield equation via the full secular approximation. The latter neglects the rotating terms in the master equation corresponding to pairs of jump operators with different Bohr frequencies. However, for many physical systems this approximation breaks down, and thus a more accurate treatment of the slowly rotating terms is required. Indeed, more precise physical results can be obtained by performing the partial secular approximation, which takes into account the relevant time scale associated with each pair of jump operators and compares it with the time scale arising from the system-environment coupling. In this work, we introduce a general code for performing the partial secular approximation in the Redfield equation for structured open quantum systems. The code can be applied to a generic Hamiltonian of any multipartite system coupled to bosonic baths. Moreover, it can also reproduce the unified master equation, which captures the same physical behavior as the Redfield equation under the partial secular approximation, but is mathematically guaranteed to generate a completely positive dynamical map. Finally, the code can compute both the local and global version of the master equation for the same physical problem. We illustrate the code by studying the steady-state heat flow in a structured open quantum system composed of two superconducting qubits, each coupled to a bosonic mode, which in turn interacts with a thermal bath. The results in this work can be employed for the numerical study of a wide range of complex open quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>Time Symmetry, Retrocausality, and Emergent Collapse: The Tlalpan Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alejandro Frank</p>
            <p>Quantum mechanics has remained conceptually puzzling since its inception. While its mathematical formalism provides predictions of unparalleled accuracy, the interpretative framework underpinning measurement and collapse has never been fully clarified. The Tlalpan Interpretation (QTI) proposes that the wavefunction collapse is not a primitive, axiomatic rule but an emergent phenomenon, a spontaneous breaking of time symmetry triggered by amplification and record creation. The novelty of QTI lies in its embedding of collapse within the conceptual language of critical phenomena in statistical physics. The theory introduces measurable parameters (the amplification fraction, the record asymmetry, and the retrocausal coherence time) that serve as order parameters describing the quantum-classical transition. Collapse is thus characterized not as a mysterious fiat but as a phase transition, with thresholds and scaling laws analogous to magnetization in ferromagnets. This perspective allows the interpretation to retain microscopic time symmetry and spatial locality, while attributing quantum correlations and Bell-type violations to retrocausal boundary constraints rather than instantaneous action at a distance. Collapse corresponds to the granularization of trajectories: the conversion of smooth, time-symmetric quantum evolution into discrete, irreversible records. Most importantly, QTI is testable. It predicts: (1) sharp threshold-like disappearance of interference when amplification exceeds a critical value, (2) anomalously fast decay of reversibility in chaotic optical cavities compared with regular ones, and (3) qualitatively new interference fringes in a time-symmetric generalization of Moshinsky's diffraction in time. If confirmed, these predictions would place collapse squarely in the realm of thermodynamic processes, removing the last "mystical" postulate from quantum theory.</p>

In the case of imperfections without memory effects, it can be combined with proofs addressing source imperfections in a modular manner. We apply our framework to compute key rates for the decoy-state BB84 protocol, when the beam splitting ratio, the detection efficiency, and dark counts of the detectors are only known to be within some ranges. We also compute key rates in the presence of memory effects in the detectors.

            <h2>A simple method for seniority-zero quantum state preparation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michal Krompiec, Josh J. M. Kirsopp, Antonio Márquez Romero, Vicente Perez Soloviev</p>
            <p>Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE), the quantum algorithm for estimating eigenvalues of a given Hermitian matrix and preparing its eigenvectors, is considered the most promising approach to finding the ground states and their energies of electronic systems using a quantum computer. It requires, however, to be warm--started from an initial state with sufficiently high overlap with the ground state. For strongly-correlated states, where QPE is expected to have advantage over classical methods, preparation of such initial states requires deep quantum circuits and/or expensive hybrid quantum-classical optimization. It is well-known that orbital-optimized paired Coupled Cluster Doubles (oo-pCCD) method can describe the static correlation features of many strongly correlated singlet states. We show that pCCD and its unitary counterpart, UpCCD, become equivalent in the limit of small amplitudes or if the number of large amplitudes is below 5. We demonstrate that substituting leading oo-pCCD amplitudes into the UpCCD Ansatz allows to prepare high-fidelity singlet states for models of multiple-bond dissociation in ethene, ethyne and dinitrogen, as well as for 1D Hubbard models at half-filling, with very shallow circuits. We envisage our method to be of general use for approximate preparation of singlet states for Quantum Phase Estimation and related algorithms.</p>

            <h2>Towards Compact Wavefunctions from Quantum-Selected Configuration Interaction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tim Weaving, Angus Mingare, Alexis Ralli, Peter V. Coveney</p>
            <p>A recent direction in quantum computing for molecular electronic structure sees the use of quantum devices as configuration sampling machines integrated within high-performance computing (HPC) platforms. This appeals to the strengths of both the quantum and classical hardware; where state-sampling is classically hard, the quantum computer can provide computational advantage in the selection of high quality configuration subspaces, while the final molecular energies are evaluated by solving an interaction matrix on HPC and is therefore not corrupted by hardware noise. In this work, we present an algorithm that leverages stochastic Hamiltonian time evolution in Quantum-Selected Configuration Interaction (QSCI), with multireference perturbation theory capturing missed correlations outside the configuration subspace. The approach is validated through a hardware demonstration utilising 42 qubits of an IQM superconducting device to calculate the potential energy curve of the inorganic silane molecule, SiH4 using a 6-31G atomic orbital basis set, under a stretching of the Si-H bond length. We assess the resulting wavefunctions for compactness, a point on which QSCI has previously been criticised. At large separations, where static correlation dominates, we find a configuration space more than 200 times smaller than that obtained from a conventional SCI selection criterion yields comparable energies. We also compare against the best-in-class Heatbath Configuration Interaction algorithm and observe similar wavefunction compactness at convergence. This result is achieved with a configuration sampling scheme that uses the experimental orbital occupancies of a time-evolved quantum state to predict likely single and double excitations away from existing configurations to bias the subspace expansion procedure.</p>

            <h2>Quantization of the electromagnetic fields from single atomic or molecular radiators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Valerica Raicu</p>
            <p>A framework is introduced for expressing electromagnetic (EM) potentials and fields of single atomic or molecular emitters modeled as oscillating dipoles, which follows a recently proposed method for solving inhomogeneous wave equations for arbitrary, time-dependent distributions of charge. This framework is first used to evaluate the physical implications of simplifying assumptions made in the standard approach to quantization of the EM fields and the impact of such assumptions on the results of energy and momentum quantization. Then, the exact expressions for the EM potentials and fields, in relation to the oscillating (transition) dipoles properties, afforded by the present framework are used to quantize electromagnetic fields from single emitters and restore the agreement with the well-known classical dipole radiation pattern, while maintaining the quantum mechanical description of electromagnetic radiation in terms of the probability distribution of quantum modes. Contributions of the present analysis to the understanding of photon emission from excited atoms or molecules stimulated by light or vacuum field fluctuations are highlighted, and possible experimental tests and practical applications are proposed.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kentaro Hino, Damyan S. Frantzov, Yuki Kurashige, Lewis M. Antill</p>
            <p>Radical pairs (also known as spin qubit pairs, electron-hole pairs) are transient reaction intermediates that are found and utilised in all areas of science. Radical pair spin dynamics simulations including all nuclear spins have been a computational barrier due to exponential scaling memory requirements. We address this issue with a tensor network method for accurately simulating the full open quantum dynamics of radical pair systems, explicitly accounting for hyperfine interactions with up to 30 nuclear spins with additional benchmarking including 60 nuclei. By employing the matrix product state (MPS) and matrix product density operator (MPDO) representations, we mitigate the exponential scaling of Hilbert and Liouville spaces typically encountered in full quantum non-Markovian treatments. We demonstrate the power of these methods with biologically relevant flavin-tryptophan radical pair systems, where we investigate electron hopping processes between multiple radical pairs using Lindblad jump operators. These simulations precisely capture anisotropic spin dynamics, clearly identifying orientational dependence of the magnetic field, which enhances or diminishes the spin-selective product yield. These directional sensitivities highlight the critical dependence of the nuclear environment and underscore the necessity of fully quantum treatments in spin biophysics, offering critical insights into avian magnetoreception mechanisms. This work provides a robust computational framework applicable to a broad range of scientific realms, which include spin chemistry, quantum biology, and spintronics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zherui Chen, Joao Basso, Zhiyan Ding, Lin Lin</p>
            <p>The presence of energy barriers in the state space of a physical system can lead to exponentially slow convergence for sampling algorithms like Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). In the classical setting, replica exchange (or parallel tempering) is a powerful heuristic to accelerate mixing in these scenarios. In the quantum realm, preparing Gibbs states of Hamiltonians faces a similar challenge, where bottlenecks can dramatically increase the mixing time of quantum dynamical semigroups. In this work, we introduce a quantum analogue of the replica exchange method. We define a Lindbladian on a joint system of two replicas and prove that it can accelerate mixing for a class of Hamiltonians with local energy barriers. We provide a rigorous lower bound on the spectral gap of the combined system's Lindbladian, which leads to an exponential improvement in spectral gap with respect to the barrier height. We showcase the applicability of our method with several examples, including the defected 1D Ising model at arbitrary constant temperature, and defected non-commuting local Hamiltonians at high temperature.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hung-Hsuan Teh, Takahiro Orito</p>
            <p>We establish a unified framework connecting decoherence and quantum complexity. By vectorizing the density matrix into a pure state in a double Hilbert space, a decoherence process is mapped to an imaginary-time evolution. Expanding this evolution in the Krylov space, we find that the $n$-th Krylov basis corresponds to an $n$-error state generated by the decoherence, providing a natural bridge between error proliferation and complexity growth. Using two dephasing quantum channels as concrete examples, we show that the Krylov complexity remains nonsingular for strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry-breaking (SWSSB) crossovers, while it exhibits a singular area-to-volume-law transition for genuine SWSSB phase transitions, intrinsic to mixed states.</p>

            <p>Temporal entanglement (TE) of an influence matrix (IM) has been proposed as a measure of complexity of simulating dynamics of local observables in a many-body system. Foligno et al. [Phys. Rev. X 13, 041008 (2023)] recently argued that the TE in chaotic 1d quantum circuits obeys linear (volume-law) scaling with evolution time. To reconcile this apparent high complexity of IM with the rapid thermalization of local observables, here we study the relation between TE, non-Markovianity, and local temporal correlations for chaotic quantum baths. By exactly solving a random-unitary bath model, and bounding distillable entanglement between future and past degrees of freedom, we argue that TE is extensive for low enough bath growth rate, and it reflects genuine non-Markovianity. This memory, however, is entirely contained in highly complex temporal correlations, and its effect on few-point temporal correlators is negligible. An IM coarse-graining procedure, reducing the allowed frequency of measurements of the probe system, results in a transition from volume- to area-law TE scaling. We demonstrate the generality of this TE transition in 1d circuits by analyzing the kicked Ising model analytically at dual-unitary points, as well as numerically away from them. This finding indicates that dynamics of local observables are fully captured by an area-law IM. We provide evidence that the compact IM MPS obtained via standard compression algorithms accurately describes local evolution.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniela Cadamuro, Markus B. Fröb, Dimitrios Katsinis, Jan Mandrysch</p>
            <p>Relative entropy serves as a fundamental measure of state distinguishability in both quantum information theory and relativistic quantum field theory. Despite its conceptual importance, however, explicit computations of relative entropy remain notoriously difficult. Thus far, results in closed form have only been obtained for ground states, coherent states, and, more recently, single-mode squeezed states. In this work, we extend the analysis to multi-mode squeezed states, imposing that the squeezing generators be local either in space or in spacetime, which results in a continuum of squeezed modes. We provide a detailed and self-contained analysis of such states for a free scalar quantum field on Minkowski spacetime, connecting also with older results on the essential self-adjointness of the Wick square, and showing that they lie in the folium of the Minkowski vacuum representation. Although the local squeezing is natural from a foundational standpoint, we uncover a severe incompatibility between locality and squeezing: the relative entropy between a locally squeezed state and the vacuum generally diverges, however small the squeezing is. This shows that while locally squeezed states are well-defined elements of the state space of a free quantum field, they are infinitely different from the vacuum, in contrast to coherent states whose relative entropy with respect to the vacuum is finite.</p>

            <h2>The impact of multimode sources on DLCZ type quantum repeaters</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emil R. Hellebek, Anders S. Sørensen</p>
            <p>Long distance entanglement generation at a high rate is a major quantum technological goal yet to be fully realized, with the promise of many interesting applications, such as secure quantum computing on remote servers and quantum cryptography. One possible implementation is using a variant of the DLCZ-scheme by combining atomic-ensemble memories and linear optics with spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) sources. As we edge closer to the realization of such a technology, the complete details of the underlying components become crucial. In this paper we consider the impact of the multimode emission from the SPDC source on quantum repeaters based on the DLCZ-scheme. We consider two cases, driving the SPDC using short Gaussian pulses and continuously. For pulsed driving, we find that the use of very narrow laser pulses to drive SPDC source is crucial to obtain high fidelity end-to-end entangled states but this puts demands on the peak intensity. By introducing a maximally allowed laser intensity, we find optimal pulse widths for each swap depth. For continuous driving, we find the temporal acceptance window of clicks relative to the heralding time to be a crucial parameter, and we can similarly optimize the acceptance window for each swap depth. For both cases, we thus identify optimal parameters given experimental limitations and aims. We have thus provided helpful knowledge towards the realization of long distance entanglement generation using the DLCZ-scheme.</p>

            <p>Quantum mechanics and general relativity are the foundational pillars of modern physics, yet experimental tests that combine the two frameworks remain rare. Measuring optical phase shifts of massless photons in a gravitational potential provides a unique quantum platform to probe gravity beyond Newtonian descriptions, but laboratory-based interferometers have not yet reached the sensitivity needed to access this regime. Here, we report the realization of a 50-km table-top Mach-Zehnder fiber interferometer operating at the single-photon level, achieving a phase sensitivity of $4.42\times10^{-6}$ rad root-mean-square (RMS) within the frequency range of 0.01 Hz to 5 Hz. We demonstrate that this sensitivity is sufficient to resolve a phase-shift signal of $(6.18 \pm 0.44)\times10^{-5}$ rad RMS at 0.1 Hz, associated with a modulated gravity-induced signal. Our results establish a milestone for quantum sensing with large-scale optical interferometry, demonstrating the capability to detect gravitational redshifts in a local laboratory, thereby paving the way for testing quantum phenomena within general relativistic frameworks.</p>

            <p>We develop the theory describing the quantum coupled dynamics of the center-of-mass motion of a nanoparticle and an ensemble of ions co-trapped in a dual-frequency linear Paul trap. We first derive analytical expressions for the motional frequencies and classical trajectories of both nanoparticle and ions.

We predict that motional cooling down to sub-kelvin temperatures is achievable in state-of-the-art experiments even in the absence of motional feedback and in the presence of micromotion. We then extend our analysis to an ensemble of $N$ ions, predicting a linear increase of the cooling rate as a function of $N$ and motional cooling of the nanoparticle down to tenths of millikelvin in current experimental platforms. Our work establishes the theoretical toolbox needed to explore the ion-assisted preparation of non-Gaussian motional states of levitated nanoparticles.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michele Coppola, Zoubair Daouma, Malte Henkel</p>
            <p>The quantum fluctuation-dissipation theorem is a central ingredient in the construction of quantum dynamics of Brownian motion which necessarily is non-Markovian. Yet, often Markovian approximations to quantum dynamics are studied in the literature. In this work, we investigate the limitations of the Markovian approximation within two paradigmatic models describing a single damped harmonic oscillator. These models are governed by distinct quantum Langevin equations, although both are constructed to satisfy the same set of phenomenological criteria: the canonical commutation relations between position and momentum, the Kubo response relation, the virial theorem, and the equilibrium quantum variance. The limitations of the Markovian approximation are underscored by the classical limit, violations of the Ehrenfest theorem, the breakdown of complete and simple positivity in the reconstructed master equations, and anomalies in thermalisation behaviour. Further phenomenological differences between the two models are illustrated through their quantum relaxation dynamics and phase diagrams, derived from their reinterpretation as mean-field approximations of a many-body interacting magnet. Our analysis explicitly reveals intrinsic inconsistencies introduced by the Markovian approximation, emphasising the need for non-Markovian frameworks for a consistent description of open quantum dynamics.</p>

This review differs from previous ones in that it is based on the most recent understanding of the theory: the dependence of the self-consistent order parameter on the supercurrent is properly taken into account, and the superfluid weight in a flat band becomes proportional to the minimal quantum metric. We provide a recap of basic quantum geometric quantities and the concept of superfluid density. The geometric contribution of superconductivity is introduced via considering the two-body problem. The superfluid weight of a multiband system is derived within mean-field theory, leading to a topological bound of flat band superconductivity. The physical interpretation of the flat band supercurrent in terms of Wannier function overlaps is discussed.</p>

Natural candidates for this research are spin mixtures of atomic species with large magnetic moments. However, the lifetime of such assemblies can be strongly affected by the dipolar relaxation that occurs in spin-flip collisions. Here we present experimental results for a mixture composed of the two lowest Zeeman states of $^{162}$Dy atoms, that act as dark states with respect to a light-induced quadratic Zeeman effect. We show that, due to an interference phenomenon, the rate for such inelastic processes is dramatically reduced with respect to the Wigner threshold law. Additionally, we determine the scattering lengths characterizing the s-wave interaction between these states, providing all necessary data to predict the miscibility range of the mixture, depending on its dimensionality.</p>

We study the Fraunhofer pattern of planar Josephson junctions in presence of different kinds of disorder and imperfections and we find that a junction that is {\it mirror} symmetric at zero-field forbids the diode effect and that the diode effect is typically magnified at the nodal points of the Fraunhofer pattern. The work presents a comprehensive treatment of the role of pure spatial inhomogeneity in the emergence of a diode effect in planar junctions, with an extension to the multi-terminal case and to systems of Josephson junctions connected in parallel.</p>

            <p>An economic modeling approach for cavity quantum electrodynamics is provided by mean-field dynamics, wherein the optical field is described classically while a self-consistent interaction with quantum emitters is incorporated through the Ehrenfest theorem. However, conventional implementations of mean-field dynamics are known to suffer from a catastrophic leakage of zero-point energy, to lose accuracy in the short-cavity limit, and to require large numbers of trajectories to be sampled. Here, we address these three shortcomings within a single integrated approach. This approach builds on our recently-proposed modification of the Ehrenfest theorem, referred to as decoupled mean-field (DC-MF) dynamics, in combination with a focused sampling scheme that enforces zero-point energy at the single-trajectory level. The approach is shown to yield high accuracy in both short and long-cavity limits while reaching convergence within a minimal amount of trajectories.</p>

            <p>Symmetry-protected non-Abelian (SPNA) statistics opens new frontiers in quantum statistics and enriches the schemes for topological quantum computing. In this work, we propose a novel type of SPNA statistics in one-dimensional strongly correlated bosonic symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases and reveal its exotic universal features through a comprehensive investigation. Specifically, we show a universal result for a wide range of bosonic SPT phases described by real Hamiltonians: the SPNA statistics of topological zero modes fall into two distinct classes. The first class exhibits conventional braiding operation of hard-core bosons. Furthermore, we discover a second class of unconventional braiding statistics characterized by an exotic nonlinear transformation, featuring a fractionalization of the first class and reminiscent of the non-Abelian statistics of symmetry-protected Majorana pairs. The two distinct classes of statistics have a topological origin in classifying non-Abelian Berry phases for braiding processes of real-Hamiltonian systems, distinguished by whether the holonomy involves a reflection operation. To illustrate, we focus on a specific bosonic SPT phase with particle-hole symmetry, and demonstrate that both classes of braiding statistics can be feasibly realized in a tri-junction with or without the aid of a controlled defect. The topological zero modes are protected by unitary symmetries and are therefore immune to dynamical symmetry breaking. Numerical results support our theoretical predictions. We demonstrate how to encode logical qubits and implement both single- and two-qubit gates using the two classes of SPNA statistics. Finally, we propose feasible experimental schemes to realize these SPNA statistics and identify the parameter regimes that ensure high-fidelity braiding results.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Takayuki Kubo</p>
            <p>This work investigates amplitude-dependent nonlinear corrections to the dissipative conductivity in superconductors, using the Keldysh--Usadel theory of nonequilibrium superconductivity, which captures the nonequilibrium dynamics of both quasiparticles and the pair potential. Our rigorous formulation naturally incorporates both the direct nonlinear action of the photon field and indirect contributions mediated by nonequilibrium variations in the pair potential, namely the Eliashberg effect and the Higgs mode. The third-harmonic current, often regarded as a hallmark of the Higgs mode in disordered superconductors, arises from both the direct photon action and the Higgs mode. Our numerical results are in excellent agreement with previous studies. In contrast, the first-harmonic current, and consequently the dissipative conductivity, receives contributions from all three mechanisms: the direct photon action, the Higgs mode, and the Eliashberg effect. It is shown that that the nonlinear correction to dissipative conductivity in dirty-limit superconductors can serve as a fingerprint of the Higgs mode, appearing as a resonance peak at a frequency near the superconducting gap \( \Delta \). In addition, our results provide microscopic insight into amplitude-dependent dissipation at frequencies well below \( \Delta \), which is particularly relevant for applied superconducting devices. In particular, the long-standing issue concerning the frequency dependence of the amplitude-dependent quality factor is explained as originating from the direct nonlinear action of the photon field, rather than from contributions by the Higgs mode and the Eliashberg effect. Our practical and explicit expression for the nonlinear conductivity formula makes our results accessible to a broad range of researchers.</p>

We map out kinematical regions where the pairs exhibit entanglement, Bell nonlocality and non-stabilizerness (`magic'). We also predict that massive quarks and antiquarks are transversely polarized, similar to the well-known transverse hyperon polarization in unpolarized collisions.

Motivated by this gap, in this paper we investigate the degradation of quantum entanglement of scalar and Dirac fields in the third-type black hole geometry arising from effective quantum gravity, which incorporates generic quantum gravitational corrections beyond classical general relativity. This quantum corrected spacetime is free of a Cauchy horizon and can be cast into a Rindler form in the near-horizon regime, allowing a direct identification of vacuum modes and a clear correspondence with the framework developed for uniformly accelerated observers. Within this framework, we compute the quantum entanglement and mutual information of uniformly entangled detector pairs in terms of the quantum parameter $\tilde{\zeta}$, the mode frequency $\tilde{\omega}$, and Bob's radial position $R_0$. The quantum parameter $\tilde{\zeta}$ consistently weakens the horizon-induced loss of correlations. For scalar fields this effect is pronounced, producing clear departures from the classical behavior, whereas for Dirac fields the familiar correlation pattern remains intact but its degradation is noticeably reduced. Overall, $\tilde{\zeta}$ acts as a universal protective factor against gravitational suppression of quantum correlations. The third-type effective quantum black hole therefore provides a controlled and physically transparent arena for probing how quantum-gravity corrections influence relativistic quantum information.</p>

            <h2>On the resolution of categorical symmetries in (Non-) Unitary Rational CFTs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arpan Bhattacharyya, Saptaswa Ghosh, Sounak Pal, Jagannath Santara</p>
            <p>We explore several aspects of the categorical symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy (SREE) in two-dimensional Rational Conformal Field Theories (RCFTs) and express it directly in terms of the modular data of the theory. Motivated by arXiv:2409.02806, we provide a general formula for SREE that applies to symmetric (weakly/strongly) and cloaking boundary conditions as well as for fusion rings with multiplicities without invoking any SymTFT construction, relying instead on a purely 2d RCFT analysis. We check the formula against several explicit examples. Additionally, we study symmetry resolution for both categorical and invertible symmetries in (non-)diagonal RCFTs and comment on the subtleties that arise in these cases. Finally, we extend our analysis to diagonal non-unitary RCFTs, focusing on theories with generalized Haagerup-Izumi modular data, and find full agreement with the given formula.</p>

            <p>In previous work, we developed a method for computing two-point correlators by decomposing the mode degrees of freedom into fast and slow components. Building on this framework, we present a numerical implementation to study the evolution of primordial scalar perturbations under controlled state deformations induced by the simplest environment corrections from the Lindblad equation. Our approach generalizes to an arbitrary number of degrees of freedom and does not rely on the slow-roll approximation. The computational routine is numerically efficient and allows users to configure arbitrary sequences of decoherence events, with full control over their duration, shape, amplitude and effective wavelength range. The resulting outputs are compatible with nonlinear numerical codes, enabling studies of how decoherence effects propagate during reheating.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sijia Wang, Achintya Sajeendran, Dong-han Yeom, Robert B. Mann, Joshua Foo</p>
            <p>In a wide range of quantum gravity theories, quasiclassical geometries, which are solutions to the Einstein field equations approximately, are described by "coherent states." Here we propose a Hamiltonian formalism for gravitational dynamics with respect to this coherent state basis, which generates time evolution of the spacetime with respect to a clock at infinity. Since the coherent states are not orthogonal, an initial quasiclassical geometry is dynamically driven into a superposition of different amplitudes. Our framework provides a dynamical mechanism for tunneling between geometries that is ubiquitous in a number of approaches to quantum gravity, from loop quantum gravity to the Euclidean path integral. We apply our framework to the problem of black hole evaporation, providing a hint at how unitarity may be preserved with the inclusion of quantum corrections to the semiclassical evolution of the black hole.</p>

            <h2>New quasi-exactly solvable systems from SUSYQM and Bethe Ansatz</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Siyu Li, Ian Marquette, Yao-Zhong Zhang</p>
            <p>We give a systematic construction of new quasi-exactly solvable systems via Bethe ansatz and supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SUSYQM). Methods based on the intertwining of supercharges have been extensively used in the literature for exactly solvable systems. We generalize the state-deleting (Krein-Adler) supersymmetric transformations to quasi-exactly exactly solvable (QES) systems building on the Bethe ansatz method and related Bethe roots. This enables us to construct superpartners for a wide class of known QES systems classified previously through a hidden $sl(2)$ algebra. We present our constructions of factorizations and intertwining relations related to 1st-order SUSYQM and the $n=1$ state for 10 nonequivalent types, denoted I,...,X. In order to have a unified treatment we rely on their ODE standard form as this is also the appropriate setting to obtain the Bethe ansatz equations which constrain the polynomial solutions. This setting also allows one to deal with systems with $n$ states in a unified manner, using analysis based on the Bethe ansatz equations to build the supersymmetric transformations in terms of the Bethe ansatz roots. We derive the Schrödinger potentials for the $n=1$ superpartners of the 10 QES cases and give closed-form solutions for the spectra and wavefunctions of the corresponding QES SUSYQM systems. Furthermore, we present numerical results for higher excited states up to the $n=10$ level. The results obtained may have wider applicability as our framework is built on ODEs with polynomial coefficients.</p>

            <p>Timing and phase resolution in satellite QKD, kilometre-scale gravitational-wave detectors, and space-borne clock networks hinge on quantum-speed limits (QSLs), yet benchmarks omit relativistic effects for coherent and squeezed probes. We derive first-order relativistic corrections to the Mandelstam-Tamm and Margolus-Levitin bounds. Starting from the Foldy-Wouthuysen expansion and treating $-p^{4}/(8 m^{3} c^{2})$ as a harmonic-oscillator perturbation, we propagate Gaussian states to obtain closed-form QSLs and the quantum Cramér-Rao bound. Relativistic kinematics slow evolution in an amplitude- and squeezing-dependent way, increase both bounds, and introduce an $\epsilon^{2} t^{2}$ phase drift that weakens timing sensitivity while modestly increasing the squeeze factor. A single electron ($\epsilon \approx 1.5\times 10^{-10}$) in a $5.4\,\mathrm{T}$ Penning trap, read out with $149\,\mathrm{GHz}$ quantum-limited balanced homodyne, should reveal this drift within $\sim 15\,\mathrm{min}$ -- within known hold times.

In particular, our ab initio calculations reveal the complex behavior of the NV's inter-system crossing rates under stresses that both preserve and break the defect's symmetry. Crucially, our proposed framework immediately resolves a number of open questions in the field, including: (i) the microscopic origin of the observed contrast-enhancement in (111)-oriented anvils, and (ii) the surprising observation of NV contrast-inversion in certain high-pressure regimes.

Here, we propose superconducting diodes (SDs) as a coherent nonreciprocal element in circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) architectures.

We use the SD as an elementary component to realize coherent nonreciprocal qubit-qubit coupling. With a minimal two qubit system, we demonstrate a nonreciprocal half-iSWAP gate with tunable Bell-state generation, thereby showcasing the potential of intrinsic nonreciprocity as a tool in coherent control in quantum technologies. Our work enables high-fidelity signal routing and entanglement generation in all-to-all connected microwave quantum networks, where nonreciprocity is embedded at the device level.</p>

By selectively shifting the relevant atomic transitions, each atom can be coupled to a distinct cavity mode, allowing independent simultaneous processing. We present practical system designs that support cavity-mode multiplexing with up to 50 modes, enabling rapid mid-circuit syndrome extraction and significantly enhancing entanglement distribution rates between remote atom arrays.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> P. Djorwé, R. Altuijri, A. J. Almalki, S. Abdel-Khalek, A.-H. Abdel-Aty</p>
            <p>We propose a scheme to generate multi-paths entanglement in an optomechanical system by exploiting polarized electromagnetic fields and dark mode control. Our system consists of two mechanically coupled mechanical resonators, which are driven by a common electromagnetic field. An inclusion of a polarizer induces linear polarizations of the electromgnetic field corresponding to the vertical (transverse electric ($\rm{TE}$) and horizontal (transverse magnetic [($\rm{TM}$]) modes, which drive the mechanical resonators. Without the mechanical coupling $J_m=0$, the polarization angle ($\phi$) controls dark mode in the system. The breaking of this dark mode leads to multi-paths engineering of bipartite optomechanical entanglements. By switching on the phonon hopping rate ($J_m\neq0$), both the polarization angle and the modulation phase of the mechanical coupling allow a further control of the dark mode. The simultaneous Dark Mode Breaking (\rm{DMB}) conditions under these two parameters leads to multi-paths bipartite and tripartite entanglements. For a fine tuning of the polarization angle ($\phi=\pi/4$) this scheme enables a generation of twin entangled states, where the bipartite/tripartite generated entangled states are degenerated and might be of great interest for quantum information processing, quantum communication and diverse quantum computational tasks. The generated entanglements are more resilient against thermal fluctuations in the \rm{DMB} regime, i.e., up to two order of magnitude robust than in the Unbreaking regime. Our work sheets light on new possibilities to generate noise-tolerant quantum resources that are useful for plethora of modern quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Quantum electrodynamic description of the neutral hydrogen molecule ionization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hui-hui Miao</p>
            <p>The ionization dynamics of a hydrogen molecule, serving as a fundamental benchmark in quantum chemistry, is investigated within a comprehensive framework combining quantum electrodynamics and the Lindblad master equation. This approach enables a first-principles description of light--matter interactions while accounting for dissipative processes and external particle influx. We systematically explore the system's evolution across three distinct regimes: closed, dissipative open, and influx-driven open quantum systems. Our results reveal a universal tendency towards the formation of the neutral hydrogen molecule ($|\rm{H}_2\rangle$) across all configurations. The dissipation strengths for photons ($\gamma_\Omega$), electrons ($\gamma_e$), and phonons ($\gamma_\omega$) are identified as critical control parameters, with $\gamma_\Omega$ significantly accelerating system stabilization. Furthermore, the introduction of particle influx ($\mu_k$) leads to a complex redistribution of energy, notably populating the atomic state ($|\rm{H},\rm{H}\rangle$). The ionization pathway is exquisitely sensitive to the initial quantum state, dictated by the composition and number of photons, which governs the accessible spin-selective excitation channels. This is conclusively demonstrated in a model with an embedded anode, where the maximum ionization probability is fundamentally constrained to $\frac{3}{4}$ by orbital hybridization. This study provides a unified theoretical foundation for quantum-controlled chemistry, with direct implications for future experiments in cavity QED and quantum information processing.</p>

In this work, a single-photon source based on WS$_2$ micro-domes, created via hydrogen ion irradiation, is realized and integrated into an open, tunable optical microcavity. Single-photon emission from the coupled emitter-cavity system is verified via the second-order correlation measurement, revealing a $g^{(2)}(\tau=0)$ value of 0.3. A detailed analysis of the spectrally selective, cavity enhanced emission features shows the impact of a pronounced acoustic phonon emission sideband, which contributes specifically to the non-resonant emitter-cavity coupling in this system. The achieved level of cavity-emitter control highlights the potential of open-cavity systems to tailor the emission properties of atomically thin quantum emitters, advancing their suitability for real-world quantum technology applications.</p>

            <p>Neutral atoms in optical tweezer arrays possess broad applicability for quantum information science, in computing, simulation, and metrology. Among atomic species, Ytterbium-171 is unique as it hosts multiple qubits, each of which is impactful for these distinct applications. Consequently, this atom is an ideal candidate to bridge multiple disciplines, which, more broadly, has been an increasingly effective strategy within the field of quantum science. Realizing the full potential of this synergy requires high-fidelity generation and transfer of many-particle entanglement between these distinct qubit degrees of freedom, and thus between these distinct applications. Here we demonstrate the creation and coherent mapping of entangled quantum states across multiple qubits in Ytterbium-171 tweezer arrays. We map entangled states onto the optical clock qubit from the nuclear spin qubit or the Rydberg qubit. We coherently transfer up to 20 atoms of a $Z_2$-ordered Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state from the interacting Rydberg manifold to the metastable nuclear spin manifold. The many-body state is generated via a novel disorder-robust pulse in a two-dimensional ladder geometry. We further find that clock-qubit-based spin detection applied to Rydberg and nuclear spin qubits facilitates atom-loss-detectable qubit measurements and $>90\%$ Rydberg decay detection. This enables mid-circuit and delayed erasure detection, yielding an error-detected two-qubit gate fidelity of $99.78(4)\%$ in the metastable qubits. This error detection also enables Rydberg qubit evolution with an effective lifetime of $1.2(2)$ ms, enhancing the fidelity of the observed many-body dynamics. These results establish a versatile architecture that advances multiple fields of quantum information science while also establishing bridges between them.</p>

            <p>Quantum phenomena such as entanglement provide powerful resources for enhancing classical sensing. Here, we theoretically show that collective entanglement of spin qubits, arising from a condensation of particle-hole pairs, can strongly amplify transitions between ground and excited spin states, potentially improving signal contrast in optically detected magnetic resonance. This collective state exhibits an $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$ enhancement of the transition amplitude with respect to an applied microwave field, where $N$ is the number of entangled spin qubits. We computationally realize this amplification using an ensemble of $N$ triplet spins with magnetic dipole interactions, where the largest transition amplitudes occur at geometries for which the condensation of particle-hole pairs is strongest. This effect, robust to noise, originates from the concentration of entanglement into a single collective mode, reflected in a large eigenvalue of the particle-hole reduced density matrix -- an entanglement witness of condensation analogous to off-diagonal long-range order, though realized here in a finite system. These results offer a design principle for quantum sensors that exploit condensation-inspired entanglement to boost sensitivity in spin-based platforms.</p>

            <p>The precise measurement of the leptonic CP-violating phase $\delta_{CP}$ remains one of the major open challenges in neutrino physics, as current experiments achieve only very limited accuracy. We address this issue through the lens of quantum estimation theory. A distinctive feature of neutrino oscillation experiments is that they cannot freely optimize the probe or measurement, since both are constrained by the production and detection of flavor eigenstates. We therefore examine whether the large uncertainty in $\delta_{CP}$ originates from intrinsic reasons, either of the neutrino quantum state or of flavor measurements, or if it instead stems from experimental limitations. By comparing quantum and classical Fisher information, we demonstrate that the limited sensitivity to $\delta_{CP}$ originates primarily from the information content of flavor measurements. Furthermore, we show that targeting the second oscillation maximum, as in the ESS$\nu$SB proposal, substantially enhances $\delta_{CP}$ information compared to experiments centered on the first maximum.</p>

            <h2>Multi-path vector entanglement engineering via dark mode control in optomechanics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> P. Djorwé, R. Altuijri, A. J. Almalki, S. Abdel-Khalek, A.-H. Abdel-Aty</p>
            <p>We propose a scheme to generate multi-paths entanglement in an optomechanical system by exploiting polarized electromagnetic fields and dark mode control. Our system consists of two mechanically coupled mechanical resonators, which are driven by a common electromagnetic field. An inclusion of a polarizer induces linear polarizations of the electromgnetic field corresponding to the vertical (transverse electric ($\rm{TE}$) and horizontal (transverse magnetic [($\rm{TM}$]) modes, which drive the mechanical resonators. Without the mechanical coupling $J_m=0$, the polarization angle ($\phi$) controls dark mode in the system. The breaking of this dark mode leads to multi-paths engineering of bipartite optomechanical entanglements. By switching on the phonon hopping rate ($J_m\neq0$), both the polarization angle and the modulation phase of the mechanical coupling allow a further control of the dark mode. The simultaneous Dark Mode Breaking (\rm{DMB}) conditions under these two parameters leads to multi-paths bipartite and tripartite entanglements. For a fine tuning of the polarization angle ($\phi=\pi/4$) this scheme enables a generation of twin entangled states, where the bipartite/tripartite generated entangled states are degenerated and might be of great interest for quantum information processing, quantum communication and diverse quantum computational tasks. The generated entanglements are more resilient against thermal fluctuations in the \rm{DMB} regime, i.e., up to two order of magnitude robust than in the Unbreaking regime. Our work sheets light on new possibilities to generate noise-tolerant quantum resources that are useful for plethora of modern quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Quantum electrodynamic description of the neutral hydrogen molecule ionization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hui-hui Miao</p>
            <p>The ionization dynamics of a hydrogen molecule, serving as a fundamental benchmark in quantum chemistry, is investigated within a comprehensive framework combining quantum electrodynamics and the Lindblad master equation. This approach enables a first-principles description of light--matter interactions while accounting for dissipative processes and external particle influx. We systematically explore the system's evolution across three distinct regimes: closed, dissipative open, and influx-driven open quantum systems. Our results reveal a universal tendency towards the formation of the neutral hydrogen molecule ($|\rm{H}_2\rangle$) across all configurations. The dissipation strengths for photons ($\gamma_\Omega$), electrons ($\gamma_e$), and phonons ($\gamma_\omega$) are identified as critical control parameters, with $\gamma_\Omega$ significantly accelerating system stabilization. Furthermore, the introduction of particle influx ($\mu_k$) leads to a complex redistribution of energy, notably populating the atomic state ($|\rm{H},\rm{H}\rangle$). The ionization pathway is exquisitely sensitive to the initial quantum state, dictated by the composition and number of photons, which governs the accessible spin-selective excitation channels. This is conclusively demonstrated in a model with an embedded anode, where the maximum ionization probability is fundamentally constrained to $\frac{3}{4}$ by orbital hybridization. This study provides a unified theoretical foundation for quantum-controlled chemistry, with direct implications for future experiments in cavity QED and quantum information processing.</p>

            <p>Versatile, tunable, and potentially scalable single-photon sources are a key asset in emergent photonic quantum technologies. In this work, a single-photon source based on WS$_2$ micro-domes, created via hydrogen ion irradiation, is realized and integrated into an open, tunable optical microcavity. Single-photon emission from the coupled emitter-cavity system is verified via the second-order correlation measurement, revealing a $g^{(2)}(\tau=0)$ value of 0.3. A detailed analysis of the spectrally selective, cavity enhanced emission features shows the impact of a pronounced acoustic phonon emission sideband, which contributes specifically to the non-resonant emitter-cavity coupling in this system. The achieved level of cavity-emitter control highlights the potential of open-cavity systems to tailor the emission properties of atomically thin quantum emitters, advancing their suitability for real-world quantum technology applications.</p>

            <p>Neutral atoms in optical tweezer arrays possess broad applicability for quantum information science, in computing, simulation, and metrology. Among atomic species, Ytterbium-171 is unique as it hosts multiple qubits, each of which is impactful for these distinct applications. Consequently, this atom is an ideal candidate to bridge multiple disciplines, which, more broadly, has been an increasingly effective strategy within the field of quantum science. Realizing the full potential of this synergy requires high-fidelity generation and transfer of many-particle entanglement between these distinct qubit degrees of freedom, and thus between these distinct applications. Here we demonstrate the creation and coherent mapping of entangled quantum states across multiple qubits in Ytterbium-171 tweezer arrays. We map entangled states onto the optical clock qubit from the nuclear spin qubit or the Rydberg qubit. We coherently transfer up to 20 atoms of a $Z_2$-ordered Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state from the interacting Rydberg manifold to the metastable nuclear spin manifold. The many-body state is generated via a novel disorder-robust pulse in a two-dimensional ladder geometry. We further find that clock-qubit-based spin detection applied to Rydberg and nuclear spin qubits facilitates atom-loss-detectable qubit measurements and $>90\%$ Rydberg decay detection. This enables mid-circuit and delayed erasure detection, yielding an error-detected two-qubit gate fidelity of $99.78(4)\%$ in the metastable qubits. This error detection also enables Rydberg qubit evolution with an effective lifetime of $1.2(2)$ ms, enhancing the fidelity of the observed many-body dynamics. These results establish a versatile architecture that advances multiple fields of quantum information science while also establishing bridges between them.</p>

            <p>Quantum phenomena such as entanglement provide powerful resources for enhancing classical sensing. Here, we theoretically show that collective entanglement of spin qubits, arising from a condensation of particle-hole pairs, can strongly amplify transitions between ground and excited spin states, potentially improving signal contrast in optically detected magnetic resonance. This collective state exhibits an $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$ enhancement of the transition amplitude with respect to an applied microwave field, where $N$ is the number of entangled spin qubits. We computationally realize this amplification using an ensemble of $N$ triplet spins with magnetic dipole interactions, where the largest transition amplitudes occur at geometries for which the condensation of particle-hole pairs is strongest. This effect, robust to noise, originates from the concentration of entanglement into a single collective mode, reflected in a large eigenvalue of the particle-hole reduced density matrix -- an entanglement witness of condensation analogous to off-diagonal long-range order, though realized here in a finite system. These results offer a design principle for quantum sensors that exploit condensation-inspired entanglement to boost sensitivity in spin-based platforms.</p>

            <h2>Is the large uncertainty of $δ_{CP}$ fundamentally encoded in the neutrino quantum state?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michela Ignoti, Claudia Frugiuele, Matteo G. A. Paris, Marco G. Genoni</p>
            <p>The precise measurement of the leptonic CP-violating phase $\delta_{CP}$ remains one of the major open challenges in neutrino physics, as current experiments achieve only very limited accuracy. We address this issue through the lens of quantum estimation theory. A distinctive feature of neutrino oscillation experiments is that they cannot freely optimize the probe or measurement, since both are constrained by the production and detection of flavor eigenstates. We therefore examine whether the large uncertainty in $\delta_{CP}$ originates from intrinsic reasons, either of the neutrino quantum state or of flavor measurements, or if it instead stems from experimental limitations. By comparing quantum and classical Fisher information, we demonstrate that the limited sensitivity to $\delta_{CP}$ originates primarily from the information content of flavor measurements. Furthermore, we show that targeting the second oscillation maximum, as in the ESS$\nu$SB proposal, substantially enhances $\delta_{CP}$ information compared to experiments centered on the first maximum.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mikhail Zubarev</p>
            <p>Variational quantum algorithms face a fundamental trainability crisis: barren plateaus render optimization exponentially difficult as system size grows. While recent Lie algebraic theory precisely characterizes when and why these plateaus occur, no practical optimization method exists with finite-sample guarantees for navigating them. We present the sequential plateau-adaptive regime-testing algorithm (SPARTA), the first measurement-frugal scheduler that provides explicit, anytime-valid risk control for quantum optimization. Our approach integrates three components with rigorous statistical foundations: (i) a $\chi^2$-calibrated sequential test that distinguishes barren plateaus from informative regions using likelihood-ratio supermartingales; (ii) a probabilistic trust-region exploration strategy with one-sided acceptance to prevent false improvements under shot noise; and (iii) a theoretically-optimal exploitation phase that achieves the best attainable convergence rate. We prove geometric bounds on plateau exit times, linear convergence in informative basins, and show how Lie-algebraic variance proxies enhance test power without compromising statistical calibration.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Josef Soucek, Michael Petrov, Michal Gulka, Emilie Bourgeois, Milos Nesladek</p>
            <p>We report on a mathematical model of the photoelectric response of NV colour centres in diamond, that can be employed for sensing and quantum science information applications. Although the model applies to NV centre in diamond, it can be applied with small modifications to other semiconducting solid state qubits. In our model, we include the drift and collection of charge carriers as well as the presence of other defects via generation and recombination dynamics. Though the photoluminescence readout and the associated dynamics of the NV defect has been extensively studied experimentally and theoretically, so far, there has been no precise model for photocurrent readout, including these effects. In our description, we use a multilevel-level system including mS=0, mS=+-1 ground and excited states, singlet state and the NV0 neutral state. Also, the presence of substitutional nitrogen (NS), which for example determines the spin coherence via the paramagnetic spin bath, is discussed together with presence of acceptor defects. We model the time-dependent occupation of all electronic sublevels and also consider the electronic charge transport from the Boltzmann transport equation, leading to information about the charge state transitions and recombination dynamics. ODMR and PDMR response as well as their quantum efficiencies, are calculated. On this basis, we determine an optimal parameter space for qubit operations, including the highest spin contrast and especially relate those to NS presence. The model is confirmed experimentally and can become a useful tool for optimisation of the performance of NV qubit photoelectric readout.</p>

            <h2>Berry's phase on photonic quantum computers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Steven Abel, Iwo Wasek, Simon Williams</p>
            <p>We formulate a continuous-variable quantum computing (CVQC) algorithm to study Berry's phase on photonic quantum computers. We demonstrate that CVQC allows the simulation of charged particles with orbital angular momentum under the influence of an adiabatically changing $\vec{B}$ field. Although formulated entirely in the CVQC setting, our construction uses only passive linear-optical operations (beam splitters and phase shifts), which act identically in single-photon photonic architectures. This enables experimental realisation on the Quandella Ascella platform, where we observe the Berry's phase phenomenon with interferometric measurement. We also generalise the framework to more rapid non-adiabatic evolution. By concatenating Aharonov-Anandan cycles for opposing magnetic fields we demonstrate that one can engineer a circuit in which dynamical phases and leading non-geometric errors cancel by symmetry, leaving the intrinsically robust geometric phase contribution.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emanuele Tumbiolo, Lorenzo Maccone, Chiara Macchiavello, Matteo G.A. Paris, Giacomo Guarnieri</p>
            <p>Quantum thermometry aims at determining temperature with ultimate precision in the quantum regime. Standard equilibrium approaches, limited by the Quantum Fisher Information given by static energy fluctuations, lose sensitivity outside a fixed temperature window. Non-equilibrium strategies have therefore been recently proposed to overcome these limits, but their advantages are typically model-dependent or tailored for a specific purpose. This Letter establishes a general, model-independent result showing that any temperature-dependent unitary driving applied to a thermalized probe enhances its quantum Fisher information with respect to its equilibrium value. Such information gain is expressed analytically through a positive semi-definite kernel of information currents that quantify the flow of statistical distinguishability. Our results are benchmarked on a driven spin-$1/2$ thermometer, furthermore showing that resonant modulations remarkably restore the quadratic-in-time scaling of the Fisher information and allow to shift the sensitivity peak across arbitrary temperature ranges. Our findings identify external unitary control as a universal resource for precision metrology and pave the way for future implementations in quantum sensing.</p>

            <h2>Entropy Flow and Exceptional-Point Structure in Two-Mode Squeezed-Bath Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eric R. Bittner</p>
            <p>Squeezed reservoirs provide a powerful means of engineering nonclassical noise and controlling irreversible dynamics in open quantum systems. Here we develop a comprehensive analysis of two coupled harmonic oscillators driven by independent squeezed baths, focusing on the emergence of coherence-driven entropy flow and the structure of exceptional points (EPs) in the corresponding Lindblad dynamics. Working entirely within the Gaussian formalism, we derive closed-form evolution equations for the covariance matrix and show that squeezing induces entropy generation only at *second order* in the anomalous correlations, a nonlinear mechanism absent in thermal environments. This entropy flow is accompanied by a rich non-Hermitian structure: by scanning the squeezing parameters we uncover a characteristic "exceptional-point fan" in the (M1, M2) plane, which separates a narrow PT-unbroken region of oscillatory dynamics from broad PT-broken sectors in which one normal mode becomes purely overdamped. This geometric organization of EPs reveals that PT symmetry survives only when the two reservoirs squeeze opposite quadratures, and is generically broken for in-phase squeezing. Our analysis establishes squeezed reservoirs as a natural setting where information-bearing noise drives irreversible behavior through coherent pathways, and lays the groundwork for experimentally accessible probes of entropy flow and critical mode behavior in more complex open systems.</p>

            <p>Harnessing rare-earth ions in oxides for quantum networks requires integration with bright emitters in III-V semiconductors, but local disorder and interfacial noise limit their optical coherence. Here, we investigate the microscopic origins of the ensemble spectrum in Er$^{3+}$:TiO$_2$ epitaxial thin films on GaAs and GaSb substrates. Ab initio calculations combined with noise-Hamiltonian modeling and Monte Carlo simulations quantify the effects of interfacial and bulk spin noise and local strain on erbium crystal-field energies and inhomogeneous linewidths. Photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy reveals that Er$^{3+}$ ions positioned at increasing distances from the III-V/oxide interface produce a systematic blue shift of the $Y_1\rightarrow Z_1$ transition, consistent with strain relaxation predicted by theory. Thermal annealing produces a compensating redshift and linewidth narrowing, isolating the roles of oxygen-vacancy and gallium-diffusion noise. These results provide microscopic insight into disorder-driven decoherence, offering pathways for precise control of hybrid quantum systems for scalable quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>We investigate photon tunneling in a pair of coupled inverted circular split-ring microwave resonators with four discrete chiral orientations. By varying the spacing between the resonators, we observe strong modulation of the transmission spectra, including mode splitting, interference effects, and the formation of dark states. Measurements on fabricated devices show clear signatures of hybridization that depend on both chirality and proximity, and these results are consistent with full-wave electromagnetic simulations. To describe the observed behavior, we develop a circuit quantum electrodynamics model that captures the dependence of the coupling strength on geometry and the reversal of its sign. Although the experimental excitation is classical, the system reproduces features expected from two quantized harmonic oscillators, providing a classical analogue of a chiral quantum hybrid platform. The ability to control photon tunneling through structural design and excitation parameters suggests potential applications in reconfigurable photonic devices, quantum communication, chiral sensing, and polarization-selective signal processing.</p>

            <p>Quantum sensors based on the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond are leading platforms for high-sensitivity magnetometry with nanometer-scale resolution. State-of-the-art implementations, however, typically rely on bulky free-space optics or sacrifice spatial resolution to achieve high sensitivities. Here, we realize an integrated platform that overcomes this trade-off by fabricating monolithic whispering-gallery-mode cavities from a diamond chip containing a high density of NV centers and by evanescently coupling excitation to and photoluminescence from the cavity using a tapered optical fiber. Employing a lock-in-amplified Ramsey magnetometry scheme, we achieve a photon-shot-noise-limited DC sensitivity of $58\,\text{nT}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ -- the best sensitivity reported to date for a nanofabricated cavity-based magnetometer. The microscopic cavity size enables sub-micrometer-scale spatial resolution and low-power operation, while fiber-coupling provides a path to scalable on-chip integration. Arrays of such sensors could enable NV-NMR spectroscopy of sub-nanoliter samples, new magnetic-gradient imaging architectures, and compact biosensing platforms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shah Fahad, Gao Xianlong</p>
            <p>We propose a scheme to manipulate the Goos-Hänchen shift (GHS) of a reflected probe field in a non-Hermitian cavity magnomechanical system. The platform consists of a yttrium-iron-garnet sphere coupled to a microwave cavity, where a strong microwave drive pumps the magnon mode and a weak field probes the cavity. The traveling field's interaction with the magnon induces gain, yielding non-Hermitian dynamics. When the traveling field is oriented at $\pi/2$ relative to the cavity's $x$-axis, the system realizes $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry; eigenvalue analysis reveals a third-order exceptional point ($\mathrm{EP}_3$) at a tunable effective magnon-photon coupling. Under balanced gain-loss and finite effective magnomechanical coupling, we demonstrate coherent control of the GHS by steering the system across the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric transition and through $\mathrm{EP}_3$ via the effective magnon-photon coupling, enabling pronounced enhancement or suppression of the lateral shift. Furthermore, we show that without effective magnomechanical coupling, the system exhibits a second-order exceptional point ($\mathrm{EP}_2$) with a distinct GHS phase transition. This phase transition vanishes when the effective magnomechanical coupling exceeds a parametric threshold, where strong absorption at resonance suppresses the GHS. We also identify the intracavity length as an additional control parameter for precise shift tuning. Notably, the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric configuration yields substantially larger GHS than its Hermitian counterpart. These results advance non-Hermitian magnomechanics and open a route to GHS-based microwave components for quantum switching and precision sensing.</p>

            <p>Estimating the ground-state energy of Hamiltonians is a fundamental task for which it is believed that quantum computers can be helpful. Several approaches have been proposed toward this goal, including algorithms based on quantum phase estimation and hybrid quantum-classical optimizers involving parameterized quantum circuits, the latter falling under the umbrella of the variational quantum eigensolver. Here, we analyze the performance of quantum Boltzmann machines for this task, which is a less explored ansatz based on parameterized thermal states and which is not known to suffer from the barren-plateau problem. We delineate a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for this task and rigorously prove that it converges to an $\varepsilon$-approximate stationary point of the energy function optimized over parameter space, while using a number of parameterized-thermal-state samples that is polynomial in $\varepsilon^{-1}$, the number of parameters, and the norm of the Hamiltonian being optimized. Our algorithm estimates the gradient of the energy function efficiently by means of a quantum circuit construction that combines classical random sampling, Hamiltonian simulation, and the Hadamard test. Additionally, supporting our main claims are calculations of the gradient and Hessian of the energy function, as well as an upper bound on the matrix elements of the latter that is used in the convergence analysis.</p>

Results show that a limited number of measurements still allows for a quick convergence to a solution, making it a viable solution for resource-efficient scenarios.</p>

            <p>Quantum machine learning research has expanded rapidly due to potential computational advantages over classical methods. Angle encoding has emerged as a popular choice as feature map (FM) for embedding classical data into quantum models due to its simplicity and natural generation of truncated Fourier series, providing universal function approximation capabilities. Efficient FMs within quantum circuits can exploit exponential scaling of Fourier frequencies, with multi-dimensional inputs introducing additional exponential growth through mixed-frequency terms. Despite this promising expressive capability, practical implementation faces significant challenges. Through controlled experiments with white-box target functions, we demonstrate that training failures can occur even when all relevant frequencies are theoretically accessible. We illustrate how two primary known causes lead to unsuccessful optimization: insufficient trainable parameters relative to the model's frequency content, and limitations imposed by the ansatz's dynamic lie algebra dimension, but also uncover an additional parameter burden: the necessity of controlling non-unique frequencies within the model. To address this, we propose near-zero weight initialization to suppress unnecessary duplicate frequencies. For target functions with a priori frequency knowledge, we introduce frequency selection as a practical solution that reduces parameter requirements and mitigates the exponential growth that would otherwise render problems intractable due to parameter insufficiency. Our frequency selection approach achieved near-optimal performance (median $R^2 \approx 0.95$) with 78\% of the parameters needed by the best standard approach in 10 randomly chosen target functions.</p>

These results highlight HUBO as a practical alternative for current and near-term devices.

This collective state exhibits an $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$ enhancement of the transition amplitude with respect to an applied microwave field, where $N$ is the number of entangled spin qubits. We computationally realize this amplification using an ensemble of $N$ triplet spins with magnetic dipole interactions, where the largest transition amplitudes occur at geometries for which the condensation of particle-hole pairs is strongest. This effect, robust to noise, originates from the concentration of entanglement into a single collective mode, reflected in a large eigenvalue of the particle-hole reduced density matrix -- an entanglement witness of condensation analogous to off-diagonal long-range order, though realized here in a finite system. These results offer a design principle for quantum sensors that exploit condensation-inspired entanglement to boost sensitivity in spin-based platforms.</p>

            <h2>Certifying Majorana Fermions with Elegant-Like Bell Inequalities and a New Self-Testing Equivalence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Patryk Michalski, Arturo Konderak, Wojciech Bruzda, Remigiusz Augusiak</p>
            <p>Bell inequalities provide a fundamental tool for probing nonlocal correlations, yet their quantum bound, that is, the maximal value attainable through quantum strategies, is rarely accessible analytically. In this work, we introduce a general construction of Bell inequalities for which this bound can be computed exactly. Our framework generalizes both the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt and Gisin's elegant inequalities, yielding Bell expressions maximally violated by any number of pairwise anticommuting Clifford observables together with the corresponding maximally entangled state. Under suitable assumptions, our inequalities also enable the device-independent certification of Majorana fermions, understood as multiqubit realizations of Clifford algebra generators. Importantly, we identify an additional equivalence that must be incorporated into the definition of self-testing beyond invariance under local isometries and transposition. This equivalence arises from partial transposition applied to the shared state and to the measurements, which in specific cases leaves all observed correlations unchanged.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Algorithm for Estimating Gibbs Free Energy and Entropy via Energy Derivatives</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shangjie Guo, Corneliu Buda, Nathan Wiebe</p>
            <p>Estimating vibrational entropy is a significant challenge in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics due to its reliance on quantum mechanical properties. This paper introduces a quantum algorithm designed to estimate vibrational entropy via energy derivatives. Our approach block encodes the exact expression for the second derivative of the energy and uses quantum linear systems algorithms to deal with the reciprocal powers of the gaps that appear in the expression. We further show that if prior knowledge about the values of the second derivative is used then our algorithm can $\epsilon$-approximate the entropy using a number of queries that scales with the condition number $\kappa$, the temperature $T$, error tolerance $\epsilon$ and an analogue of the partition function $\mathcal{Z}$, as $\widetilde{O}\left(\frac{\mathcal{Z}\kappa^2 }{\epsilon T}\right)$. We show that if sufficient prior knowledge is given about the second derivative then the query scales quadratically better than these results. This shows that, under reasonable assumptions of the temperature and a quantum computer can be used to compute the vibrational contributions to the entropy faster than analogous classical algorithms would be capable of. Our findings highlight the potential of quantum algorithms to enhance the prediction of thermodynamic properties, paving the way for advancements in fields such as material science, molecular biology, and chemical engineering.</p>

            <p>Quantum batteries (QBs) have emerged as promising candidates capable of outperforming classical counterparts by utilizing entangled operators. Spin chains, in particular, exhibit unique {charging} properties across diverse settings. Here, we introduce the kicked-Ising model as a QB and analytically characterize its charging dynamics within the self-dual operator regime, valid for arbitrary system sizes and Floquet cycles. Using Clifford quantum cellular automata and momentum-space Floquet analysis with the Cayley-Hamilton theorem, we obtain exact expressions for energy injection, uncovering the influence of boundary conditions and spin-chain parity on charging performance. The kicked-Ising QB achieves maximal charging while exhibiting remarkable robustness against disorder. We further propose an intensified protocol within a fixed time window that enables faster and more efficient energy injection, while non-uniform kick schedules enhance experimental flexibility. Spin correlators analysis further shows that low-frequency driving boosts energy injection, highlighting a clear connection between charging, scrambling, and kick-induced delocalization. Our theoretical framework are supported by tensor-network simulations and finally verified on IBM quantum hardware. Accounting for platform-specific constraints, we demonstrate that the kicked-Ising QB offers a scalable, disorder-resilient protocol and testbed to assess quantum platforms.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement Generation via Hamiltonian Dynamics Having Limited Resources</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Moein Naseri</p>
            <p>We investigate the fundamental limits of entanglement generation under bipartite Hamiltonian dynamics when only finite physical resources-specifically, bounded energy variance-are available. Using the relative entropy of entanglement, we derive a closed analytical expression for the instantaneous entanglement generation rate for arbitrary pure states and Hamiltonians expressed in the Schmidt basis. We find that constraints based solely on the mean energy of the Hamiltonian are insufficient to bound the entanglement generation rate, whereas imposing a variance constraint ensures a finite and well-defined maximum. We fully characterize the Hamiltonians that achieve this optimal rate, establishing a direct relation between their imaginary components in the Schmidt basis and the structure of the optimal initial states. For systems without ancillas, we obtain a closed-form expression for the maximal rate in terms of the surprisal variance of the Schmidt coefficients and identify the family of optimal states and Hamiltonians. We further extend our analysis to scenarios where Alice and Bob may employ local ancillary systems: using a matrix-analytic framework and a refined description of the Hamiltonians allowed by the physical constraints, we derive an explicit optimization formula and characterize the attainable enhancement in entanglement generation.</p>

We apply the algorithm to quantum chemistry, and in particular, to the potential energy curve calculations of the model problem of the hydrogen molecule in the split valence basis. We compare the number of qudits and the number of gates required between qubit and qutrit HHL implementations. In general, we find that for a fixed precision, the qutrit HHL circuit requires fewer number of qudits and comparable number of two-qudit gates than its qubit counterpart.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vibin Abraham, Priyabrata Senapati, Himadri Pathak, Bo Peng</p>
            <p>Accurately resolving many-body satellite features in molecular core-level spectra requires theoretical approaches that capture electron correlation both efficiently and systematically. The recently developed time-dependent double coupled-cluster (TD-dCC) ansatz achieves this by combining correlation effects from the N- and (N-1)-electron sectors, but its exact formulation remains computationally demanding. Here we introduce a hierarchy of cost-effective approximate TD-dCC ansatzes derived from truncated Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansions, which preserve a single-similarity-transformation structure while retaining the essential correlation diagrams responsible for satellite formation. We further develop a detailed component analysis that isolates hole-mediated excitation pathways, which are correlated processes arising from the coupling between ground-state and ionized-state amplitudes. We use it to interpret quasiparticle and satellite features across the hierarchy. Applications to the single-impurity Anderson model and molecular systems (H2O and CH4) demonstrate that the approximate TD-dCC methods closely and efficiently reproduce exact many-body spectral features and quasiparticle weights. In parallel, we construct a fault-tolerant quantum signal processing algorithm for the core-hole Green's function, providing a scalable quantum route for simulating correlated core-level dynamics. Together, these developments establish complementary classical and quantum methodologies for quantitative, many-body-accurate core spectroscopy.</p>

These capabilities open avenues to address scalability challenges in neutral-atom quantum computers and simulators, enabling fast optical readout, efficient and subwavelength non-diffracting interaction zones, and genuine compatibility with integrated solid-state photon sources, detectors, and stop-band modulators. Beyond controllable quantum matter, the platform also enables in-situ imaging of evanescent fields of light and nanoscale structures, including prospects for three-dimensional scanning microscopy with non-invasive single-atom probes for quantum sensing applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Walter Rieck, Anton Frisk Kockum, Guangze Chen</p>
            <p>Bound states in the continuum (BICs) are spatially localized modes embedded in the spectrum of extended states, typically stabilized by symmetry or interference. While extensively studied in single-particle and linear systems, the many-body regime of BICs remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that giant atoms, quantum emitters coupled nonlocally to structured waveguides, can host robust doublon BICs, i.e., two-photon bound states stabilized by destructive interference and interactions. We first analyze a driven two-photon emission process and show how doublon BICs arise and mediate decoherence-free interaction between distant atoms. We then demonstrate that these many-body BICs also emerge under natural, undriven dynamics via a virtual two-photon emission process in three-level giant atoms. Our results reveal an interference-based mechanism for stabilizing many-body localization in open quantum systems, with potential applications in quantum simulation, non-ergodic dynamics, and protected quantum information processing.</p>

            <p>We theoretically investigate a quantum battery architecture where two identical two-level atoms are charged by a cavity-magnomechanical system, which includes a microwave cavity, a magnon mode hosted in a YIG sphere, and phonon mode due to the deformation of the YIG sphere. The charging process relies on coherent energy exchange, where the atoms couple to the cavity, which in turn, it interacts with the magnon mode via a beam-splitter mechanism. By deriving the system Hamiltonian under the rotating-wave approximation and employing a Lindblad master equation to rigorously model dissipation, we analyze the complete dynamical evolution of the battery. Our study demonstrates that strong, resonant light-matter interactions are crucial for enhancing the key performance metrics: charging efficiency, stored energy, and ergotropy (extractable work). We systematically investigate the deleterious effects of detuning and decoherence, and critically, we uncover a non-trivial interplay between the system's coupling strengths. This reveals optimal operating regimes where constructive interference maximizes performance, while excessive coupling in specific channels can degrade it. Ultimately, our findings provide a quantitative framework for engineering high-efficiency quantum batteries in hybrid magnonic platforms, offering a design roadmap for future experimental realizations.</p>

            <p>The intriguing physical phenomena associated with exceptional points have established non-Hermitian physics as a frontier of modern research. Recent investigations have extended non-Hermitian physics into the fully quantum domain. However, existing studies predominantly concentrate on discrete-variable quantum systems, while non-Hermitian quantum effects in continuous-variable encoded systems remain largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate the exceptional structure for a driven-dissipative Kerr-cat qubit, realized with a Kerr nonlinear resonator. We find that the dissipation leads to a bidirectional jump between the two basis states of the cat qubit, which is in distinct contrast with the unidirectional jump associated with normal two-level systems. The competition between this jump and a single-photon drive gives arise to the emergence of third-order Liouvillian exceptional points (LEP3s), each corresponds to a crossing point of two lines of LEP2s. We further show that the LEP3 can exhibit the topological character of the Hamiltonian EP3s, which cannot be realized with a single qubit. Our work opens the possibility of realizing non-Hermitian phenomena with continuous-variable quantum systems.</p>

            <p>The following paper presents a holistic approach to the processing of entangled links within entanglement based quantum key distribution protocols, whose security relies on the Bell inequality. We investigate the interactions, and the collective impact, of the whole processing chain on the final secure key rate. This includes the quantum mechanical preprocessing in the form of entanglement distillation, processing of the entangled states via measurements and the necessary classical postprocessing based on the measurement results. Our investigations are based on the principle idea of the Eckert 1991 protocol and utilize the secret key capacity introduced by Devetak and Winter in 2005. Our results include a proof on what measurement bases need to be chosen to achieve this capacity for the case of Werner states. It also presents a new processing strategy and compares it with the most common one that can be found within the literature. Furthermore, it answers the question on how much entanglement distillation is optimal. By doing so we propose a unified formalism, describing the whole processing chain, that can be used to make quantitative statements on the relation between the quality and quantity of entangled but noisy quantum states used for generating secure keys.</p>

            <p>Until recently, attosecond optical spectroscopy and quantum optics evolved along non-overlapping directions. In attosecond science, attosecond pulses have been regarded as classical waves, applied to probe electron dynamics on their natural time scale. Here, we transfer fundamental concepts of quantum optics into attosecond physics, enabling control of both the properties of the XUV attosecond pulses and the quantum fluctuations of matter on attosecond time scales. By combining bright squeezed vacuum (BSV) with a strong laser field to drive high-harmonic generation, we transfer the quantum properties of the BSV onto the resulting XUV attosecond pulses. Applying advanced attosecond interferometry, we reconstruct the quantum state of the XUV high harmonics and their associated attosecond pulses with attosecond precision. Finally, we resolve the squeezing of the electron's wavepacket during one of the most fundamental strong-field phenomena - field induced tunneling. The ability to measure and control quantum correlations in both electrons and XUV attosecond pulses establishes a foundation for attosecond quantum electrodynamics, manipulating the quantum state of electrons and photons with sub-cycle precision.</p>

            <h2>Quantum machine learning for efficient reduced order modelling of turbulent flows</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Han Li, Yutong Lou, Dunhui Xiao</p>
            <p>Accurately predicting turbulent flows remains a central challenge in fluid dynamics due to their high dimensionality and intrinsic nonlinearity. Recent developments in quantum algorithms and machine learning offer new opportunities for overcoming the computational barriers inherent in turbulence modeling. Here we present a new hybrid quantum-classical framework that enables faster-than-real-time turbulence prediction by integrating machine learning, quantum computation, and fluid dynamics modeling, in particular, the reduced-order modeling. The novel framework combines quantum proper orthogonal decomposition (QPOD) with a quantum-enhanced deep kernel learning (QDKL) approach. QPOD employs quantum circuits to perform efficient eigenvalue decomposition for low-rank flow reconstruction, while QDKL exploits quantum entanglement and nonlinear mappings to enhance kernel expressivity and dynamic prediction accuracy. The new method is demonstrated on three benchmark turbulent flows, our architecture achieves significantly improved predictive accuracy at reduced model ranks, with training speeds up to 10 times faster and parameter counts reduced by a factor of 1/N compared to classical counterparts, where N is the input dimensionality. Although constrained by current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware, our results demonstrate the potential of quantum machine learning to transform turbulence simulation and lay a solid foundation for scalable, real-time quantum fluid modeling in future quantum computers.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tengyu Ai, Qi Bi, Yuxin He, Jia Liu, Xiao-Ping Wang</p>
            <p>We investigate whether collider experiments can reach the quantum limit of precision, defined by the quantum Fisher information (QFI), using only classical observables such as particle momenta. As a case study, we focus on the $\tau^+\tau^-$ system and the decay channel $\tau \to \pi \nu$, which offers maximal spin-analyzing power and renders the decay a projective measurement. We develop a general framework to determine when collider measurements can, in principle, saturate the QFI in an entangled biparticle system, and this framework extends naturally to other such systems. Within this framework, QFI saturation occurs if and only if the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD) commutes with a complete set of orthonormal separable projectors associated with collider-accessible measurements. This separability condition, reflecting the independence of decay amplitudes, is highly nontrivial. To meet this condition, a key requirement is that the spin density matrix be rank-deficient, allowing the SLD sufficient freedom. We show that the classical Fisher information asymptotically saturates the QFI for magnetic dipole moments and CP-violating Higgs interactions in selected phase-space regions, but not for electric dipole moments. These results bridge quantum metrology and collider physics, providing a systematic method to identify quantum-optimal sensitivity in collider experiments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daigo Oue, Mário G. Silveirinha</p>
            <p>Here, we demonstrate that vacuum fluctuations can induce lateral forces on a small particle positioned near a translation-invariant uniform non-Hermitian substrate with chiral gain. This type of non-Hermitian response can be engineered by biasing a low-symmetry conductor with a static electric field and is rooted in the quantum geometry of the material through the Berry curvature dipole. The chiral-gain material acts as an active medium for a particular circular polarisation handedness, while serving as a passive, dissipative medium for the other polarisation handedness. Owing to the nonreciprocity and gain characteristics, momentum is continuously exchanged in a preferred direction parallel to the surface between the test particle and the surrounding electromagnetic field, giving rise to lateral forces. Interestingly, the force can be viewed as a fluctuation-induced drag analogous to a Hall force. Indeed, although the gain is driven by an electric current, the resulting force acts perpendicular to the bias -- unlike conventional current-drag effects. This effect stems from the skewed propagation characteristics of surface modes and gain-momentum locking. Our theory reveals a Hall-like asymmetry in the field correlations and establishes a novel link between quantum geometry and fluctuation-induced phenomena, offering new possibilities for nanoscale control via tailored electromagnetic environments.</p>

            <p>Ergodic isolated quantum many-body systems satisfy the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), i.e., the expectation values of local observables in the system's eigenstates approach the predictions of the microcanonical ensemble. However, the ETH does not specify what happens to expectation values of local observables within an energy window when the average over disorder realizations is taken. As a result, the expectation values of local observables can be distributed over a relatively wide interval and may exhibit nontrivial structure, as shown in [Phys. Rev. B \textbf{104}, 214201 (2021)] for a quasiperiodic disordered system for site-resolved magnetization. We argue that the non-Gaussian form of this distribution may \textit{falsely} suggest non-ergodicity and a breakdown of ETH. By considering various types of disorder, we find that the functional forms of the distributions of matrix elements of the site-resolved magnetization operator mirror the distribution of the onsite disorder. We argue that this distribution is a direct consequence of the local observable having a finite overlap with moments of the Hamiltonian. We then demonstrate how to adjust the energy window when analyzing expectation values of local observables in disordered quantum many-body systems to correctly assess the system's adherence to ETH, and provide a link between the distribution of expectation values in eigenstates and the outcomes of quench experiments.</p>

            <p>Vacuum cavity control of quantum materials is the engineering of quantum materials systems through electromagnetic zero-point fluctuations. In this work we articulate a generic mechanism for vacuum optical control of correlated electronic order: Casimir control, where the zero-point energy of the electromagnetic continuum, the Casimir energy, depends on the properties of the material system. To assess the experimental viability of this mechanism we focus on the Casimir stabilization of fluctuating nematic order. In nematic Fermi liquids, different orientations of the electronic order are often energetically degenerate. Thus, while local domains of fixed orientation may form, thermal disordering inhibits long range order. By engineering the electromagnetic environment of the electronic system, however, we show that the Casimir energy can be used as a tool to preferentially stabilize particular orientations of the nematic order. As a concrete example, we examine the interplay between a birefringent crystal -- which sources an anisotropic electromagnetic environment -- and a quantum Hall stripe system, an archetypal nematic Fermi fluid. We show that for experimentally feasible setups, the anisotropy induced by the orientation dependent Casimir energy can be $10^4$ times larger than other mechanisms known to stabilize quantum Hall stripes. This finding convincingly implies that our setting may be realized with currently available experimental technology. Having demonstrated that the Casimir energy can be used to stabilize fluctuating nematic order, we close by discussing the implications for recent terahertz cavity experiments on quantum Hall stripes, as well as pave the road towards broader Casimir control of competing correlated electronic phases.</p>

            <p>Phase transitions in one-dimensional lattice systems are well established and have been extensively studied within both Hermitian and non-Hermitian frameworks. In this work, we extend this understanding to a more general setting by investigating localization and delocalization transitions and the behavior of the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) using a tight-binding model on a generalized random graph lattice. Our model incorporates three key parameters, asymmetric hopping $\Delta$, on-site disorder $W$, and a random long-range coupling $p$ that together define the underlying random graph structure. By varying $p$, $\Delta$, and the disorder strength, we explore the interplay between topology, randomness, and non-Hermiticity in determining localization properties. Our results show a strong competition between skin effect driven and Anderson driven localizations across parameter regimes. Notably, even in the presence of strong disorder, skin effect driven localization coexists with Anderson-driven localization. We further discuss the relevance of these results to machine-learning architectures and information propagation in complex networks and other real-world problems.</p>

We complement this approach with a classical optimization algorithm to produce arbitrary numbers of Ingleton-violating states, with tunable degrees of violation, and empirically determine the maximal attainable violation for Ingleton's inequality. Our analysis reveals characteristic patterns of quantum resources that accompany Ingleton violation. A comprehensive statistical analysis shows that Ingleton-violating states occupy sharply-defined, isolated regions of the Hilbert space, and are extremely rare. Together, these results establish a unified computational toolkit for studying entropy vector dynamics, tracking quantum resource evolution, and engineering circuits with controlled information-theoretic features.</p>

            <p>The development of nonlinear and frequency-tunable superconducting microwave circuits for operation in large magnetic fields is of high relevance for hybrid quantum systems such as spin resonance spectrometers, microwave quantum magnonics, dark matter axion detectors or flux-mediated optomechanics. With these exciting perspectives in mind, we investigate niobium-based circuits with integrated nano-constriction quantum interferometers in magnetic in-plane fields up to several hundred mT. Our experiments reveal an unexpected and pronounced field-induced asymmetry in the bias-flux response of the circuits, which is demonstrated to originate from a field-induced Josephson-diode effect within the nano-constrictions and which considerably enhances the circuit figures of merit in a magnetic field. An intuitive macroscopic Josephson-diode model attributes the effect to inhomogeneous constriction properties and provides us with the diode current-phase relation as a function of the in-plane field. Finally, we demonstrate that in the diode-state the circuit Kerr nonlinearity is bimodal in frequency, not only eliminating alternative explanations for the bias-flux-asymmetries but also being potentially useful for quantum circuit applications. Overall, our report underlines that niobium nano-constriction circuits belong to the most promising candidates for high-field hybrid quantum systems and reveals the untapped potential of combining Josephson nano-diodes with microwave quantum circuits.</p>

            <p>The excellent sensitivities of quantum sensors are a double-edged sword: minuscule quantities can be observed, but any undesired signal acts as noise. This is challenging when detecting quantities that are obscured by such noise. Decoupling sequences improve coherence times and hence sensitivities, though only AC signals in narrow frequency bands are distinguishable. Alternatively, comagnetometers operate gaseous spin mixtures at high temperatures in the self-compensating regime to counteract slowly varying noise. These are applied with great success in various exotic spin-interaction searches. Here, we propose a method that decouples specific DC fields from DC and AC magnetic noise. It requires any spin cluster where the effect on each individual spin is different for the target field and local magnetic fields, which allows for a different approach compared to comagnetometers. The presented method has several key advantages, including an orders-of-magnitude increase in noise frequencies to which we are resistant. We explore electron-spin nuclear-spin pairs in nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond, with a focus on their merit for light dark-matter searches. Other applications include gradient sensing, quantum memory, and gyroscopes.</p>

            <h2>Adiabatic reverse annealing is robust to low-temperature decoherence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> An Le, Christopher L. Baldwin</p>
            <p>Adiabatic reverse annealing (ARA) is an improvement to conventional quantum annealing (QA) that uses an initial guess at the desired ground state to circumvent problematic phase transitions. Despite encouraging results in the closed-system setting, Ref. [1] has suggested on the basis of numerical simulations that ARA may lose its advantage in the presence of decoherence. Here, we revisit this problem from a more analytical perspective. Using the $p$-spin model as a solvable example, together with the adiabatic master equation to describe the effects of the environment (valid at weak coupling), we show that ARA can in fact succeed in open systems but that the temperature of the environment plays a key role. We first demonstrate that, in the adiabatic limit, the system will follow the instantaneous equilibrium state as long as the protocol does not pass through any (finite-temperature) phase transitions. Given this, there are two distinct mechanisms by which ARA can break down at high temperature: either there are no paths that avoid transitions, or the equilibrium state itself is disordered. When the temperature is sufficiently low that neither of these occur, then ARA succeeds. Remarkably, there are even situations in which the environment benefits ARA: we find parameter values for which no transition-avoiding paths exist at zero temperature but such paths appear at non-zero temperature.</p>

Our method provides a new state of the art for synthesizing typical unitary matrices from $SU(2^n)$ for $n=3, 4, 5$, and we extend it to the subgroups $SO(2^n)$ and $Sp^\ast(2^n)$. We complement this numerical method by a partial proof, which hinges on an open conjecture that relates universality of an ansatz to it having full Jacobian rank almost everywhere.</p>

We present recent advancements on these topics including construction and assembly of block-encodings, and various generalizations of quantum signal processing (QSP) algorithms to perform polynomial transformations. We also highlight the scalability of QSP methods on parallel and distributed quantum architectures. Promising applications in simulation and observable estimation in chemistry, physics, and optimization problems are presented.

            <p>Observation of the quantum Mpemba effect has spurred much interest in its enabling conditions and its relation to the classical counterpart. Here, we consider weakly open many-body quantum systems initialized in different thermal states and examine when the initially farther state relaxes to the (non-equilibrium) steady state faster. We claim that the number of conserved quantities in the unitary part plays a crucial role: the Mpemba effect is possible only when the Hamiltonian commutes with other extensive operators or is integrable. The reason lies in the dynamical evolution happening in spaces of different dimensions. When energy is the only approximately conserved quantity, dissipation pushes the dynamics within a single-parameter manifold of different thermal states. In contrast, for Hamiltonians with several conserved quantities, the dynamics drift in the multi-dimensional space of generalized Gibbs ensembles, whose distance to the steady state is less trivial. We provide numerical results for large system sizes using tensor networks and free-fermion techniques, thereby supporting our claim.</p>

To facilitate this, it is desirable to have robust control of the network in order to be able to provide a reliable service to the end nodes.

This control architecture enables quantum network applications to be executed on end nodes running a modern operating system such as QNodeOS arXiv:2407.18306. In that work, we performed an evaluation of our architecture based on a proof-of-concept implementation. In the course of performing this evaluation, we discovered many outstanding questions and challenges. These relate not only to implementing our specific control architecture, but also to the design of any quantum network control architecture.

            <p>As quantum simulators are scaled up to larger system sizes and lower noise rates, non-Markovian noise channels are expected to become dominant. While provably efficient protocols for Markovian models of quantum simulators, either closed system models (described by a Hamiltonian) or open system models (described by a Lindbladian), have been developed, it remains less well understood whether similar protocols for non-Markovian models exist. In this paper, we consider geometrically local lattice models with both quantum and classical non-Markovian noise and show that, under a Gaussian assumption on the noise, we can learn the noise with sample complexity scaling logarithmically with the system size. Our protocol requires preparing the simulator qubits initially in a product state, introducing a layer of single-qubit Clifford gates and measuring product observables.</p>

            <p>In this thesis, we explore the intersection of two fundamental subfields of quantum information theory: quantum coherence and contextuality. Despite their apparent differences, both areas address key issues relevant to the foundations and applications of quantum theory. By developing a novel graph-theoretic approach, extending a framework recently introduced by Galvão and Brod (Phys. Rev.

Our key contributions include: the development of a graph-theoretic framework for generating coherence and contextuality witnesses; a formal mapping between the inequalities that follows from the work by Galvão and Brod to existing noncontextuality inequalities; the conceptualization of a relational form of quantum coherence; a proof of contextual advantage for the task of quantum interrogation; and the discovery of an infinite family of coherence witnesses that also require quantum states in Hilbert spaces of specific dimensions.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Data Learning of Topological-to-Ferromagnetic Phase Transitions in the 2+1D Toric Code Loop Gas Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shamminuj Aktar, Rishabh Bhardwaj, Andreas Bärtschi, Tanmoy Bhattacharya, Stephan Eidenbenz</p>
            <p>Quantum data learning (QDL) provides a framework for extracting physical insights directly from quantum states, bypassing the need for any identification of the classical observable of the theory. A central challenge in many-body physics is that the identity of quantum phases, especially those with topological order, are often inaccessible through local observables or simple symmetry-breaking diagnostics. Here, we apply QDL techniques to the 2+1-dimensional toric-code loop-gas model in a magnetic field. Ground states are generated across multiple lattice sizes using a parametrized loop-gas circuit (PLGC) with a variational quantum-eigensolver (VQE) approach. We then train a quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) across the full field-parameter range to perform phase classification and capture the overall phase structure. We also employ a physics-aware training protocol that excludes the near-critical region (0.2 <= x <= 0.4)) around (x_c = 0.25), the phase-transition point estimated by quantum Monte Carlo, reserving this window for testing to evaluate the ability of the model to learn the phase transition. In parallel, we implement an unsupervised quantum k-means method based on state overlaps, which partitions the dataset into two phases without prior labeling. Our supervised QDL approach recovers the phase structure and accurately locates the phase transition, in close agreement with previously reported values; the unsupervised QDL approach recovers the phase structure and locates the phase transition with a small offset as expected in finite volumes; both QDL methods outperform classical alternatives. These findings establish QDL as an effective framework for characterizing topological quantum matter, studying finite volume effects, and probing phase diagrams of higher-dimensional systems.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Optical Simulator for Unruh-DeWitt Detector Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tai Hyun Yoon</p>
            <p>We present a quantum-optical platform for simulating relativistic detector-field interactions using entangled nonlinear biphoton sources (ENBSs), realized through phase-controlled single-photon frequency-comb (SPFC) sources. By mapping the dynamical evolution of this system onto the Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detector model, we show that signal-mode excitations emulate detector transitions driven by vacuum fluctuations, while coherently seeded idler modes act as an effective quantum field. This correspondence enables tabletop exploration of Unruh-like excitation, coherence harvesting, and field-induced entanglement. We derive the effective interaction Hamiltonian and Lindblad master equation for two coherently seeded ENBS units and obtain analytical solutions for the signal photon number \(N_{\rm sig}(t)\) and second-order correlation function \(g^{(2)}(0;t)\). Numerical simulations confirm that phase-dependent biphoton dynamics reproduce UDW-type behavior, including tunable excitation and quantum correlations. The output signal state exhibits controllable fidelity, interference visibility, and entanglement entropy as functions of the seeding phase and amplitude. These results establish ENBSs as experimentally accessible quantum simulators of relativistic field phenomena, providing a photonic testbed for analog gravitational effects, vacuum fluctuations, and spacetime-induced coherence-all within reach of current nonlinear-optics technology.</p>

By analyzing the occupations at different frequencies in the emission spectrum, a linear regression suffices in many cases to recognize the relevant parameters of incident squeezed states. Beyond highlighting the general potential of this approach under continuous driving, we illustrate its effectiveness in an explicit nontrivial example where the source is a degenerate optical parametric oscillator (OPO), coupled to a nonlinear polariton microcavity.</p>

            <p>Multiplexing is essential for improving entanglement distribution rates in quantum communication. Frequency multiplexing provides a promising and scalable path toward large-capacity quantum networks. Further progress requires increasing the number of frequency modes and developing broadband photon-pair sources and quantum memories that are spectrally compatible. Here, we report the integration of a cavity-enhanced spontaneous parametric down-conversion source in the telecom C-band with a frequency-multiplexed atomic frequency comb memory. The bow-tie cavity source was simultaneously resonant at 606 nm and 1550 nm, generating non-degenerate photon pairs exhibiting a clustered frequency-comb spectrum. The atomic frequency comb memory, implemented in Praseodymium-doped Yttrium Orthosilicate crystals, provided up to 83 frequency modes with 123 MHz spacing and enabled broadband storage of 606 nm signal photons. By filtering the main cluster, we obtained $32.7 \pm 4.8$ effective modes, as confirmed from coincidence measurements. Importantly, we observed strong nonclassical correlations after storage, with cross-correlation values of $g_{s,i}^{(2)} = 8.1\pm0.7$. Our experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of integrating cavity-enhanced photon-pair sources with rare-earth-ion-doped solid-state memories. The integration reveals a high frequency multiplicity that is essential for scalable quantum networks.</p>

            <p>We propose an scheme for directional single-photon source based on a chiral cavity-magnon system. In this system, the magnon mode in a single-crystal yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere is coupled to only one of two rotating microwave modes in the torus-shaped microwave cavity. When two-photon drives are applied to both ports of the waveguide, the chiral cavity-magnon coupling leads to an unconventional photon blockade in one propagation direction, resulting in directional single-photon emission. The emission direction of the single-photon source can be controlled by reversing the biased magnetic field. Furthermore, we further examine the effects of imperfect chiral cavity-magnon coupling and the coupling between the two cavity modes on the photon blockade behavior. The results show that the system retains robustness in the presence of these nonideal factors, and the unidirectional photon blockade effect remains clearly preserved.</p>

            <p>Parameterised quantum circuit (PQC) based Quantum Reinforcement Learning (QRL) has emerged as a promising paradigm at the intersection of quantum computing and reinforcement learning (RL). By design, PQCs create hybrid quantum-classical models, but their practical applicability remains uncertain due to training instabilities, barren plateaus (BPs), and the difficulty of isolating the contribution of individual pipeline components. In this work, we dissect PQC based QRL architectures through a systematic experimental evaluation of three aspects recurrently identified as critical: (i) data embedding strategies, with Data Reuploading (DR) as an advanced approach; (ii) ansatz design, particularly the role of entanglement; and (iii) post-processing blocks after quantum measurement, with a focus on the underexplored Output Reuse (OR) technique. Using a unified PPO-CartPole framework, we perform controlled comparisons between hybrid and classical agents under identical conditions. Our results show that OR, though purely classical, exhibits distinct behaviour in hybrid pipelines, that DR improves trainability and stability, and that stronger entanglement can degrade optimisation, offsetting classical gains. Together, these findings provide controlled empirical evidence of the interplay between quantum and classical contributions, and establish a reproducible framework for systematic benchmarking and component-wise analysis in QRL.</p>

            <p>Quantum battery has enormous potential for development, and quantum battery capacity is an important indicator of quantum battery. In this work, we mainly study the evolution of quantum battery capacity of GHZ state and GHZ-like states under Markovian channels in the tripartite system. We find that under the depolarizing channel and bit-phase flip channel, the battery capacity shows a brief sudden death of the capacity. And we also find that under the dephasing channel, the battery capacity gradually decreases and tends to a constant, that is, the frozen capacity. We show that the battery capacity monotonically decreases for GHZ state under the amplitude damping channel on the first subsystem. And we study the variation of capacity under the Markovian channels n times on the first subsystem using the GHZ state. We can observe that under the amplitude damping and dephasing channels, the battery capacity decreases and tends to a constant, i.e. frozen capacity, and the larger n, the earlier this phenomenon occurs. We also investigate the evolution of capacity under three independent same type Markovian channels. We have also conducted corresponding research on GHZ-like states.</p>

We prepare the atomic ensemble by driving the system to its steady state with varying Rabi frequencies $\Omega$ that go from the weak $\Omega \ll \Gamma$ to the strong driving regime $\Omega \gg \Gamma$, where $\Gamma$ is the single-atom decay rate. We investigate the early-time dynamics in the transition between the strong and weak driving regimes using: i) angular-dependent observables such as the light emitted by the cloud, and ii) global observables, i.e., the excited state population. When driving the cloud on-resonance, we find that as a function of the driving frequency, the behavior of the collected light at certain angles transitions from the single-photon subradiant regime to a superradiant regime while the behavior of the excited state population does not show superradiance. The experiment shows good agreement with numerical predictions in the regime of parameters under study.</p>

            <p>The Kerr parametric oscillator (KPO) has recently attracted considerable attention from the perspective of its applications to quantum information processing, and understanding its properties is an important challenge. Spectroscopic measurements serve as an effective means of elucidating detailed information about the system, such as the energy-level structure and the transition matrix elements of the KPO. Conventional spectroscopy requires the drive frequency to match an energy spacing with a nonzero transition matrix element. In recent years, a phenomenon called photonic resonance (PR) has been theoretically predicted in KPO spectroscopy. Specifically, resonance occurs under the condition that the detuning is set to $n/2$ times the Kerr nonlinearity, where $n$ is a natural number. However, under this condition the transition matrix element vanishes, and thus the mechanism by which photonic resonance (PR) arises has remained unclear. In this work, we aim to elucidate the physical origin of PR observed in KPO spectroscopy. We first performed theoretical calculations and experiments of spectroscopic measurements, confirming that PR can indeed be observed and that the theoretical and experimental results are in qualitative agreement. We then carried out an analytical study under the assumption of an ideal noiseless environment. Our analysis revealed that, although the transition matrix element of the external field expressed in the system's energy eigenbasis is zero, higher-order perturbative effects induce Rabi oscillations between the ground and excited states. Furthermore, numerical simulations in a time domain including the effect of decoherence demonstrated that coherent oscillations decay, leading to the appearance of PR.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kai Ryen Bush, Kjetil Børkje</p>
            <p>Entanglement between remote quantum mechanical systems enables a range of quantum information tasks in communication, computation and distributed sensing. Large numbers of entangled subsystems also require experimentally accessible and practically feasible methods of verifying the genuine, i.e., simultaneous, entanglement of all subsystems. We have derived a class of entanglement witnesses suitable for $W$-states, which are states where a single excitation is coherently distributed across subsystems initially in their ground state or a state with low thermal occupation, e.g., via detection of a Raman-scattered photon. The entanglement is witnessed through violation of an inequality involving number statistics, which can be measured via detection of subsequent Raman-scattered photons. Unlike conventional, partially tomographic, witnesses, our method is experimentally accessible for both multipartite and continuous variable systems. The thermal robustness of the method is quantified by the initial thermal occupations for which violation occurs. As an alternative approach, we have derived an inequality which tests the nonlocal, or quantum coherent, nature of the photon measurement backaction which produces the $W$-state. Violation of this alternative inequality implies the entanglement of the resulting state given the assumption of a separable initial state, under less stringent thermal constraints than the general entanglement witness. Our results are applicable to all Raman-scattering systems which can exhibit sufficient degrees of quantum indistinguishability.</p>

This configuration enables radiation-pressure interactions that generate strong quantum correlations between the two sideband modes. Remarkably, these correlations persist even at large numbers of thermal quanta if one properly engineers the optical cooling rate of the mechanical mode. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of robust entanglement under ambient conditions, opening new avenues for hybrid quantum technologies based on mechanical interfaces and continuous-variable quantum information processing.</p>

            <p>We report the first experimental realization of a scalable basic cell for quantum routing, enabling coherent control and exchange of microwave photons between two spatially separated superconducting waveguides coupled via a single transmon qubit. The cell was characterized at 10 mK with an average input signal of approximately 1 photon at approximately 6 GHz, and with the qubit biased to its optimal point to minimize sensitivity to external magnetic fluctuations. By combining steady-state and time-domain measurements, we reconstructed the key parameters of the system, including qubit relaxation and dephasing, waveguide-qubit couplings, and cross-waveguide photon transfer efficiency. The observed performance is consistent with a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian formalism and demonstrates clear limits set by flux bias, temperature, and photon number, in agreement with flux- and temperature-induced dephasing models. Crucially, the cell operates reliably at the single-photon level, and in the high-photon regime we directly observe photon dressing induced by the qubit. These results establish a versatile platform for studying open quantum system phenomena and pave the way for scalable implementations of quantum routing and network nodes.</p>

            <h2>Enhancing Infrared Laser Dissociation of Molecules with the Electromagnetic Vacuum</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Johan F. Triana, Felipe Herrera</p>
            <p>Controlling bond breaking is a long-standing goal in molecular physics. Infrared nanocavities are currently being developed for reaching exotic coupling regimes of cavity QED with a few molecules, but it is not well understood how chemical reactions would proceed in such systems. To address this, we study infrared laser photodissociation of a single CS$_{2}$ molecule with a stretching mode that strongly interacts with a resonant infrared vacuum, subject to a strong laser field that either resonantly drives the molecule at its fundamental vibration frequency or injects photons at the cavity resonance. We show that the intensities required for photodissociation are significantly lower inside the cavity than in free space, with a strong dependence on the type of driving condition. By directly injecting photons into the cavity, the molecule dissociates with two orders of magnitude less laser energy than by directly driving the vibrational mode. This photodissociation enhancement is a purely quantum mechanical effect that cannot be captured semi-classically. The intracavity ladder climbing dynamics is substantially modified relative to free space due to vacuum-induced admixing a large number of vibrational quantum numbers and the cavity field acting as a surrogate molecular mode that strongly interacts with the dissociative vibrational motion. Our work provides fundamental mechanistic understanding of chemical dynamics that can be used for designing new types of nanophotonics experiments that probe single-molecule chemistry.</p>

            <h2>Optimal Thermalization under Indefinite Causal Order with Identical and Asymmetric Baths</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Neeraj Sharma, Parveen Kumar</p>
            <p>Indefinite causal order (ICO), in which the order of quantum operations is placed in a coherent superposition, has been demonstrated to enhance various information-processing tasks. Here, we investigate its impact on the thermodynamic processes generated by thermalizing quantum channels. We consider a two-level system interacting with two thermal baths under a quantum SWITCH, with the channel order controlled coherently by an ancillary qubit. We derive closed-form expressions for the effective inverse temperature $\beta_f$ of the postselected system state for both identical and distinct bath temperatures, and identify the control-qubit parameters that maximize heating or cooling. Our analysis reveals how the diagonal and coherent components of the control-qubit state contribute separately to the temperature shift, and how their interplay enables departures from the thermal response attainable under any fixed causal order. Bath asymmetry enhances these effects, while reduced purity of the control qubit state suppresses them. These results provide a systematic framework for assessing the thermodynamic capabilities of ICO and clarify the role of quantum coherence as a tunable thermodynamic resource.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Felix Roser, Etienne M. Springer, Hans Peter Büchler, Nicolai Lang</p>
            <p>We propose a scalable and noise-resilient protocol for the detection of the entanglement transition in a projective version of the transverse field Ising model. Entanglement transitions are experimentally difficult to observe due to the inherent randomness of projective measurements and noise in large-scale experimental settings. Our approach combines error correction algorithms with classical shadow tomography to overcome both problems. This allows for experimentally accessible upper and lower bounds on the entanglement transition without postselection or full state tomography. These bounds remain robust under noise and their sharpness is a measure of the noise rate.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Masked Autoencoders for Vision Learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emma Andrews, Prabhat Mishra</p>
            <p>Classical autoencoders are widely used to learn features of input data. To improve the feature learning, classical masked autoencoders extend classical autoencoders to learn the features of the original input sample in the presence of masked-out data. While quantum autoencoders exist, there is no design and implementation of quantum masked autoencoders that can leverage the benefits of quantum computing and quantum autoencoders. In this paper, we propose quantum masked autoencoders (QMAEs) that can effectively learn missing features of a data sample within quantum states instead of classical embeddings. We showcase that our QMAE architecture can learn the masked features of an image and can reconstruct the masked input image with improved visual fidelity in MNIST images. Experimental evaluation highlights that QMAE can significantly outperform (12.86% on average) in classification accuracy compared to state-of-the-art quantum autoencoders in the presence of masks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dharma P. Permana, Mazena Mackoit Sinkevičienė, Julius Ruseckas, Hamid R. Hamedi</p>
            <p>We investigate the propagation of an optical vector vortex weakly interacting with a coherently prepared atomic medium (phaseonium) in a three-level $\Lambda$ configuration. The vector beam consists of vortex pulse pairs with right- and left-circular polarizations, corresponding to opposite spin angular momentum (SAM), and carrying opposite orbital angular momentum (OAM) charges $\pm l$. We show that during the propagation of the vortex pairs, analytically obtained in the linear regime, the medium inherits the topology of the vortex pair, mapping the OAM onto a spatially structured atomic coherence. This mapping produces $2|l|-$fold azimuthal transparency structures that reshape the beam intensity from a ring into a petal-like pattern. The OAM-structured atomic coherence induces a corresponding optical anisotropy within the medium, which feeds back into the propagating vector beam, resulting in optical spin-orbit coupling manifested as SAM exchange, rotation, and evolution of polarization textures. Depending on the initial ground-state population of the phaseonium, the polarization state evolves between left-circular, linear, and right-circular polarizations.</p>

            <p>Leakage to non-computational states is a source of correlated errors in both time and space that limits the effectiveness of quantum error correction (QEC) with superconducting circuits. We present and experimentally demonstrate a high-fidelity, leakage reduction unit (LRU) operating concurrently with transmon measurement without incurring time overhead. Adapted from double-drive reset of population (DDROP), the protocol utilizes simultaneous drives on the transmon and its readout resonator, leveraging the dispersive shift to create a directional process that returns the transmon to the computational subspace. The LRU achieves a 98.4% leakage removal fraction without compromising the computational-state assignment fidelity (99.2%). We combine LRU-enhanced measurement and neural-network decoding to successfully suppress logical error rates in both memory and stability QEC experiments without any post-selection.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> María Laura Olivera-Atencio, Jesús Casado-Pascual, Denis Lacroix</p>
            <p>We introduce a reinforcement learning algorithm designed to identify the fixed points of a given quantum operation. The method iteratively constructs the unitary transformation that maps the computational basis onto the basis of fixed points through a reward-penalty scheme based on quantum measurements. In cases where the operation corresponds to a Hamiltonian evolution, this task reduces to determining the Hamiltonian eigenstates. The algorithm is first benchmarked on random Hamiltonians acting on two and three qubits and then applied to many-body systems of up to six qubits, including the transverse-field Ising model and the all-to-all pairing Hamiltonian. In both cases, the algorithm is demonstrated to perform successfully; in the pairing model, it can also reveal hidden symmetries, which can be exploited to restrict learning to specific symmetry sectors. Finally, we discuss the possibility of post-selecting high-fidelity states even when full convergence has not been reached.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saavanth Velury, Yuxuan Wang</p>
            <p>We propose a momentum-space based variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) framework for simulating quasiparticle excitations in interacting quantum many-body systems on near-term quantum devices. Leveraging translational invariance and other symmetries of the Hamiltonian, we reconstruct the momentum-resolved quasiparticle excitation spectrum through targeted simulation of low-lying excited states using VQE. We construct a translationally symmetric variational ansatz designed to evolve a free-fermion particle-hole excited state with definite momentum $q$ to an excited state of the interacting system at the same momentum, employing a fermionic fast Fourier transform (FFFT) circuit coupled to a Hamiltonian Variational Ansatz (HVA) circuit. Even though the particle number is not explicitly conserved in the variational ansatz, the correct quasiparticle state is reached by energetic optimization. We benchmark the performance of the proposed VQE implementation on the XXZ Hamiltonian, which maps onto the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid in the fermionic representation. Our numerical results show that VQE can capture the low-lying excitation spectrum of the bosonic quasiparticle/two-spinon dispersion of this model at various interaction strengths. We estimate the renormalized velocity of the quasiparticles by calculating the slope of the dispersion near zero momentum using the VQE-optimized energies at different system sizes, and demonstrate that it closely matches theoretical results obtained from Bethe ansatz. Finally, we highlight extensions of our proposed VQE implementation to simulate quasiparticles in other interacting quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Florian Koch, Yu-Min Hu, Jan Carl Budich</p>
            <p>Open quantum systems far from thermal equilibrium can exhibit remarkable physical phenomena including topological properties without a direct equilibrium counterpart. Along these lines, in periodically driven dissipative systems within the effective non-Hermitian (NH) Hamiltonian approximation spectral winding numbers have been linked to intriguing nonreciprocal transport properties. Here, going beyond an NH Hamiltonian description, we introduce and study a microscopic lattice model of a driven open quantum system described by a Markovian quantum master equation, which exhibits the mentioned spectral winding within a NH approximation. By encompassing quantum jump processes in the topological analysis, we uncover a distinct \emph{jump-induced} topological phase, which qualitatively corresponds to the richer non-reciprocal transport properties of the fully quantum model. In addition, we find that the NH skin effect, i.e.~the accumulation of a macroscopic number of eigenstates at one end of the system, is already visible in the transient dynamics even for systems with periodic boundary conditions. Our results exemplify the subtle correspondence between NH topological properties and physical manifestations of Liouvillian topological properties in open quantum systems, thus providing a theoretical framework towards understanding unidirectional transport in quantum dissipative Floquet dynamics.</p>

            <p>Solving excited states is a challenging task for interacting systems. For one-dimensional critical systems, however, excited states can be directly accessed from the eigenvectors of the local effective Hamiltonian that is constructed from the ground state obtained by variational matrix product state (MPS) optimization. Despite its numerical success, the theoretical mechanism underlying this method has remained largely unexplored. In this work, we provide a conformal field theory (CFT) perspective that helps elucidate this connection. The key insight is that this construction effectively uses a truncated basis of ground-state Schmidt vectors to represent excited states, where the contribution of each Schmidt vector can be expressed as a CFT correlation function and shown to decay with increasing Schmidt index. The CFT analysis further predicts an entanglement-spectrum transition of excited states as the ratio of the subsystem size to the total system size is varied. Our numerical results support this picture and demonstrate a reorganization of the entanglement spectrum into distinct conformal towers as this ratio changes.</p>

Our approach generalizes to an arbitrary number of degrees of freedom and does not rely on the slow-roll approximation. The computational routine is numerically efficient and allows users to configure arbitrary sequences of decoherence events, with full control over their duration, shape, amplitude and effective wavelength range. The resulting outputs are compatible with nonlinear numerical codes, enabling studies of how decoherence effects propagate during reheating.</p>

            <p>The development of quantum materials for single-photon emission is crucial for the advancement of quantum information technology. Although significant advancement has been witnessed in recent years for single photon sources in near infrared band ({\lambda}~700-1000 nm), several challenges have yet to be addressed for ideal single photon emission at the telecommunication band. In this study, we present a droplet-epitaxy strategy for O-band to C-band single-photon source based semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) using metal-organic vapor-phase epitaxy (MOVPE). Via investigating the growth conditions of the epitaxial process, we have successfully synthesized InAs/InP QDs with narrow emission lines spanning a broad spectral range of {\lambda}~1200-1600 nm. The morphological and optical properties of the samples were characterized using atomic force microscopy and micro photoluminescence spectroscopy. The recorded single-photon purity of a plain QD structure reaches (g(2)(0) = 0.16), with a radiative recombination lifetime as short as 1.5 ns.

            <p>Non-reciprocity is a key resource for pushing the performance of photonic devices beyond the fundamental limits imposed by Lorentz reciprocity. Here, we report on the realization of an optical sensor where non-reciprocal light propagation allows detecting small perturbations with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) that scales exponentially with system size. Our approach is based on encoding two Hatano-Nelson (HN) chains, which is equivalent to the bosonic Kitaev model, within the resonant modes of an electro-optics frequency comb. Non-reciprocal light propagation in the frequency domain is realized through simultaneous phase and amplitude modulation of the circulating field inside the optical fiber cavity. We demonstrate the sensing of a small modulating tone coupling the two HN chains with a SNR that scales exponentially with the lattice size, formed from up to 70 frequency modes per chain. Our results open a new paradigm in non-Hermitian sensing, with potential applications in remote sensing including the optical readout of superconducting circuits.</p>

            <p>Recently, the coherent modified Redfield theory (CMRT) has been widely used to simulate the excitation-energy-transfer (EET) processes in photosynthetic systems. However, the numerical simulation of the CMRT is computationally expensive when dealing with large-scale systems, e.g. photosystem I (PSI) and II (PSII). On the other hand, the chemical reaction and fluorescence loss traditionally treated by the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian approach may result in significantly error in a wide range of parameters. To address these issues, we introduce a quantum jump approach (QJA) based on the CMRT to simulate the evolution of photosynthetic complexes including both the chemical reaction and fluorescence loss. The QJA shows higher accuracy and efficiency in simulating the EET processes. The QJA-CMRT approach may provide a powerful tool to design and optimize artificial photosynthetic systems, which benefits future innovation in the field of energy.</p>

            <p>We investigate the exceptional points (EPs) and their pseudospectra in black hole perturbation theory. By considering a Gaussian bump modification to the Regge-Wheeler potential with variable amplitude, position, and width parameters, $(\varepsilon,d,\sigma_0)$, a continuous line of EPs (exceptional line, EL) in this three-dimensional parameter space is revealed. We find that the vorticity $\nu=\pm1/2$ and the Berry phase $\gamma=\pi$ for loops encircling the EL, while $\nu=0$ and $\gamma=0$ for those do not encircle the EL. Through matrix perturbation theory, we prove that the $\epsilon$-pseudospectrum contour size scales as $\epsilon^{1/q}$ at an EP, where $q$ is the order of the largest Jordan block of the Hamiltonian-like operator, contrasting with the linear $\epsilon$ scaling at non-EPs. Numerical implements confirm this observation, demonstrating enhanced spectral instability at EPs for non-Hermitian systems including black holes.</p>

B} \textbf{110}, 214438 (2024)}. It was shown that in contrast to the translationally invariant models, such a spin liquid stabilizes a gapped ground state with a finite irrational flux density. In this work, we analyze the strong bond-anisotropic limit of the model and demonstrate that the aperiodic lattice geometry naturally generates a hierarchy of exponentially separated coupling constants in the resulting toric code Hamiltonian. Furthermore, a perturbative magnetic field leads to anomalous localization properties where an anyonic excitation sequentially delocalizes over subsets of sites forming equipotential contours in the quasicrystal. In addition, certain background flux configurations, together with the underlying geometry, give rise to strictly localized eigenstates that remain decoupled from the rest of the spectrum. Using numerical studies, we uncover the key mechanisms responsible for this unconventional localization behavior. Our study highlights that topologically ordered phases, in the presence of geometrical constraints can lead to highly anomalous localization properties of fractionalized charges.</p>

            <p>The decay out-states of unstable Standard Model (SM) particles provide a unique, well-defined intrinsic quantum-information probe of the SM parameter space. We use Higgs decays as a test case: after tracing out kinematics, we compute entanglement among final-state spins and colors across all decay channels and impose a near-maximal entanglement-entropy criterion. This criterion yields quantitative indications for fundamental parameters. Within the SM, the entanglement entropy exhibits a global maximum close to the observed Higgs mass and the measured $W$ mass, the latter being equivalent to the $SU(2)_L$ gauge coupling. In a two-parameter kappa framework, applying the same criterion points to an SM-like balance between vector and fermion couplings, constraining the ratio of the sector-wide rescalings. These results suggest that entanglement extremality can serve as a complementary handle on fundamental parameters.</p>

            <p>Studies of quantum field entanglement in de Sitter space based on the von Neumann entropy of local patches have concluded that curvature enhances entanglement between regions and their complements. Similar conclusions about entanglement enhancement have been reached in analyses of Fourier modes in the cosmological patch of de Sitter space. We challenge this interpretation by adopting a fully local approach: examining entanglement between pairs of field modes compactly supported within de Sitter's cosmological patch. Our approach is formulated in terms of the properties of a metric tensor and an associated complex structure induced by the Bunch-Davies vacuum on the classical phase space. We find that increasing curvature increases correlations between local modes but, somewhat counterintuitively, decreases their entanglement. Our methods allow us to characterize how entanglement is spatially distributed, revealing that a cosmological constant, even if tiny, qualitatively alters the vacuum's entanglement structure. We show that our results are compatible with previous entropy-based studies when properly interpreted. Our findings have implications for entanglement between observables generated during cosmic inflation.</p>

            <p>Identifying experimental signatures of anyons, which exhibit fractional exchange statistics, remains a central challenge in the study of two-dimensional topologically ordered systems. Previous theoretical work has shown that the threshold behavior in linear response spectroscopy can reveal the fractional exchange statistics between an anyon and its antiparticle. In this work, we extend this framework to nonlinear, two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy. We demonstrate by analyzing time-ordered four-point correlation functions that the threshold behavior of nonlinear response functions encodes the fractional statistics between general pairs of anyons that can combine to any composite topological charge. This feature in particular provides a powerful probe for unambiguously distinguishing non-Abelian anyons, which can form multiple composite charges with distinct nontrivial braid statistics. Our approach is validated using numerical simulations that are consistent with the correct fractional exchange statistics for both the Abelian anyons in the toric code and non-Abelian Ising anyons.</p>

The spin-1 XY model is known to host a family of such exceptional states originating from long-lived quasiparticle excitations that exhibit anomalously low entanglement entropy and long-time periodic revivals, resulting in weak ergodicity breaking. We study the stability of these scarred states against typical U(1) symmetry preserving perturbations in the XY chain. While perturbation theory can describe the deformed scar states at small system sizes, finite-size scaling of the perturbation matrix elements indicates that the scars ultimately thermalize in larger chains. Nonetheless, we demonstrate that the long-range order associated with the scars decays under the perturbation, and we estimate the relaxation timescale of oscillatory dynamics in certain local observables to be of order $\lambda^{-2}$, where $\lambda$ is the perturbation strength.</p>

            <p>Edge states of chiral topologically ordered phases are commonly described by chiral Luttinger liquids, effective theories that are exact only in the hydrodynamic limit. Motivated by recent bulk observations of fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) in two-dimensional materials and by synthetic realizations in ultracold atoms, we revisit this framework and quantify deviations from the hydrodynamic limit due to lattice effects. Using a combination of analytical arguments and numerical simulations, we disentangle universal from nonuniversal edge properties. We outline experimental probes in excitonic FCIs and in ultracold atom systems, and in particular propose time-resolved edge spectroscopy to directly access the predicted exponents and velocities.</p>

It allows us to enhance a natural model of quantum computation -- permutational quantum computing (PQC) -- and define a more powerful model: PQC+. While PQC was shown to be efficiently classically simulatable, we exhibit a problem which can be efficiently solved on PQC+ machine, whereas no classical polynomial time algorithm is known; thus providing evidence against PQC+ being classically simulatable. We further discuss practical quantum machine learning algorithms which can be carried out in the paradigm of PQC+.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giulia Piccitto, Giuliano Chiriacò, Davide Rossini, Angelo Russomanno</p>
            <p>We study the asymptotic bipartite entanglement in various integrable and nonintegrable models of monitored fermions. We find that, for the integrable cases, the entanglement versus the system size is well fitted, over more than one order of magnitude, by a function interpolating between a linear and a power-law behavior. Up to the sizes we are able to reach, a logarithmic growth of the entanglement can be also captured by the same fit with a very small power-law exponent. We thus propose a characterization of the various entanglement phases using the fitting parameters. For the nonintegrable cases, as the staggered t-V and the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models, the numerics prevents us from spanning different orders of magnitude in the size, therefore we fit the asymptotic entanglement versus the measurement strength and then look at the scaling with the size of the fitting parameters. We find two different behaviors: for the SYK we observe a volume-law growth, while for the t-V model some traces of an entanglement transition emerge. In the latter models, we study the localization properties in the Hilbert space through the inverse participation ratio, finding an anomalous delocalization with no relation with the entanglement properties. Finally, we show that our function fits very well the fermionic logarithmic negativity of a quadratic model in ladder geometry with stroboscopic projective measurements.</p>

            <h2>Partial independence suffices to rule out Real Quantum Theory experimentally</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mirjam Weilenmann, Nicolas Gisin, Pavel Sekatski</p>
            <p>The role of complex quantities in quantum theory has been puzzling physicists since the beginnings. It is thus natural to ask whether, in order to describe our experiments, the mathematical structure of complex Hilbert spaces it is built on is really necessary. Recently, it was shown that this structure is inevitable in network scenarios with independent sources. More precisely, Real Quantum Theory cannot explain the predictions of (Complex) Quantum Theory [Renou et al., Nature 600, 2021]. Here, we revisit the independence assumption underlying this work. We show that assuming partial independence is sufficient for showing the inadequacy of Real Quantum Theory. We derive a tradeoff between source independence and the Bell value achievable in Real Quantum Theory, which also lower bounds the source correlations required to explain previous experiments by means of real quantum systems. We further show that 1 bit of entanglement is necessary and sufficient for recovering the complex quantum correlations by means of Real Quantum Theory in the scenario from [Renou et al., Nature 600, 2021]. Finally, building on [McKague et al., PRL 102, 2009], we provide a construction to simulate any complex quantum setup with m independent sources by means of Real Quantum Theory, by allowing the sources to share a m real-qubit entangled state in the first round of the experiment.</p>

            <h2>Thermalization and irreversibility of an isolated quantum system</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xue-Yi Guo</p>
            <p>The irreversibility and thermalization of many-body systems can be attributed to the erasure of spread non-equilibrium state information by local operations. This thermalization mechanism can be demonstrated by the sequence of $\hat{O}_i(t_i)$, where $\hat{O_i}$ is a local operator, $\hat{O_i}(t_i) = e^{i\hat{H}t_i} \hat{O_i} e^{-i\hat{H}t_i}$, $\hat{H}$ is the system Hamiltonian, $t_i$ can take positive, negative, or zero values, and the sequence is arranged according to the subscript $i$. We numerically demonstrate the information erasure of initial non-equilibrium quantum states through such sequence in a one-dimensional Hubbard model. During this process, the system's entanglement entropy increases monotonically toward a stable value. By incorporating this information erasure mechanism into an isolated system, our numerical simulations reveal that in this completely isolated system, a thermalization process emerges.</p>

            <p>Frequency-modulation schemes offer an alternative to standard Rabi pulses for realizing robust quantum operations. In this work, we investigate short-duration population transfer between the ground and first excited states of a ladder-type qutrit, with the goal of minimizing leakage into the second excited state. Our multiobjective approach seeks to reduce the maximum transient second-state population and maximize detuning robustness. Inspired by two-state models -- such as the Allen-Eberly and Hioe-Carroll models -- we extend these concepts to our system, exploring a range of pulse families, including those with super-Gaussian envelopes and polynomial detuning functions. We identify Pareto fronts for pulse models constructed from one of two envelope functions paired with one of four detuning functions. We then analyze how each Pareto-optimal pulse parameter influences the two Pareto objectives as well as amplitude robustness.</p>

            <p>Forthcoming quantum devices will require high-fidelity information transfer across a many-body system. We formulate the criterion for lossless signal propagation and show that a single qubit can play the role of an antenna, collecting large amounts of information from a complex system. We derive the condition under which the antenna, far from the source and embedded in a many-body interacting medium, can still collect the complete information. A striking feature of this setup is that a single qubit antenna can receive even the full signal amplified by the entanglement of the source. As a consequence, the recovery of this information can be performed with simple single-qubit operations on the antenna (which we fully characterize) rather than with multi-qubit measurements of the source. Finally, we discuss the control of the system parameters necessary for lossless signal propagation. A method discussed here could improve the precision of quantum devices and simplify metrological protocols.</p>

            <p>Long-range quantum systems, in which the interactions decay as $1/r^{\alpha}$, are of increasing interest due to the variety of experimental set-ups in which they naturally appear. Motivated by this, we study fundamental properties of long-range spin systems in thermal equilibrium, focusing on the weak regime of $ \alpha>D$. Our main result is a proof of analiticity of their partition functions at high temperatures, which allows us to construct a classical algorithm with sub-exponential runtime $\exp(\mathcal{O}(\log^2(N/\epsilon)))$ that approximates the log-partition function to small additive error $\epsilon$. As by-products, we establish the equivalence of ensembles and the Gaussianity of the density of states, which we verify numerically in both the weak and strong long-range regimes. This also yields constraints on the appearance of various classes of phase transitions, including thermal, dynamical and excited-state ones. Our main technical contribution is the extension to the quantum long-range regime of the convergence criterion for cluster expansions of Kotecký and Preiss.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xue-Yi Guo</p>
            <p>The irreversible entropy increase described by the second law of thermodynamics is fundamentally tied to thermalization and the emergence of equilibrium. In the first part of our work (Ref: arXiv.2503.04152), we constructed an isolated gas system model and numerically demonstrated irreversible growth of entanglement entropy caused by erasure of spread non-equilibrium state information. Here, we mathematically prove that for a typical macroscopic system in a non-equilibrium state $|\phi_0\rangle$, the quantum state $|\phi'_0\rangle = \hat{O}(t)|\phi_0\rangle$ will inevitably evolve toward equilibrium. Our work demonstrates that the second law of thermodynamics, and consequently the ergodic hypothesis in statistical physics, can be understood and proven from a quantum information perspective. From this perspective, the second law can be stated as: In typical macroscopic physical systems, the spreading and erasure of non-equilibrium information is inevitable.</p>

            <p>The verification of quantum entanglement is essential for quality control in quantum communication. In this work, we propose an efficient protocol to directly verify the two-qubit entanglement of a known target state through a single expectation value measurement. Our method provides exact entanglement quantification using the currencence measure without performing quantum state tomography. We prove the existence of a unitary transformation that drives the initial state of a two-qubit system to a designated final state, where the trace over a chosen observable directly yields the concurrence of the initial state. Furthermore, we implement an optimal control process of that transformation and demonstrate its effectiveness through numerical simulations. We also show that this process is robust to environmental noise. Our approach offers advantages in directly verifying entanglement with low circuit depth, making it suitable for industrial-scale quality control of entanglement generation. Our results, presented here, provide mathematical justification for our earlier computational experiments.</p>

            <p>The study of out-of-equilibrium quantum many-body dynamics remains one of the most exciting research frontiers of physics, standing at the crossroads of our understanding of complex quantum phenomena and the realization of quantum advantage. Quantum algorithms for the dynamics of quantum systems typically require deep quantum circuits whose accuracy is compromised by noise and imperfections in near-term hardware. Thus, reducing the depth of such quantum circuits to shallower ones while retaining high accuracy is critical for quantum simulation. Variational quantum compilation methods offer a promising path forward, yet a core difficulty persists: ensuring that a variational ansatz $V$ faithfully approximates a target unitary $U$. Here we leverage Pauli propagation techniques to develop a strategy for compressing circuits that implement the dynamics of large two-dimensional (2D) quantum systems and beyond. As a concrete demonstration, we compress the dynamics of systems up to $30 \times 30$ qubits and achieve accuracies that surpass standard Trotterization methods by orders of magnitude at identical circuit depths. To experimentally validate our approach, we execute the compiled ansatz on Quantinuum's H1 quantum processor and observe that it tracks the system's dynamics with significantly higher fidelity than Trotterized circuits without optimization. Our circuit compression scheme brings us one step closer to a practical quantum advantage by allowing longer simulation times at reduced quantum resources and unlocks the exploration of large families of hardware-friendly ansätze.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chanaprom Cholsuk, Tobias Vogl, Viktor Ivády</p>
            <p>The negatively charged boron vacancy $V_B^-$ defect in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has recently emerged as a promising spin qubit for sensing due to its high-temperature spin control and versatile integration into van der Waals structures. While extensive experiments have explored their coherence properties, much less is known about the spin relaxation time $T_1$ and its control-parameter dependence. In this work, we develop a parameter-free spin dynamics model based on the cluster-expansion technique to investigate $T_1$ relaxation mechanisms at low temperature. Our results reveal that the $V_B^-$ center constitutes a strongly coupled electron spin-nuclear spin core, which necessitates the inclusion of the coherent dynamics and derived memory effects of the three nearest-neighbor nitrogen nuclear spins. Using this framework, this work closely reproduces the experimentally observed $T_1$ time at $B = 90\,\mathrm{G}$ and further predicts the $T_1$ dependence on external magnetic field in the $0 \le B \le 2000\,\mathrm{G}$ interval, when the spin relaxation is predominantly driven by electron-nuclear and nuclear-nuclear flip-flop processes mediated by hyperfine and dipolar interactions. This study establishes a reliable and scalable approach for describing $T_1$ relaxation in $V_B^-$ centers and offers microscopic insights to support future developments in nuclear-spin-based quantum technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fernando Gago-Encinas, Christiane P. Koch</p>
            <p>Universal quantum computing requires the ability to perform every unitary operation, i.e., evolution operator controllability. In view of developing resource-efficient quantum processing units (QPUs), it is important to determine how many local controls and qubit-qubit couplings are required for controllability. Unfortunately, assessing the controllability of large qubit arrays is a difficult task, due to the exponential scaling of Hilbert space dimension. Here we show that it is sufficient to connect two qubit arrays that are evolution operator controllable by a single entangling two-qubit gate in order to obtain a composite qubit array that is evolution operator controllable. The proof provides a template to build up modular QPUs from smaller building blocks with reduced numbers of local controls and couplings. We illustrate the approach with two examples, consisting of 10, respectively 127 qubits, inspired by IBM quantum processors.</p>

            <p>We present a novel application of the Extended Kalman Smoother (EKS) for highly accurate frequency estimation from free spin precession signals of polarized $^3$He. Traditional approaches often rely on nonlinear least-squares fitting, which can suffer from limited robustness to signal decay and time-dependent frequency shifts. By contrast, our EKS-based method captures both amplitude and frequency variations with minimal tuning, adapting automatically to fluctuations via an expectation-maximization algorithm. We benchmark the technique in extensive simulations that emulate realistic spin precession signals with exponentially decaying amplitudes and noisy frequency drifts. Compared to least-squares fits with fixed block lengths, EKS systematically reduces estimation errors, particularly when frequencies evolve or signal-to-noise ratios are moderate to high. We further validate these findings with experimental data from a free-precession decay $^3$He magnetometer. Our results indicate that EKS-based analysis can substantially improve precision in nuclear magnetic resonance-based magnetometry, where accurate frequency estimation underpins absolute field determinations. This versatile approach promises to enhance the stability and accuracy of future highly accurate measurements.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Imre Varga</p>
            <p>Characterizing complexity and criticality in quantum systems requires diagnostics that are both computationally tractable and physically insightful. We introduce a measure of quantum state complexity for n-qubit systems, defined as the divergence between the Shannon or von Neumann entropy of the computational basis distribution and the second-order Rényi entropy. This quantity is particularly powerful as the latter Rényi entropy is directly related to state purity, linear entropy, and the inverse participation ratio, providing a clear physical grounding. While other Rényi orders could be used, the second order offers a deep and established connection to these key physical quantities. We first validate the measure in canonical noise channels, showing it peaks at the boundary between quantum and classical regimes. We then demonstrate its power in many-body physics. For systems exhibiting a many-body localization transition - including deformed random matrix ensembles and a disordered Heisenberg spin chain - the complexity measure reliably signals the crossover from integrable/localized to quantum-chaotic/ergodic phases. Crucially, the maximum complexity occurs in the non-ergodic yet extended states at the transition, precisely capturing the critical region where the system is neither fully localized nor thermalized. Furthermore, within the chaotic phase, the measure correlates with the survival probability of local excitations, revealing a spectrum of thermalization properties. Our results establish that the entropic complexity is a simple, versatile, and effective probe for identifying nontrivial quantum regimes and transitions giving a new and alternative insight into such systems.</p>

            <p>Machine-learning (ML) ansätze have greatly expanded the accuracy and reach of variational quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations, in particular when exploring the manifold quantum phenomena exhibited by spin systems. However, the scalability of QMC is still compromised by several other bottlenecks, and specifically those related to the actual evaluation of observables based on random deviates that lies at the core of the approach. Here we show how the set-transformer architecture can be used to dramatically accelerate or even bypass that step, especially for time-consuming operators such as powers of the magnetization. We illustrate the procedure with a range of examples structured around quantum spin systems with long-range interactions, and comprising both regressions (to predict observables) and classifications (to detect phase transitions). Moreover, we show how transfer learning can be leveraged to reduce the training cost by reusing knowledge from different systems and smaller system sizes.</p>

            <p>Quantum sensors leverage nonclassical resources to achieve sensing precision at the Heisenberg limit, surpassing the standard quantum limit attainable through classical strategies. However, a critical issue is that the environmental noise induces rapid decoherence, fundamentally limiting the realizability of the Heisenberg limit. In this Letter, we propose a quantum digital twin protocol to overcome this issue. The protocol first establishes observable-constrained state reconstruction to infer random errors in the decoherence process, and then utilizes reinforcement learning to derive adaptive compensatory control strategies. Demonstrated across discrete, continuous variable and multi-qubit circuit systems, our approach bypasses quantum state tomography's exponential overhead and discovers optimal control schemes to restore the Heisenberg limit. Unlike quantum error correction or mitigation schemes requiring precise noise characterization and ancillary qubits, our autonomous protocol achieves noise-resilient sensing through environment-adaptive control sequencing. This work establishes quantum digital twin as a generic methodology for quantum control, proposing a noise-immune paradigm for next-generation quantum sensors compatible with NISQ-era experimental constraints.</p>

            <p>Exceptional points (EPs), singularities in non-Hermitian systems where eigenvalues and eigenstates coalesce, exhibit a dramatically enhanced response to perturbations compared to Hermitian degeneracies. This makes them exceptional candidates for sensing applications. The spectral splitting of an $N$th-order EP scales with perturbation strength $\epsilon$ over a wide range, from $\epsilon$ to $\epsilon^{1/N}$. Although the exact scaling exponent can be determined in principle by solving the characteristic equation, this approach becomes analytically intractable for large $N$ and often fails to yield useful physical insight. In this work, we develop a theory to directly predict the scaling exponent from the matrix positions of the perturbation. By using the Jordan block structure of the unperturbed Hamiltonian, we show that the splitting exponent can be analytically determined when the matrix positions of the perturbation satisfy some specific conditions. Our analytical framework provides a useful design principle for engineering perturbations to achieve a desired spectral response, facilitating the development of EP-based sensors.</p>

In QSS-VQE, the electronic structure Hamiltonian is first mapped to a qubit representation and subsequently embedded into the Fock space of bosonic qumodes, enabling efficient state preparation and reduced quantum resource requirements. We demonstrate the performance of QSS-VQE through simulations of molecular excited states, including dihydrogen and a conical intersection in cytosine. Additionally, we explore a bosonic model Hamiltonian to assess the expressivity of qumode gates, identifying regimes where qumode-based implementations outperform purely qubit-based approaches.

            <p>Quantum light propagation through turbulent atmosphere has become a subject of intensive research, spanning both theoretical and experimental studies. This interest is driven by its important applications in free-space quantum communication, remote quantum sensing, and environmental monitoring. At the same time, this phenomenon itself poses an intriguing fundamental problem. A consistent theoretical description typically makes explicit assumptions about the measurement scheme at the receiver station and/or the method of quantum-information encoding. A common and straightforward approach encodes the information in quantum states of a quasi-monochromatic mode, representing a pulsed Gaussian beam. Atmospheric turbulence induces random distortions of the pulse shape and, consequently, random fluctuations of the transmittance through the receiver aperture. These fluctuations, characterized by the probability distribution of transmittance (PDT), directly affect the quantum state of the received light. In this paper we examine various analytical models of the PDT, validate them through numerical simulations, and assess their range of applicability. Furthermore, we extend the analysis beyond the standard ensemble-averaging approach, recognizing that realistic experiments typically involve time averaging. This requires a detailed examination of the underlying random process, including the study of temporal correlations and their impact on nonclassical properties of electromagnetic radiation.</p>

While their connection to quantum nonlocality via Bell inequalities is well established, their link to quantum contextuality remains largely unexplored. We establish a graph theoretic connection between contextuality and UPBs. First, an equivalence between Klyachko-Can-Binicioğlu-Shumovsky (KCBS) vectors and the Pyramid UPB is shown and then by constructing a one parameter family of UPB vectors, a quantitative connection between `contextuality strength' and bound entanglement of states associated with the corresponding UPB is demonstrated. This equivalence is extended to generalized KCBS vectors and the GenPyramid UPB. A new class of minimal UPBs in $\mathbb{C}^3 \otimes \mathbb{C}^n$ is constructed using Lovász-optimal orthogonal representations (LOORs) of cycle graphs and their complements which we term the GenContextual UPB. Any minimal UPB in this dimension is shown to be graph-equivalent to the GenContextual UPB. We briefly discuss the distinguishability properties of GenContextual UPB. In the reverse direction, we observe that the constituent vectors of the QuadRes UPB are LOORs of Paley graphs.

            <h2>From single-particle to many-body chaos in Yukawa--SYK: theory and a cavity-QED proposal</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Pascual Solis, Alex Windey, Soumik Bandyopadhyay, Andrea Legramandi, Philipp Hauke</p>
            <p>Understanding how quantum systems transition from integrable to fully chaotic behavior remains a central open problem in physics. The Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model provides a paradigmatic framework for studying many-body chaos and holography, yet it captures only the strongly correlated limit, leaving intermediate regimes unexplored. Here, we investigate the Yukawa--SYK (YSYK) model, where bosonic fields mediate random fermionic interactions, and demonstrate that it naturally bridges single-particle and many-body chaos. Using spectral and dynamical chaos markers, we perform a comprehensive finite-size characterization of the YSYK model. We show that the interaction strength acts as a tunable control parameter interpolating between the SYK$_2$ and SYK$_4$ limits, and introduce a framework enabling direct and quantitative comparison with these benchmark models. In the intermediate regimes, we uncover distinct dynamical regimes marked by partial ergodicity breaking, prethermalization plateaus, and incomplete scrambling. Finally, we propose a feasible optical-cavity implementation of the YSYK model using ultra-cold atoms. Our results establish the YSYK model as a unifying platform connecting single-particle and many-body chaos, paving the way for experimental observation of these phenomena.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shoichi Murakami, Shunsuke Hiraoka, Toshiki Kobayashi, Takashi Yamamoto, Rikizo Ikuta</p>
            <p>We demonstrate channel-selective frequency up-conversion from telecom wavelengths around 1540 nm for optical fiber communication to visible wavelengths around 780 nm, based on second-order optical nonlinearity in a cavity of the converted modes. In our experiment, we selectively convert a light from any frequency mode within frequency-multiplexed telecom signals to a desired output mode, determined by the cavity resonances. Based on the experimental results of the frequency up-conversion, we derive the signal-to-noise ratio of the process at the single-photon level, and discuss its applicability to channel-selective quantum frequency conversion (CS-QFC) in the context of frequency-multiplexed quantum networks. Finally, we describe specific use cases of the CS-QFC, which show its utility as a reconfigurable switching element in frequency-multiplexed networks, particularly for selectively performing Bell-state measurements between two photons originating from different frequencies.</p>

            <p>A qubit sensor with an electric dipole moment acquires an additional contribution to its depolarization rate when it is placed in the vicinity of a polar or dielectric material as a consequence of electrical noise arising from polarization fluctuations in the latter. Here, we characterize this relaxation rate as a function of experimentally tunable parameters such as sample-probe distance, probe-frequency, and temperature, and demonstrate that it offers a window into dielectric properties of insulating materials over a wide range of frequencies and length scales. We discuss the experimental feasibility of our proposal and illustrate its ability to probe a variety of phenomena, ranging from collective polar excitations to phase transitions and disorder-dominated physics in relaxor ferroelectrics. Our proposal paves the way for a novel table-top probe of polar and dielectric materials in a parameter regime complementary to existing tools and techniques.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rajeev Singh</p>
            <p>The macroscopic energy-momentum and spin densities of relativistic spin hydrodynamics are obtained from the ensemble average of their respective microscopic definitions (quantum operators). These microscopic definitions suffer from ambiguities, meaning that one may obtain different forms of symmetric energy-momentum tensor and spin tensor through pseudogauge transformations (or, in other words, Belinfante improvement procedure). However, this ambiguity may be fixed if we obtain these currents using Noether's second theorem instead of widely used Noether's first theorem. The second theorem fixes the super-potential determined by local symmetry, thereby selecting a unique physically consistent pseudogauge. In this article, we use Noether's second theorem to derive energy-momentum and spin currents without the need of pseudogauge transformations for free Dirac massive particles with spin one-half.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shi Jin, Nana Liu, Chuwen Ma, Yizhe Peng, Yue Yu</p>
            <p>The Schrödingerization method converts linear partial and ordinary differential equations with non-unitary dynamics into systems of Schrödinger-type equations with unitary evolution. It does so via the so-called warped phase transformation that maps the original equation into a Schrödinger-type equation in one higher dimension \cite{Schrshort,JLY22SchrLong}. The original proposal used a particular initial function in the auxiliary space that did not achieve optimal scaling in precision. Here we show that, by choosing smoother initial functions in auxiliary space, Schrödingerization \textit{can} in fact achieve near optimal and even optimal scaling in matrix queries. We construct three necessary criteria that the initial auxiliary state must satisfy to achieve optimality. This paper presents detailed implementation of four smooth initializations for the Schrödingerization method: (a) the error function and related functions, (b) the cut-off function, (c) the higher-order polynomial interpolation, and (d) Fourier transform methods. Method (a) achieves optimality and methods (b), (c) and (d) can achieve near-optimality. A detailed analysis of key parameters affecting time complexity is conducted.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> HongZheng Liu, YiNuo Tian, Zhiyue Wu</p>
            <p>The singularities prevalent in classical thermodynamics largely stem from the "postulate of equal a priori probabilities" neglecting the physical constraints imposed by computational complexity. This paper introduces Complexity Window Thermodynamics (CWT), a framework that characterizes the observer's "ignorance" via a finite complexity budget, thereby naturally smoothing out singular behaviors associated with phase transitions and negative temperatures within this window. We derive a generalized First Law of Thermodynamics driven by a complexity generation potential, which incorporates "information processing work," and demonstrate a universal action-time bound constraining the growth of complexity. CWT not only offers a unified perspective on critical phenomena in condensed matter and the black hole information problem but also suggests that the total generatable complexity of the universe is comparable in order of magnitude to its holographic entropy. Thus, it paves a new pathway for a resource-theoretic unification of thermodynamics, quantum computation, and gravity.</p>

            <p>Multi-invariants are local-unitary invariants of state replicas introduced as potential probes of multipartite entanglement and correlations in quantum many-body systems. In this paper, we investigate two multi-invariants for tripartite pure states, namely multi-entropy and dihedral invariant. We compute the (genuine) multi-entropy for Lifshitz groundstates, and obtain its analytical continuation to noninteger values of Rényi index. We show that the genuine multi-entropy can be expressed in terms of mutual information and logarithmic negativity, a relation that also holds for stabilizer states. For general tripartite pure states, we demonstrate that dihedral invariants are related to Rényi reflected entropies. In particular, we show that the dihedral permutations of replicas are equivalent to the reflected construction, or alternatively to the realignment of density matrices.</p>

            <h2>Engineering multi-mode bosonic squeezed states using Monte-Carlo optimization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jieqiu Shao, Diego A. R. Dalvit, Lukasz Cincio, Bharath Hebbe Madhusudhana</p>
            <p>Bosonic systems, such as photons and ultracold atoms, have played a central role in demonstrating quantum-enhanced sensing. Quantum entanglement, through squeezed and GHZ states, enables sensing beyond classical limits. However, such a quantum advantage has so far been confined to two-mode bosonic systems, as analogous multi-mode squeezed states are non-trivial to prepare. Here, we develop a Monte-Carlo based optimization technique which can be used to efficiently engineer a Hamiltonian control-sequence for multi-mode bosonic systems to prepare multi-mode squeezed states. Specifically, we consider a Bose-Einstein condensate in an optical lattice, relevant for applications in gravimetry and gradiometry, and demonstrate that metrologically useful squeezed states can be generated using the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian which includes on-site atomic interactions, tunable via Feshbach resonances. By analyzing the distribution (density) of the quantum Fisher information (QFI) over the Hilbert space, we identify a characteristic \textit{intermediate scaling} of the QFI: $\mathcal{O}(N^2 L+L^2 N)$, which lies between the standard quantum limit (SQL) and the Heisenberg limit (HL) for $N$ atoms in $L$ modes. We show that in general, within the Hilbert space there is a finite, $\mathcal{O}(1)$ measure subset of Hilbert space with an intermediate QFI scaling. Therefore, one can find a Hamiltonian control sequence using a Monte Carlo optimization over random control sequences, that produces a state with intermediate scaling of the QFI. We assume an experimentally accessible range of the control parameters in the Hamiltonian resources and show that the intermediate scaling can be readily achieved. Our results indicate that the HL can be approached in quantum gravimetry using realistic experimental parameters for systems with $L=\mathcal{O}(1)$ and $N\gg L$.</p>

            <h2>Nonclassicality of a Macroscopic Qubit-Ensemble via Parity Measurement Induced Disturbance</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lorenzo Braccini, Debarshi Das, Ben Zindorf, Stephen D. Hogan, John J. L. Morton, Sougato Bose</p>
            <p>We propose an experimental scheme to test the nonclassicality of a macroscopic ensemble of qubits, through the violation of the classical notion of macrorealism (MR) via the fundamental measurement-induced disturbance of quantum systems. An electromagnetic resonator is used to probe the parity of the qubit-ensemble. The action of sequential measurements allows the nonclassicality of whole ensemble to manifest itself, in the ideal case, irrespective of its size. This enables to probe the macroscopic limits of quantum mechanics as the qubit-ensemble is, effectively, a single large spin of many $\hbar$ units. Even as $\hbar \rightarrow 0$ in comparison to the total angular momentum of the ensemble, a constant amount of violation of MR is found in the noiseless case. However, environmental decoherence and inhomogeneity of qubit-electromagnetic field couplings precipitate the quantum-to-classical transition. This implies that Bohr's correspondence principle is not fundamental, but a consequence of practical limitations. We outline an implementation with a variety of qubits (superconducting qubits, spins in semiconductors, and Rydberg atoms) coupled to a coplanar waveguide resonator, and - via the corresponding noise analysis - find that violation of MR is detectable up to $100$ qubits via current technology.</p>

            <h2>Generation of spin-squeezed states using dipole-coupled spins</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yifan Song, Nabiha Hasan, Susumu Takahashi</p>
            <p>Spins in solids and molecules are promising for applications of quantum sensing technology. The sensitivity of the quantum sensing depends on how precisely spin observables can be determined in the measurement, and is intrinsically limited by the uncertainties of the observables. The use of a spin-squeezed state in a quantum sensor can reduce the uncertainty below the standard quantum limit when combined with an appropriate measurement procedure. Here, we discuss the simulation study of the generation of a squeezed state in an interacting spin system. We show that a spin system coupled by the magnetic dipole interaction can create a squeezed state. Model systems to realize the spin squeezing experimentally are also discussed. In addition, we find that a squeezed state is a type of entangled state. The present work paves the way to realize a squeezed state using a spin system to build a quantum sensor network with improved sensitivity, and to use it for the detection of quantum entanglement.</p>

            <p>Optical cavities provide a powerful means to engineer light-matter hybrid states by coupling confined electromagnetic fields with matter excitations. Achieving in situ control of the coupling strength is essential for investigating how such hybridization evolves with the coupling strength. In this work, we use a symmetry-changing structural phase transition in lead halide perovskites to reversibly tune the phonon-photon coupling strength, leveraging the fact that their phonon frequencies and oscillator strengths are dictated by lattice symmetry. Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy of MAPbI3 embedded in nanoslot cavities reveals three polariton branches above the critical temperature Tc = 162.5 K, and the emergence of an additional branch below Tc, activated by a new phonon mode in the low-temperature phase. The full dispersion is accurately reproduced using a multimode Hopfield model, confirming that all normalized coupling strengths remain in the ultrastrong coupling regime. These results demonstrate symmetry-controlled tuning of ultrastrong coupling via phonon engineering in optical cavities.</p>

            <p>In this work, we investigate the emergence and control of genuine tripartite entanglement in a hybrid cavity quantum electrodynamics architecture consisting of two linearly coupled single mode resonators, one of which interacts coherently with a two level atom. An analytical framework is developed in a weak driving regime, where the system dynamically supports a delocalized hybrid excitation shared by the two photonic modes and the atomic degree of freedom. Tripartite concurrence fill has been used to characterize and identify parameter regimes of maximal multipartite quantum correlation that can be generated in this model. Additionally, we demonstrate how dissipative rates and detuning asymmetries govern the conversion of bipartite entanglement into a genuinely tripartite state, establishing a controllable transition from localized Jaynes Cummings correlations to delocalized photonic atomic entanglement networks. These findings outline a clear route to engineering steady state multipartite quantum resources in coupled cavity QED platforms, with direct relevance to quantum networking, distributed quantum information processing, and photonic state routing in scalable quantum architectures.</p>

However, under the resonance condition, exact solutions can be obtained, offering insight into a variety of physical scenarios. In this work, we study the resonant TDJC model considering different modulations of the atom-field coupling. The model is presented and an analytical solution derived in a didactic way, allowing us to examine how time-dependent couplings affect atomic population inversion and atom-field entanglement. We also consider an atom traversing a partially cooled cavity, which induces periodicity and reveals the combined effects of atomic motion and thermal fluctuations. The Bloch vector is used to analyze the dynamics of the system, including the atomic state purity, and reveals phenomena such as atomic dipole alignment with the field due to the oscillating coupling, as well as atomic population trapping, which arises by increasing the initial mean thermal photon number.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhehao Yi, Rahul Bhadani</p>
            <p>Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) combine the advantages of classical optimization and quantum computation, making them one of the most promising approaches in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. However, when optimized using gradient descent, VQAs often suffer from the vanishing gradient problem, commonly known as the barren plateau. Various methods have been proposed to mitigate this issue. In this work, we propose a hybrid approach that integrates a classical proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller with a neural network to update the parameters of variational quantum circuits. We refer to this method as NPID, which aims to mitigate the barren plateau. The proposed algorithm is tested on randomly generated quantum input states and random quantum circuits with parametric noise to evaluate its universality, and additional simulations are conducted under different noise rates to examine its robustness. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated based on its convergence speed toward the target cost value. Simulation results show that NPID achieves a convergence efficiency 2-9 times higher than NEQP and QV, with performance fluctuations averaging only 4.45% across different noise levels. These results highlight the potential of integrating classical control theory into quantum optimization, providing a new perspective for improving the trainability and stability of variational quantum algorithms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chih-Chun Wang</p>
            <p>Density functional theory (DFT) is an indispensable ab initio method in both quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics. Based on recent advancements in reduced density matrix functional theory (RDMFT), a variant of DFT that is believed to be better suited for strongly correlated systems, we construct a mathematical framework generalizing all ground state functional theories, which in particular applies to fermionic, bosonic, and spin systems. We show that within the special class of such functional theories where the space of external potentials forms the Lie algebra of a compact Lie group, the $N$-representability problem is readily solved by applying techniques from the study of momentum maps in symplectic geometry, an approach complementary to Klyachko's famous solution to the quantum marginal problem. The ``boundary force'', a diverging repulsive force from the boundary of the functional's domain observed in previous works but only qualitatively understood in isolated systems, is studied quantitatively and extensively in our work. Specifically, we present a formula capturing the exact behavior of the functional close to the boundary. In the case where the Lie algebra is abelian, a completely rigorous proof of the boundary force formula based on Levy-Lieb constrained search is given. Our formula is a first step towards developing more accurate functional approximations, with the potential of improving current RDMFT approximate functionals such as the Piris natural orbital functionals (NOFs). All key concepts and ideas of our work are demonstrated in translation invariant bosonic lattice systems.</p>

            <p>The quantum Mpemba effect (QME) is a phenomenon observed in many-body systems where initial systems configurations farther from equilibrium can be observed to equilibrate faster than configurations that are closer to it. By considering noise induced error in the initial system state preparation, we analyse the robustness of various models exhibiting the QME. We demonstrate that exponentially accelerated thermalisation in open system dynamics modelled by a Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad master equation is highly sensitive to noise induced deviations in the initial state, making this approach to accelerated thermalisation difficult to achieve. In contrast, we demonstrate that accelerated restoration of symmetry in $U(1)$ symmetric random unitary circuits via increased initial symmetry breaking is robust in the presence of state preparation error. When large errors are present in the state preparation, we show that this can in fact induce a higher rate of symmetry restoration and a stronger QME.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qiu-Yi Chen, Feng Qiao, Zu-Jian Ying</p>
            <p>Quantum Rabi model (QRM) is a fundamental model for light-matter interactions, the finite-component quantum phase transition (QPT) in the QRM has established a paradigmatic application for critical quantum metrology (CQM). However, such a paradigmatic application is restricted to a local regime of the QPT which has only a single critical point. In this work we propose a globalized CQM in the QRM by introducing an auxiliary nonlinear term which is realizable and can extend the critical point to a continuous critical regime. As a consequence, a high measurement precision is globally available over the entire coupling regime from the original critical point of the QRM down to the weak-coupling limit, as demonstrated by the globally accessible diverging quantum Fisher information in dynamics. We illustrate a measurement scheme by quadrature dynamics, with globally criticality-enhanced inverted variance as well as the scaling relation with respect to finite frequencies. In particular, we find that the globally high measurement precisions still survive in the presence of decoherence. Our proposal paves a way to break the local limitation of QPT of the QRM in CQM and enables a broader application, with implications of applicability in realistic situation.</p>

            <p>Understanding the quantum evolution of light in nonlinear media is central to the development of next-generation quantum technologies. Yet modeling these processes remains computationally demanding, as the required resources grow rapidly with photon number and phase-space resolution. Here we introduce a tensor-network approach that efficiently captures the dynamics of nonlinear optical systems in a continuous-variable representation. Using the matrix product state (MPS) formalism, both quantum states and operators are encoded in a highly compressed form, enabling direct numerical integration of the Schrödinger equation. We demonstrate the method by simulating degenerate spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) and show that it accurately reproduces established theoretical benchmarks - energy conservation, pump depletion, and quadrature squeezing - even in regimes where conventional Fock-basis simulations become infeasible. For high-intensity pump fields ($\alpha = 100$), the MPS representation achieves compression ratios above $3\cdot 10^3$ while preserving physical fidelity. This framework opens a scalable route to modeling multimode quantum light and nonlinear optical phenomena beyond the reach of traditional methods.</p>

            <p>Entanglement is a central resource in quantum technologies, and the realization of photonic entanglement necessarily relies on interaction with matter. Resonance fluorescence (RF), originating from the coherent interaction between a driving field and a two-level system, plays a pivotal role in quantum optics. Here, we demonstrate a novel route to entanglement generation based on RF from a single quantum dot. Rather than relying on generation of multiphoton states, our approach directly exploits vacuum-one-photon number superposition states created under resonant excitation. By delocalizing this superposition via a beam splitter, we realize time-bin entanglement and observe a clear violation of the Clauser-Horn-Shimony-Holt Bell inequality using Franson-type interferometry. Our scheme removes the need for multiphoton generation, simplifies the experimental requirements, and establishes a scalable pathway toward solid-state entangled photon sources.</p>

            <h2>Topological Quantum Transducers in a Hybrid Rydberg Atom System</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pei-Yao Song, Jin-Lei Wu, Weibin Li, Shi-Lei Su</p>
            <p>We propose a topological transport platform for microwave-to-optical conversion at the single-photon level in a Rydberg atom-cavity setting. This setting leverages a hybrid dual-mode Jaynes-Cummings (JC) configuration, where a microwave resonator couples an optical cavity mediated by a Rydberg atom ensemble. Our scheme uniquely enables the formation of Fock-state lattices (FSLs), where photon hopping rates depend on photon numbers in individual sites. We identify an inherent zero-energy mode corresponding to the dark state of the dual-mode JC model. This enables to build a high-efficiency single-photon transducer, which realizes topologically protected photon transport between the microwave and optical modes. Crucially, we show analytically that the FSL features continuous variations of the winding number. Our work establishes a robust mechanism for efficient quantum transduction in synthetic dimensions and opens avenues for exploring topological physics with continuous winding numbers in the atom-cavity system.</p>

            <p>Magic is a non-classical resource whose efficient manipulation is fundamental to advancing efficient and scalable fault-tolerant quantum computing. Quantum advantage is possible only if both magic and entanglement are present. Of particular interest is non-local magic- the fraction of the resource that cannot be distilled (or erased) by local unitary operations - which is a necessary feature for quantum complex behavior. We perform the first experimental demonstration of non-local magic in a superconducting Quantum Processing Unit (QPU). Direct access to the QPU device enables us to identify and characterize the dominant noise mechanisms intrinsic to the quantum hardware. We observe excellent agreement between theory and experiment without the need for any free parameter in the noise modeling of our system and shows the experimental capability of harnessing both local and non-local magic resources separately, thereby offering a promising path towards more reliable pre-fault-tolerant quantum devices and to advance hardware-aware research in quantum information in the near term. Finally, the methods and tools developed in this work are conducive to the experimental realization of efficient purity estimation (featuring exponential speedup) and the decoding of Hawking radiation from a toy-model of a Black Hole.</p>

            <h2>Intelligent Inverse Design of Multi-Layer Metasurface Cavities for Dual Resonance Enhancement of Nanodiamond Single Photon Emitters</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Omar A. M. Abdelraouf</p>
            <p>Single-photon emitters (SPEs) based on nitrogen-vacancy centers in nanodiamonds (neutral NV0 (wavelength 575 nm) and negative NV- (wavelength 637 nm)) represent promising platforms for quantum nanophotonics applications, yet their emission efficiencies remain constrained by weak light-matter interactions. Multi-layer metasurfaces (MLM) offer unprecedented degrees of freedom for efficient light manipulation beyond conventional single-material metasurfaces, enabling dual-resonance cavities that can simultaneously enhance pump excitation and SPE collection. However, traditional trial-and-error and forward optimization methods face significant challenges in designing these complex structures due to the vast parameter space and computational demands. Here, we present NanoPhotoNet-Inverse, an artificial intelligence-driven inverse design framework based on a hybrid deep neural network architecture. This model efficiently performs inverse design of two dual-resonance MLM cavities to amplify pump and SPE emissions of different vacancies in nanodiamond and improve SPE collection. Our approach achieves inverse design prediction efficiency exceeding 98.7%, demonstrating three orders of magnitude amplification in SPE count rate and 50 picosecond lifetime, significantly surpassing conventional cavity designs. These remarkable enhancements in emission rates and collection efficiency position our platform as a transformative technology for advancing quantum communication networks, quantum computing architectures, quantum sensing applications, and quantum cryptography systems. Therefore, it opens new pathways for intelligent photonic device engineering in quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Scalable spin squeezing from spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tommaso Comparin, Fabio Mezzacapo, Martin Robert-de-Saint-Vincent, Tommaso Roscilde</p>
            <p>Spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) is a property of Hamiltonian equilibrium states which, in the thermodynamic limit, retain a finite average value of an order parameter even after a field coupled to it is adiabatically turned off. In the case of quantum spin models with continuous symmetry, we show that this adiabatic process is also accompanied by the suppression of the fluctuations of the symmetry generator -- namely, the collective spin component along an axis of symmetry. In systems of $S=1/2$ spins or qubits, the combination of the suppression of fluctuations along one direction and of the persistence of transverse magnetization leads to spin squeezing -- a much sought-after property of quantum states, both for the purpose of entanglement detection as well as for metrological uses. Focusing on the case of XXZ models spontaneously breaking a U(1) (or even SU(2)) symmetry, we show that the adiabatically prepared states have nearly minimal spin uncertainty; that the minimum phase uncertainty that one can achieve with these states scales as $N^{-3/4}$ with the number of spins $N$; and that this scaling is attained after an adiabatic preparation time scaling linearly with $N$. Our findings open the door to the adiabatic preparation of strongly spin-squeezed states in a large variety of quantum many-body devices including e.g. optical lattice clocks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lorenzo Fioroni, Vincenzo Savona</p>
            <p>From fundamental sciences to economics and industry, discrete optimization problems are ubiquitous. Yet, their complexity often renders exact solutions intractable, necessitating the use of approximate methods. Heuristics inspired by classical physics have long played a central role in this domain. More recently, quantum annealing has emerged as a promising alternative, with hardware implementations realized on both analog and digital quantum devices. Here, we develop a heuristic inspired by quantum annealing, using Generalized Coherent States as a parameterized variational Ansatz to represent the quantum state. This framework allows for the analytical computation of energy and gradients with low-degree polynomial complexity, enabling the study of large problems with thousands of spins. Concurrently, these states capture non-trivial entanglement, crucial for the effectiveness of quantum annealing. We benchmark the heuristic on the three-dimensional Edwards-Anderson model and compare the solution quality and runtime of our method to other popular heuristics. Our findings suggest that it offers a scalable way to leverage quantum effects for complex optimization problems, with the potential to complement or improve upon conventional alternatives in large-scale applications.</p>

            <h2>Quantum error correction for long chains of trapped ions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Min Ye, Nicolas Delfosse</p>
            <p>We propose a model for quantum computing with long chains of trapped ions and we design quantum error correction schemes for this model. The main components of a quantum error correction scheme are the quantum code and a quantum circuit called the syndrome extraction circuit, which is executed to perform error correction with this code. In this work, we design syndrome extraction circuits tailored to our ion chain model, a syndrome extraction tuning protocol to optimize these circuits, and we construct new quantum codes that outperform the state-of-the-art for chains of about $50$ qubits. To establish a baseline under the ion chain model, we simulate the performance of surface codes and bivariate bicycle (BB) codes equipped with our optimized syndrome extraction circuits. Then, we propose a new variant of BB codes defined by weight-five measurements, that we refer to as BB5 codes and we identify BB5 codes that achieve a better minimum distance than any BB codes with the same number of logical qubits and data qubits, such as a $[[48, 4, 7]]$ BB5 code. For a physical error rate of $10^{-3}$, the $[[48, 4, 7]]$ BB5 code achieves a logical error rate per logical qubit of $5 \cdot 10^{-5}$, which is four times smaller than the best BB code in our baseline family. It also achieves the same logical error rate per logical qubit as the distance-7 surface code but using four times fewer physical qubits per logical qubit.</p>

            <h2>Composable Finite-Size Security of High-Dimensional Quantum Key Distribution Protocols</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Florian Kanitschar, Marcus Huber</p>
            <p>Practical implementations of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) extending beyond urban areas commonly use satellite links. However, the transmission of quantum states through the Earth's atmosphere is highly susceptible to noise, restricting its application primarily to nighttime. High-dimensional (HD) QKD offers a promising solution to this limitation by employing high-dimensionally entangled quantum states. Although experimental platforms for HD QKD exist, previous security analyses have been limited to the asymptotic regime and have either relied on impractical measurements or employed computationally demanding convex optimization tasks restricting the security analysis to low dimensions. In this work, we bridge this gap by presenting a composable finite-size security proof against both collective and coherent attacks for a general HD QKD protocol that uses only experimentally accessible measurements. In addition to the conventional, yet impractical `one-shot' key rates, we provide a practical variable-length security argument that yields significantly higher expected key rates. This approach is particularly crucial under rapidly changing and turbulent atmospheric conditions, as encountered in free-space and satellite-based QKD platforms.</p>

            <p>We present a two-step decoder for the parity code and evaluate its performance in code-capacity and faulty-measurement settings. For noiseless measurements, we find that the decoding problem can be reduced to a series of repetition codes while yielding near-optimal decoding for intermediate code sizes and achieving optimality in the limit of large codes. In the regime of unreliable measurements, the decoder demonstrates fault-tolerant thresholds above 5% at the cost of decoding a series of independent repetition codes in (1 + 1) dimensions. Such high thresholds, in conjunction with a practical decoder, efficient long-range logical gates, and suitability for planar implementation, position the parity architecture as a promising candidate for demonstrating quantum advantage on qubit platforms with strong noise bias.</p>

            <h2>Quantum mixture-density network for multimodal probabilistic prediction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jaemin Seo</p>
            <p>Multimodal probability distributions are common in both quantum and classical systems, yet modeling them remains challenging when the number of modes is large or unknown. Classical methods such as mixture-density networks (MDNs) scale poorly, requiring parameter counts that grow quadratically with the number of modes. We introduce a Quantum Mixture-Density Network (Q-MDN) that employs parameterized quantum circuits to efficiently model multimodal distributions. By representing an exponential number of modes with a compact set of qubits and parameters, Q-MDN predicts Gaussian mixture components with high resolution. We evaluate Q-MDN on two benchmark tasks: the quantum double-slit experiment and chaotic logistic bifurcation. In both cases, Q-MDN outperforms classical MDNs in mode separability and prediction sharpness under equal parameter budgets. Our results demonstrate an efficiency in probabilistic regression and highlight the potential of quantum machine learning in capturing complex stochastic behavior.</p>

            <p>Magnetosensitive spin-correlated radical-pairs (SCRPs) offer a promising platform for noise-robust quantum metrology. However, unavoidable interradical interactions, such as electron-electron dipolar and exchange couplings, alongside deleterious perturbations resulting from intrinsic radical motion, typically degrade their potential as magnetometers. In contrast to this, we show how structured molecular motion modulating interradical interactions in a live chemical sensor in cryptochrome can, in fact, increase sensitivity and, more so, push precision in estimating magnetic field directions closer to the quantum Cramér-Rao bound, suggesting near-optimal metrological performance. Remarkably, this approach to optimality is amplified under environmental noise and persists with increasing complexity of the spin system, suggesting that perturbations inherent to such natural systems have enabled them to operate closer to the quantum limit to more effectively extract information from the weak geomagnetic field. This insight opens the possibility of channeling the underlying physical principles of motion-induced modulation of electron spin-spin interactions towards devising efficient handles over emerging molecular quantum information technologies.</p>

            <p>Synchronization is a hallmark of collective behavior that emerges when nonlinear systems interact, spanning scales from mechanical oscillators to planetary orbits. As a universal phenomenon it underpins the study of complex systems and has far-reaching technological implications. While classical synchronization has a long and rich history, it has not been observed experimentally between multiple quantum limit-cycle oscillators despite a decade of theoretical investigations. We realize synchronization between two quantum van der Pol oscillators by engineering dissipation in a mixed-isotope trapped-ion quantum simulator. The synchronized state is encoded in a fixed relative phase between the oscillators that is inaccessible to local measurements and only revealed through joint readout of both oscillators, in stark contrast to the classical case where synchronization can be observed via individual phase measurements. We further show that the relative phase can be precisely controlled, and that the chain of two oscillators can synchronize to an external field, suggesting applications in sensing. Our results provide a promising pathway for studying more complex synchronized quantum dynamics beyond two oscillators, where a theoretical treatment becomes increasingly challenging, and it remains to be understood whether genuinely quantum features persist in such cases.</p>

            <p>Trapped-ion crystals are a leading platform for quantum information science, but achieving the high-fidelity entangling gates required for fault-tolerant quantum computing becomes harder as system size increases. As systems scale, spectral crowding makes low-order nonlinear resonances between collective motional modes increasingly common and can limit gate performance, especially in monolithic or global-mode architectures. We develop a general model to identify and simulate nonlinear motional-mode coupling (NoMoCou) arising from third-order Coulomb terms and quantify its impact on the Molmer-Sorensen gate across linear chains and 2D crystals in rf and Penning traps. We delineate the regimes where NoMoCou dominates the error budget and provide design rules: detune operating points from low-order resonances, tune trap anisotropy to reshape spectra, and shape gate waveforms.</p>

            <p>We introduce a quantum key distribution (QKD) primitive based on charge teleportation: by Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC) on an entangled many-body ground state, Alice's one-bit choice steers the sign of a local charge shift at Bob, which directly encodes the key bit. Relative to energy teleportation schemes, the charge signal is bit-symmetric, measured in a single basis, and markedly more robust to realistic noise and model imperfections. We instantiate the protocol on transverse-field Ising models, star-coupled and one-dimensional chain, obtain closed-form results for two qubits, and for larger systems confirm performance via exact diagonalization, circuit-level simulations, and a proof-of-principle hardware run. We quantify resilience to classical bit flips and local quantum noise, identifying regimes where sign integrity, and hence key correctness, is preserved. These results position charge teleportation as a practical, low-rate QKD primitive compatible with near-term platforms.</p>

            <p>We present and open source a quantum circuit simulator tailored to chemistry applications. More specifically, our simulator can compute the Born-rule probabilities of samples obtained from circuits containing passive fermionic linear optical elements and controlled-phase gates. We support both approximate and exact calculation of probabilities, and for approximate probability calculation, our simulator's runtime is exponential only in the magnitudes of the circuit's controlled-phase gate angles. This makes our simulator useful for simulating certain systems that are beyond the reach of conventional state vector methods. We demonstrate our simulator's utility by simulating the local cluster unitary Jastrow (LUCJ) ansatz and integrating it with sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD) to improve the accuracy of molecular ground-state energy estimates. Applied to a 52-qubit $N_2$ system, we observe accuracy improvements of up to $46\%$ over the baseline SQD implementation with negligible computational overhead. More generally, we highlight a regime in which our simulator achieves substantially superior latency scaling and exponentially superior memory scaling over a tensor network simulator and a state vector simulator. As an efficient and flexible tool for simulating quantum chemistry circuits, our simulator enables new opportunities for enhancing near-term quantum algorithms in chemistry and related domains.</p>

            <p>The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), as a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm, is an important tool for effective quantum computing in the current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. However, the traditional hardware-efficient ansatz without taking into account symmetries requires more computational resources to explore the unnecessary regions in the Hilbert space. The conventional Subspace-Search VQE (SSVQE) algorithm, which can calculate excited states, is also unable to effectively handle degenerate states since the loss function only contains the expectation value of the Hamiltonian. In this study, the energy eigenstates of the one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model with two lattice sites and the two-dimensional Hubbard model with four lattice sites are calculated. By incorporating symmetries into the quantum circuits and loss function, we find that both the ground state and excited state calculations are improved greatly compared to the case without symmetries. The enhancement in excited state calculations is particularly significant. This is because quantum circuits that conserve the particle number are used, and appropriate penalty terms are added to the loss function, enabling the optimization process to correctly identify degenerate states. The results are verified through repeated simulations.</p>

Further, both QNNs architectures fail to demonstrate a meaningful scaling law of decreasing errors with increasing training data. These findings highlight the challenges of scaling QNNs for complex molecular systems and emphasize the need for improved encoding strategies, regularization techniques, and hybrid quantum-classical approaches.</p>

            <p>This study introduces a new unified structural framework for orbifold sigma models that incorporates twisted sectors, singularities, and smooth regions into a single algebraic object. Traditional approaches to orbifold theories often treat such sectors separately, requiring ad hoc regularizations near singularities and failing at capturing inter-sector interactions under renormalization group flow. Therefore, the scope of this study aims at resolving these limitations through the construction of a unified orbifold algebra $\mathcal{A}(X/G)$ that decomposes into idempotent-projected components corresponding to conjugacy classes of the finite group $G$ acting on the target space $X$. The formalism is shown to recover conventional sigma model results in the smooth limit where $G$ approaches the trivial group, with the internal renormalization group derivation reducing to the standard one-loop beta function proportional to the Ricci tensor. Examples demonstrate the applicability, including explicit calculations for the $\mathbb{C}/\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold that exhibit the decomposition into untwisted and twisted field contributions.</p>

            <p>An economic modeling approach for cavity quantum electrodynamics is provided by mean-field dynamics, wherein the optical field is described classically while a self-consistent interaction with quantum emitters is incorporated through the Ehrenfest theorem. However, conventional implementations of mean-field dynamics are known to suffer from a catastrophic leakage of zero-point energy, to lose accuracy in the short-cavity limit, and to require large numbers of trajectories to be sampled. Here, we address these three shortcomings within a single integrated approach. This approach builds on our recently-proposed modification of the Ehrenfest theorem, referred to as decoupled mean-field (DC-MF) dynamics, in combination with a focused sampling scheme that enforces zero-point energy at the single-trajectory level. The approach is shown to yield high accuracy in both short and long-cavity limits while reaching convergence within a minimal amount of trajectories.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eric Vernier, Lorenzo Piroli</p>
            <p>Free fermions in disguise (FFD) Hamiltonians describe spin chains which can be mapped to free fermions, but not via a Jordan-Wigner transformation. Although the mapping gives access to the full Hamiltonian spectrum, the computation of spin correlation functions is generally hard. Indeed, the dictionary between states in the spin and free-fermion Hilbert spaces is highly non-trivial, due to the non-linear and non-local nature of the mapping, as well as the exponential degeneracy of the Hamiltonian eigenspaces. In this work, we provide a series of results characterizing the Hilbert space associated to FFD Hamiltonians. We focus on the original model introduced by Paul Fendley and show that the corresponding Hilbert space admits the exact factorization $\mathcal{H}=\mathcal{H}_F\otimes \mathcal{H}_D$, where $\mathcal{H}_F$ hosts the fermionic operators, while $\mathcal{H}_D$ accounts for the exponential degeneracy of the energy eigenspaces. By constructing a family of spin operators generating the operator algebra supported on $\mathcal{H}_D$, we further show that $\mathcal{H}_D=\mathcal{H}_{F'}\otimes \mathcal{H}_{\widetilde{D}}$, where $\mathcal{H}_{F'}$ hosts ancillary free fermions in disguise, while $\mathcal{H}_{\widetilde{D}}$ is generated by the common eigenstates of an extensive set of commuting Pauli strings. Our construction allows us to fully resolve the exponential degeneracy of all Hamiltonian eigenspaces and is expected to have implications for the computation of spin correlation functions, both in and out of equilibrium.</p>

We introduce a compact hybrid upgrade with two components: (i) a coherently coupled \emph{ancilla} qubit that receives the homodyne current and feeds back \emph{quantum-coherently} on the system, recovering information from \emph{both} field quadratures and intentionally engineered to decay much faster than the system; and (ii) a lightweight supervised predictor that forecasts the near-future homodyne current, phase-aligning the correction to overcome hardware latency. A Lindblad treatment yields closed-form effective decay rates: the ancilla suppresses the emission channel by a cooperativity factor, while the predictor further suppresses the residual decay in proportion to forecast quality. Using IBM-scale parameters (baseline \(T_1 = 50~\mu\mathrm{s}\)), numerical simulations surpass the W--M limit, achieving \(\sim 3\!-\!4\times\) longer \(T_1\) together with improved population retention and integrated energy. The method is modular and hardware-compatible: ancilla coupling and supervised prediction can be added to existing W--M loops to convert leaked information into a precise, time-advanced corrective drive. We also include a detailed, student-friendly derivation of the effective rates for both ancilla-assisted and prediction-enhanced feedback, making the impact of each design element analytically transparent.</p>

            <h2>Detection of many-body entanglement partitions in a quantum computer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Albert Rico, Dmitry Grinko, Robin Krebs, Lin Htoo Zaw</p>
            <p>We present a method to detect entanglement partitions of multipartite quantum systems, by exploiting their inherent symmetries. Structures like genuinely multipartite entanglement, $m$-separability and entanglement depth are detected as very special cases. This formulation enables us to characterize all the entanglement partitions of all three- and four- partite states and witnesses with unitary and permutation symmetry. In particular, we find and parametrize a complete set of bound entangled states therein. For larger systems, we provide a large family of analytical witnesses detecting many-body states of arbitrary size where none of the parties is separable from the rest. This method relies on weak Schur sampling with projective measurements, and thus can be implemented in a quantum computer. Beyond physics, our results extend to the mathematical literature: we establish new inequalities between matrix immanants, and characterize the set of such inequalities for matrices of size three and four.</p>

            <h2>Many-Body Time Evolution from a Correlation-Efficient Quantum Algorithm</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michael Rose, David A. Mazziotti</p>
            <p>We introduce the correlation-efficient time-evolution (CETE) algorithm for simulating quantum many-body dynamics. CETE recasts each step of time evolution as a time-independent correlation problem: the ansatz begins from a mean-field single Slater determinant and is then correlated to capture the true time-evolved state. We derive this exact ansatz from a contraction of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation onto the space of two electrons. Unlike conventional evolution by sequential short-time propagators, which must both correlate and decorrelate the state as the degree of correlation fluctuates in time, CETE correlates only once. This substantially reduces circuit depth, extending accessible simulation times on near-term quantum devices. We demonstrate the approach by simulating the time evolution of the hydrogen molecule's electronic wavefunction, highlighting the potential for the CETE algorithm to simulate strongly correlated systems on near-term devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexis R. Legón, Mario Miranda, P. A. Orellana</p>
            <p>We examine a quantum routing mechanism utilizing a giant-atom-like array coupled to two one-dimensional waveguides. The giant-atom-like array is formed by a one-dimensional array of three-level-systems. In the regime of strong atom-waveguide coupling and weak inter-atomic interactions, this system functions as an efficient and directionally controllable single-photon router. Our analysis shows that the routing behavior is influenced by effective phase accumulation and interference effects, which can be adjusted by varying the number of coupling sites $N$, the photon energy $E$, and the inter-atomic coupling strength $J$. Importantly, we identify configurations that enable perfect photon transfer ($100 \%$ efficiency) over a wide range of energies and that provide dynamic control over the output channel. In addition, we investigate how the system responds to changes in its internal parameters, demonstrating the robustness and scalability of routing performance. These findings underscore the potential of this setup for implementation in reconfigurable and integrated quantum photonic networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Janarbek Yuanbek, Bruno Tenorio</p>
            <p>The present study systematically investigates the modulation mechanism of post-selected weak measurement (WM) on the non-classical properties of entangled coherent states (ECSs). The primary goal is achieving controllable enhancement of quantum resources such as entanglement and squeezing, while minimising disturbance to the quantum state. We theoretically analyze the post-selected weak measurement process, and its effectiveness in amplifying the non-classical features of ECSs. The von Neumann measurement model is employed to analytically describe the weak-value amplification of the pointer state. It is demonstrated that a significant enhancement of squeezing can be achieved by tuning the measurement coupling strength. The joint Wigner function analysis in phase space further reveals that, as the coupling strength increases, the coherent structure of the state evolves from symmetric double peaks to multi-branch quantum interference fringes. The entanglement, quantified by the Hillery-Zubairy criterion, exhibits a pronounced increase with stronger coupling, while the quantum Fisher information indicates a systematic improvement in phase estimation precision. The results obtained establish a tunable weak measurement framework for precise manipulation of continuous-variable entangled states. This provides a feasible theoretical pathway for enhancing quantum metrology and measurement-based state engineering.</p>

            <h2>Generating spatially separated correlated multiphoton states in nonlinear waveguide quantum electrodynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jia-Qi Li, Anton Frisk Kockum, Xin Wang</p>
            <p>Strongly correlated multi-photon states are indispensable resources for advanced quantum technologies, yet their deterministic generation remains challenging due to the inherent weak nonlinearity in most optical systems. Here, we propose a scalable architecture for producing correlated few-photon entangled states via cascaded inelastic scattering in a nonlinear waveguide. When a single photon scatters off a far detuned excited two-level emitter, it coherently converts into a propagating doublon, a bound photon pair with anomalous dispersion. This doublon can subsequently scatter off a downstream excited emitter to further convert into a triplon, and so on, thereby establishing a photon-number amplification cascade $|\cdot \rangle \!\! \rightarrow \!\! |\!\!: \rangle \!\! \rightarrow \! \! |\!\!\therefore \rangle \!\! \to \!\! ...$ Central to this process is the concept of a pseudo-giant atom, which we introduce here to capture the non-local scattering potential emergent from the wave functions of bound states. By implementing this scheme using a real giant atom with multiple engineered coupling points, we achieve unidirectional and full controllable photon conversion without backscattering. The resulting output state forms a programmable superposition of spatially and temporally isolated photon-number components, automatically sorted by their distinct group velocities. This work opens a new paradigm in quantum state engineering, enabling on-demand generation of complex multi-photon resources for quantum simulation, metrology, and scalable quantum networks.</p>

            <p>Many living organisms can exploit quantum mechanical effects to gain distinct biological advantages. In plants, photosynthesis uses quantum coherence to achieve near 100% efficiency in energy transfer. With advances in experimental techniques, two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy can reveal dynamic processes such as coherence and coupling within a system, and it plays an important role in studying energy transfer in photosynthesis. On the theory side, methods such as the generalized Bloch-Redfield theory and the hierarchical equations of motion are used to model photosynthetic systems. Quantum simulation, as a high-efficiency and low-complexity approach, has also made progress across various platforms in the study of photosynthesis. In recent years, a series of studies has introduced quantum coherence into artificial systems to enhance energy transfer efficiency, laying the groundwork for the design of coherent devices with efficient energy transport. Birds can use the weak geomagnetic field and spin-dependent chemical reactions to detect direction. Theoretical frameworks for animal navigation include magnetite-based mechanisms, magnetoreceptor genes, and the radical-pair mechanism. Quantum simulations of navigation have also advanced on multiple platforms. Inspired by animal navigation, diverse quantum effects have been applied to improve sensing and to support navigation tasks. This paper presents a comprehensive review of progress on quantum coherence in photosynthesis and avian navigation, along with related theoretical methods, quantum simulation approaches, and research on quantum coherent devices.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate a method for generating entanglement between trapped atomic ions based on adiabatically ramped state-dependent forces. By ramping both the amplitude of the state-dependent force and the motional mode frequencies, we realize an entangling operation that is robust to motional mode occupation and drifts in the mode frequencies. We measure Bell state fidelities above 0.99 across a broad range of ramp parameters and with motional occupations up to 10 phonons. This technique enables high-fidelity entangling operations without ground-state cooling, has a reduced calibration overhead, and is well suited for both quantum logic spectroscopy applications and scalable quantum computing architectures.</p>

            <p>We develop a hybrid qubit-qumode framework for simulating quantum electrodynamics in 2+1 dimensions. In this approach, fermionic matter fields are represented by qubits, while U(1) gauge fields are encoded in continuous-variable bosonic modes whose canonical quadratures capture the electric and vector-potential components of the theory. To reconcile the non-compact phase space of the qumodes with the compact U(1) gauge symmetry, we introduce and compare two complementary constraint-enforcement strategies: (i) a squeezing-based projection that confines qumode states to the unit circle through an effective modification of the inner product, and (ii) a method that dynamically enforces compactness via a penalty Hamiltonian term. We construct the corresponding hybrid Hamiltonian, derive its decomposition into experimentally accessible qubit-qumode gates, and analyze its spectrum in the analytically tractable single-plaquette limit. The hybrid formulation reproduces the correct gauge-invariant dynamics and provides a scalable route toward simulating Abelian lattice gauge theories coupled to fermionic matter on near-term hybrid quantum architectures. Ground-state preparation and convergence are demonstrated using a continuous-variable extension of the Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution (QITE) algorithm, establishing a general framework for hybrid discrete-continuous quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories.</p>

            <p>Electron matter waves coherently diffract when passing through a periodic structure of light formed by two interfering light waves. In this so-called Kapitza-Dirac effect, the electron momentum changes due to absorption and emission of photons via stimulated Compton scattering. Until now, the effect has only been observed with low energy electrons due to the small momentum of a visible photon compared to the momentum of high energy electron leading to diffraction angles of 10^(-4) rad or smaller. We report on the observation of the Kapitza-Dirac effect in a scanning electron microscope using high energy (20 keV and 30 keV) electrons with de-Broglie wavelengths of 9 pm and 7 pm, respectively. The photon sidebands in the electron transverse momentum spectrum are detected in the convergent beam diffraction geometry using spatial filtering. As the coupling strength between the electrons and the light field increases, the sideband populations exhibit coherent, reversible oscillations among diffraction orders. The effect can serve as a coherent electron beam-splitter or a phase-plate in various types of electron microscopes.</p>

            <h2>Efficient Hamiltonian-aware Quantum Natural Gradient Descent for Variational Quantum Eigensolvers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chenyu Shi, Hao Wang</p>
            <p>The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is one of the most promising algorithms for current quantum devices. It employs a classical optimizer to iteratively update the parameters of a variational quantum circuit in order to search for the ground state of a given Hamiltonian. The efficacy of VQEs largely depends on the optimizer employed. Recent studies suggest that Quantum Natural Gradient Descent (QNG) can achieve faster convergence than vanilla gradient descent (VG), but at the cost of additional quantum resources to estimate Fubini-Study metric tensor in each optimization step. The Fubini-Study metric tensor used in QNG is related to the entire quantum state space and does not incorporate information about the target Hamiltonian. To take advantage of the structure of the Hamiltonian and address the limitation of additional computational cost in QNG, we propose Hamiltonian-aware Quantum Natural Gradient Descent (H-QNG). In H-QNG, we propose to use the Riemannian pullback metric induced from the lower-dimensional subspace spanned by the Hamiltonian terms onto the parameter space. We show that H-QNG inherits the desirable features of both approaches: the low quantum computational cost of VG and the reparameterization-invariance of QNG. We also validate its performance through numerical experiments on molecular Hamiltonians, showing that H-QNG achieves faster convergence to chemical accuracy while requiring fewer quantum computational resources.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yan Li, Cheng Liu, Yu-Hong Liu, Yue-Hui Zhou, Jie-Qiao Liao</p>
            <p>Quantum entanglement is a crucial resource in quantum technologies, enabling advancements in quantum computing, quantum communication, and quantum precision measurement. Here, we propose a method to enhance optomechanical entanglement by introducing an optical Kerr nonlinear medium and a squeezed vacuum reservoir of the optomechanical cavity. By performing the displacement and squeezing transformations, the system can be reduced to a standard linearized optomechanical system with normalized driving detuning and linearized-coupling strength, in which the optical and mechanical modes are, respectively, coupled to an optical vacuum bath and a mechanical heat bath. We focus on the entanglement generation in the single stable regime of the system. By evaluating the steady-state logarithm negativity, we find that the optomechanical entanglement can be enhanced within a wide range of the Kerr constant. In addition, the Kerr nonlinearity can extend the stable region, enabling considerable entanglement generation in the blue-sideband parameter region. We also investigate the dependence of the entanglement generation on the average thermal phonon occupation of the mechanical bath and the optical driving amplitude. It is found that the presence of the Kerr nonlinearity allows the generation of optomechanical entanglement even when the thermal phonon occupation of the mechanical bath is as high as 3000. Our findings will provide valuable insights into enhancing fragile quantum resources in quantum systems.</p>

            <p>Quantum frequency conversion (QFC) is essential for interfacing quantum systems operating at different wavelengths and for realizing scalable quantum networks. Despite extensive progress, achieving QFC with simultaneous high efficiency, low pump power, minimal noise, broad bandwidth, and pump-wavelength flexibility remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate efficient, low-noise, and bidirectional QFC between the telecom (1550-nm) and visible (780-nm) bands using unpoled indium gallium phosphide (InGaP) $\chi^{(2)}$ nanophotonic waveguides, eliminating the need for a long-wavelength pump. Leveraging the large nonlinear susceptibility of InGaP together with programmable modal-phase-matching control, we obtain record-low pump power (20 mW) -- an order of magnitude lower than that in previous demonstrations using integrated thin-film waveguides -- and record-high loss-inclusive normalized conversion efficiency among non-resonant QFC implementations. The platform maintains quantum coherence and entanglement of input photons with noise well below the single-photon level. These results mark a significant advance in integrated nonlinear photonics for high-performance QFC, facilitating the development of versatile and scalable quantum networks.</p>

            <p>Electrons levitating above the surface of solid neon have recently emerged as a promising platform for high-quality qubits. The morphology and uniformity of the neon growth in these systems is crucial for qubit performance in a scalable architecture. Here we report on the controlled growth and characterization of thin solid neon films using multiplexed superconducting microwave resonators. By monitoring changes in the resonant frequency and internal quality factor ($Q_i$) of an array of frequency multiplexed quarter-wave coplanar waveguide resonators, we quantify the spatial uniformity of the film. A pulsed gas deposition protocol near the neon triple point results in repeatable film formation, generating measurable shifts in frequency and variations in $Q_i$ across the resonator array. Notably, introducing a post-deposition anneal at 12 K for one hour improves the film homogeneity, as shown by the reduced resonator-to-resonator variance in frequency and $Q_i$, consistent with enhanced wetting. These results demonstrate resonator-based metrology as an in-situ tool for characterising neon film growth, directly supporting the development of electron on inert quantum solid qubit platforms.</p>

            <p>We present a non-perturbative Hamiltonian mapping method for quantum systems strongly coupled to a quantized field mode (cavity), yielding compact closed-form representations of hybrid light-matter systems. The mapping method builds on an entangling transformation of photonic and atomic degrees of freedom. By truncating the resulting cavity-dressed Hamiltonian (CDH) to successively larger excitation sectors, we construct a series of compact models that converge to the exact limit, outpacing conventional approaches even in the challenging resonant and ultrastrong light-matter regime. The mapping principle also applies to multimode cavities coupled to matter through noncommuting operators and to leaky cavities. We benchmark the CDH framework on the quantum Rabi model, demonstrating accurate spectral predictions in both weak and strong coupling regimes, together with converging ground-state and thermal observables. We study the Dicke-Heisenberg lattice model and determine its phase diagram under resonant and strong light-matter coupling, achieving significant computational savings over brute-force simulations and identifying cavity-mediated spin correlations both analytically and numerically. The closed-form and compactness of the CDH provide both physical insight and enhanced computational efficiency, facilitating studies of strongly coupled hybrid light-matter systems.</p>

While light is confined in the microresonator by total internal reflection, a portion of the optical field, known as the evanescent field, extends outside. This makes the mode's resonant frequency sensitive to changes in the surrounding environment. In this work, we explore the quantum sensitivity limits of this type of sensors. We demonstrate that by preparing the probe light in a squeezed quantum state, it is possible to surpass the shot-noise limit. The resulting sensitivity is constrained only by optical losses and the available degree of squeezing. The influence of the losses can be reduced using additional squeezing of the light inside the microresonator.</p>

            <p>In this work, we introduce an experimentally viable scheme to enhance the simultaneous estimation precision of the couplings $G_{mc}$ and $G_{mb}$, with a particular focus on the performance of heterodyne detection. By comparing simultaneous and individual estimation strategies, we demonstrate that the simultaneous approach offers a notable advantage in our system. To support this, we compute the quantum Fisher information matrices (QFIMs) based on the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD) and the right logarithmic derivative (RLD). Our results show that the quantum Cramér Rao bound (QCRB) associated with the RLD is consistently lower than that of the SLD, indicating superior estimation precision. From a physical standpoint, this improvement reflects the system's enhanced capacity to encode, transfer, and extract quantum information while allowing optimal control of fundamental interactions. We show that increasing the Rabi frequency, cavity loss rate, and the average number of photons and phonons, combined with reduced mechanical damping and temperature, enhances the system's sensitivity to the coupling parameters. These mechanisms act on the available quantum resources, such as entanglement, squeezing, and state purity, leading to more precise estimations. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that under certain conditions, heterodyne detection can closely approach the ultimate precision set by the QFIM. This suggests that a measurement strategy based on heterodyne detection can offer an efficient and practical route for estimating the couplings $G_{mc}$ and $G_{mb}$, paving the way for high precision hybrid quantum sensors.</p>

Given such a circuit, our simulator can compute Born-rule probabilities for samples drawn from it.

For approximate Born-rule probability calculation, our simulator's runtime is exponential only in the magnitudes of the angles of the circuit's controlled-phase gates. This makes our simulator useful for simulating certain systems that are beyond the reach of conventional state vector methods. We demonstrate our simulator's utility by simulating the local unitary cluster Jastrow (LUCJ) ansatz and integrating it with sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD) to improve the accuracy of molecular ground-state energy estimates. Applied to a 52-qubit $N_2$ system, we observe accuracy improvements of up to $46\%$ over the baseline SQD implementation with negligible computational overhead.

            <p>The tin-vacancy center in diamond (SnV) has emerged as a compelling building block for realizing next-generation quantum networks thanks to its excellent optical and spin properties. Coupling to photonic crystal cavities (PCCs) promises to further enhance the SnV light-matter interface and unlock a diverse range of entanglement generation protocols. Recent pioneering experiments showing Purcell enhancement of SnV centers in PCCs underscore this potential. However, optical coupling that is coherent - the key ingredient for use in quantum protocols - has so far remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate above-unity coherent cooperativity of SnV centers embedded in photonic crystal cavities. We fabricate free-standing PCCs using a quasi-isotropic undercut. Across two samples, we conduct room-temperature characterizations, measuring resonances for 327 cavities, with an average quality factor exceeding $Q = 1.0(3) \times 10^4$. Two cavity-coupled emitters are examined in detail, exhibiting quality factors up to $Q = 25.4(4) \times 10^3$ and Purcell-reduced lifetimes corresponding to cooperativities up to $C = 20.6(11)$. Furthermore, the single SnVs are observed to strongly modulate the cavity transmission with an extinction contrast up to $98.8(4) \%$ on resonance. Finally, SnV linewidth measurements reveal above-unity coherent cooperativities in both devices, with the highest value being $C_\mathrm{coh} = 8.3(12)$. These results open the door to using cavity-coupled SnV centers as efficient, coherent light-matter interfaces for future quantum networks.</p>

However, an efficacious method for this, especially for mixed states and higher-dimensional density matrices, remains elusive. While there are many existing algorithms on computing the fidelity between two pure states, there is not much work on how to obtain the fidelity between two mixed states. Here, we propose an efficient quantum algorithm for the fidelity estimation, based primarily on the density matrix exponentiation and interferometeric scheme for mixed states, with a time complexity of $O(N^2/\epsilon^7)$, where $N$ is the system size and $\epsilon$ is a precision error. Our algorithm may serve as a resource-efficient technique to deduce fidelity of any two (pure or mixed) unknown or known quantum states, when the density matrices of the quantum states commute with each other.</p>

            <h2>Probing parameters estimation with Gaussian non-commutative measurements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alice P. G. Hall, Carlos H. S. Vieira, Jonas F. G. Santos</p>
            <p>Gaussian quantum states and channels are pivotal across many branches of quantum science and their applications, including the processing and storage of quantum information, the investigation of thermodynamics in the quantum regime, and quantum computation. The great advantage is that Gaussian states are experimentally accessible via their first and second statistical moments. In this work, we investigate parameter estimation for Gaussian states, in which the probe-state preparation stage involves two noncommutative Gaussian measurements on the position and momentum observables, introducing tunable parameters. The influence of these noncommutative Gaussian measurements is investigated through the quantum Fisher information (QFI). We showed that the QFI for characterizing Gaussian channels can be increased by adjusting the uncertainty parameters in the preparation of the probe state. Furthermore, if the probe is initially in a thermal state, probe-state preparation may generate quantum coherence in its energy basis. We showed that not only does the amount of coherence affect the improvement of the QFI, but also the rate of change of the coherence with respect to the parameter to be estimated. The proposed probe-state protocol is applied to two paradigmatic single-mode Gaussian channels, the attenuator and amplification channels, which are building blocks of Gaussian quantum information. Our results contribute to the use of coherence in quantum metrology and are experimentally feasible in quantum-optical devices.</p>

            <h2>Sequences of Bivariate Bicycle Codes from Covering Graphs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benjamin C. B. Symons, Abhishek Rajput, Dan E. Browne</p>
            <p>We show that given an instance of a bivariate bicycle (BB) code, it is possible to generate an infinite sequence of new BB codes using increasingly large covering graphs of the original code's Tanner graph. When a BB code has a Tanner graph that is a $h$-fold covering of the base BB code's Tanner graph, we refer to it as a $h$-cover code. We show that for a BB code to be a $h$-cover code, its lattice parameters and defining polynomials must satisfy simple algebraic conditions relative to those of the base code. By extending the graph covering map to a chain map, we show there are induced projection and lifting maps on (co)homology that enable the projection and lifting of logical operators and, in certain cases, automorphisms between the base and the cover code. The search space of cover codes is considerably reduced compared to the full space of possible polynomials and we find that many interesting examples of BB codes, such as the $[[144,12,12]]$ gross code, can be viewed as cover codes. We also apply our method to search for BB codes with weight 8 checks and find many codes, including a $[[64,14,8]]$ and $[[144,14,14]]$ code. For an $h$-cover code of an $[[n,k,d]]$ BB code with parameters $[[n_h = hn, k_h, d_h]]$, we prove that $k_h \geq k$ and $d_h \leq hd$ when $h$ is odd. Furthermore if $h$ is odd and $k_h = k$, we prove the lower bound $d \leq d_h$. We conjecture it is always true that an $h$-cover BB code of a base $[[n,k,d]]$ BB code has parameters $[[n_h = hn, k_h \geq k, d \leq d_h \leq hd]]$. While the focus of this work is on bivariate bicycle codes, we expect these methods to generalise readily to many group algebra codes and to certain code constructions involving hypergraph, lifted, and balanced products.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sahil Pontula, Debasmita Banerjee, Marin Soljacic, Yannick Salamin</p>
            <p>Frequency combs are multimode photonic systems that underlie countless precision sensing and metrology applications. Since their invention over two decades ago, numerous efforts have pushed frequency combs to broader bandwidths and more stable operation. More recently, quantum squeezing and entanglement have been explored in single frequency comb systems for quantum advantages in sensing and signal multiplexing. However, the production of quantum light across multiple frequency combs remains unexplored. In this work, we theoretically explore a mechanism that generates a series of nonlinearly coupled frequency combs through cascaded three-wave upconversion and downconversion processes mediated by a single idler comb. We show how this system generates inter- and intracomb two-mode squeezing and entanglement spanning a very large spectral range, from ultraviolet to mid-IR frequencies. Finally, we show how this system can be engineered to produce on-demand multimode quantum light through covariance matrix optimization. Our findings could enable tunable broadband ghost spectroscopy protocols, squeezing-enhanced pump-probe measurements, and broadband entanglement between spectrally-multiplexed quanta of information.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matias Bundgaard-Nielsen, Gian Luca Lippi, Jesper Mørk</p>
            <p>The random nature of spontaneous emission leads to unavoidable fluctuations in a laser's output. This is often included through random Langevin forces in laser rate equations, but this approach falls short for nanolasers. In this paper, we show that the laser quantum noise can be quantitatively computed for a very broad class of lasers by starting from simple and intuitive rate equations and merely assuming that the number of photons and excited electrons only takes discrete values. The success of the model is explained by showing that it constitutes a Markov chain, which can be derived from the full master equations. We show that in the many-photon limit, the model simplifies to Langevin equations. We perform an extensive comparison of different approaches for computing quantum noise in lasers, identifying the best approach for different system sizes, ranging from nanolasers to macroscopic lasers, and different levels of excitation, i.e., cavity photon number. In particular, we find that the numerical solution to the Langevin equations is inaccurate below the laser threshold, while the laser Markov chain model, on the other hand, is accurate for all pump values and laser sizes when collective emitter effects are excluded.</p>

            <h2>Photonic spin Hall effect in $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric non-Hermitian cavity magnomechanics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shah Fahad, Muzamil Shah, Gao Xianlong</p>
            <p>Non-Hermitian cavity magnomechanics (CMM), which incorporates the magnon-photon and magnon-phonon interactions simultaneously, enables rich physical phenomena, including exceptional-point-enhanced sensing, and offers pathways toward topological transitions and nonreciprocal quantum transformation. These interactions exert a pivotal influence on the optical response of a weak probe field and pave the way for novel applications in quantum technologies. In this work, we consider a yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) sphere coupled to a microwave cavity. The magnon mode of the YIG sphere is directly excited through microwave field coupling, whereas the cavity mode is probed via a weak-field interrogation scheme. The direct interaction of a traveling field with the magnon mode induces gain in the system, thereby establishing non-Hermitian dynamics. The parity-time (PT)-symmetric behavior of a hybrid non-Hermitian CMM is designed and investigated. Eigenvalue spectrum analysis demonstrates that a third-order exceptional point (EP_3) emerges under tunable effective magnon-photon coupling when the traveling field is oriented at an angle of \pi/2 relative to the cavity's x-axis. The photonic spin Hall effect (PSHE) in a reflected probe field is subsequently examined in such a system. Under balanced gain and loss conditions and in the presence of effective magnon-phonon coupling, tunable effective magnon-photon coupling enables coherent control of the PSHE across the broken PT-symmetric phase, at the EP_3, and in the PT-symmetric phase. Investigation reveals that the PSHE can be significantly enhanced or suppressed via effective magnon-photon coupling. The influence of intracavity length on the PSHE is further explored, providing an additional parameter for fine-tuning the transverse shift. These findings establish a direct correspondence between the PSHE and the underlying non-Hermitian eigenvalue spectrum.</p>

            <p>We introduce an all-optical quantum-enhanced diagnostic for electric fields in low-temperature plasmas. Trace amounts of rubidium vapor, added to argon plasma, allow us to produce spectrally narrow electric field-sensitive optical resonances via quantum optical effect of Rydberg electromagnetically induced transparency, and to non-invasively measure electric field in plasma with sensitivity exceeding 1 V/cm. By collecting fluorescence from the illuminated region of interest, we reconstruct a 2D spatial profile of the electric field magnitude with $30~\mu$m resolution. As a proof-of-principle demonstration, we measured the changes in electric field within the plasma sheath surrounding a biased Langmuir probe tip. This method holds significant potential for studying sheath structures in low-temperature plasmas.</p>

            <h2>Dyadic-Chaotic Lifting S-Boxes for Enhanced Physical-Layer Security within 6G Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ilias Cherkaoui, Indrakshi Dey</p>
            <p>Sixth-Generation (6G) wireless networks will interconnect billions of resource-constrained devices and time-critical services, where classical, fixed, and heavy cryptography strains latency and energy budgets and struggles against large-scale, pre-computation attacks. Physical-Layer Security (PLS) is therefore pivotal to deliver lightweight, information-theoretic protection, but still requires strong, reconfigurable confusion components that can be diversified per slice, session, or device to blunt large-scale precomputation and side-channel attacks. In order to address the above requirement, we introduce the first-ever chaos-lifted substitution box (S-box) for PLS that couples a $\beta$-transformation-driven dynamical system with dyadic conditional sampling to generate time-varying, seedable 8-bit permutations on demand. This construction preserves uniformity via ergodicity, yields full 8-bit bijections, and supports on-the-fly diversification across sessions. The resulting S-box attains optimal algebraic degree 7 on every output bit and high average nonlinearity 102.5 (85% of the 8-bit bound), strengthening resistance to algebraic and linear cryptanalysis. Differential and linear profiling report max DDT entry 10 (probability 0.039) and max linear probability 0.648, motivating deployment within a multi-round cipher with a strong diffusion layer, where the security-to-efficiency trade-off is compelling. Our proposed reconfigurable, lightweight S-box directly fulfills key PLS requirements of 6G networks by delivering fast, hardware-amenable confusion components with built-in agility against evolving threats.</p>

            <h2>Small clusters of He atoms in finite-cutoff EFT</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Betzalel Bazak</p>
            <p>Small clusters of $^4$He atoms provide a paradigmatic setting for exploring universal phenomena in few-body quantum systems with large scattering length. Their weakly bound states serve as ideal test cases for studying Efimov physics and the emergence of universality beyond the three-body sector. In this work, we investigate few-$^4$He systems within a finite-cutoff effective field theory (EFT) framework. The EFT interactions are calibrated to reproduce low-energy observables obtained from the realistic LM2M2 potential, enabling a direct and systematic comparison between the two approaches. We demonstrate that, for suitably chosen finite cutoffs, the empirical effective range is accurately reproduced already at leading order, achieving next-to-leading-order precision without explicit higher-order corrections. Using these interactions, we solve the Schrödinger equation for systems of a few atoms, obtaining binding energies and scattering observables in excellent agreement with results derived from realistic interatomic potentials. In particular, we compute atom--tetramer scattering parameters and binding energies of clusters up to eight atoms, thereby extending the EFT description to larger helium systems. Our findings establish a quantitative bridge between realistic helium potentials and finite-cutoff EFT, showing that the latter provides an efficient and predictive framework for describing few-body universality in weakly bound quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>Electron Tunneling Enhances Thermal Conductance through Metal-Insulator-Semiconductor Junctions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yizhe Liu, Bo Sun</p>
            <p>The presence of interfaces in semiconductor devices substantially hinders thermal transport, contributing disproportionately to the overall thermal resistance. However, approaches to enhance interfacial thermal transport remain scarce without changing the interface structure, as the intrinsic electron and phonon properties of constituent materials set an upper limit. Here, we find a new thermal transport pathway, electronic heat tunneling, to enhance interfacial thermal conductance through metal-insulator-semiconductor junctions. By applying photoexcitation or bias voltage, we observe remarkable thermal conductance increases in operando, opening a new channel for efficient interfacial heat dissipation. The electron quantum tunneling pathway is parallel to conventional phonon-mediated interfacial thermal transport, and violates the Wiedemann-Franz law since this pathway deviates from the paradigm of diffusive transport. Moreover, we develop a tunneling mismatch model to describe the enhanced thermal conductance, originating from tunneling heat flux. Our Letter demonstrates a previously unexplored heat transport mechanism to enhance thermal conductance, bypassing the need for interface engineering. These findings emphasize the essential need to understand semiconductor thermal properties under realistic operating conditions.</p>

            <p>Matter-wave optics is often viewed as a linear analogue of photonics, where noninteracting particles are coherently split, diffracted, and recombined, and interference arises from single-particle coherence. In ultracold quantum gases, however, interactions are intrinsic and can rival or exceed kinetic and optical energy scales. This drives matter-wave optics into a nonlinear regime: diffraction and momentum distributions become interaction-dependent, interference contrast degrades or collapses, and revival dynamics appear. In the mean time, interactions can generate squeezing and entanglement, enabling sensitivities beyond the standard quantum limit. We showcase representative examples - covering diffraction, splitting, and interferometry - that illustrate how interactions reshape the basic elements of matter-wave optics and open new opportunities for nonlinear quantum technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Peng Ma, Ming-Jian Gao, Jun-Hong An</p>
            <p>The discovery of topological phases has ushered in a new era of condensed matter physics and revealed a variety of natural and artificial materials. They obey the bulk-boundary correspondence (BBC), which guarantees the emergence of boundary states with non-zero topological invariants in the bulk. A wide attention has been paid to extending topological phases to nonlinear and non-Hermitian systems. However, the BBC and topological invariants of non-Hermitian nonlinear systems remain largely unexplored. Here, we establish a complete BBC and topological characterization of the topological phases in a class of non-Hermitian nonlinear-eigenvalue systems by introducing an auxiliary system. We restore the BBC broken by non-Hermiticity via employing the generalized Brillouin zone on the auxiliary system. Remarkably, we discover that the interplay between non-Hermiticity and nonlinearity creates an exotic complex-band topological phase that coexists with the real-band topological phase. Our results enrich the family of nonlinear topological phases and lay a foundation for exploring novel topological physics in metamaterial systems.</p>

            <p>Lattice spin models featuring kinetic constraints constitute a paradigmatic setting for the investigation of glassiness and localization phenomena. The intricate dynamical behavior of these systems is a result of the dramatically reduced connectivity between many-body configurations. This truncation of transition pathways often leads to a fragmentation of the Hilbert space, yielding highly collective and therefore often slow dynamics. Moreover, this mechanism supports the formation of characteristic elementary excitations, which we investigate here theoretically in a two-dimensional Rydberg lattice gas. We explore their properties as a function of interaction strength and range, and illustrate how they can be experimentally probed via sideband spectroscopy. Here, we show that the transition rate to certain delocalized superposition states of elementary excitations displays collective many-body enhancement.</p>

            <h2>Thermodynamics of the Fermi-Hubbard Model through Stochastic Calculus and Girsanov Transformation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Detlef Lehmann</p>
            <p>We apply the methodology of our recent paper 'The Dynamics of the Hubbard Model through Stochastic Calculus and Girsanov Transformation' [1] to thermodynamic correlation functions in the Fermi-Hubbard model. They can be obtained from a stochastic differential equation (SDE) system. To this SDE system, a Girsanov transformation can be applied. This has the effect that the usual determinant or pfaffian which shows up in a pfaffian quantum Monte Carlo (PfQMC) representation [2] basically gets absorbed into the new integration variables and information from that pfaffian moves into the drift part of the transformed SDE system. While the PfQMC representation depends heavily on the choice of how the quartic interaction has been factorized into quadratic quantities in the beginning, the Girsanov transformed formula has the very remarkable property that it is nearly independent of that choice, the drift part of the transformed SDE system as well as a remaining exponential which has the obvious meaning of energy are always the same and do not depend on the Hubbard-Stratonovich details. The resulting formula may serve as a starting point for further theoretical or numerical investigations. Here we consider the spin-spin correlation at half-filling on a bipartite lattice and obtain an analytical proof that the signs of these correlations have to be of antiferromagnetic type, at arbitrary temperatures. Also, by checking against available benchmark data [3], we find that approximate ground state energies can be obtained from an ODE system. This may even hold for exact ground state energies, but future work would be required to prove or disprove this. As in [1], the methodology is generic and can be applied to arbitrary quantum many body or quantum field theoretical models.</p>

            <p>We introduce a three-stroke quantum isochoric cycle that functions as a heat engine operating between two thermal reservoirs. Implemented for a particle confined in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, the cycle's performance is benchmarked against the classical three-stroke triangular and isochoric engines. We find that the quantum isochoric cycle achieves a higher efficiency than both classical counterparts and also surpasses the efficiency of the recently proposed three-stroke quantum isoenergetic cycle. Owing to its reduced number of strokes, the design substantially lowers control complexity in nanoscale thermodynamic devices, offering a more feasible route to experimental realization compared to conventional four-stroke architectures. We further evaluate the cycle in graphene-based systems under an external magnetic field, including monolayer graphene (MLG), AB-stacked bilayer graphene (BLG), and twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) at both magic and non-magic twist angles. Among these platforms, magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) attains the highest efficiency at fixed work output, highlighting its promise for quantum thermodynamic applications.</p>

            <p>We introduce a new scheme for quantum circuit design called controlled gate networks. Rather than trying to reduce the complexity of individual unitary operations, the new strategy is to toggle between all of the unitary operations needed with the fewest number of gates. We present the general theory of controlled gate networks and show that, under quite general conditions, it can significantly reduce the number of two-qubit gates needed to produce linear combinations of unitary operators. The first example we consider is a variational subspace calculation for a two-qubit system. The second example is estimating the eigenvalues of a two-qubit Hamiltonian via the rodeo algorithm using operators that we call controlled reversal gates. We use the Quantinuum H1-2 and IBM Perth devices to realize the quantum circuits. The third example is the application of controlled gate networks to the controlled time evolution of a free nucleon on a three-dimensional lattice. For all of the examples, we show very substantial reductions in the number of two-qubit gates required. Our work demonstrates that controlled gate networks are a useful tool for reducing gate complexity in quantum algorithms for quantum many-body problems such as those relevant to nuclear physics.</p>

            <p>Graph states are central resources for quantum information processing, supporting applications in computation, communication, and error correction. In photonic systems, they are typically assembled from smaller entangled states using probabilistic fusion gates, which demand many photons and suffer from low success rates. We present an optimized scheme for directly generating caterpillar graph states (CGSs) -- essential resource states for constructing high-dimensional lattice graph states -- using only single-photon sources, linear optics, and heralded measurements. Based on the linear quantum graph (LQG) picture, our method produces CGSs efficiently and scalably. For CGSs of length $l\ge 3$, it requires $l-2$ fewer photons and achieves a success rate $2^{l-2}$ times higher than fusion-based approaches. These results demonstrate that the LQG picture provides a powerful and flexible route for realizing complex photonic graph states with minimal resources.</p>

            <p>Non-signalling conditions encode minimal requirements that any (quantum) systems must satisfy in order to be consistent with special relativity. Recent works have argued that in scenarios involving more that two parties, correlations compatible with relativistic causality do not have to satisfy all possible non-signalling conditions but only a subset of them. Here we show that correlations satisfying only this subset of constraints have to satisfy highly non-local monogamy relations between the effects of space-like separated random variables. These monogamy relations take the form of entropic inequalities between the various systems and we give a general method to derive them. Using these monogamy relations we refute previous suggestions for physical mechanisms that could lead to relativistically causal correlations, demonstrating that such mechanisms would lead to superluminal signalling.</p>

            <p>At continuous phase transitions, quantum many-body systems exhibit scale-invariance and complex, emergent universal behavior. Most strikingly, at a quantum critical point, correlations decay as a power law, with exponents determined by a set of universal scaling dimensions. Experimentally probing such power-law correlations is extremely challenging, owing to the complex interplay between decoherence, the vanishing energy gap, and boundary effects. Here, we employ a Rydberg quantum simulator to adiabatically prepare critical ground states of both a one-dimensional ring and a two-dimensional square lattice. By accounting for and tuning the openness of our quantum system, which is well-captured by the introduction of a single phenomenological length scale, we are able to directly observe power-law correlations and extract the corresponding scaling dimensions. Moreover, in two dimensions, we observe a decoupling between phase transitions in the bulk and on the boundary, allowing us to identify two distinct boundary universality classes. Our work demonstrates that direct adiabatic preparation of critical states in quantum simulators can complement recent approaches to studying quantum criticality using the Kibble-Zurek mechanism or digital quantum circuits.</p>

            <p>The behavior of quantum states at exceptional points and at critical points associated with quantum phase transitions is intriguing yet puzzling. In this study, we present an alternative method for obtaining the Berry potentials using the evolution generator along the parameter induced dimension and demonstrate that they are singular at these critical points. Although these singularities may appear to indicate a breakdown in quantum state evolution, we show that the information carried by quantum states evolving across these critical points is not destroyed. Specifically, when the evolution generator of the full Hilbert space bundle is taken into account, the quantum states remain insensitive to the critical points. In physical terms, it's similar to the classical image of an object smoothly passing through a black hole's event horizon. Further similarities between exceptional points and quantum phase transitions are explored in this work.</p>

We analyze such propagation of a quantum non-Gaussian state with nonlinear squeezing through a small cluster state and show that when a nonlinear feedforward is involved in the teleportation protocol, higher nonlinear squeezing can be transferred. In a probabilistic regime, the improvement can be manifested even with current experimental resources. Better processing of non-Gaussian states can bring us closer to the necessary interplay between cluster states and non-Gaussianity required by quantum computing.</p>

            <p>In the rapidly evolving interdisciplinary field of quantum information science and technology, a major obstacle is the need to understand advanced mathematics to solve complex problems. Current findings in educational research suggest that incorporating visualizations into problem-solving settings can have beneficial effects on students' performance and cognitive load compared to relying solely on symbolic problem-solving content. Visualizations like the (dimensional) circle notation enable us to represent not only single-qubit but also more complex multi-qubit states, entanglement, and quantum algorithms. In this pilot study, we aim to take an initial step toward identifying the contexts in which students benefit from the presentation of visualizations of single- and multi-qubit systems in addition to mathematical formalism. For this purpose, we propose a set of test items and a comprehensive methodology to assess students' performance and cognitive load when solving problems. This is a pilot investigation with a large breadth of questions intended to generate hypotheses and guide larger-scale, more focused studies in the future. Specifically, we compare two approaches: using the mathematical-symbolic Dirac Notation alone and using it in combination with the (dimensional) circle notation. In surveys in one-, two- and three-qubit systems, we gather qualitative data from five, five and two think-aloud interviews, identifying problems that students encounter and their problem-solving strategies. In addition, we analyze quantitative data (performance and cognitive load) from 23, 27 and 17 participants in surveys on one-, two- and three-qubit systems recruited mainly from our quantum computing lectures.

            <p>In Phys. Rev. A 108, L060402 (2023), we introduced a Bayesian measurement error mitigation algorithm, which leveraged complete information from the readout signal, and validated the protocol on a quantum device with five superconducting qubits. Here, we present an improved algorithm's implementation, tailored for multiqubit experiments on near-term superconducting qubit quantum devices. In particular, we provide a detailed algorithm workflow, from calibrating the detector response functions to the postprocessing of measurement outcomes, offering a computationally efficient solution for the output size typical of current quantum computing devices. We show how the numerical representation of the noise function affects the performance of the error mitigation algorithm and test the convergence criteria. We benchmark our protocol on actual quantum computers with superconducting qubits, where the readout signal encodes the measurement information as unprocessed analog data before qubit state assignment. Finally, we compare the performance of our algorithm against other measurement error mitigation methods, such as iterative Bayesian unfolding and the Mthree method, and show how our method can be integrated on top of other readout error mitigation protocols.</p>

            <p>In this work, we show that the completeness relation for the eigenvectors, which is an essential assumption of quantum mechanics, remains true if the Hamiltonian, having a discrete spectrum, is modified by a delta potential (to be made precise by a renormalization scheme) supported at a point in two and three-dimensional compact manifolds or Euclidean spaces. The formulation can be easily extended to $N$ center case, and the case where delta interaction is supported on curves in the plane or space. We finally give an interesting application for sudden perturbation of the support of the delta potential.</p>

            <p>Spin amplification is the process that ideally increases the number of excited spins when one of them is excited initially. We show that by applying optimal control techniques to design classical drive pulse shapes, spin amplification can be achieved in a previously unexplored fast regime, with amplification times comparable to the intrinsic interaction timescale. This is an order of magnitude faster than the previous protocols and makes spin amplification possible even with significant decoherence and inhomogeneity in the spin system. The initial spin excitation can be delocalized over the entire ensemble, which is a more typical situation when a photon is collectively absorbed by the spins. We focus on the superconducting persistent-current artificial atoms and the Rydberg atoms as spins.</p>

            <p>Understanding and optimizing the relaxation dynamics of many-body systems is essential both for foundational studies in quantum thermodynamics and for applications such as quantum simulation and quantum computing. Efficient preparation of thermal states of a many-body Hamiltonian is governed by the spectral properties of the associated Lindbladian, in particular its spectral gap, which determines the slowest relaxation rate. In this work, we develop a systematic framework for constructing Lindbladians that prepare thermal states. Our approach reveals a simple relation between the relaxation dynamics at finite and infinite temperatures. The framework is scalable to larger system sizes when implemented using tensor-network methods. We find that efficient thermalization requires that the relaxation dynamics respect the symmetries of the thermal state, which reduces the number of free parameters. By applying gradient-based optimization to the Lindbladians, we enhance the spectral gap and thereby boost thermalization. When applied to both classical and quantum spin models, our method demonstrates a substantial enhancement of the spectral gap. For larger system sizes, our approach provides a variational upper bound and enables a certified lower bound on the minimum relaxation rate.</p>

            <p>We provide a universal framework for the quantum simulation of SU(N) Yang--Mills theories on fault-tolerant digital quantum computers adopting the orbifold lattice formulation. As warm-up examples, we also consider simple models, including scalar field theory and the Yang--Mills matrix model, to illustrate the universality of our formulation, which shows up in the fact that the truncated Hamiltonian can be expressed in the same simple form for any N, any dimension, and any lattice size, in stark contrast to the popular approach based on the Kogut--Susskind formulation. In all these cases, the truncated Hamiltonian can be programmed on a quantum computer using only standard tools well-established in the field of quantum computation. As a concrete application of this universal framework, we consider Hamiltonian time evolution by Suzuki--Trotter decomposition. This turns out to be a straightforward task due to the simplicity of the truncated Hamiltonian. We also provide a simple circuit structure that contains only CNOT and one-qubit gates, independent of the details of the theory investigated.</p>

Benchmarking shows our method achieves up to 5.49\% better modularity scores while requiring less computational time compared to classical optimization approaches.

            <p>We compare the performance of randomized classical and quantum neural networks (NNs) as well as classical and quantum-classical hybrid convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the task of supervised binary image classification. We keep the employed quantum circuits compatible with near-term quantum devices and use two distinct methodologies: applying randomized NNs on dimensionality-reduced data and applying CNNs to full image data. We evaluate these approaches on three fully-classical data sets of increasing complexity: an artificial hypercube data set, MNIST handwritten digits and industrial images. Our central goal is to shed more light on how quantum and classical models perform for various binary classification tasks and on what defines a good quantum model. Our study involves a correlation analysis between classification accuracy and quantum model hyperparameters, and an analysis on the role of entanglement in quantum models, as well as on the impact of initial training parameters. We find classical and quantum-classical hybrid models achieve statistically-equivalent classification accuracies across most data sets with no approach consistently outperforming the other. Interestingly, we observe that quantum NNs show lower variance with respect to initial training parameters and that the role of entanglement is nuanced. While incorporating entangling gates seems advantageous, we also observe the (optimizable) entangling power not to be correlated with model performance. We also observe an inverse proportionality between the number of entangling gates and the average gate entangling power. Our study provides an industry perspective on quantum machine learning for binary image classification tasks, highlighting both limitations and potential avenues for further research in quantum circuit design, entanglement utilization, and model transferability across varied applications.</p>

            <h2>Unified strategy for non-invertible Fisher information matrix in quantum metrology</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Min Namkung, Changhyoup Lee, Hyang-Tag Lim</p>
            <p>In quantum multi-parameter estimation, the precision of estimating unknown parameters is bounded by the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB), defined via the inverse of the Fisher information matrix (FIM). However, in certain scenarios such as distributed quantum sensing the FIM becomes non-invertible due to parameter redundancy, which depends on the probe state and measurement. This issue is often handled using a weaker form of the CRB, potentially overestimating the uncertainty and underrepresenting achievable precision. Here, we propose an alternative approach by introducing equality constraints to remove redundancy and define the CRB via the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of the FIM. This framework enables systematic treatment of both simultaneous estimation and distributed sensing cases. We demonstrate its utility by reanalyzing several known examples within this unified perspective, highlighting improved interpretability and practical relevance. Our results offer a concrete guideline for addressing non-invertible FIMs and enhancing the precision of quantum multi-parameter estimation in realistic scenarios.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stefano Veroni, Alexandru Paler, Giacomo Giudice</p>
            <p>We show that universal quantum computation can be concretely made fault-tolerant without mid-circuit measurements. To this end, we introduce a measurement-free deformation protocol of the Bacon-Shor code to realize a logical $\mathit{CCZ}$ gate. Combined with a fold-transversal logical Hadamard gate, this enables a universal set of fault-tolerant operations using only transversal gates and qubit permutations. For the purpose of benchmarking under circuit-level noise, we develop an efficient method to simulate non-Clifford circuits with a small number of Hadamard gates. Separately, we demonstrate that certain CSS codes can be concatenated without measurements or having to rely on a universal logical gate set. This is made possible by means of a resource-efficient gadget -- termed the ``disposable Toffoli gadget'' -- that realizes the error-correcting feedback. Then, under concatenation of the Bacon-Shor code, we observe a fault-tolerance threshold at a circuit-level depolarizing noise rate of approximately $0.12\,\%$. Together, the deformation and concatenation protocols outline a blueprint for a fully fault-tolerant architecture without any feed-forward operation, particularly suited to state-of-the-art neutral-atom platforms.</p>

            <p>Quantum compiling, which aims to approximate target qubit gates by finding optimal sequences (braidwords) of basic braid operations, constitutes a fundamental challenge in quantum computing. We develop a genetic algorithm (GA)-enhanced Solovay-Kitaev algorithm (SKA) for approximating single-qubit gates using four elementary braiding matrices (EBMs) derived from Fibonacci anyons. The GA-enhanced SKA demonstrates robust performance, efficiently identifying optimal braidwords within exponentially large search spaces. Notably, the approximation precision achieved by our method surpasses that of Monte Carlo (MC)-enhanced SKA and becomes comparable to deep reinforcement learning (RL) approaches when braidword lengths exceed 25. Implementing 2- and 3-order approximations with the GA-enhanced SKA yields optimal braidword (initial braiding lengths l0=50 and 30 respectively) achieving gate distances of 5.9*10-7 - sufficient precision for most quantum computing applications. This work develops an optimized compilation framework for non-Abelian anyon gates, providing an essential methodology for enhancing future topological quantum computation architectures through gate optimization.</p>

            <p>We experimentally realize a quantum clock by using a charge sensor to count charges tunneling through a double quantum dot (DQD). Individual tunneling events are used as the clock's ticks. We quantify the clock's precision while measuring the power dissipated by the DQD and, separately, the charge sensor in both direct-current and radio-frequency readout modes. This allows us to probe the thermodynamic cost of creating ticks microscopically and recording them macroscopically. Our experiment is the first to explore the interplay between the entropy produced by a microscopic clockwork and its macroscopic measurement apparatus. We show that the latter contribution not only dwarfs the former but also unlocks greatly increased precision, because the measurement record can be exploited to optimally estimate time even when the DQD is at equilibrium. Our results suggest that the entropy produced by the amplification and measurement of a clock's ticks, which has often been ignored in the literature, is the most important and fundamental thermodynamic cost of timekeeping at the quantum scale.</p>

            <p>We optimize matrix-product state-based algorithms for simulating quantum circuits with finite fidelity, specifically the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) and the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithms, by exploiting the irregular arrangement of entangling operations in circuits. We introduce a variation of the standard TEBD algorithm, we termed "cluster-TEBD", which dynamically arranges qubits into entanglement clusters, enabling the exact contraction of multiple circuit layers in a single time step. Moreover, we enhance the DMRG algorithm by introducing an adaptive protocol, which analyzes the entanglement distribution within each circuit section to be contracted, dynamically adjusting the qubit grouping at each iteration. We analyze the performances of these enhanced algorithms in simulating both stabilizer and nonstabilizer random-structured quantum circuits, with up to 1000 qubits and 100 layers of Clifford and non-Clifford gates, and in simulating Shor's quantum algorithm with up to hundreds of thousands of layers. Our findings show that, even with reasonable computational resources per task, cluster-based approaches can significantly speed up simulations of large-sized quantum circuits and improve the fidelity of the final states.</p>

            <h2>Moderate-length lifted quantum Tanner codes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Virgile Guémard, Gilles Zémor</p>
            <p>We introduce new families of quantum Tanner codes, a class of quantum codes that first appeared in the work of Leverrier and Zémor (FOCS 2022). These codes are built from two classical Tanner codes, for which the underlying graphs are extracted from coverings of 2D geometrical complexes, and the local linear codes are tensor-products of cyclic or double-circulant linear codes. The advantage of code lifting is that, for any lift of odd index $t$ of an $[[n,k,d]]$-code, we can adapt the study of the transfer homomorphism arising in cellular homology to describe symmetries of its logical operators and to establish that its dimension is lower bounded by $k$, and its distance is upper bounded by $t\cdot d$. Moreover, when the dimension of the lifted code is equal to $k$, its distance is lower bounded by $d$. These parameter bounds also apply to the previous methods of code lifting of Guémard (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, 2025). Finally, We present several explicit families, and identify instances of moderate length quantum codes which are degenerate, have low check weight, and whose distance surpasses the square root of the code length. Among them, we report the existence of a $[[96,2,12]]$-code whose distance growth saturates our bound, and for which half of the checks are of weight 8 and the other half of weight 4.</p>

            <p>Creating highly spin-squeezed states for quantum metrology surpassing the standard quantum limit is a topic of great interest. Spin squeezing has been achieved by either entangling different atoms in an ensemble, or by controlling the multilevel internal spin state of an atom. Here, we experimentally demonstrate combined internal and collective spin squeezing in a hot atomic ensemble with $\sim 10^{11}$ rubidium atoms. By synergistically combining these two types of squeezing and carefully aligning their squeezing quadratures, we have achieved a metrologically relevant spin squeezing of $-6.21\pm0.84$ dB, significantly outperforming the results obtained by utilizing either type of squeezing alone. Our approach provides a new perspective on fully harnessing the degrees of freedom inherent in quantum states of an atomic ensemble.</p>

            <p>We study the connection between exceptional points (EPs) and optimal parameter estimation, in a simple system consisting of two counter-propagating traveling wave modes in a microring resonator. The unknown parameter to be estimated is the strength of a perturbing cross-coupling between the two modes. Partially reflecting the output of one mode into the other creates a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian which exhibits a family of EPs, creating an exceptional surface (ES). We use a fully quantum treatment of field inputs and noise sources to obtain a quantitative bound on the estimation error by calculating the quantum Fisher information (QFI) in the output fields, whose inverse gives the Cramér-Rao lower bound on the mean-squared-error of any unbiased estimator. We determine the bounds for two input states, namely, a semiclassical coherent state and a highly nonclassical NOON state. We find that the QFI is enhanced in the presence of an EP for both of these input states and that both states can saturate the Cramér-Rao bound. We then identify idealized yet experimentally feasible measurements that achieve the minimum bound for these two input states. We also investigate how the QFI changes for parameter values that do not lie on the ES, finding that these can have a larger QFI, suggesting alternative routes to optimize the parameter estimation for this problem.</p>

            <p>Scalable interferometers lie at the heart of photonic quantum technologies, but their expansion has been fundamentally limited by optical losses that grow with circuit depth. Here, we introduce and experimentally demonstrate a measurement-induced architecture for multimode squeezed-light interferometers that overcomes this barrier.

We validate the principle with a six-mode device and extend it to a 400-mode interferometer, marking a leap in scale beyond conventional designs. Crucially, this strategy not only enables scalable squeezed light interferometry but also provides a powerful route to the generation of large-scale entangled states - a key requirement for quantum computing, simulation, and communication. Our results establish measurement-induced circuits as a practical pathway toward noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) applications, and future demonstrations of quantum advantage.</p>

We further extend AME properties to a family of non-Gaussian states constructed from discrete Zak basis states that incorporate grid states (a.k.a., Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill states) as non-Gaussian resources. Realizations of CV AME states enable open-destination multi-party CV teleportation, CV quantum secret sharing, CV majority-agreed key distribution, perfect-tensor networks on arbitrary geometries, and multi-unitary circuits. Our extension to non-Gaussian AME states may further provide robustness to Gaussian noise and benefits to quantum CV information processing.</p>

The optical response of the resonator shows correlation with the resonance modes and position, which is attributed to the two-level system around the resonator. These findings not only contribute to the design and understanding of quantum transducers and single-photon detectors, but also to the understandings of catastrophic high-energy particle irradiation events that generate unintended phonons in quantum devices.</p>

            <p>Mechanisms that give rise to coherent quantum dynamics, such as quantum many-body scars, have recently attracted much interest as a way of controlling quantum chaos. However, identifying the presence of quantum scars in general many-body Hamiltonians remains an outstanding challenge.

By iteratively evolving and projecting states within a low-entanglement variational manifold, ScarFinder isolates scarred trajectories by suppressing thermal contributions. We validate the method on the analytically tractable spin-1 XY model, recovering the known scar dynamics, as well as the mixed field Ising model, where we capture and generalize the initial conditions previously associated with ``weak thermalization''. We then apply the method to the PXP model of Rydberg atom arrays, efficiently characterizing its mixed phase space and finding a previously unknown trajectory with nearly-perfect revival dynamics in the thermodynamic limit. Our results establish ScarFinder as a powerful, model-agnostic tool for identifying and optimizing coherent dynamics in quantum many-body systems.</p>

Our algorithm represents a near-term alternative to previous sequential approaches by reverse application of a disentangler, which can be found by minimizing bipartite entanglement measures after the application of a layer of parameterized disentangling gates. Since a successful disentangler is expected to decrease the bond dimension on average, such a layer-by-layer optimization remains classically efficient even for deep circuits. Additionally, as the Schmidt coefficients of all bonds are locally accessible through the canonical $\Gamma$-$\Lambda$ form of an MPS, the optimization algorithm can be heavily parallelized. We discuss guarantees and limitations to trainability and show numerical results for ground states of one-dimensional, local Hamiltonians as well as artificially spread out entanglement among multiple qubits using error correcting codes.</p>

Quantum gates were derived from these EBMs. One-qubit gates were synthesized using a genetic algorithm-enhanced Solovay-Kitaev algorithm (GA-enhanced SKA), while two-qubit gates were constructed through brute-force search or GA optimization to approximate local equivalence classes [CNOT]. Implementing this framework for SU(2)5, SU(2)6, and SU(2)7 models successfully generated the canonical universal gate set {H-gate, T-gate, CNOT-gate}. These numerical results provide conclusive verification of the universal quantum computation capabilities inherent in SU(2)k anyon models.

            <p>We investigate parametric excitation and pattern formation in a harmonically trapped two-component Bose-Einstein condensate. We assume the condensate to be in the miscible phase, but near the miscible-immiscible phase transition, where total density and spin density excitations are decoupled. By periodically modulating the atomic scattering lengths, Faraday patterns can be generated in both density and spin channels. In an elongated condensate, the pattern in the spin channel corresponds to a one-dimensional standing wave with the two components exhibiting an out-of-phase density oscillation, where the modulation frequency and the oscillation period are related to the velocity of the spin sound. After the spin pattern is fully developed, the system quickly enters a nonlinear destabilization regime. For a pancake-shaped condensate, a two-dimensional Faraday pattern is generated with an interesting l-fold rotational symmetry. The number of nodes along the radial and angular directions increases with larger modulation frequencies. We also compare the growth rates of spin Faraday patterns generated with different modulation protocols, which are accessible to current experiments.</p>

We prepare Two-Mode Squeezed Vacuum (TMSV) states in the mechanical motions of a trapped ion and characterize the states with phase-space tomography. First, we verify continuous-variable entanglement by measuring an Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen entanglement parameter of 0.0132(7), which is below the threshold of 0.25 for Reid's EPR criterion. Second, we perform a continuous-variable Bell test and find a violation of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality, measuring 2.26(3), which is above the entanglement threshold of 2. We also demonstrate the flexibility of our method by preparing a non-Gaussian entangled oscillator state--a superposition of TMSV states.</p>

            <h2>On Quantum Entanglement and Nonlocality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mafiz Uddin</p>
            <p>Bell inequalities on local hidden variables were used to test particle entanglement given by the quantum mechanics wavefunction. The experiments on correlated photon pairs showed a clear violation of Bell inequalities and agreement with quantum mechanics. This study revealed that the Bell inequalities on normalized density function is true only for photon polarization at individual instances but it does not hold over the entire population in a given system. The Bell inequalities is not an incompatibility criterion for local hidden variables vs quantum mechanics rather it is a criterion for an individual nature vs population dynamics. The study found that the local variables (photon polarization) described each quantity in Bell test and a complete agreement with the experiments where quantum mechanics was incapable to provide as it is a unified system. The paper concludes with great satisfaction that the simultaneous measurement of two correlated photons at a distance was a local cause (photon-filter interaction did not violate the special theory of relativity) and the nonlocality description given by the wavefunction was not physical.</p>

            <p>We investigate the emergence of quantum coherence and quantum correlations in a two-particle system with deformed symmetries arising from the quantum nature of spacetime. We demonstrate that the deformation of energy-momentum composition induces a momentum-dependent interaction that counteracts the decoherence effects described by the Lindblad equation in quantum spacetime. This interplay leads to the formation of coherence, entanglement and other correlations, which we quantify using concurrence, the $l_1$-norm of coherence, quantum mutual information and Local Quantum Fisher Information. Our analysis reveals that while the openness of quantum spacetime ultimately degrades entanglement, it also facilitates the creation and preservation of both classical and quantum correlations.</p>

            <h2>Exact Quantum Capacity of Decohering Channels in Arbitrary Dimensions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shayan Roofeh, Vahid Karimipour</p>
            <p>We derive exact analytical expressions for the quantum capacity of a broad subclasses of generalized dephasing channels of the form $\Lambda(\rho)=(1-x)\rho + x D(\rho)$, where $D(\rho)$ represents a structured decoherence process. These channels are degradable for all noise parameters and in arbitrary dimensions, yielding closed-form, single-letter capacity formulas. Our analysis includes fully decohering, block-decohering, and weakly decohering channels, the latter involving coherence preservation within overlapping subspaces. Surprisingly, even under maximal decoherence, the channel may retain nonzero capacity due to residual coherence structure. These results provide quantitative role for decoherence-free and partially coherent subspaces in preserving quantum information, offering guidance for encoding strategies in quantum memories and fault-tolerant quantum communication systems.</p>

            <h2>A continuous variable quantum battery with wireless and remote charging</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jun Wen, Zheng Wen, Ping Peng, Guan-Qiang Li</p>
            <p>Quantum battery has become one of the hot issues at the research frontiers of quantum physics recently. Charging power, extractable work and wireless charging over long-distance are three important aspects of interest. Non-contact electromagnetic interaction provides an important avenue for wireless charging. In this paper, we design a wireless and remote charging scheme based on the quantized Hamiltonian of two coupled LC circuits, and focus on the charging dynamics of a continuous variable quantum battery. It is found that the quantum entanglement, which is regarded as a significant quantum resource, is not a prerequisite for charging the battery and extracting useful work. On the contrary, all of the energy in the battery could be converted into useful work in the absence of the entanglement for our model. The often overlooked counter-rotating wave coupling in the interacting Hamiltonian is helpful for extracting more useful work from the charger. If the coupling between the battery and the charger is designed to contain both the rotating and counter-rotating wave couplings, the extractable work can be obtained even if the charger is prepared in thermal states, while such effect cannot be achieved in the presence of a rotating or counter-rotating wave coupling alone. Finally, the effect of the system's parameters on the extractable work is discussed, which will provide a reference for full use of the thermal state energy.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jianmin Wang, Rong Zhu, Yue Li, Z. Y. Ou</p>
            <p>Any amplifier requires coupling to its internal degrees of freedom for energy gain. This coupling introduces extra quantum noise to the output. On the other hand, if the internal degree of the amplifier can be accessed and manipulated, we can manage and even reduce the quantum noise of the amplifier's output. In this paper, we present an experiment to reduce the quantum noise of a Raman amplifier by preparing the atomic medium in a correlated state with the Stokes light field. We report an observation of quantum noise reduction of more than 3.5 dB in the atomic Raman amplification process. From another perspective, the Raman amplifier at high gain in turn serves as a measurement tool for the quantum correlation between the atom and light. Furthermore, such a scheme, when viewed as a whole, also forms a quantum-entangled atom-light hybrid interferometer that can lead to quantum-enhanced sensors.</p>

            <p>Quantum machine learning (QML) has great potential for the analysis of chemical datasets. However, conventional quantum data-encoding schemes, such as fingerprint encoding, are generally unfeasible for the accurate representation of chemical moieties in such datasets. In this contribution, we introduce the quantum molecular structure encoding (QMSE) scheme, which encodes the molecular bond orders and interatomic couplings expressed as a hybrid Coulomb-adjacency matrix, directly as one- and two-qubit rotations within parameterised circuits. We show that this strategy provides an efficient and interpretable method in improving state separability between encoded molecules compared to other fingerprint encoding methods, which is especially crucial for the success in preparing feature maps in QML workflows. To benchmark our method, we train a parameterised ansatz on molecular datasets to perform classification of state phases and regression on boiling points, demonstrating the competitive trainability and generalisation capabilities of QMSE. We further prove a fidelity-preserving chain-contraction theorem that reuses common substructures to cut qubit counts, with an application to long-chain fatty acids. We expect this scalable and interpretable encoding framework to greatly pave the way for practical QML applications of molecular datasets.</p>

            <h2>Towards Practical Quantum Phase Estimation: A Modular, Scalable, and Adaptive Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alok Shukla, Prakash Vedula</p>
            <p>Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) is a cornerstone algorithm in quantum computing, with applications ranging from integer factorization to quantum chemistry simulations. However, the resource demands of standard QPE, which require a large number of coherent qubits and deep circuits, pose significant challenges for current Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. In this work, we introduce the Adaptive Windowed Quantum Phase Estimation (AWQPE) algorithm, a novel method designed to address the limitations of standard QPE. AWQPE utilizes small, independent blocks of $m > 1$ control qubits to estimate multiple phase bits simultaneously within a "window,'' thereby significantly reducing the number of iterations required to achieve a desired precision. These independent blocks are amenable to parallelization and, when combined with a robust least-significant-bit (LSB) to most-significant-bit (MSB) ambiguity resolution mechanism, enhance the algorithm's accuracy while mitigating the risk of error propagation. Our numerical simulations demonstrate AWQPE's accuracy and robustness, showcasing a distinct balance between resource efficiency and computational speed. This makes AWQPE particularly well-suited for near-term quantum platforms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kun Fang, Masahito Hayashi</p>
            <p>We consider the task of distinguishing whether a quantum system is prepared in a state from one of several sets of quantum states. Assuming their convexity and stability under tensor product, we prove that the optimal error exponent for discrimination is precisely given by the regularized quantum Chernoff divergence between the sets, thereby establishing a generalized quantum Chernoff bound for the discrimination of multiple sets of quantum states. This extends the classical and quantum Chernoff bounds to the general setting of composite and correlated quantum hypotheses. Furthermore, leveraging minimax theorems, we show that discriminating between sets of quantum states is no harder than discriminating between their worst-case elements in terms of error probability. This implies the existence of an optimal state-agnostic test that achieves the minimum error probability for all states in the sets, matching the performance of the optimal state-dependent test for the most difficult pair of states. We provide explicit characterizations of the optimal state-agnostic test in the binary composite case. Finally, we show that the maximum overlap between a pure state and a set of free states, a quantity that frequently arises in quantum resource theories, is equal to the quantum Chernoff divergence between the sets, thereby providing an operational interpretation of this quantity in the context of symmetric hypothesis testing.</p>

            <p>Pinpointing the dissipation mechanisms and evaluating their impacts to the performance of Josephson junction (JJ) are crucial for its application in superconducting circuits. In this work, we demonstrate the junction-embedded resonator (JER) as a platform which enables us to identify and quantify various dissipation mechanisms of JJ. JER is constructed by embedding JJ in the middle of an open-circuit, 1/2 {\lambda} transmission-line resonator. When the 1st and 2nd harmonics of JER are excited, JJ experiences different boundary conditions, and is dominated by internal and external dissipations, respectively. We systematically study these 2 dissipation mechanisms of JJ by varying the JJ area and number. Our results unveil the completely different behaviors of these 2 dissipation mechanisms, and quantitatively characterize their contributions, shedding a light on the direction of JJ optimization in various applications.</p>

            <h2>Positive maps and extendibility hierarchies from copositive matrices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aabhas Gulati, Ion Nechita, Sang-Jun Park</p>
            <p>This work introduces and systematically studies a new convex cone of PCOP (pairwise copositive). We establish that this cone is dual to the cone of PCP (pairwise completely positive) and, critically, provides a complete characterization for the positivity of the broad class of covariant maps. We provide a way to lift matrices from the cone of COP to PCOP, thereby creating a powerful bridge between the theory of copositive forms and the positive maps. We develop an analogous framework for decomposable maps, introducing the cone PDEC. As a primary application of this framework, we define a novel family of linear maps $\Phi_t^G$ parameterized by a graph $G$ and a real parameter $t$. We derive exact thresholds on $t$ that determine when these maps are positive or decomposable, linking these properties to fundamental graph-theoretic parameters. This construction yields vast new families of positive indecomposable maps, for which we provide explicit examples derived from infinite classes of graphs, most notably rank 3 strongly regular graphs such as Paley graphs. On the dual side, we investigate the entanglement properties of large classes of (symmetric) states. We prove that the SOS hierarchies used in polynomial optimization to approximate the cone of copositive matrices correspond precisely to dual cones of witnesses for different levels of the PPT bosonic extendibility hierarchy}-. In the setting of the DPS hierarchy for separability, we construct a large family of optimal entanglement witnesses that are not certifiable by any level of the PPT bosonic extendibility hierarchy, answering a long standing open question from [DPS04]. Leveraging the duality, we also provide an explicit construction of (mixture of) bipartite Dicke states that are simultaneously entangled and $K_r$-PPT bosonic extendible for any desired hierarchy level $r \geq 2$ and local dimension $n \geq 5$.</p>

For networks with more than two nodes, achieving perfect privacy is possible only asymptotically, in the limit of large photon numbers.

We show that local homodyne detection achieves a quadratic scaling of precision with the total number of photons. We further analyze the impact of thermal noise in the preparation stage on both privacy and estimation precision.

            <p>Joint spectral measurements are a powerful tool for characterising biphoton spectral correlation, which is crucial for quantum information and communication technologies. In these applications, highly pure biphoton states are essential in any time- and frequency-mode, often obviating the need for time-resolved measurements. Conversely, spectroscopy utilising entangled photon pairs is gaining significant attention for its ability to unveil molecular dynamics, a field that critically demands time-resolved capabilities. Here, we introduce a novel methodology for capturing a biphoton spectrum that comprises visible and near-infrared photons, resulting in a three-fold non-degenerate joint spectrum. Our system employs two non-scanning spectrographs: a fibre spectrograph for near-infrared photons and a delay-line-anode single-photon imager for visible photons. We successfully measure the joint spectral intensity by leveraging a time-tagging acquisition strategy. Furthermore, our approach uniquely enables time-resolved joint spectral measurements with a temporal resolution of approximately 150 ps. This methodology bridges the gap between the requirements for pure biphoton states and the need for dynamic insights in quantum spectroscopy.</p>

            <p>The generation of entangled photons through Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC) is a critical resource for many key experiments and technologies in the domain of quantum optics. Historically, SPDC was limited to the generation of photon pairs. However, the use of the strong nonlinearities in circuit quantum electrodynamics has recently enabled the observation of Three-Photon SPDC (3P-SPDC). Despite great interest in the entanglement structure of the resultant states, entanglement between photon triplets produced by a 3P-SPDC source has still has not been confirmed. Here, we report on the observation of genuine tripartite non-Gaussian entanglement in the steady-state output field of a 3P-SPDC source consisting of a superconducting parametric cavity coupled to a transmission line. We study this non-Gaussian tripartite entanglement using an entanglement witness built from three-mode correlation functions, and observe a maximum violation of the bound by 23 standard deviations of the statistical noise. Furthermore, we find strong agreement between the observed and the analytically predicted scaling of the entanglement witness. We then explore the impact of the temporal function used to define the photon mode on the observed value of the entanglement witness.</p>

            <p>Quantum phase estimation (QPE) and Lindbladian dynamics are both foundational in quantum information science and central to quantum algorithm design. In this work, we bridge these two concepts: certain simple Lindbladian processes can be adapted to perform QPE-type tasks. However, unlike QPE, which achieves Heisenberg-limit scaling, these Lindbladian evolutions are restricted to standard quantum limit complexity. This indicates that, different from Hamiltonian dynamics, the natural dissipative evolution speed of such Lindbladians does not saturate the fundamental quantum limit, thereby suggesting the potential for quadratic fast-forwarding. We confirm this by presenting a quantum algorithm that simulates these Lindbladians for time $t$ within an error $\varepsilon$ using $\mathcal{O}\left(\sqrt{t\log(\varepsilon^{-1})}\right)$ cost, whose mechanism is fundamentally different from the fast-forwarding examples of Hamiltonian dynamics. As a bonus, this fast-forwarded simulation naturally serves as a new Heisenberg-limit QPE algorithm. Therefore, our work explicitly bridges the standard quantum limit-Heisenberg limit transition to the fast-forwarding of dissipative dynamics. We also adopt our fast-forwarding algorithm for efficient Gibbs state preparation and demonstrate the counter-intuitive implication: the allowance of a quadratically accelerated decoherence effect under arbitrary Pauli noise.</p>

            <p>Topology optimization is a key methodology in engineering design for finding efficient and robust structures. Due to the enormous size of the design space, evaluating all possible configurations is typically infeasible. In this work, we present an end-to-end, fault-tolerant quantum algorithm for topology optimization that operates on the exponential Hilbert space representing the design space. We demonstrate the algorithm on the two-dimensional Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm (MBB) beam problem. By restricting design variables to binary values, we reformulate the compliance minimization task as a combinatorial satisfiability problem solved using Grover's algorithm. Within Grover's oracle, the compliance is computed through the finite-element method (FEM) using established quantum algorithms, including block-encoding of the stiffness matrix, Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) for matrix inversion, Hadamard test, and Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE). The complete algorithm is implemented and validated using classical quantum-circuit simulations. A detailed complexity analysis shows that the method evaluates the compliance of exponentially many structures in quantum superposition in polynomial time. In the global search, our approach maintains Grover's quadratic speedup compared to classical unstructured search. Overall, the proposed quantum workflow demonstrates how quantum algorithms can advance the field of computational science and engineering.</p>

            <p>In higher-order quantum computing (HOQC), one typically considers the universal transformation of unknown quantum operations, treated as blackboxes. It is also implicitly assumed that the resulting operation must act on arbitrary, and thus unknown, input states. In this work, we explore a variant of this framework in which the operation remains unknown, but the input state is fixed and known. We argue that this assumption is well-motivated in certain practical contexts, such as unitary programming, and show that classical knowledge of the input state can significantly enhance performance. We demonstrate that in the SAR protocol, this knowledge leads to an exponential advantage through a repeat-until-success strategy, highlighting the operational power of known-state higher-order transformations. Moreover, this assumption allows us to distinguish between protocols designed for pure, bipartite, and mixed states, which enables us to identify the class of mixed states for which deterministic and exact implementation becomes possible.</p>

We present \textbf{qc-kmeans}, a hybrid compressive $k$-means that summarizes a dataset with a constant-size Fourier-feature sketch and selects centroids by solving small per-group QUBOs with shallow QAOA circuits. The QFF sketch estimator is unbiased with mean-squared error $O(\varepsilon^2)$ for $B,S=\Theta(\varepsilon^{-2})$, and the peak-qubit requirement $q_{\text{peak}}=\max\{D,\lceil \log_2 B\rceil + 1\}$ does not scale with the number of samples. A refinement step with elitist retention ensures non-increasing surrogate cost. In Qiskit Aer simulations (depth $p{=}1$), the method ran with $\le 9$ qubits on low-dimensional synthetic benchmarks and achieved competitive sum-of-squared errors relative to quantum baselines; runtimes are not directly comparable. On nine real datasets (up to $4.3\times 10^5$ points), the pipeline maintained constant peak-qubit usage in simulation. Under IBM noise models, accuracy was similar to the idealized setting. Overall, qc-kmeans offers a NISQ-oriented formulation with shallow, bounded-width circuits and competitive clustering quality in simulation.</p>

A key challenge is the large bandwidth mismatch between QD photons and the narrow optical transitions of the memories. We combine a comprehensive model of the spin-photon interface, including full spin-photon coupling dynamics, and explore mitigation strategies such as frequency filtering and optimized magnetic-field orientation. Our results show that with optimized designs, photon-to-memory transfer can be achieved with high efficiency and fidelity, supporting the feasibility of such hybrid systems.

            <p>We introduce shallow instantaneous quantum polynomial-time (IQP) circuits as generative graph models, using an edge-qubit encoding to map graphs onto quantum states. Focusing on bipartite and Erdős-Rényi distributions, we study their expressivity and robustness through simulations and large-scale experiments. Noiseless simulations of $28$ qubits ($8$-node graphs) reveal that shallow IQP models can learn key structural features, such as the edge density and bipartite partitioning. On IBM's Aachen QPU, we scale experiments from $28$ to $153$ qubits ($8$-$18$ nodes) in order to characterize performance on real quantum hardware. Local statistics, such as the degree distributions, remain accurate across scales with total variation distances ranging from $0.04$ to $0.20$, while global properties like strict bipartiteness degrade at the largest system sizes ($91$ and $153$ qubits). Notably, spectral bipartivity, a relaxation of strict bipartiteness, remains comparatively robust at higher qubit counts. These results establish practical baselines for the performance of shallow IQP circuits on current quantum hardware and demonstrate that, even without error mitigation, such circuits can learn and reproduce meaningful structural patterns in graph data, guiding future developments in quantum generative modeling for the NISQ era and beyond.</p>

            <h2>Enhancing Remote Magnon-Magnon Entanglement with Quantum Interference</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuan Gong, Yan-Xue Cheng, Wei Xiong, Jiaojiao Chen</p>
            <p>Cavity magnonics, owing to its strong magnon-photon coupling and excellent tunability, has attracted significant interest in quantum information science. However, achieving strong and robust macroscopic entanglement remains a long-standing challenge due to the inherently linear nature of the beam-splitter interaction. Here, we propose an experimentally feasible scheme to generate and enhance macroscopic entanglement between two remote magnon modes by injecting squeezed vacuum fields (SVFs) into coupled microwave cavities. We demonstrate that even a single SVF applied to one cavity can induce steady magnon-magnon entanglement, while applying two SVFs (the double-squeezed configuration) enables selective activation of two independent entanglement channels associated with the cavity supermodes. Remarkably, quantum interference between the two SVFs allows for phase-controlled enhancement of entanglement, resulting in significantly improved robustness against cavity dissipation and thermal noise. Under realistic parameters, the survival temperature of quantum entanglement increases from approximately $260$ mK to $450$ mK. Our results establish a versatile and controllable approach to generating and enhancing quantum entanglement through double-squeezed-field interference, opening new avenues to study and enhance macroscopic quantum physics in cavity-magnon systems with only beam-splitter interactions.</p>

            <h2>Quantum-classical gravity distinction in reservoir-engineered massive quantum system</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ziqian Tang, Zizhao Han, Zikuan Kan, Chen Yang, Zeji Li, Yining Jiang, Yulong Liu</p>
            <p>Massive quantum systems have emerged as compelling tabletop interface-systems for testing the quantum nature of gravity. However, conventional schemes that focus on directly using gravity to induce entanglement suffer from overwhelming environmental decoherence: maintaining entanglement between two oscillators requires an impractically high mechanical quality factor. In this work, we put forward an alternative reservoir-engineered scheme, whose core function is to quantify how gravity modifies (rather than prepares) the steady-state entanglement. Compared to quantum gravity, classical gravity introduces additional dissipative channels, which in turn give rise to distinct entanglement characteristics and thus enable the discrimination between the two types of gravity. Notably, this entanglement difference can still be maintained even when the mechanical quality factor is far below the threshold required by conventional schemes. Moreover, it demonstrates significant robustness against non-gravitational couplings, specifically, those like Casimir and Coulomb forces that are inherent in experimental setups. Our scheme relaxes the experimental requirements for verifying quantum gravity, thereby paving a new path toward its near-term realization.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eric Ghysels, Jack Morgan</p>
            <p>Classical shadows are an efficient method for constructing an approximate classical description of a quantum state using very few measurements. In the paper we propose to enhance classical shadow methods using bootstrap resampling methods. We apply nonparametric bootstrapping to assess the variability and accuracy of estimators by repeatedly sampling with replacement from the observed data, i.e. in our case the classical shadow measurements. We show that the bootstrap distributions are very different from the Gaussian approximations. Likewise, the theoretical error bounds are not tight compared to the bootstrap percentiles. Finally, we suggest using resampling tools to make risk assessments.</p>

            <p>We gain quantitative insights on effects of light-matter interactions on correlated quantum matter by quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We introduce a wormhole algorithm for the paradigmatic Dicke-Ising model which combines the light-matter interaction of the Dicke model with Ising interactions. The quantum phase diagram for ferro- and antiferromagnetic interactions on the chain and the square lattice is determined. The occurring superradiant phase transitions are in the same universality class as the Dicke model leading to a well-known peculiar finite-size scaling that we elucidate in terms of scaling above the upper critical dimension. For the ferromagnetic case, the transition between the normal and the superradiant phase is of second order with Dicke criticality (first order) for large (small) longitudinal fields separated by a multicritical point. For antiferromagnetic interactions, we establish the light-matter analogue of a lattice supersolid with off-diagonal superradiant and diagonal magnetic order and determine the nature of all transition lines.</p>

Applications range from quantum computation to condensed matter physics and quantum gravity. We seek to bridge the approaches of these fields, which define and study complexity using different frameworks and tools. We describe several definitions of complexity, along with their key properties. In quantum information theory, we focus on complexity growth in random quantum circuits. In quantum many-body systems and quantum field theory (QFT), we discuss a geometric definition of complexity in terms of geodesics on the unitary group. In dynamical systems, we explore a definition of complexity in terms of state or operator spreading, as well as concepts from tensor-networks. We also outline applications to simple quantum systems, quantum many-body models, and QFTs including conformal field theories (CFTs). Finally, we explain the proposed relationship between complexity and gravitational observables within the holographic anti-de Sitter (AdS)/CFT correspondence.</p>

            <p>The recursion method provides a powerful framework for studying quantum many-body dynamics in the Lanczos basis recursively constructed within the Krylov space of operators. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the recursion method, when supplemented by the universal operator growth hypothesis, can effectively compute autocorrelation functions and transport coefficients at infinite temperature. We extend the scope of the recursion method to far-from-equilibrium quench dynamics. We apply the method to spin systems in one, two, and three spatial dimensions. In one dimension its usefulness is limited: although it remains accurate at moderate times, it eventually experiences an abrupt breakdown and subsequently yields results that deviate strongly from the true dynamics. In contrast, in two and three dimensions the method proves far more effective, providing a reasonably accurate description of the evolution across all time scales -- from the initial transient regime to thermalization.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> G. Gimeno, M. Xipell, Enric Pérez</p>
            <p>This work analyses the extent to which the "blurred orbits" of the current model for the atom, drafted by Heisenberg in 1926, fits the image of a bunch of wandering electrons around a nucleus. We will deal with early appearances of the concept of indistinguishable particles within the frame of quantum mechanics. There are few studies on the use of this concept in Heisenberg's 1926 papers on helium, in contrast with the large number of them on its use in Bose--Einstein's 1924 papers. We will discuss to what extent Heisenberg's approach leads to a purely statistical interpretation of this concept. We will also study the viewpoint of Dirac, who dealt with the same topic few months later. Although the indistinguishability of the electrons and indeterminacy are common explanations for the blurring of electron orbits, we argue that such an image is an oversimplification which masks interesting aspects of: a) the dynamics of bound electrons and b) the deeper implications of indistinguishability in quantum mechanics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christopher Gerard R. Sevilla, Jayson G. Cosme</p>
            <p>The atom-cavity system is a versatile platform for emulating light-matter systems and realizing dissipation-induced phases, such as limit cycles (LCs) and time crystals. Here, we study the dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) inside an optical cavity with transverse pumping and an additional intracavity optical lattice along the cavity axis. Specifically, we explore the theoretical predictions obtained from expanding the atomic field operators of the second-quantized Hamiltonian in two ways: (i) position basis and (ii) single-band Wannier basis. Both bases agree on the existence of most types of static and dynamical phases. However, the large sea of irregular dynamical phase, captured within the position basis, is absent in the Wannier basis. Moreover, we show that they predict different types of LCs due to the inherent limitation of the single-band Wannier expansion, highlighting the importance of including higher energy bands to correctly capture certain phenomena. Using truncated Wigner approximation, we investigate the fragmentation dynamics of the BEC. We demonstrate that both position and Wannier bases qualitatively agree on the photon-mediated fragmentation dynamics of the BEC in the density-wave phase, despite the absence of interatomic interactions. The presence of interatomic interaction leads to further fragmentation, which can only be observed in larger system sizes. Finally, we predict a sudden increase in the fragmentation behavior for larger pump intensities.</p>

            <p>We improve the convergence of the Lanczos algorithm using the matrix product state representation. As an alternative to the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), the Lanczos algorithm avoids local minima and can directly find multiple low-lying eigenstates. However, its performance and accuracy are affected by the truncation required to maintain the efficiency of the tensor network representation. In this work, we propose the modified thick-block Lanczos method to enhance the convergence of the Lanczos algorithm with MPS representation. We benchmark our method on one-dimensional instances of the Fermi-Hubbard model and the Heisenberg model in an external field, using numerical experiments targeting the first five lowest eigenstates. Across these tests, our approach attains the best possible accuracy permitted by the given bond dimension. This work establishes the Lanczos method as a reliable and accurate framework for finding multiple low-lying states within a tensor-network representation</p>

            <p>Systems exhibiting the Hilbert-space fragmentation are nonergodic, and their Hamiltonians decompose into exponentially many blocks in the computational basis. In many cases, these blocks can be labeled by eigenvalues of statistically localized integrals of motion (SLIOM), which play a similar role in fragmented systems as local integrals of motion in integrable systems. While a nonzero perturbation eliminates all nontrivial conserved quantities from integrable models, we demonstrate for the $t$-$J_z$ chain that an appropriately chosen perturbation may gradually eliminate SLIOMs (one by one) by progressively merging the fragmented subspaces. This gradual recovery of ergodicity manifests as an extended critical regime characterized by multiple peaks of the fidelity susceptibility. Each peak signals a change in the number of SLIOMs and blocks, as well as an ultra-slow relaxation of local observables.</p>

            <p>We study the temporal dynamics of light interacting with a one-dimensional lattice of cold atoms. In such a system, a photonic band gap opens up, yielding an efficient Bragg reflection for an incident field incoming with the right angle and detuning. Here, we report two new effects appearing in the Bragg reflection. First, for some detunings, there is a ``flash'', i.e., a transient increase of the reflected intensity when the incident field is switched off. Second, the subsequent extinction of the reflected field is clearly superradiant, with decay rates up to height times the natural decay rate of the atomic excited state. Numerical simulations are in qualitative agreement with the observations, which can be explained by a classical photonic model. Our results are a step towards exploiting this photonic band gap in atomic systems for quantum-optical applications.</p>

            <p>We present MetaTT, a Tensor Train (TT) adapter framework for fine-tuning of pre-trained transformers. MetaTT enables flexible and parameter-efficient model adaptation by using a single shared TT to factorize transformer sub-modules. This factorization indexes key structural dimensions, including layer and matrix type, and can optionally incorporate heads and tasks. This design allows MetaTT's parameter count to scale with the sum, rather than the product, of the modes, resulting in a substantially more compact adapter. Our benchmarks compare MetaTT with LoRA along with recent state-of-the-art matrix and tensor decomposition based fine-tuning methods. We observe that when tested on single-task standard language modeling benchmarks, MetaTT achieves competitive parameter efficiency to accuracy tradeoff. We further demonstrate that MetaTT performs competitively when compared to state-of-the-art methods on multi-task learning. Finally, we leverage the TT-ansatz to design a rank adaptive optimizer inspired by the DMRG method from many-body physics. Our results demonstrate that integrating this approach with AdamW enhances optimization performance for a specified target rank.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Karyn Le Hur, Fan Yang, Magali Korolev</p>
            <p>The one-dimensional (1D) $J_1-J_2$ quantum spin model can be viewed as a strong-coupling analogue of the Schrieffer-Su-Heeger model with two inequivalent alternating Ising couplings along the wire, associated to the physics of resonating valence bonds. Similar to the quantum Ising model, which differently presents a long-range N\' eel ordered phase, this model also maps onto a p-wave superconducting wire which shows a topological phase transition with the emergence of low-energy Majorana fermions. We show how signatures of the topological phase transition for the p-wave superconducting wire, i.e. a half Skyrmion, are revealed through local (short-range) spin observables and their derivatives related to the capacitance of the pairing fermion model. Then, we present an edge correspondence through the edge spin susceptibility in the $J_1-J_2$ model revealing that the topological phase transition is a metal of Majorana fermions. We justify that the spin magnetization at an edge at very small transverse magnetic field is a good marker of the topological invariant and of Majorana zero modes. We identify a correspondence between the quantum information of resonating valence bonds and the charge fluctuations in a p-wave superconductor through our method "the bipartite fluctuations". Physical properties of this 1D model are in fact robust when including additional interactions, which is optimistic for practical applications e.g. in quantum circuits.</p>

The emergence of AS dualism is due to the fact that non-Hermitian topological systems provide non-trivial topological transport channels for disordered systems, causing the originally localized Anderson modes to transform into skin modes, i.e., the localized states within the point gap regions have dual characteristics of localization under periodic boundary condition (PBC) and skin effects under open boundary conditions (OBC). As an example, we analytically prove the 1D AS dualism through the transfer matrix method. Moreover, by discussing many-body interacting systems, we confirm that AS dualism is universal.</p>

            <p>The negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is a leading solid-state quantum emitter, offering spin-photon interfaces over a wide temperature range with applications from electromagnetic sensing to bioimaging. While NV centers in bulk diamond are well understood, embedding them in nanodiamond (ND) introduces complexities from size, NV location, and NV polarizations. NVs in ND show altered fluorescence properties including longer lifetimes, lower quantum efficiency, and higher sensitivity to dielectric surroundings, which arise from radiative suppression, surface-induced non-radiative decay, and escape inefficiency at the diamond-background interface. Prior models typically addressed isolated aspects, such as dielectric contrast or surface quenching, without integrating full quantum-optical NV behavior with classical electrodynamics. We present a hybrid framework coupling rigorous electromagnetic simulations with a quantum-optical NV model including phonon sideband dynamics. NV emission is found to depend strongly on ND size, NV position, and surrounding refractive index. Our results explain observations such as shallow NVs in water-coated ND appearing brighter than deeper ones in air. This integrated model provide a unified framework for realistic NV in ND emission scenarios and informs the design of efficient NV-based sensors and quantum devices, advancing understanding of quantum emitter photophysics in nanoscale crystals.</p>

            <p>Magnon spintronics aims to harness spin waves in magnetic films for information technologies. Color center magnetometry is a promising tool for imaging spin waves, using electronic spins associated with atomic defects in solid-state materials as sensors. However, two main limitations persist: the magnetic fields required for spin-wave control detune the sensor-spin detection frequency, and this frequency is further restricted by the color center nature. Here, we overcome these limitations by decoupling the sensor spins from the spin-wave control fields -selecting color centers with intrinsic anisotropy axes orthogonal to the film magnetization- and by using color centers in diamond and hexagonal boron nitride to operate at complementary frequencies. We demonstrate isofrequency imaging of field-controlled spin waves in a magnetic half-plane and show how intrinsic magnetic anisotropies trigger bistable spin textures that govern spin-wave transport at device edges. Our results establish color center magnetometry as a versatile tool for advancing spin-wave technologies.</p>

            <p>Optical systems capable of generating fields with sub-wavelength spatial features have become standard in science and engineering research and industry. Pertinent examples include atom- and ion-based quantum computers and optical lithography setups. So far, no tools exist to characterize such fields - both intensity and polarization - at sub-wavelength length scales. We use a single trapped atomic ion, confined to approximately 40 nm X 40 nm X 180 nm to sense a laser light field at a wavelength of 370 nm. With its spatial extent smaller than the absorption cross-section of a resonant detector, the ion-sensor operates at the fundamental limit of spatial resolution. Our technique relies on developing an analytical model of the ion-light interaction and using the model to extract the intensity and polarization. An important insight provided in this work is also that the inverse of this model can be learned, in a restricted sense, on a deep neural network, speeding up the intensity and polarization readout by five orders of magnitude. This speed-up makes the technique field-deployable to characterize optical instruments by probing light at the sub-wavelength scale.</p>

            <p>For nanoscale single-layer graphene-based devices, valley-dependent topological physics may be exploited in device design. To demonstrate the point, we investigate an electrical bias-controlled, topological kind discontinuity in valley polarization, in a two-segment armchair nanoribbon of single-layer graphene, where the discontinuity is created at the interface by applying opposite in-plane, transverse electrical biases to the two segments. In particular, using an efficient tight-binding theoretical formulation, we explicitly obtain energy eigenvalues and probability distributions of discontinuity-induced, interface-confined electron eigenstates, in a reference configuration. Moreover, implications of the confinement for electron transport are explored. A configurational variation is introduced to transform the eigenstates into transport-active, quasi-localized ones. Such states are shown to result in Fano "anti-resonances" in transmission spectra. The resilience of the quasi-localized states and their associated Fano fingerprints is presented with respect to configurational fluctuations. Last, a proof-of-concept electron energy band-stop filter is illustrated, highlighting the potential of the foregoing confinement and, more broadly, valley-dependent topological physics in designing nanoscale single-layer graphene devices.</p>

            <p>Radio-frequency reflectometry, which probes small changes in the electrical impedance of a device, provides a useful method for sensitive and fast detection of dynamic processes in quantum systems. We use this method to detect excitation of the quantized motional (Rydberg) states of trapped electrons on liquid helium. The Rydberg transition in an ensemble of electrons is detected by a change in the impedance of an rf circuit coupled to the microwave-excited electrons. To elucidate the origin of the observed response, the result is compared with an independent impedance measurement on the same electron system modulated by an electrostatic potential and with a numerical simulation using the Green's function method. Additionally, it is found that the rf response to the Rydberg resonance can be strongly enhanced by a resonant mode of the electron collective motion. Our results suggest that the observed response to the Rydberg resonance must be attributed to the lateral motion of the many-electron system rather than the vertical displacement of the individually excited electrons, as was explicate earlier. A theoretical analysis of the expected response due to the vertical displacement is given.</p>

The model is motivated by the physics of fracton excitations, which only possess mobility in a reduced dimension compared to the full model. We provide an exact mapping of this model to an arbitrary number of independent transverse-field Ising chain segments with open boundary conditions. The number and lengths of these segments correspond directly to the number of immobile excitations and their respective distances from one another. Furthermore, we demonstrate that multiple immobile excitations exhibit Casimir-like forces between them, resulting in a non-trivial spectrum.</p>

            <p>Quantum phase imaging enables the analysis of transparent samples with thickness and refractive index variations in scenarios requiring precise measurements under low-light conditions. Recent advances in nonlinear metasurfaces offer compact solutions for quantum light generation and manipulation. Here, we present a compact quantum phase imaging system integrating a lithium niobate (LiNbO3) metasurface for generating spatially entangled photon pairs and a silicon (Si) metasurface for phase gradient extraction. The LiNbO3 metasurface enables efficient spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) with angularly dispersed, tunable emission, while the Si metasurface employs a nearly linear optical transfer function (OTF) to differentiate phase and extract phase gradients via spatial quantum correlations. This dual-metasurface enabled combined ghost imaging and all-optical scanning protocols with quantum light achieves phase gradient reconstruction without mechanical tuning. Experimental results demonstrate the system's ability to resolve phase gradients up to 25 rad/mm with 88% fidelity using a 6x3-pixel proof-of-concept setup. In addition, theoretically, it is confirmed that the resolution of the system is primarily limited by the quality factor of the compact design, leveraging nonlocal resonances and quantum correlations, establishes a new paradigm for portable quantum phase-gradient imaging, with potential applications in sensing, microscopy, and LiDAR.

            <p>We investigate the dynamics of key quantum correlations - Negativity (NG), Quantum Discord (QD), and Quantum-Memory-Assisted Entropic Uncertainty (QM-EUR) - in a bipartite two-qubit system under the influence of external pulses and various decoherence channels, including amplitude damping (gamma_amp), pure dephasing (gamma_deph), and pulse-induced dephasing (G), while different regimes of inter-qubit coupling (Jzz, Jxx), qubit energy splitting (epsilon), and pulse parameters (A_pulse, beta_pulse) are explored. Our results show that inter-qubit coupling and energy splitting epsilon significantly influence the dynamics, producing pronounced oscillations in the weak-coupling regime and protecting pre-existing entanglement in the strong-coupling regime. NG is the most sensitive, QD persists longer revealing nonclassical correlations independent of entanglement, and QM-EUR reflects residual quantum memory and entropic uncertainty, showing that quantum signatures survive even when NG and QD are weak. Pulse amplitude and width effectively control the generation and dissipation of correlations, while the intensity of pulse-induced dephasing modulates the balance between sustained oscillations and rapid decoherence. The initial state also plays a crucial role: a partially entangled initial state is more resilient to perturbations, preserving correlations over time, whereas a separable state exhibits cycles of entanglement creation and destruction. Thus, by adjusting system parameters, it is possible to control the stability and lifetime of correlations and coherence, providing a framework to optimize quantum systems for applications requiring both strong entanglement and long-lasting coherence, such as quantum computing and secure communication.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement boosting: Low-volume logical Bell pair preparation for distributed fault-tolerant quantum computation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shinichi Sunami, Yutaka Hirano, Toshihide Hinokuma, Hayata Yamasaki</p>
            <p>Distributed architecture is a promising route to scaling fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) beyond the inherent limitations of single processors. For practical implementation of distributed FTQC, logical Bell pair preparation must be designed not only for efficient Bell pair consumption but also for the spacetime volume of the protocol; however, entanglement distillation protocols have primarily focused on minimizing the consumption of Bell pairs, often resulting in protocols that require a substantial number of local operations. To resolve this issue, we introduce a metric for characterizing the practical cost of preparing high-fidelity logical Bell pairs, link-limited volume (LLV), which is a circuit-volume metric incorporating both the cost of physical Bell pair consumption and the volume associated with local operations. Guided by this metric, we propose entanglement boosting protocol, which achieves efficient preparation of logical Bell pairs encoded in rotated surface code with LLV reduced by orders of magnitude compared to prior state-of-the-art methods. In this protocol, paralleling recent advances in magic state cultivation, we employ soft-information decoders and postselection to suppress the logical error rates of Bell pairs to practical levels in the order of $10^{-10}$ from fewer than 100 noisy physical Bell pairs while all local operations are implementable within a spatial region of a single surface code patch. We also present a pipelined implementation of entanglement distillation using high-rate quantum error-correcting codes, enabling arbitrarily low logical error rates while also maintaining physically efficient implementations. These results pave the way for the practical implementation of distributed FTQC, reinforcing the benefits of fast interconnect technologies and serving as a guiding principle for the efficient design of protocols and devices.</p>

            <h2>Optimal propagation distance for maximal biphoton entanglement through the weakly turbulent atmosphere</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luchang Niu, Saleem Iqbal, Yang Xu, Robert W. Boyd</p>
            <p>Understanding the influence of atmospheric turbulence on the propagation of entangled biphoton states is essential for free-space quantum communication protocols. Using the extended Huygens-Fresnel principle and the Kolmogorov turbulence model, we derive an analytical expression for the combined density operator of the signal and idler fields generated via SPDC, following propagation through separate turbulent channels. By expressing this density operator in the continuous position basis, we show how the spatial correlations between signal and idler persist through turbulence despite the loss of state purity, as they transition from being quantum to classical in nature. We further identify a finite range of propagation distances over which the angle-OAM entanglement is maximized, which provides valuable insights for designing free-space quantum communication links operating over several kilometers through the turbulent atmosphere.</p>

            <h2>A New Quantum Secure Time Transfer System</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ravi Singh Adhikari, Aman Gupta, Anju Rani, Xiaoyu Ai, Robert Malaney</p>
            <p>High-precision clock synchronization is essential for a wide range of network-distributed applications. In the quantum space, these applications include communication, sensing, and positioning. However, current synchronization techniques are vulnerable to attacks, such as intercept-resend attacks, spoofing, and delay attacks. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a new quantum secure time transfer (QSTT) system, subsequently used for clock synchronization, that largely negates such attacks. Novel to our system is the optimal use of self-generated quantum keys within the QSTT to information-theoretically secure the maximum amount of timing data; as well as the introduction, within a hybrid quantum/post-quantum architecture, of an information-theoretic secure obfuscated encryption sequence of the remaining timing data. With these enhancements, we argue that our new system represents the most robust implementation of QSTT to date.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhen-huan Yang, Dan-Bo Zhang</p>
            <p>Spontaneous macroscopic quantum synchronization is an emergent phenomenon where an ensemble of quantum oscillators achieves global phase coherence through the interplay of interaction and dissipation. To illuminate this phenomenon, we study an ensemble of two-level systems (TLS) and establish its associated nonlinear quantum master equation, for which self-consistent analytical solutions of quantum synchronization can be obtained. The trajectories on the Bloch sphere vividly illustrate how dissipation and interaction drive the system toward a synchronized state. We present a phase diagram for macroscopic synchronization as a function of interaction strength and the gain-to-damping ratio. Furthermore, we demonstrate full synchronization and partial synchronization between two groups of TLS with different natural frequencies. This work establishes ensemble of TLS as a remarkable system for understanding spontaneous quantum synchronization.</p>

            <p>Quantum error correction (QEC) requires non-invasive measurements for fault tolerant quantum computing. Deviations from ideal quantum non-demolition (QND) measurements can disturb the encoded information. To address this challenge, we develop a readout protocol for a $D-$dimensional system that, after a single positive outcome, switches to probing only the $D{-}1$ remaining subspace. This adaptive switching strategy minimizes measurement-induced errors by relying on negative-result measurement results that do not perturb the Hamiltonian. We apply the protocol on an 8-dimensional $^{123}{\rm Sb}$ nuclear qudit in silicon, and achieve an increase in the readout fidelity from $(98.93\pm0.07)\%$ to $(99.61\pm0.04)\%$, while reducing threefold the overall readout time. To highlight the broader relevance of measurement-induced errors, we study a 10-dimensional $^{73}{\rm Ge}$ nuclear spin read out through Pauli spin blockade, revealing nuclear spin flips arising from hyperfine and quadrupole interactions. These results unveil the effect of non-ideal QND readout across diverse platforms, and introduce an efficient readout protocol that can be implemented with minimal FPGA logic on existing hardware.</p>

            <p>The Riemann Hypothesis (RH), one of the most profound unsolved problems in mathematics, concerns the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function. Establishing connections between the RH and physical phenomena could offer new perspectives on its physical origin and verification. Here, we establish a direct correspondence between the nontrivial zeros of the zeta function and dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) in two realizable quantum systems, characterized by the averaged accumulated phase factor and the Loschmidt amplitude, respectively. This precise correspondence reveals that the RH can be viewed as the emergence of DQPTs at a specific temperature. We experimentally demonstrate this correspondence on a five-qubit spin-based system and further propose an universal quantum simulation framework for efficiently realizing both systems with polynomial resources, offering a quantum advantage for numerical verification of the RH. These findings uncover an intrinsic link between nonequilibrium critical dynamics and the RH, positioning quantum computing as a powerful platform for exploring one of mathematics' most enduring conjectures and beyond.</p>

In particular, we show how finite-size effects impact the lifetimes of these large arrays. Our results may have interesting applications for quantum memories and topological effects in ordered atomic arrays.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lijuan Dong, Aanal Jayesh Shah, Peter Kirton, Hadiseh Alaeian, Simone Felicetti</p>
            <p>Analogous to Coulomb blockade for electrons, photon blockade is a key quantum optical effect in which the presence of one photon prevents the transmission of subsequent ones through a nonlinear medium. Beyond its fundamental interest, photon and multi-photon blockade are actively studied as mechanisms for generating technologically-relevant quantum states of light. Although photon blockade typically requires achieving strong light-matter coupling, increasing the number of atoms fails to enhance antibunching. Here, we analyze the optical transmission properties of a quantum resonator that embeds a two-photon-coupled ensemble of emitters, combining an approximate analytical approach with full quantum numerical simulations. We show that when light and matter are coupled via a two-photon interaction, both single- and multi-photon blockade can benefit from a collective enhancement. We propose different driving schemes in which the second or third-order correlation functions are strongly suppressed with increasing atom number. Differently from established methods, this collective enhancement of non-classical properties occurs with unitary transmission and is ultimately constrained only by decoherence. This demonstrates that collective two-photon couplings are a powerful mechanism for realizing photon blockade even in platforms where individual strong coupling is not achievable.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate $4\pi$-steradian vector magnetic field sensing using an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in a single-crystal diamond coupled to a microwave (MW) cavity. The MW cavity enhances the spin-photon coupling which enables efficient, high-contrast spin-state readout via MW interrogation and removes the need for bulky optical collection components. An applied AC bias magnetic field lifts the zero-field degeneracy of the four crystallographic NV orientations, allowing each orientation to be individually addressed and used for vector reconstruction of the magnetic field. The resulting magnetometer has a 40\% contrast (20x higher than typical for optical spin-ensemble readout) and achieves a single-axis sensitivity of 250 pT/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ which is flat from DC to 1 kHz. Noise models of the composite spin-cavity system establish MW amplitude noise as the dominant noise source and predict a thermal noise limit of 2 pT/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$.</p>

            <p>The use of quantum light to probe exciton properties in semiconductor and molecular nanostructures typically occurs in the low-intensity regime. A substantial enhancement of exciton-photon coupling can be achieved with photonic cavities, where excitons hybridize with cavity modes to form polariton states. To provide a theoretical framework for interpreting experimental efforts in this direction, we develop a scattering theory describing the interaction of frequency-entangled photon pairs with cavity polariton and bipolariton states under various coupling regimes. Employing the Tavis-Cummings model in combination with our scattering approach, we present a quantitative analysis of how the interaction of the entangled photon pair with the polariton/bipolariton modifies its joint spectral amplitude (JSA). Specifically, we examine the effects of the cavity-mode steady-state population, exciton-cavity coupling strength, and different forms of the input photon JSA. Our results show that the entanglement entropy of the scattered photons is highly sensitive to the interplay between the input JSA and the spectral line shapes of the polariton resonances, emphasizing the cavity filtering effects. We suggest that biphoton scattering quantum light spectroscopy best serves as a sensitive probe of polariton and bipolariton states in the photon-vacuum cavity state.</p>

Although not topologically protected, the qubit leverages distinct spatial profiles to couple to two independent environmental baths, realizing the phenomenon of quantum this http URL mechanism is tested against the threat of quasiparticle poisoning (QP). I show that frustration is effective against Ohmic noise ($s=1$) and has some protection for $0.76<s<1$ sub-Ohmic noise. However, the experimentally prevalent $1/f$ noise ($s\to0$) falls deep within the model's localized phase, where frustration is insufficient. This causes Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking and catastrophic decoherence. The qubit's viability depends on what is the effective environment that these local Majorana wave functions experience.</p>

            <p>We analyze a simple and efficient experimental protocol to cool the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model to low temperatures. The protocol utilizes local couplings between two copies of an SYK model to create a gapped adiabatic path, between a high temperature product state and a low temperature thermofield double state. By smoothly varying the coupling strength between these two limits, one efficiently cools the SYK model. We support these predictions-and demonstrate fast cooling to the low-temperature gravitational regime-via exact numerical solutions to the large-N equations of motion that govern the ground state and dynamical properties of the coupled system. Finally, we present a theoretical framework based upon eigenstate thermalization that provides a microscopic explanation for the efficacy of the cooling protocol; intriguingly, this suggests that the protocol may be applicable for cooling strongly-interacting quantum Hamiltonians more broadly.</p>

            <p>Quantum superposition famously manifests as spatial interference, epitomized by the double-slit experiment. Its less explored temporal analogue, Stückelberg interference, arises in driven systems where phases accumulated along distinct time-domain pathways recombine. Extending this phenomenon to large interacting systems introduces a new complexity as delicate phase relationships are disrupted by many-body interactions. Here we experimentally achieve controllable vacuum-state freezing in programmable Rydberg arrays of up to 100 atoms through many-body Stückelberg interference, with visibility exceeding $70\%$ and excitation suppression to $1\%$ despite periodic driving that would typically induce heating. Comparing single and dual-frequency protocols across multiple geometries, we show that simultaneous modulation of detuning and Rabi frequency dramatically enhances interference-driven freezing. Finite-range interaction tails play a decisive role, producing interference patterns which constrained $PXP$ models cannot capture. Our results establish temporal interference as a scalable microscopic mechanism for Floquet control, enabling predictive many-body state engineering in large-scale platforms.</p>

            <h2>A measurement-driven quantum algorithm for SAT: Performance guarantees via spectral gaps and measurement parallelization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Franz J. Schreiber, Maximilian J. Kramer, Alexander Nietner, Jens Eisert</p>
            <p>The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is of central importance in both theory and practice. Yet, most provable guarantees for quantum algorithms rely exclusively on Grover-type methods that cap the possible advantage at only quadratic speed-ups, making the search for approaches that surpass this quadratic barrier a key challenge. In this light, this work presents a rigorous worst-case runtime analysis of a recently introduced measurement-driven quantum SAT solver. Importantly, this quantum algorithm does not exclusively rely on Grover-type methods and shows promising numerical performance. Our analysis establishes that the algorithm's runtime depends on an exponential trade-off between two key properties: the spectral gap of the associated Hamiltonian and the success probability of the driving measurements. We show that this trade-off can be systematically controlled by a tunable rotation angle. Beyond establishing a worst-case runtime expression, this work contributes significant algorithmic improvements. First, we develop a new readout routine that efficiently finds a solution even for instances with multiple satisfying assignments. Second, a measurement parallelization scheme, based on perfect hash families, is introduced. Third, we establish an amplitude-amplified version of the measurement-driven algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility of our framework: By suitably scheduling the algorithm's parameters, we show that its runtime collapses from exponential to polynomial on a special class of SAT instances, consistent with their known classical tractability. A problem we leave open is to establish a non-trivial lower bound on the spectral gap as a function of the rotation angle. Resolving this directly translates into an improved worst-case runtime, potentially realizing a super-quadratic quantum advantage.</p>

When the coordinates of the trajectory are independently addressable by external drives, the net energy transferred between drives is set by the non-abelian Berry-curvature tensor. The trajectory-averaged pumping power is separately controlled by the initial state and by the Hamiltonian topology through the Euler class.

            <p>We introduce the Two-Mode Janus State (TMJS), a non-Gaussian quantum state defined as a coherent superposition of two distinct Two-Mode Squeezed States (TMSS). This construction serves as a direct, non-Gaussian generalization of the canonical thermofield double (TFD) state, which is itself a single, Gaussian TMSS. We develop a complete analytical framework for the TMJS's arbitrary $k$-th order photon statistics, identifying a new family of "squeezing polynomials" that govern all diagonal and off-diagonal moments. Our central result is that the state's non-Gaussianity is dynamically steerable via an external "Janus phase." This phase acts as a switch, allowing the higher-order coherences ($g^{(k)}$) to be tuned from perfectly thermal (matching the TFD marginal) to deeply sub-Poissonian, a regime marked by strong Wigner negativity. We further establish a physical realization for the TMJS, proposing its generation via coherently superposed Dynamical Casimir Effect (DCE) trajectories, distinguishing it from the static, observer-dependent Unruh effect. The TMJS provides a versatile, interference-enhanced platform for engineering Unruh-DeWitt detector responses and probing non-Gaussian physics in relativistic settings.</p>

            <p>Quantum state tomography is a fundamental task in quantum information science, enabling detailed characterization of correlations, entanglement, and electronic structure in quantum systems. However, its exponential measurement and computational demands limit scalability, motivating efficient alternatives such as classical shadows, which enable accurate prediction of many observables from randomized measurements. In this work, we introduce a bi-objective semidefinite programming approach for constrained shadow tomography, designed to reconstruct the two-particle reduced density matrix (2-RDM) from noisy or incomplete shadow data. By integrating $N$-representability constraints and nuclear-norm regularization into the optimization, the method builds an $N$-representable 2-RDM that balances fidelity to the shadow measurements with energy minimization. This unified framework mitigates noise and sampling errors while enforcing physical consistency in the reconstructed states. Numerical and hardware results demonstrate that the approach significantly improves accuracy, noise resilience, and scalability, providing a robust foundation for physically consistent fermionic state reconstruction in realistic quantum simulations.</p>

            <p>Quantum computers have long been expected to efficiently solve complex classical differential equations. Most digital, fault-tolerant approaches use Carleman linearization to map nonlinear systems to linear ones and then apply quantum linear-system solvers. However, provable speedups typically require digital truncation and full fault tolerance, rendering such linearization approaches challenging to implement on current hardware. Here we present an analog, continuous-variable algorithm based on coupled bosonic modes with qubit-based adaptive measurements that avoids Hilbert-space digitization. This method encodes classical fields as coherent states and, via Kraus-channel composition derived from the Koopman-von Neumann (KvN) formalism, maps nonlinear evolution to linear dynamics. Unlike many analog schemes, the algorithm is provably efficient: advancing a first-order, $L$-grid point, $d$-dimensional, order-$K$ spatial-derivative, degree-$r$ polynomial-nonlinearity, strongly dissipative partial differential equations (PDEs) for $T$ time steps costs $\mathcal{O}\left(T(\log L + d r \log K)\right)$. The capability of the scheme is demonstrated by using it to simulate the one-dimensional Burgers' equation and two-dimensional Fisher-KPP equation. The resilience of the method to photon loss is shown under strong-dissipation conditions and an analytic counterterm is derived that systematically cancels the dominant, experimentally calibrated noise. This work establishes a continuous-variable framework for simulating nonlinear systems and identifies a viable pathway toward practical quantum speedup on near-term analog hardware.</p>

The effect is especially pronounced when both the system and environment exhibit $PT$-symmetry. Interestingly, greater environmental non-Hermiticity correlates with extended coherence, contrary to traditional expectations.

On one hand, by designing the non-Markovian coupling parameters between the waveguide and resonator, single or two-photon transport and the resulting photon blockade effect can be manipulated according to the output photonic states at the end of waveguide. This non-Markovian process can be evaluated by scattering matrices and second order correlation functions related to the distance between two coupled points. On the other hand, when classical driving fields are applied upon the resonator with interactions between its clockwise and counterclockwise modes, the blockade effect of the output field can be determined by the intracavtiy eigenstates. Then the correlations of the output field as well as the intracavity states can be modulated by the non-Markovian coupling between the microring resonator and waveguide.</p>

            <p>Scaling superconducting quantum processors beyond single dilution refrigerators requires efficient optical interconnects, yet integrating microwave-to-optical (M2O) transducers poses challenges due to frequency mismatches and qubit decoherence. We propose a modular architecture using SNAIL-based parametric coupling to interface Brillouin M2O transducers with long-lived 3D cavities, while maintaining plug-and-play compatibility. Through numerical simulations incorporating realistic noises, including laser heating, propagation losses, and detection inefficiency, we demonstrate raw entangled bit fidelities of F~0.8 at kHz-level rates over 30 km using the Duan-Lukin-Cirac-Zoller (DLCZ) protocol. Implementing asymmetric entanglement pumping tailored to amplitude damping errors, we achieve purified fidelities F~0.94 at 0.2 kHz rates. Our cavity-based approach outperforms transmon schemes, providing a practical pathway for distributed superconducting quantum computing.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement Phase Transition in Chaotic non-Hermitian Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhen-Tao Zhang, Feng Mei</p>
            <p>We have studied entanglement phase transition in a class of chaotic non-Hermitian spin chain in which its spin-spin coupling term commutes with the non-Hermitian term. Two models are investigated: transverse field Ising model with a complex longitudinal field and non-Hermitian XX model with a transverse field. Through calculating their complex spectra, we find these models are subject to a gapless-gapped phase transition with dissipation rate if the transverse field is larger than a model-dependent value. Interestingly, the variation of the complex gap with the dissipation rate is not monotonous, instead it manifest oscillations before entering the gapped phase. By simulating their non-unitary evolution, we show that the entanglement entropy of the steady state would transition from a volume-law to an area-law scaling with the increase of the dissipation rate. Meanwhile, some unexpected results about the entanglement entropy appear in the volume-law phase. These unusual features of the complex gap and the steady-state entanglement can be attributed to level crossings between the maximal imagine level and other levels. Our work reveals a novel entanglement transition in chaotic non-Hermitian systems.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement Structure of Nonlocal Field Theories</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Reza Pirmoradian, M. Hossein Bek-Khoshnevis, Sadaf Ebadi, M. Reza Tanhayi</p>
            <p>Nonlocal interactions are known to generate volume-law entanglement entropy. However, their deeper impact on the fine structure of quantum correlations remains a key open question. In this work, we explore a bosonic nonlocal field theory, examining correlation measures beyond entanglement entropy, namely, mutual information and tripartite information. Using numerical lattice simulations, we show that the nonlocality scale, \(A\), not only determines the onset of volume-law behavior but also leads to striking features: notably, extremely long-range mutual information and an unusual monogamy structure. In this regime, increasing the separation between large regions can paradoxically enhance their multipartite entanglement. Through holographic duality, we verify that the Ryu-Takayanagi formula correctly captures the volume-law scaling of entropy. Yet, a significant tension emerges: while the field theory reveals rich spatial correlations, the holographic model predicts a complete suppression of both mutual and tripartite information in the volume-law phase. This non-monogamous behavior in the holographic description stands in sharp contrast to the monogamous and highly structured entanglement observed in the field theory. Our results demonstrate that nonlocality gives rise to quantum states of such complexity that conventional geometric models of spacetime fall short. This points to the need for a new framework that goes beyond geometry to fully capture the nature of these correlations.</p>

Further, for any $N$, all 2-2 scattering channels are shown to emerge from the span of a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ algebra, suggesting that scattering in this context is fundamentally governed by the action of ``bit flips'' on the internal quantum numbers.

            <p>Finite-size general security proofs for quantum key distribution based on Rényi entropies have recently been introduced. These approaches are more flexible and provide tighter bounds on the secret key rate than traditional formulations based on the von Neumann entropy.

In this work, we introduce a method based on non-symmetric conic optimization for solving this problem. Our technique is fast, reliable, and completely general. We illustrate its performance on several protocols, whose results represent an improvement over the state of the art.</p>

            <p>The speed of a fault-tolerant quantum computer is dictated by the reaction time of its classical electronics, that is, the total time required by decoders and controllers to determine the outcome of a logical measurement and execute subsequent conditional logical operations. Despite its importance, the reaction time and its impact on the design of the logical microarchitecture of a quantum computer are not well understood. In this work, we build, for a surface code based architecture, a model for the reaction time in which the decoder latency is based on parallel space- and time-window decoding methods, and communication latencies are drawn from our envisioned quantum execution environment comprising a high-speed network of quantum processing units, controllers, decoders, and high-performance computing nodes. We use this model to estimate the increase in the logical error rate of magic state injections as a function of the reaction time. Next, we show how the logical microarchitecture can be optimized with respect to the reaction time, and then present detailed full-system quantum and classical resource estimates for executing utility-scale quantum circuits based on realistic hardware noise parameters and state-of-the-art decoding times. For circuits with $10^{6}$--$10^{11}$ $T$ gates involving 200--2000 logical qubits, under a $\Lambda=9.3$ hardware model representative of a realistic target for superconducting quantum processors operating at a 2.86 MHz stabilization frequency, we show that even decoding at a sub-microsecond per stabilization round speed introduces substantial resource overheads: approximately 100k--250k additional physical qubits for correction qubit storage in the magic state factory; 300k--1.75M extra physical qubits in the core processor due to the code distance increase of $d$ to $d+4$ for extra memory protection; and a longer runtime by roughly a factor of 100.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Silvia Cardenas-Lopez, Edgar Guardiola-Navarrete, Ana Asenjo-Garcia</p>
            <p>Spontaneous collective decay in driven atomic ensembles can generate coherence far from equilibrium, as illustrated by superradiant lasers where decay into a single-mode cavity synchronizes atomic phases into a macroscopic dipole and yields superradiant emission of light with an ultranarrow spectrum. Whether similar ordering persists in multimode reservoirs with propagation and competing collective decay channels remains an open question. We address this problem by analyzing atoms coupled to one-dimensional electromagnetic baths through two models. The first is a ring cavity supporting two bright collective decay channels, and the second is a bidirectional waveguide where, in addition to competition between channels, propagation induces coherent dipole-dipole interactions. For suitable incoherent pumping strengths, the dynamics enters a synchronization window in which collective decay overcomes disordering processes, leading to spontaneous steady-state phase ordering and superradiant emission. We extract the thresholds marking the onset of synchronization and show that the maximum intensity scales quadratically in both models. The resulting order is not described by a single macroscopic dipole: in the ring cavity spontaneous chirality emerges at the level of individual trajectories, while the waveguide develops a local chirality with different orders dominating opposite ends of the atomic array. The analysis of the emitted light spectrum reveals a linewidth that seems to narrow with increased system size in the ring cavity, while narrowing in the waveguide remains inconclusive within accessible numerics. These results clarify how competition and propagation shape emergent order in one-dimensional reservoirs and identify regimes where steady-state superradiance may arise beyond the Dicke limit.</p>

            <p>The electronic wavefunction is at the heart of physical phenomena, defining the frontiers of quantum materials research. While the amplitude of the electron wavefunction in crystals can be measured with state-of-the-art probes in unprecedented resolution, its phase has remained largely inaccessible, obscuring rich electronic information. Here we develop a quantum-path electron interferometer based on time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, that enables the reconstruction of the phase of electronic states in quantum materials - with energy and momentum resolution. We demonstrate the scheme by resolving the phase along the Dirac electronic band of a prototypical topological insulator and observe a resonance-associated phase jump as well as a momentum and phase synchronized inversion revealing the helicity of the Dirac cone. We show the interferometer can be optically controlled by the polarization of the absorbed light, allowing a differential measurement of the phase - a crucial component for extracting phase information from an interferogram. This photo-electron-interferometer is a purely experimental scheme and does not rely on any specific theoretical model. It can be extended to a variety of materials, opening up the phase dimension in quantum materials research.</p>

            <h2>Mutual information as a measure of renormalizability</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Brenden Bowen, Albert Farah, Spasen Chaykov, Nishant Agarwal</p>
            <p>Renormalization is an essential technique in field-theoretic descriptions of natural phenomena, where the absence of a UV-complete description yields an abundance of divergent quantities. While the renormalization prescription has been thoroughly refined for equilibrium systems, consistently extending it to out-of-equilibrium systems is an active area of research. In this paper, we identify a mutual information-based measure of renormalizability that applies to quantum field theories both in and out of equilibrium. Specifically, we use mutual information to characterize correlations between infinitesimal shells in momentum space and show that the logarithmic derivative of mutual information with mode separation, at large mode separation, is a measure of renormalizability. We first consider Minkowski spacetime, where we introduce dynamics by performing an interaction quench, initializing the field in the free theory vacuum and then turning on the interaction. We show that the late-time mutual information relaxes to that for the interacting vacuum and the logarithmic derivative at large mode separation is negative for super-renormalizable theories, zero for renormalizable (marginal) theories, and positive for non-renormalizable theories. We then consider a conformally-coupled scalar field on the Poincaré patch of de Sitter spacetime, initializing the field in the Bunch-Davies vacuum in the asymptotic past. For different self-interactions and at any finite time, we find that the resulting mutual information has the same qualitative behavior as a function of mode separation, demonstrating that it can be used as a reliable indicator of renormalizability.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shaofeng Huang, Yu-Peng Wang, Jie Ren, Chen Fang</p>
            <p>Superdiffusion is an anomalous transport behavior. Recently, a new mechanism, termed the ``nodal mechanism," has been proposed to induce superdiffusion in quantum models. However, existing realizations of the nodal mechanism have so far been proposed on fine-tuned, artificial Hamiltonians, posing a significant challenge for experimental observation. In this work, we propose a broad class of models for generating superdiffusion potentially realizable in condensed matter systems across different spatial dimensions. A robust nodal structure emerges from the hybridization between the itinerant electrons and the local impurity orbitals, protected by the intrinsic symmetry and topology of the electronic band. We derive a universal scaling law for the conductance, $G \sim L^{-\gamma}$, revealing how the exponent is dictated by the dimensionality of the nodal structure ($D_{\text{node}}$) and its order $n$, and the dimensionality of the system $(D)$ at high temperatures or that of the Fermi surface ($D^F$) at low temperatures. Through numerical simulations, we validate these scaling relations at zero temperature for various models, including those based on graphene and multi-Weyl semimetals, finding excellent agreement between our theory and the computed exponents. Beyond the scaling of conductance, our framework predicts a suite of experimentally verifiable signatures, notably a new mechanism for linear-in-temperature resistivity ($\rho \sim T$) and a divergent low-frequency optical conductivity ($\sigma(\omega) \sim \omega^{\gamma -1}$), establishing a practical route to discovering and engineering anomalous transport in quantum materials.</p>

            <p>Much of our understanding of gapless many-body quantum systems stems from their low-energy descriptions as conformal field theories. This is especially true in 1+1 dimensions, where such theories have an infinite-dimensional parameter space induced by their conformal symmetry. We reveal the associated quantum geometry by considering finite systems driven by time-dependent conformal transformations. For small deformations, perturbation theory predicts absorption rates and linear responses that are intrinsically related to components of the quantum geometric tensor. For arbitrarily large but adiabatic deformations, we show that periodic drives give rise to nontrivial return amplitudes involving the quantum metric, beyond the familiar leading order that only features a Berry phase. Our field-theoretic findings are universal, comprising general relations between measurable quantities and quantum geometry that only depend on the central charge of the conformal symmetry. This is supported by both analytical results for quantum dynamics under certain Floquet drives, and numerical simulations of gapless lattice models.</p>

Notably, we find that, even within the same Altland-Zirnbauer class, distinct topological transitions generate qualitatively different spatial signatures, enabling a refined, class-internal probe of topological stability. As such, nonlocal quantum geometric indicators provide a more efficient and versatile tool to understand and predict the stability of topological phase transitions.</p>

The spacetime curvature generates a spin connection term, acting as an effective magnetic field and a position-dependent chiral chemical potential. This leads to strongly asymmetric wave propagation, confined within an inhomogeneous Lieb-Robinson cone. The front velocities decrease with increasing fermion mass and horizon radius. Entanglement growth occurs inside the causal cone, and saturates through a string-breaking mechanism driven by screening excitations. In dipole-dipole scattering, the central bipartite entropy rises when the inward Lieb-Robinson fronts intersect, forming a bright ridge in the local entanglement profile. Charge and current correlators peak at the front arrival, providing a real-time diagnostic of chiral transport. These results establish a causality-respecting framework, linking curvature and horizons to transport and entanglement in (1+1)-dimensional fermionic matter.</p>

Test calculations on five small molecules are compared with CASCI, CASSCF, and conventional CCSD results. qLR with UCC/ooUCC yields spin-spin coupling constants comparable to classical methods. We further examine the role of orbital optimization and find that ooUCC markedly affects the computed couplings; orbital-optimized results show better agreement with CCSD.

We demonstrate accurate parameter recovery in several benchmark systems-including Wegner's Ising gauge theory, $\phi^4$ theory, Schwinger and Sine-Gordon models, and mixed spin-gauge systems, and show how iterating the procedure under coarse-graining reconstructs full non-perturbative renormalization-group flows. This gives direct access to phase boundaries, fixed points, and emergent interactions without relying on perturbation theory. We also address a realistic setting where full gauge configurations may be unavailable, and reformulate learning algorithms for multiple field theories so that they are recovered directly using observables such as correlations from scattering data or quantum simulators. We anticipate that our methodology will find widespread use in practical learning of field theories in strongly coupled regimes where analytical tools might fail.</p>

            <p>Quantum phase imaging enables the analysis of transparent samples with thickness and refractive index variations in scenarios requiring precise measurements under low-light conditions. Recent advances in nonlinear metasurfaces offer compact solutions for quantum light generation and manipulation. Here, we present a compact quantum phase imaging system integrating a lithium niobate (LiNbO3) metasurface for generating spatially entangled photon pairs and a silicon (Si) metasurface for phase gradient extraction. The LiNbO3 metasurface enables efficient spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) with angularly dispersed, tunable emission, while the Si metasurface employs a nearly linear optical transfer function (OTF) to differentiate phase and extract phase gradients via spatial quantum correlations. This dual-metasurface enabled combined ghost imaging and all-optical scanning protocols with quantum light achieves phase gradient reconstruction without mechanical tuning. Experimental results demonstrate the system's ability to resolve phase gradients up to 25 rad/mm with 88% fidelity using a 6x3-pixel proof-of-concept setup. In addition, theoretically, it is confirmed that the resolution of the system is primarily limited by the quality factor of the compact design, leveraging nonlocal resonances and quantum correlations, establishes a new paradigm for portable quantum phase-gradient imaging, with potential applications in sensing, microscopy, and LiDAR.

            <p>SeQuant is an open-source library for symbolic algebra of tensors over commutative (scalar) and non-commutative (operator) rings. The key innovation supporting most of its functionality is a graph-theoretic tensor network (TN) canonicalizer that can handle tensor networks with symmetries faster than their standard group-theoretic counterparts. The TN canonicalizer is used for routine simplification of conventional tensor expressions, for optimizing application of Wick's theorem (used to canonicalize products of tensors over operator fields), and for manipulation of the intermediate representation leading to the numerical evaluation. Notable features of SeQuant include support for noncovariant tensor networks (which often arise from tensor decompositions) and for tensors with modes that depend parametrically on indices of other tensor modes (such dependencies between degrees of freedom are naturally viewed as nesting of tensors, "tensors of tensors" arising in block-wise data compressions in data science and modern quantum simulation). SeQuant blurs the line between pure symbolic manipulation/code generation and numerical evaluation by including compiler-like components to optimize and directly interpret tensor expressions using external numerical tensor algebra frameworks.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pilsung Kang</p>
            <p>Classical approaches often treat interaction as engineered product terms or as emergent patterns in flexible models, offering little control over how synergy or antagonism arises. We take a quantum-inspired view: following the Born rule (probability as squared amplitude), \emph{coherent} aggregation sums complex amplitudes before squaring, creating an interference cross-term, whereas an \emph{incoherent} proxy sums squared magnitudes and removes it. In a minimal linear-amplitude model, this cross-term equals the standard potential-outcome interaction contrast \(\Delta_{\mathrm{INT}}\) in a \(2\times 2\) factorial design, giving relative phase a direct, mechanism-level control over synergy versus antagonism. We instantiate this idea in a lightweight \emph{Interference Kernel Classifier} (IKC) and introduce two diagnostics: \emph{Coherent Gain} (log-likelihood gain of coherent over the incoherent proxy) and \emph{Interference Information} (the induced Kullback-Leibler gap). A controlled phase sweep recovers the identity. On a high-interaction synthetic task (XOR), IKC outperforms strong baselines under paired, budget-matched comparisons; on real tabular data (\emph{Adult} and \emph{Bank Marketing}) it is competitive overall but typically trails the most capacity-rich baseline in paired differences. Holding learned parameters fixed, toggling aggregation from incoherent to coherent consistently improves negative log-likelihood, Brier score, and expected calibration error, with positive Coherent Gain on both datasets.</p>

            <p>In this work, we present a comprehensive geometrical formulation of quantum thermodynamics based on contact geometry and principal fiber bundles. The quantum thermodynamic state space is modeled as a contact manifold, with equilibrium Gibbs states forming a Legendrian submanifold that encodes the fundamental thermodynamic relations. A principal fiber bundle over the manifold of density operators distinguishes the quantum state structure from thermodynamic labels: its fibers represent non-equilibrium configurations, and their unique intersections with the equilibrium submanifold enforce thermodynamic consistency. Quasistatic processes correspond to minimizing geodesics under the Bures-Wasserstein metric, leading to minimal dissipation, while the divergence of geodesic length toward rank-deficient states geometrically derives the third law. Non-equilibrium extensions, formulated through pseudo-Riemannian metrics and connections on the principal bundle, introduce curvature-induced holonomy that quantifies irreversibility in cyclic processes. In this framework, the thermodynamic laws in the quantum regime emerge naturally as geometric consequences.</p>

Our model incorporates three key parameters, asymmetric hopping $\Delta$, on site disorder $W$, and a random long-range coupling $p$ that render the underlying nature of random graph. By varying $p,$ $\Delta$ and the disorder, we explore the interplay between topology, randomness, and non-Hermiticity in determining localization properties. Our results show the competition between skin effect driven and Anderson driven localizations in the parameter regimes. Despite the presence of large disorder, the skin effect driven localization coexists with Anderson driven localization.</p>

            <h2>Improved Offline Reinforcement Learning via Quantum Metric Encoding</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Outongyi Lv, Yewei Yuan, Nana Liu</p>
            <p>Reinforcement learning (RL) with limited samples is common in real-world applications. However, offline RL performance under this constraint is often suboptimal. We consider an alternative approach to dealing with limited samples by introducing the Quantum Metric Encoder (QME). In this methodology, instead of applying the RL framework directly on the original states and rewards, we embed the states into a more compact and meaningful representation, where the structure of the encoding is inspired by quantum circuits. For classical data, QME is a classically simulable, trainable unitary embedding and thus serves as a quantum-inspired module, on a classical device. For quantum data in the form of quantum states, QME can be implemented directly on quantum hardware, allowing for training without measurement or re-encoding. We evaluated QME on three datasets, each limited to 100 samples. We use Soft-Actor-Critic (SAC) and Implicit-Q-Learning (IQL), two well-known RL algorithms, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. From the experimental results, we find that training offline RL agents on QME-embedded states with decoded rewards yields significantly better performance than training on the original states and rewards. On average across the three datasets, for maximum reward performance, we achieve a 116.2% improvement for SAC and 117.6% for IQL. We further investigate the $\Delta$-hyperbolicity of our framework, a geometric property of the state space known to be important for the RL training efficacy. The QME-embedded states exhibit low $\Delta$-hyperbolicity, suggesting that the improvement after embedding arises from the modified geometry of the state space induced by QME. Thus, the low $\Delta$-hyperbolicity and the corresponding effectiveness of QME could provide valuable information for developing efficient offline RL methods under limited-sample conditions.</p>

            <h2>Continuum limit of gauged tensor network states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gertian Roose, Erez Zohar</p>
            <p>It is well known that all physically relevant states of gauge theories lie in the sectors of the Hilbert space which satisfy the Gauss law. On the lattice, the manifeslty gauge invariant subspace is known to be exactly spanned by gauged tensor networks. In this work, we demonstrate that the continuum limit of certain types of gauged tensor networks is well defined and leads to a new class of states that may be helpful for the non-perturbative study of gauge theories directly in the continuum.</p>

            <h2>High-Energy Decays and Weak Quantum Measurements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alan J. Barr</p>
            <p>High-energy particle decays naturally realise informationally weak measurements of quantum spin. Decay kinematics act as continuous pointer variables whose overlapping angular distributions encode partial, non-projective information about the parent spin state. Ensemble averages of these pointers yield weak values, linking collider spin-density reconstruction to Aharonov-Vaidman measurement theory. This framework unifies spin tomography, entangled-decay correlations, and spin-correlation algorithms, showing that relativistic decays realise informationally weak measurements of spin and suggesting new ways to probe coherence and interference in high-energy processes.</p>

            <h2>Direct Raman observation of the quantum metric in a quantum magnet</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chao-Fan Wang, Han Ge, Jun-Yang Chen, Liusuo Wu, Xiaobin Chen, Jia-Wei Mei, Mingyuan Huang</p>
            <p>The quantum geometric tensor (QGT) unifies the Berry curvature (its imaginary part) and the quantum metric (its real part), yet Raman studies of chiral phonons have so far accessed only the former. We perform circularly polarized Raman spectroscopy on the quantum magnet K2Co(SeO3)2, where the field-odd chiral splitting and the field-even center-frequency shift collapse onto a single curve across temperature and magnetic field, revealing a common microscopic origin for both observables. Since the chiral splitting reflects the Berry curvature, the concomitant even component, arising from the same microscopic origin, captures the field-induced change of the quantum metric, corresponding to the diagonal Born-Oppenheimer correction. Across two resolvable Eg modes, the unified data are well captured by a simple empirical quadratic relation. These results establish Raman spectroscopy as a direct probe of the quantum metric and an operational decomposition of quantum geometry within a single measurement.</p>
