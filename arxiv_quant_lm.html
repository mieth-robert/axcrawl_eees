            <h2>Using Frame Randomization to Mitigate Errors in Quantum Optimization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rachel E. Johnson, Joshua A. Job, Steve Adachi</p>
            <p>Error mitigation is essential for near-term quantum devices, and one promising technique is frame randomization. This method inserts random twirling gates into a circuit to reduce errors while preserving unitarity and depth. We apply frame randomization to the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) with $p=1$ on a superconducting quantum circuit system, demonstrating its potential to improve energy calculations. Specifically, we investigate the use of QAOA to calculate the lowest energy state of a frustrated Ising ring system and compare the results of randomized circuits generated using two different randomized techniques. Our results show that both methods can mitigate errors, with expected extremal energy values of $5.25\pm0.145$ and $4.08\pm0.36$, for Randomized Compilation and Pauli frame randomization respectively, compared to $2.63\pm0.068$ without randomization and $5.676\pm0.006$ with a noiseless simulator.</p>

            <h2>Importance of Correlations for Neural Quantum States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fabian DÃ¶schl, Annabelle Bohrdt</p>
            <p>Neural quantum states (NQS) have emerged as a powerful variational ansatz for representing quantum many-body wave functions. Their internal mechanisms, however, remain poorly understood. We investigate the role of correlations for NQS-like quantum state representation by employing a correlation-based interpretable neural network architecture and thereafter proving our observations based on Boolean function theory. The correlator neural network demonstrates that, even for simple product states, up to all system-size correlation orders in the chosen computational basis are required to represent a quantum state faithfully. We explain these observations using the Fourier expansion, which reveals the correlator basis as the effective basis of the internal NQS structure, the resulting necessity for high-order correlations, potential linear dependencies in constrained Hilbert spaces, and connections between spin basis-rotations and the correlator basis. Furthermore, we analyze how activation functions, network architectures, and choice of reference basis influence correlation requirements. Our results provide new insights and a better understanding of the internal structure and requirements of NQS, enabling a more systematic use of NQS in future research.</p>

            <h2>Relativistic Quantum Thermal Machine: Harnessing Relativistic Effects to Surpass Carnot Efficiency</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tanmoy Pandit, Pritam Chattopadhyay, Kaustav Chatterjee, Varinder Singh</p>
            <p>We investigate a three-level maser quantum thermal machine in which the system-reservoir interaction is modeled via Unruh-DeWitt type coupling, with one or both reservoirs undergoing relativistic motion relative to the working medium. Motion induces Doppler reshaping of the reservoir spectra, modifying energy-exchange rates and enabling operation beyond the Carnot efficiency at finite power. We numerically analyze families of efficiency-power curves and extract the analytic form of a generalized Carnot bound, which recovers the Carnot limit. In addition, Doppler reshaping alters the boundaries between heat-engine and refrigerator operation, making it possible to extract positive work even in the absence of a temperature gradient. These findings establish relativistic motion as a genuine thermodynamic resource.</p>

            <h2>Excitonic Coupling and Photon Antibunching in Venus Yellow Fluorescent Protein Dimers: A Lindblad Master Equation Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ian T. Abrahams</p>
            <p>Strong excitonic coupling and photon antibunching have been observed together in Venus yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) dimers -- a cryptic combination under prevailing theoretical models. In 2019, Kim et al. demonstrated Davydov splitting in Venus dimer circular dichroism (CD) spectra, revealing large negative dimer coupling energy, while antibunching was confirmed by antibunching-fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (AB/FCS fingerprinting). To explain this coexistence, Venus dimer population dynamics are modeled here within a Lindblad master equation framework, justified by the separation of characteristic coupling, dephasing, and thermal relaxation rates. Simulations predict rapid decoherence, consistent with antibunching, indicating that coherence in both the excitonic and site bases is too short-lived to affect photon emission statistics. Despite the absence of long-lived coherence, Venus dimers provide a tractable platform for probing evolutionary pressures on fluorescent protein photophysics and quantum dynamics. Cryogenic cooling could extend coherence lifetimes into the regime required for quantum gate operations, suggesting a route toward fluorescent protein-based qubits. More broadly, the results highlight a structural design principle -- a "bioexciton motif" -- that links excitonic coupling, decoherence, and protein architecture, pointing to general rules by which biology both constrains and inspires quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Free-Particle State Realized via Optimal Filtering in Optomechanics: Implications for Gravity-Induced Entanglement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryotaro Fukuzumi, Kosei Hatakeyama, Daisuke Miki, Kazuhiro Yamamoto</p>
            <p>We analyze the conditional quantum state of a mechanical mirror in an optomechanical system under continuous measurement, feedback control, and quantum filtering. Our study identifies a regime in which the mirror's momentum is squeezed beyond the standard quantum limit achievable through appropriate tuning of the homodyne detection angle. We show that in this regime, optimal filtering effectively realizes a free-particle-like state. Notably, when applied to a setup involving two optomechanical systems, this phenomenon significantly boosts the signal of gravity-induced entanglement (GIE) because the momentum squeezing not only accentuates the difference between the common mode and the differential mode but, when the purity is high, also increases the position uncertainty due to the uncertainty principle, thereby enlarging the spatial extent of the superposition. Our results provide new insights into strategies for verifying the quantum nature of gravity using optomechanical platforms.</p>

            <h2>Non-Equilibrium Criticality-Enhanced Quantum Sensing with Superconducting Qubits</h2>

            <p>Exploiting quantum features allows for estimating external parameters with precisions well beyond the capacity of classical sensors, a phenomenon known as quantum-enhanced precision. Quantum criticality has been identified as a resource for achieving such enhancements with respect to the probe size. However, they demand complex probe preparation and measurement and the achievable enhancement is ultimately restricted to narrow parameter regimes. On the other hand, non-equilibrium probes harness dynamics, enabling quantum-enhanced precision with respect to time over a wide range of parameters through simple probe initialization. Here, we unify these approaches through a Stark-Wannier localization platform, where competition between a linear gradient field and particle tunneling enables quantum-enhanced sensitivity across an extended parameter regime. The probe is implemented on a 9-qubit superconducting quantum device, in both single- and double-excitation subspaces, where we explore its performance in the extended phase, the critical point and the localized phase. Despite employing only computational-basis measurements we have been able to achieve near-Heisenberg-limited precision by combining outcomes at distinct evolution times. In addition, we demonstrate that the performance of the probe in the entire extended phase is significantly outperforming the performance in the localized regime. Our results highlight Stark-Wannier systems as versatile platforms for quantum sensing, where the combination of criticality and non-equilibrium dynamics enhances precision over a wide range of parameters without stringent measurement requirements.</p>

            <h2>Electrically pumped ultrabright entangled photons on chip</h2>

            <p>Entangled photon sources (EPS) are essential for quantum science and technology. Despite advancements in integrated optical platforms like thin-film lithium niobate, a scalable, high-performance, chip-scale EPS has remained elusive. We address this by demonstrating an electrically pumped, post-selection-free polarization-EPS, achieved through hybrid integration of a distributed feedback laser with thin-film lithium niobate chip which integrates periodically poled lithium niobate waveguides, beam splitter, and polarization rotator combiner. By injecting current into the chip, we realize a high-performance EPS with a bandwidth of 73 nm and an entanglement pair generation rate of 4.5*10^10 pairs/s/mW. The polarization entanglement shows Bell-state fidelities above 96% across frequency-correlated modes. This compact, integrated EPS enables key applications, including high-speed quantum key distribution via wavelength division multiplexing, satellite-based quantum communication, and entanglement-based quantum metrology.</p>

            <p>We investigate High-Harmonic Generation (HHG) in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain with electron-phonon coupling modeled via the Holstein interaction. The system dynamics are simulated using the tight-binding approximation, with local phonons approximated as quantum harmonic oscillators.

            <h2>High-fidelity realisation of CNOT gate in Majorana-based optical platform</h2>

            <p>We present the experimental realisation of a robust CNOT quantum gate using Majorana zero modes simulated on a photonic platform. Three Kitaev chains supporting Majorana zero modes at their endpoints are used to encode two logical qubits, and both intra-chain and inter-chain braiding operations are performed to implement the CNOT gate. While the topological encoding of quantum information in Majorana fermions does not offer full topological protection in our non-interacting photonic setting, it nevertheless exhibits a natural resilience to the dominant noise and decoherence effects present in the experiment. Consequently, the fidelity of the CNOT gate is significantly enhanced, surpassing 0.992 and addressing a key limitation in the path toward scalable quantum computation. These results represent a major advancement in topological quantum computing with Majorana fermions and underscore the potential of photonic platforms for realising high-fidelity quantum gates.</p>

            <h2>Trapping and cooling of nanodiamonds in a Paul trap under ultra-high vacuum: Towards matter-wave interferometry with massive objects</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Omer Feldman, Ben Baruch Shultz, Maria Muretova, Or Dobkowski, Yonathan Japha, David Grosswasser, Ron Folman</p>
            <p>Quantum mechanics (QM) and General relativity (GR), also known as the theory of gravity, are the two pillars of modern physics. A matter-wave interferometer with a massive particle can test numerous fundamental ideas, including the spatial superposition principle - a foundational concept in QM - in previously unexplored regimes. It also opens the possibility of probing the interface between QM and GR, such as testing the quantization of gravity. Consequently, there exists an intensive effort to realize such an interferometer. While several approaches are being explored, we focus on utilizing nanodiamonds with embedded spins as test particles which, in combination with Stern-Gerlach forces, enable the realization of a closed-loop matter-wave interferometer in space-time. There is a growing community of groups pursuing this path [1]. We are posting this technical note (as part of a series of seven such notes), to highlight our plans and solutions concerning various challenges in this ambitious endeavor, hoping this will support this growing community. In this work we detail the trapping of a nanodiamond at 10^-8 mbar, which is good enough for the realization of a short-duration Stern-Gerlach interferometer. We describe in detail the cooling we have performed to sub-Kelvin temperatures, and demonstrate that the nanodiamond remains confined within the trap even under high-intensity 1560 nm laser illumination. We would be happy to make available more details upon request.</p>

            <h2>Quantum teleportation over thermal microwave network</h2>

            <p>Quantum communication in the microwave regime is set to play an important role in distributed quantum computing and hybrid quantum networks. However, typical superconducting quantum circuits require millikelvin temperatures for operation, which poses a significant challenge for largescale microwave quantum networks. Here, we present a solution to this challenge by demonstrating the successful quantum teleportation of microwave coherent states between two spatially-separated dilution refrigerators over a thermal microwave channel with a temperature of $4$ K. We distribute two-mode squeezed states over the noisy channel and employ the resulting quantum entanglement for quantum teleportation of coherent states with fidelities of $72.3 \pm 0.5 ~\%$ at $1$ K and $59.9 \pm 2.5 ~\%$ at $4$ K, exceeding the no-cloning and classical communication thresholds, respectively. We successfully model the teleportation protocol using a Gaussian operator formalism that includes losses and noise. This analysis shows that the teleportation infidelity mainly stems from a parasitic heating of the cold quantum nodes due to the hot network connection. Our results prove the experimental feasibility of distributed superconducting architectures and motivate practical applications of noisy quantum networks in various frequency regimes.</p>

            <h2>Exploring the Interplay Between Quantum Entanglement and Decoherence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samuel Marquez Gonzalez</p>
            <p>Quantum entanglement manifests as a distinctive correlation between particles that transcends classical boundaries when their quantum states cannot be described independently. On the other hand, as quantum systems interact with their surroundings, decoherence emerges, leading to the gradual decay of quantum coherence and entanglement. In the case of entanglement, this is known as entanglement sudden death (ESD). Decoherence mechanisms are examined, focusing on how various environmental factors, such as thermal, electromagnetic, and collisional decoherence, influence the integrity of entangled states. The role of quantum noise, such as amplitude damping, phase damping, and depolarizing, is also analyzed. By integrating theoretical insights with experimental findings, this study highlights the delicate balance between maintaining entanglement and mitigating decoherence. The findings have significant implications for the development of quantum technologies, including quantum computing and quantum communication, where preserving entanglement is crucial for achieving robust and reliable performance.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement Preservation and Clauser-Horne Nonlocality in Electromagnetically Induced Transparency Quantum Memories</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Po-Han Tseng, Yong-Fan Chen</p>
            <p>Quantum memories are indispensable for quantum repeater networks, deterministic generation of single- or multi-photon states, and linear optical quantum computing. Although experiments have demonstrated that electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) quantum memories can store entangled photons, a definitive theoretical framework verifying the preservation of entanglement and nonlocality has not been rigorously established. Here, we develop a comprehensive model by integrating the dark-state polariton framework with reduced-density-operator theory to derive the retrieved density operator under realistic ground-state decoherence conditions. Our analysis reveals that decoherence inevitably causes probe photon loss, converting a Bell state into a mixed state. Crucially, we predict a critical storage efficiency threshold of 89.7%. Only when this threshold is exceeded does the retrieved probe photon state violate the Clauser-Horne inequality, thereby preserving nonlocality; below this point, nonlocal correlations vanish. Moreover, our theory shows that multiple spatially separated EIT memories can cooperatively store and retrieve N-qubit entangled states encoded in photon number, path, and polarization with near-unity fidelity in the ideal limit. This work bridges a long-standing theoretical gap and lays a solid foundation for the application of EIT memories in scalable quantum networks and quantum information processing.</p>

            <h2>Versatile photonic frequency synthetic dimensions using a single Mach-Zehnder-interferometer-assisted device on thin-film lithium niobate</h2>

            <p>Investigating physical models with photonic synthetic dimensions has been generating great interest in vast fields of science. The rapid developing thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) platform, for its numerous advantages including high electro-optic coefficient and scalability, is well compatible with the realization of synthetic dimensions in the frequency together with spatial domain. While coupling resonators with fixed beam splitters is a common experimental approach, it often lacks tunability and limits coupling between adjacent lattices to sites occupying the same frequency domain positions. Here, on the contrary, we conceive the resonator arrays connected by electro-optic tunable Mach-Zehnder interferometers in our configuration instead of fixed beam splitters. By applying bias voltage and RF modulation on the interferometers, our design extends such coupling to long-range scenario and allows for continuous tuning on each coupling strength and synthetic effective magnetic flux. Therefore, our design enriches controllable coupling types that are essential for building programmable lattice networks and significantly increases versatility. As the example, we experimentally fabricate a two-resonator prototype on the TFLN platform, and on this single chip we realize well-known models including tight-binding lattices, topological Hall ladder and Creutz ladder. We directly observe the band structures in the quasi-momentum space and important phenomena such as spin-momentum locking and the Aharonov-Bohm cage effect. These results demonstrate the potential for convenient simulations of more complex models in our configuration.</p>

            <h2>Non-Equilibrium Probing of Topological Supersolids in Spin-Orbit-Coupled Dipolar Condensates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Biao Dong, Xiao-Fei Zhang, Wei Han, Renyuan Liao, Xue-Ying Yang, Wu-Ming Liu, Yong-Chang Zhang</p>
            <p>A chiral supersolid is a quantum phase that simultaneously exhibits crystalline order, superfluidity, and topological spin texture, with spontaneously broken translational, U(1) gauge, and chiral symmetries. Here, we demonstrate a chiral supersolid with tunable non-equilibrium dynamics in a spin-orbit coupled dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate. By adjusting dipolar interaction and spin-orbit coupling, we uncover two distinct quantum phase transitions: (i) a first-order transition from a single skyrmion superfluid to a triangular meron supersolid, and (ii) a second-order transition from this superfluid to a square skyrmion supersolid. These phases are characterized by their lattice symmetries, nonclassical rotational inertia, and spin textures. Under parity-time symmetric dissipation, we predict phase-dependent damping of the current oscillations, directly linked to the superfluid fraction. The predicted chiral supersolid phase can be experimentally observed in ultracold magnetic atoms with spin-orbit coupling. Our results establish dipolar quantum gases as a platform for designing topological matter with spintronic functionality.</p>

            <p>We prove a new lower bound for the unitary synthesis problem in the so-called 1.5-query setting. Our analysis establishes that any attempt to implement arbitrary n-qubit unitaries via limited oracle access requires resources that exceed the fractional query threshold. This result extends the one-query lower bound of Lombardi, Ma, and Wright (2023) to the fractional query regime, and introduces a conservative and chaining-based approach to handle intermediate query complexities. As a consequence, we derive cryptographic implications, showing that pseudorandom quantum states remain secure against adversaries restricted to 1.5 queries. Our work provides both conceptual clarification of fractional-query complexity and practical insights into the design of quantum cryptographic protocols.</p>

            <p>Spin defects in two-dimensional materials are a promising platform for quantum sensing. Simulating the defect's optical response and optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) contrast is key to identifying suitable candidates. However, existing simulation methods are typically unable to supply the required accuracy. Here, we propose two quantum algorithms to detect an imbalance in the triplet-to-singlet intersystem crossing (ISC) rates between excited states with the same and different spin projections -- a necessary condition for nonzero ODMR response. The lowest-cost approach evaluates whether the evolution of an $S=0$ state under the spin-orbit coupling induces ISC to $S=1$, and also whether there is an imbalance in its intensity depending on the final state spin projection. The second approach works by comparing the emission spectrum of a spin defect with and without the spin-orbit coupling operator, inferring ISC intensity for different spin transition channels from spectrum intensity changes. Additionally, we present an improved scheme to evaluate the defect's optical response, building upon previous work. We study these quantum algorithms in the context of the negatively charged boron vacancy in hexagonal boron nitride. We generate an embedded active space of 18 spatial orbitals using quantum defect embedding theory (QDET) and show that the ISC rate imbalance can be detected with as few as 105 logical qubits and $2.2 \times 10^8$ Toffoli gates. By avoiding direct and costly rate calculations, our methods enable faster screening of candidate defects for ODMR activity, advancing the prospect of using quantum simulations to aid the development of high-performing sensing devices.</p>

            <p>In a phononic quantum network, quantum information is stored and processed within stationary nodes defined by solid-state spins, and the information is routed between nodes by phonons. The phonon holds distinct advantages over its electromagnetic counterpart the photon, including smaller device footprints, reduced crosstalk, long coherence times at low temperatures, and strong interactions with both solid-state spins and electromagnetic waves. Enhanced interactions between a phononic cavity and a stationary qubit have been demonstrated in multiple platforms including superconducting qubits, spins in silicon carbide and spins in diamond. However, an outstanding issue is the compatibility between the spin's coupling to the resonant phononic cavity and the simultaneous use of pulse sequences to extend the coherence time of the spin by suppressing the low-frequency environmental noise. Here we demonstrate all-mechanical coherence protection of a solid-state spin qubit, where optical initialization, quantum operations, and readout are performed in a dressed basis that is highly immune to low-frequency noise and compatible with a phononic cavities. We additionally show record-high Rabi frequencies reaching 800 MHz, which allows for ultrafast quantum control. Our results establish a first step for high-fidelity, phonon-mediated quantum gates and represent a crucial advance toward robust on-chip quantum phononic networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Leo Kruglikov, Filippo Ferrari, Vincenzo Savona</p>
            <p>We investigate the steady-state dynamical regimes of boundary-driven, dissipative bosonic chains subjected to $n$-photon drives. Using the truncated Wigner approximation, we explore how multi-photon drives shape the interplay between quantum fluctuations, nonlinear interactions, and dissipative processes in such quantum systems. We identify two main regimes: a chaotic hydrodynamic regime characterized by the restoration of a local $\mathbb{U}(1)$ symmetry, photon saturation due to Kerr nonlinearity, and spatial prethermalization effects; and a non-chaotic resonant nonlinear wave (RNW) regime exhibiting sub-Poissonian photon statistics, persistent $\mathbb{Z}_n$ symmetry, and quantum-driven phase decoherence. Our findings reveal the universal nature of the hydrodynamic regime and highlight the RNW regime's sensitivity to boundary driving conditions, suggesting novel routes for quantum state engineering in driven-dissipative quantum devices. These results are experimentally relevant for state-of-the-art circuit quantum electrodynamics platforms.</p>

Qubit systems, being highly isolated from their dissipative surroundings, provide a possible experimental testbed for studying this theoretical construct. Here we investigate a $N$-qubit system, weakly coupled to its environment. We present quantitative analytical and numerical results on both the revival probability and time, and demonstrate that the system indeed returns arbitrarily close to its initial state in a time exponential in the number of qubits $N$. The revival times become astronomically large for systems with just a few tens of qubits. Given the lifetimes achievable in present-day superconducting multi-qubit systems, we propose a realistic experimental test of the theory and scaling of PoincarÃ© revivals.</p>

            <h2>Thermalization and Many-Body Zeno Effect in monitored Hamiltonian Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jia-Jin Feng, Quntao Zhuang</p>
            <p>Random quantum states are essential for various applications in quantum information science. Prior approaches of generating genuine random states rely on a large bath to thermalize the system, such that a subsequent measurement on the bath post-selects a random state for the system. To reduce the size of the required bath, we propose an alternative approach based on holographic deep thermalization driven by Hamiltonian evolution, combined with mid-circuit measurements. By trading spatial and time resources, our approach achieves genuine randomness with a bath of constant size that is independent of the system size. We quantify randomness with the frame potential and analyze its dynamics throughout the evolution. Given a total evolution time, as we increase the number of mid-circuit measurements, the frame potential initially decreases exponentially with the number of measurements, due to the mechanism of holographic deep thermalization. Past a critical number of mid-circuit measurements, the frame potential rises again, signaling the onset of the quantum Zeno effect. We provide analytical results for the asymptotic behavior of the frame potential, which are in good agreement with the numerical simulations. Our findings offer practical guidance for generating Haar-random ensembles through Hamiltonian evolution and controlled measurement.</p>

            <h2>Quantum state engineering of maximally entangled photon pairs by path identity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Richard Bernecker, Baghdasar Baghdasaryan, Stephan Fritzsche</p>
            <p>Cutting-edge quantum technologies lean on sources of high-dimensional entangled states (HDES) that reliably prepare high-fidelity target states. The idea to overlap photon paths from distinct but indistinguishable sources was recently introduced for the creation of HDES, known as entanglement by path identity. In this regard, the use of orbital angular momentum (OAM) modes is promising, as they offer a high-dimensional and discrete Hilbert space to encode information. While entanglement by path identity with OAM has been verified experimentally, a detailed investigation of how the OAM distribution of photon pairs can be engineered to maximize the entanglement is lacking. We address this gap and identify an optimal dimensionality for maximally entangled states (MESs) when the spatial engineering of pump beam and the path identity approach are combined. Our theoretical study reveals notable limitations for the fidelity of high-dimensional target states and also establishes their equivalence to entangled biphoton states pumped by a spatially engineered beam. These findings constitute a valuable step toward the optimized preparation of MESs in high dimensions.</p>

            <h2>Accurate and Scalable Simulation of Cavity-Based Networks in Modular Quantum Architectures</h2>

            <p>Cavity-mediated interconnects are a promising platform for scaling modular quantum computers by enabling high-fidelity inter-chip quantum state transmission and entanglement generation. In this work, we first model the dynamics of deterministic inter-chip quantum state transfer using the Stimulated Raman Adiabatic Passage (STIRAP) protocol, analyzing fidelity loss mechanisms under experimentally achievable qubit-cavity coupling and decoherence parameters. We then extend the NetSquid simulator, typically used for simulating long-range quantum communication networks, to support cavity-based communication channels for mediating inter-chip state transfer and entanglement generation. We model cavities as amplitude damping channels parameterized by physical system characteristics; cavity decay rate k and qubit-cavity coupling strength g, and analyze the impact of intrinsic qubit decoherence factors dictated by T1 and T2 times. Our simulations accurately represent the system's dynamics in both strong and weak coupling regimes, and identify critical trade-offs between fidelity, latency, and noise factors. The proposed framework supports faithful modeling and scalable simulation of modular architectures, and provides insights into design optimization for practical quantum network implementations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xin-Xin Hu, Gabriele Maron, Luke Masters, Arno Rauschenbeutel, JÃ¼rgen Volz</p>
            <p>Photon-photon entanglement and photon antibunching are fundamental manifestations of the quantum nature of optical light fields, but are typically regarded as distinct phenomena. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that pairs of narrow-band time-bin entangled photons can be naturally extracted from resonance fluorescence. We split the collected fluorescence of a single trapped atom on a 50 : 50 beamsplitter, resulting in strong temporal correlations between photons at the beamsplitter outputs. A time-bin coincidence between the two output modes then projects their state onto a maximally entangled Bell state. This entanglement is evidenced by violating the CHSH-Bell inequality as well as by reconstructing the density matrix of the photon pair. Importantly, we show that the entanglement persists both for weak and strong excitation of the emitter. Our results establish resonance fluorescence as an efficient source of time-bin entangled photon pairs, i.e., a practical and scalable resource for quantum communication and photonic quantum technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Italo L. Soares Andrade, Kleber Pirota, Amir O. Caldeira, Francisco Rouxinol</p>
            <p>We report the observation of the Purcell effect in a cavity-metallic magnet hybrid system using electric-field-mediated coupling. In this configuration, microwave-induced axial currents in the microwire induce circular magnetic fields that drive the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) of the magnetized microwire. Field-dependent transmission and reflection spectroscopies reveal a clear cavity perturbation consistent with the Purcell regime, in which the magnetic loss rate exceeds the light-matter coupling strength. Despite the small magnetic volume ($\sim 10^{-13}\,\text{m}^3$), measurements performed at both room temperature and $T = 7$ mK show coupling rates as high as $g/2pi = 56$ MHz, one order of magnitude stronger than the one expected from conventional coupling at the magnetic antinode. Time-domain ringdown measurements directly show the magnetic-field-dependent modification of the cavity photon lifetime, in agreement with theoretical predictions. These results establish a versatile approach for coupling microwave fields to metallic magnets via geometric and electric-field-mediated interactions, opening new opportunities for hybrid cavity-magnet systems.</p>

            <h2>Detecting Many-Body Scars from Fisher Zeros</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuchen Meng, Songtai Lv, Yang Liu, Zefan Tan, Erhai Zhao, Haiyuan Zou</p>
            <p>The far-from-equilibrium dynamics of certain interacting quantum systems still defy precise understanding. One example is the so-called quantum many-body scars (QMBSs), where a set of energy eigenstates evade thermalization to give rise to long-lived oscillations. Despite the success of viewing scars from the perspectives of symmetry, commutant algebra, and quasiparticles, it remains a challenge to elucidate the mechanism underlying all QMBS and to distinguish them from other forms of ergodicity breaking. In this work, we introduce an alternative route to detect and diagnose QMBS based on Fisher zeros, i.e., the patterns of zeros of the analytically continued partition function $Z$ on the complex $\beta$ (inverse temperature) plane. For systems with scars, a continuous line of Fisher zeros will appear off the imaginary $\beta$ axis and extend upward, separating the $\beta$ plane into regions with distinctive thermalization behaviors. This conjecture is motivated from interpreting the complex $Z$ as the return amplitude of the thermofield double state, and it is validated by analyzing two models with QMBS, the $\bar{P}X\bar{P}$ model and the Ising chain in external fields. These models also illustrate the key difference between QMBS and strong ergodicity breaking including their distinctive renormalization group flows on the complex $\beta$ plane. This ``statistical mechanics" approach places QMBS within the same framework of thermal and dynamical phase transitions. It has the advantage of spotting scars without exhaustively examining each individual quantum state.</p>

            <h2>Non-Hermitian Hopf insulators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daichi Nakamura, Kohei Kawabata</p>
            <p>Hopf insulators represent a unique class of topological insulators that exist exclusively in two-band systems and are inherently unstable upon the inclusion of additional bands. Meanwhile, recent studies have shown that non-Hermiticity gives rise to distinctive complex-energy gap structures, known as point gaps, and associated topological phases with no analogs in Hermitian systems. However, non-Hermitian counterparts of Hopf insulators have remained largely elusive. Here, we generally classify topological phases of two-band non-Hermitian systems based on the homotopy theory and uncover Hopf-type point-gap topology present only for two bands. Specifically, we reveal such Hopf-type point-gap topology for three-dimensional systems with chiral symmetry (class AIII) and four-dimensional systems with no symmetry (class A). Explicitly constructing prototypical models from the Hermitian Hopf insulator, we further demonstrate that these non-Hermitian topological phases lead to anomalous point-gapless boundary states spectrally detachable from the bulk bands.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nikesh Lilani, Dilpreet Sandhu, Subhash Mahapatra</p>
            <p>In this work, we study quantum chaos in a variety of holographic QCD models at finite temperature and chemical potentials. This includes the 1 R-Charge black hole (1RCBH) model, the 2 R-Charge black hole (2RCBH) model, a potential reconstruction-based analytic bottom-up model, and a numerical bottom-up model. All these models are different avatars of the Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity action, distinguished by their specific choices of dilaton potentials and gauge-kinetic coupling functions. We focus on computing the chaos parameter, the butterfly velocity, using three distinct methods: entanglement wedge reconstruction, out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), and pole-skipping. We show that all three methods yield identical results for the butterfly velocity across all the holographic QCD models considered, further establishing the equivalence between the three approaches. Furthermore, we analyze in detail the behavior of the butterfly velocity as a function of chemical potential and temperature. Interestingly, a universal trend emerges across all models: the butterfly velocity increases/decreases with temperature/chemical potential for thermodynamically stable phases. Additionally, in the high-temperature limit, the butterfly velocity in all models approaches that of the chargeless plasma.</p>

            <h2>One, Two, Three: One empirical evaluation of a two-copy shadow tomography scheme with triple efficiency</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Viet T. Tran, Richard Kueng</p>
            <p>Shadow tomography protocols have recently emerged as powerful tools for efficient quantum state learning, aiming to reconstruct expectation values of observables with fewer resources than traditional quantum state tomography. For the particular case of estimating Pauli observables, entangling two-copy measurement schemes can offer an exponential improvement in sample complexity over any single-copy strategy conceivable [1, Huang, Kueng, Preskill, PRL(2021)]. A recent refinement of these ideas by King et al. [2, King, Gosset, Kothari, Babbush, SODA (2025)] does not only achieve polynomial sample complexity, but also maintains reasonable computational demands and utilizes joint measurements on only a small constant number of state copies. This `triple efficiency' is achievable for any subset of $n$-qubit Pauli observables, whereas single-copy strategies can only be efficient if the Pauli observables have advantageous structure. In this work, we complement existing theoretical performance guarantees with the empirical evaluation of triply efficient shadow tomography using classical, noise-free simulations. Our findings indicate that the empirical sample complexity aligns closely with theoretical predictions for stabilizer states and, notably, demonstrates slightly improved scaling for random Gibbs states compared to established theoretical bounds. In addition, we improve a central subroutine in the triply-efficient shadow protocol by leveraging insights from a refined quantum and quantum-inspired convex optimization algorithm [3, Henze et al. arXiv:2502.15426 (2025)]. To summarize, our empirical sample complexity studies of triply efficient shadow tomography not only confirm existing theoretical scaling behavior, but also showcase that the actual constants involved are comparatively benign. Hence, this protocol has the potential to also be very sample-efficient in practice.</p>

            <h2>Inducing macroscopic cat states of nonequilibrium electrons via cat-state light irradiation and projective measurements</h2>

Here we investigate the quantum dynamics of N independent two-level electrons interacting with SchrÃ¶dinger cat or kitten states of light. Without measurement, a macroscopic cat state of electrons appears only in an ultrashort time window. In contrast, we demonstrate that photon-number parity or quadrature projective measurements can restore a macroscopic cat state in nonequilibrium electrons, even in the thermodynamic limit. These dynamics are captured by an external-field approximation, in which the electronic system evolves into a Rabi-oscillation cat state. Our results highlight the need for precise quantum measurement techniques for light to control macroscopic quantum states of matter driven by quantum light.</p>

            <h2>Harvesting Contextuality from the Vacuum</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Philip A. LeMaitre</p>
            <p>Quantum contextuality is the notion that certain measurement scenarios do not admit a global description of their statistics and has been implicated as the source of quantum advantage in a number of quantum information protocols. It has been shown that contextuality generalizes the concepts of non-local entanglement and magic, and is an equivalent notion of non-classicality to Wigner negativity. In this paper, the protocol of contextuality harvesting is introduced and it is shown that Unruh-DeWitt models are capable of harvesting quantum contextuality from the vacuum of a massless scalar quantum field. In particular, it is shown that gapless systems can be made to harvest contextuality given a suitable choice of measurements. The harvested contextuality is also seen to behave similarly to harvested magic and can be larger in magnitude for specific parameter regimes. An Unruh-DeWitt qubit-qutrit system is also investigated, where it is shown that certain tradeoffs exist between the harvested contextuality of the qutrit and the harvested entanglement between the systems, and that there are harvesting regimes where the two resources can both be present. Some of the tools of contextuality, namely the contextual fraction, are also imported and used as general harvesting measures for any form of contextuality, including non-local entanglement and magic. Additionally, new criteria for genuine harvesting are put forward that also apply to individual systems, revealing new permissible harvesting parameter regimes.</p>

            <p>Simulating vibrational dynamics is essential for understanding molecular structure, unlocking useful applications such as vibrational spectroscopy for high-fidelity chemical detection. Quantum algorithms for vibrational dynamics are emerging as a promising alternative to resource-demanding classical approaches, but this domain is largely underdeveloped compared to quantum simulations of electronic structure. In this work, we describe in detail three distinct forms of the vibrational Hamiltonian: canonical bosonic quantization, real space representation, and the Christiansen second-quantized form. Leveraging Lie algebraic properties of each, we develop efficient fragmentation schemes to enable the use of Trotter product formulas for simulating time evolution. We introduce circuits required to implement time evolution in each form, and highlight factors that contribute to the simulation cost, including the choice of vibrational coordinates. Using a perturbative approach for the Trotter error, we obtain tight estimates of T gate cost for the simulation of time evolution in each form, enabling their quantitative comparison. Combining tight Trotter error estimates and efficient fragmentation schemes, we find that for the medium-sized CH$_4$ molecule with 9 vibrational modes, time evolution for approximately 1.8 ps may be simulated using as little as 36 qubits and approximately $3 \times 10^{8}$ T gates -- an order-of-magnitude speedup over prior-art algorithms. Finally, we present calculations of vibrational spectra using each form to demonstrate the fidelity of our algorithms. This work presents a unified and highly optimized framework that makes simulating vibrational dynamics an attractive use case for quantum computers.</p>

            <p>We address the challenge of multi-target quantum optimization, where the objective is to simultaneously optimize multiple cost functions defined over the same quantum search space. To accelerate optimization and reduce quantum resource usage, we investigate a range of strategies that enable knowledge transfer between related tasks. Specifically, we introduce a two-stage framework consisting of a training phase where solutions are progressively shared across tasks and an inference phase, where unoptimized targets are initialized based on prior optimized ones. We propose and evaluate several methods, including warm-start initialization, parameter estimation via first-order Taylor expansion, hierarchical clustering with D-level trees, and deep learning-based transfer. Our experimental results, using parameterized quantum circuits implemented with PennyLane, demonstrate that transfer techniques significantly reduce the number of required iterations while maintaining an acceptable cost value. These findings highlight the promise of multi-target generalization in quantum optimization pipelines and provide a foundation for scalable multi-target quantum optimization.</p>

            <h2>Dynamical Phase Transitions in Open Quantum Walks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stefano Longhi</p>
            <p>Dynamical phase transitions in the relaxation behavior of stochastic quantum walks are investigated, focusing on systems where coherent unitary evolution is periodically interrupted by dephasing. This interplay leads to a classicalization of the dynamics, effectively described by non-equilibrium Markovian processes that can violate detailed balance. As a result, such systems exhibit a richer and more complex spectral structure than their equilibrium counterparts. Extending recent insights from classical Markov dynamics [G. Teza {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 130}, 207103 (2023)], we demonstrate that these quantum-classical hybrid systems can host not only first-order dynamical phase transitions -- characterized by eigenvalue crossings -- but also second-order transitions marked by the coalescence of eigenvalues and eigenvectors at exceptional points. We analyze two paradigmatic models: a quantum walk on a ring under gauge fields and a walk on a finite line with internal degrees of freedom, both exhibiting distinct mechanisms for breaking detailed balance. These findings reveal a novel class of critical behavior in open quantum systems, where decoherence-induced classicalization enables access to non-Hermitian spectral phenomena. Beyond their fundamental interest, our results offer promising implications for quantum technologies, including quantum simulation, error mitigation, and the engineering of controllable non-equilibrium quantum states.</p>

            <h2>Unified quantification of entanglement and magic in information scrambling and their trade-off relationship</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mao Kaneyasu, Yoshihiko Hasegawa</p>
            <p>Information scrambling is a phenomenon observed in a wide range of quantum systems, in which initially localized information becomes distributed across the entire system. Clarifying the essence of this phenomenon is made possible by quantum resource theory, which provides an axiomatic framework for quantifying various forms of quantumness. Within this framework, information scrambling can be classified into two distinct types: entanglement scrambling and magic scrambling. Although each has been analyzed individually through their respective resource theories, such separate treatments fail to capture the inherent trade-off between them. In this study, we introduce a unified measure of the two types of scrambling, grounded in resource-theoretic principles. This unified approach reveals a rigorous trade-off relationship between entanglement and magic scrambling, as the exact maximum value of the proposed measure can be derived analytically. Furthermore, we quantify the scrambling capability of unitary transformations in terms of their ability to amplify this measure.</p>

We begin by developing a model that includes radiative and nonradiative broadening to calculate the total scattered and absorbed energy. As an example calculation, we consider cesium atoms in a magneto-optical trap, and evaluate the fluorescence emission when driven by non-degenerate classical and squeezed light, in both the continuous-wave and pulsed regimes. We find that squeezed light can provide an enhancement in both regimes under ideal circumstances. These enhancements are in principle detectable. However, we stress that they are moderate at best compared to recently reported values for molecular systems.</p>

            <p>Reliable and robust control lies at the core of implementing quantum information processing with diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers. However, control pulses inevitably introduce multiple errors, leading to decoherence and hindering scalable applications. Here, we experimentally report an experiment-friendly multiple-noise-resilient nonadiabatic geometric quantum gate~(MNR-NGQG) that can significantly improve conventional dynamical gate in both robustness and coherence. Notably, even when the detuning fluctuation range is comparable to the maximum Rabi frequency, the single-qubit gate performance of the MNR-NGQG remains almost unchanged. Besides, the coherence time of the electron spin is significantly extended to 690 $\pm$ 30 $ \mu$s, 3.5 times that of the naive dynamical counterpart. As a result, the fidelity of single-qubit gates reaches 0.9992(1), as characterized by quantum process tomography. With its experimentally feasible design and relaxed hardware requirements, our work offers a solid paradigm for achieving high-fidelity quantum control in NV center system, paving the way for practical applications in quantum information science.</p>

This process also serves as a tool for nuclear spin purification. The results are obtained by mapping the problem onto perfect state transfer on a 1D chain.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chao Wang, Pengrui Zhou, Xi-Ning Zhuang, Ziwei Cui, Menghan Dou, Zhao-Yun Chen, Guo-Ping Guo</p>
            <p>Efficient encoding of classical information plays a fundamental role in numerous practical quantum algorithms. However, the preparation of an arbitrary amplitude-encoded state has been proven to be time-consuming, and its deployment on current noisy devices can be challenging. In this work, we propose an improved Matrix Product State(MPS) method preparation protocol with an exponential reduction on the circuit depth, as well as topological adaptability. By refined utilization of the disentangling principle, we also reduce approximately 33% two-qubit gate count. To validate our method, we study various families of functions and distributions with provably bounded MPS rank. Numerical experiments show that our method significantly reduces circuit depth while achieving higher fidelity for states arising in financial and other applications.</p>

            <h2>BELT: Block Encoding of Linear Transformation on Density Matrices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fuchuan Wei, Rundi Lu, Yuguo Shao, Junfeng Li, Jin-Peng Liu, Zhengwei Liu</p>
            <p>Linear maps that are not completely positive play a crucial role in the study of quantum information, yet their non-completely positive nature renders them challenging to realize physically. The core difficulty lies in the fact that when acting such a map $\mathcal{N}$ on a state $\rho$, $\mathcal{N}(\rho)$ may not correspond to a valid density matrix, making it difficult to prepare directly in a physical system. We introduce Block Encoding of Linear Transformation (BELT), a systematic protocol that simulates arbitrary linear maps by embedding the output $\mathcal{N}(\rho)$ into a block of a unitary operator. BELT enables the manipulation and extraction of information about $\mathcal{N}(\rho)$ through coherent quantum evolution. Notably, BELT accommodates maps that fall outside the scope of quantum singular value transformation, such as the transpose map. BELT finds applications in entanglement detection, quantum channel inversion, and simulating pseudo-differential operators, and demonstrates improved sample complexity compared to protocols based on Hermitian-preserving map exponentiation.</p>

            <h2>Generalized quantum Chernoff bound</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kun Fang</p>
            <p>We establish a generalized quantum Chernoff bound for the discrimination of multiple sets of quantum states, thereby extending the classical and quantum Chernoff bounds to the general setting of composite and correlated quantum hypotheses. Specifically, we consider the task of distinguishing whether a quantum system is prepared in a state from one of several convex, compact sets of quantum states, each of which may exhibit arbitrary correlations. Assuming their stability under tensor product, we prove that the optimal error exponent for discrimination is precisely given by the regularized quantum Chernoff divergence between the sets. Furthermore, leveraging minimax theorems, we show that discriminating between sets of quantum states is no harder than discriminating between their worst-case elements in terms of error probability. This implies the existence of a universal optimal test that achieves the minimum error probability for all states in the sets, matching the performance of the optimal test for the most challenging states. We provide explicit characterizations of the universal optimal test in the binary composite case. Finally, we show that the maximum overlap between a pure state and a set of free states, a quantity that frequently arises in quantum resource theories, is equal to the quantum Chernoff divergence between the sets, thereby providing an operational interpretation of this quantity in the context of symmetric hypothesis testing.</p>

            <p>Security analysis is a critical part in any cryptographic protocol, may it be classical or quantum. Without security analysis, one cannot ensure the secrecy of the distributed keys. To perform a conclusive security analysis, it is very often necessary to frame the problem as an optimization problem. However, solving such optimization problems is quite challenging. In this article, we focus on the security analysis of device-independent quantum key distribution (DIQKD) with random key basis protocol. We show that the optimization cost of the existing security analysis can be reduced without compromising the key rate. In particular, we reframe the entire security analysis of this protocol as a strongly convex optimization problem and demonstrate that unlike the original security proof, optimization of Bob's measurement angles for finding a lower bound on Eve's uncertainty about Alice's key generation basis can be done with lesser cost. We derive an explicit form of the pessimistic error that arises while optimizing the measurement angles of both the parties. We also clarify a few parts of the original security proof, making the analysis more rigorous and complete.</p>

            <h2>Trading Quantum Ensembles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junaid ur Rehman</p>
            <p>We consider an example scenario where we require several copies of a pure quantum state $|\psi\rangle$ for some quantum information processing task. Due to practical limitations, we only have access to $N = 10^3$ depolarized copies of $|\psi\rangle$ such that the fidelity $F$ of each copy with $|\psi\rangle$ is $0.75$. We denote this quantum asset with the ensemble $\mathcal{A}: (10^3, 0.75)_{|\psi\rangle}$. A genie appears and offers to trade $\mathcal{A}$ with either $\mathcal{B}: (10^4, 0.65)_{|\psi\rangle}$ or with $\mathcal{C}: (10^2, 0.90)_{|\psi\rangle}$. Should we accept the trade with either of these two ensembles? In this article, we attempt to answer this question with arbitrary $N$ and $F$. More specifically, we derive resource equivalence curves from quantum resource theory of purity, quantum state distinguishability, quantum state purification, and quantum state tomography. These curves enable ranking of these ensembles according to their operational usefulness for these tasks and allow us to answer the question of trading the aforementioned ensembles.</p>

            <h2>Dynamic syndrome decoder in volume-law phases of hybrid quantum circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dawid Paszko, Marcin Szyniszewski, Arijeet Pal</p>
            <p>Phases of matter with volume-law entanglement are frequently observed in quantum circuits and have numerous applications, ranging from deepening our understanding of quantum mechanics to advancements in quantum computing and cryptography. Their capacity to host entangled, complex quantum information is complemented by their ability to efficiently obscure it from quantum measurements through scrambling, reminiscent of quantum error-correction. However, the issue of initial-state decodability has primarily been studied in measurement-only models with area-law phases, which limit the entanglement of the encoded state. In this work, we introduce a class of Clifford circuits in one and two dimensions that feature a decodable volume law phase, allowing for information retrieval in logarithmic circuit depths. We present the Sign-Color Decoder that tracks stabilizers revealing the initial state, akin to monitoring a dynamically-changing syndrome for error-correcting codes. We demonstrate this approach in scenarios where error locations are either known or unknown to the decoder, and we provide new insights about the relationship between the decodability transition and measurement-induced phase transition. We propose that this decodability transition is universal across various settings, including different circuit geometries. Our findings pave the way for using volume law states as encoders with mid-circuit measurements, opening potential applications in quantum error correction and quantum cryptography.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Phase Estimation Beyond the Gaussian Limit</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kimin Park, Tanjung Krisnanda, Yvonne Gao, Radim Filip</p>
            <p>Quantum metrology aims to enhance measurement precision beyond the standard quantum limit (SQL), the benchmark set by classical resources, enabling advances in sensing, imaging, and fundamental physics. A critical milestone beyond the SQL is surpassing the Gaussian bound -- the fundamental precision limit achievable with any Gaussian state, such as optimally squeezed states. Certain non-Gaussian states, specifically asymmetric superpositions of coherent states (SCS) and superpositions of a vacuum and a Fock state (ON states), can outperform this Gaussian bound within an intermediate energy range. In particular, asymmetric SCS emerge as a highly practical resource for near-term quantum sensing architectures operating beyond the Gaussian limit due to their efficient preparation and processing via a constant-complexity protocol. Our comprehensive analysis under realistic loss, noise, and detection schemes quantifies the critical trade-off between achievable precision and the operational range of the non-Gaussian advantage. This work sheds light on the fundamental impact of non-Gaussianity and asymmetry on metrological tasks, and offers insights on how to leverage such resources in realistic near-term quantum enhanced sensors beyond the Gaussian limit.</p>

            <h2>Driven-Dissipative Interpretation of Measurement-Induced State Transitions Beyond Semiclassical Predictions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bo-Syun Pan, Yen-Hsiang Lin, Chiao-Hsuan Wang</p>
            <p>Dispersive readout plays a central role in superconducting quantum computing, enabling quantum nondemolition (QND) measurements of qubits through a coupled microwave resonator. However, under strong readout drives, multi-photon resonances can cause measurement-induced state transition (MIST), resulting in qubit leakage out of the computational subspace and compromising the QND character. We present a driven-dissipative interpretation of MIST using a reduced quantum model that captures the dynamics and entanglement structure underlying the breakdown of QND measurement, a feature inaccessible to previous semiclassical treatments. A super-MIST regime under strong drive is uncovered, characterized by steady-state qubit inversion and slow relaxation beyond the semiclassical Landau-Zener predictions. We further identify a transient readout condition in which the resonator becomes highly populated while the qubit remains near its original state. These results are broadly applicable to superconducting qubits such as fluxonium and transmon, unveil the nonequilibrium dynamics of MIST, and highlight strongly driven regimes that can be leveraged for measurement optimization.</p>

            <p>Reducing the size and complexity of high-performance timekeeping devices is an ever-growing need for various applications, such as 6G wireless technology, positioning, navigation and timing (PNT), Internet of Things (IoT), and ultrafast spectroscopy. This work presents a distributed feedback (DFB) laser-pumped Rb atomic clock, which features extraordinary frequency stability, small size and low power consumption. The DFB laser head employs a built-in isolator with a linewidth of approximately 1 MHz. For complete optical pumping of the atoms in the absorption cell, the laser beam is expanded to a diameter of 10 mm by using an optical diffuser-based beam expander. The physics package is based on a magnetron microwave cavity and surrounded by two layers of magnetic shielding. The overall volume of the optical system combined with the physics package is 250 cm$^3$. The proposed atomic clock is also designed to operate at a low temperature, whose absorption cell is maintained at 323 K. Benefiting from the lower Rb atom density, the excited atoms present a long population relaxation time of 5.8 ms. The frequency synthesizer and frequency-locked loop are implemented by digital circuits. The short-term stability of the atomic clock is measured to be $1.8\times10^{-12}\tau ^{-1/2}$ (1-100s). Our achievement paves the way for practical application of the laser-pumped Rb atomic clocks.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement harvesting and curvature of entanglement: A modular operator approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rupak Chatterjee</p>
            <p>An operator-algebraic framework based on Tomita-Takesaki modular theory is used to study aspects of quantum entanglement via the application of the modular conjugation operator $J$. The entanglement structure of quantum fields is studied through the protocol of entanglement harvesting whereby by quantum correlations evolve through the time evolution of qubit detectors coupled to a Bosonic field. Modular conjugation operators are constructed for Unruh-Dewitt type qubits interacting with a scalar field such that initially unentangled qubits become entangled. The entanglement harvested in this process is directly quantified by an expectation value involving $J$ offering a physical application of this operator. The modular operator formalism is then extended to the Markovian open system dynamics of coupled qubits by expressing entanglement monotones as functionals of a state $\rho$ and its modular reflection $J\rho J$. The second derivative of such functionals with respect to an external coupling parameter, termed the curvature of entanglement, provides a natural measure of entanglement sensitivity. At points of modular self-duality, the curvature of entanglement coincides with the quantum Fisher information measure. These results demonstrate that the modular conjugation operator $J$ captures both the harvesting of entanglement from quantum fields and the curvature of entanglement in coupled qubit dynamics providing parallel modular structures that connect these systems.</p>

            <p>In previous works, we showed that both time and space can emerge from entanglement within a globally constrained quantum Universe, with no background coordinates. By extending the Page and Wootters quantum time formalism to include both quantum clocks and rods, and imposing global constraints on total energy and momentum, we constructed a fully relational model of quantum spacetime. Here we take a further step: working in 1+1 dimensions, we show that the standard wave equations governing quantum particles (the SchrÃ¶dinger, Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations) emerge naturally from this framework. The solutions of the equations are derived directly from the constraints, without assuming any external spacetime structure. The second quantization formalism is also implemented and discussed. Our results provide further support for the idea that quantum dynamics in spacetime may emerge from entanglement and constraints.</p>

            <h2>Born's Rule from Quantum Frequentism</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lionel Brits</p>
            <p>Quantum theory has evolved from a set of provisional rules to an indispensable framework that underlies much of modern technology and infrastructure. Yet, after a century, Born's probability postulate remains at odds with the theory's unitary character. The problem stems from the linearity of the SchrÃ¶dinger equation, as linear systems are insensitive to the magnitudes of their solutions' coefficients. If measurement is unitary, and thus linear, how can the frequency of an outcome depend on the magnitude of its amplitude? And if not, at what scale does unitarity break down? This question remains pressing, as the assumption of unitarity underlies both the design of large-scale fault-tolerant quantum devices, as well as our understanding of fundamental aspects of our universe, for example, the black hole information problem. Proponents of the many-worlds interpretation have argued that Born's rule is observed because events that violate it have vanishing norms, and so must be unphysical. However, this argument has only been made explicit for special cases involving infinitely many identical states. In this paper we provide a generalized form of Born's rule applicable to measurements of arbitrarily-prepared factorizable states, and prove that such systems contain no histories that violate Born's rule. Our result therefore demonstrates that purely unitary evolution can co-exist with Born's rule under more relaxed conditions. In addition, we apply our generalized rule to the problem of quantum circuit fidelity, and provide a single-shot alternative to cross-entropy benchmarking based on self-information rate.</p>

            <p>Quantum networks that distribute entanglement among remote nodes will unlock transformational technologies in quantum computing, communication, and sensing. However, state-of-the-art networks utilize only a single optically-addressed qubit per node; this constrains both the quantum communication bandwidth and memory resources, greatly impeding scalability. Solid-state platforms provide a valuable resource for multiplexed quantum networking where multiple spectrally-distinguishable qubits can be hosted in nano-scale volumes. Here we harness this resource by implementing a two-node network consisting of several rare-earth ions coupled to nanophotonic cavities. This is accomplished with a protocol that entangles distinguishable 171Yb ions through frequency-erasing photon detection combined with real-time quantum feedforward. This method is robust to slow optical frequency fluctuations occurring on timescales longer than a single entanglement attempt: a universal challenge amongst solid-state emitters. We demonstrate the enhanced functionality of these multi-emitter nodes in two ways. First, we mitigate bottlenecks to the entanglement distribution rate through multiplexed entanglement of two remote ion pairs. Secondly, we prepare multipartite W-states comprising three distinguishable ions as a resource for advanced quantum networking protocols. These results lay the groundwork for scalable quantum networking based on rare-earth ions.</p>

Here we present a variational generative optimization network that learns to map simple random inputs into high quality solutions across a variety of quantum tasks. We demonstrate that the network rapidly identifies entangled states exhibiting an optimal advantage in entanglement detection when allowing classical communication, attains the ground state energy of an eighteen spin model without encountering the barren plateau phenomenon that hampers standard hybrid algorithms, and-after a single training run-outputs multiple orthogonal ground states of degenerate quantum models. Because the method is model agnostic, parallelizable and runs on current classical hardware, it can accelerate future variational optimization problems in quantum information, quantum computing and beyond.</p>

            <p>In classical thermodynamics, heat must spontaneously flow from hot to cold systems. In quantum thermodynamics, the same law applies when considering multipartite product thermal states evolving unitarily. If initial correlations are present, anomalous heat flow can happen, temporarily making cold thermal states colder and hot thermal states hotter. Such effect can happen due to entanglement, but also because of classical randomness, hence lacking a direct connection with nonclassicality. In this work, we introduce scenarios where anomalous heat flow \emph{does} have a direct link to nonclassicality, defined to be the failure of noncontextual models to explain experimental data. We start by extending known noncontextuality inequalities to a setup where sequential transformations are considered. We then show a class of quantum prepare-transform-measure protocols, characterized by time intervals $(0,\tau_c)$ for a given critical time $\tau_c$, where anomalous heat flow happens only if a noncontextuality inequality is violated. We also analyze a recent experiment from Micadei et. al. [Nat. Commun. 10, 2456 (2019)] and find the critical time $\tau_c$ based on their experimental parameters. We conclude by investigating heat flow in the evolution of two qutrit systems, showing that our findings are not an artifact of using two-qubit systems.</p>

We explore a top-down approach in which the subsystems emerge from the spectrum of the whole system. This approach has been referred to as quantum mereology. First we show that decomposing a system into subsystems is equivalent to decomposing a spectrum into other spectra. Then we argue that the number of subsystems (the volume of the system) can be inferred from the spectrum itself. In local models, this information is encoded in finite size corrections to the Gaussian density of states.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gang Liu, Gen Li, Huatang Tan, Jie Li</p>
            <p>We propose an efficient method for dissipative generation of magnonic cat states in a cavity-magnon-qubit hybrid system by exploiting a two-magnon driving and dissipation mechanism. When both the magnon and qubit are driven, a coherent nonlinear two-magnon interaction is induced, wherein the qubit and the magnon mode exchange energy through magnon pairs. The dissipation of the qubit is exploited to steer the magnon mode into a quantum superposition of distinct coherent states, where the magnon mode evolves into either an even or odd cat state, depending on the parity of the magnon initial state. For the case where the magnon initial state is a superposition state, e.g., of $\ket{0}$ and $\ket{1}$, the magnon mode can evolve into a weighted mixture of the even and odd cat states. We also find that magnon squeezed states may emerge during the short-time evolution, showcasing the capability of our mechanism in preparing diverse magnon non-classical states. Magnonic cat and squeezed states are macroscopic quantum states and find applications in macroscopic quantum studies and quantum sensing, e.g., in the dark matter search using ferromagnetic axion haloscopes.</p>

            <p>One of the key issues in quantum discrimination problems is understanding the extent of the advantages in discrimination performance when using resource states compared to resourceless states. We show that in any resource theory of states, which may not be convex, the extent to which the maximum average success probability can be improved in quantum channel discrimination problems without using auxiliary systems can be precisely quantified by the robustness measure. This result offers an intuitive operational meaning of the robustness measure in any convex resource theory. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the robustness measure can also quantify the improvement in channel discrimination problems that use auxiliary systems. Using these findings, resources can be fully characterized to achieve higher success probabilities than any state without the given resource in channel discrimination problems.</p>

            <p>Optical quantum computing is a promising approach for achieving large-scale quantum computation. While Gaussian operations have been successfully scaled, the inherently weak nonlinearity in optics makes generating highly non-Gaussian states a critical challenge for universality and fault tolerance. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a scalable method to generate optical non-Gaussian states with a resonator-based quantum memory that supports continuous-time storage and retrieval, in contrast to conventional loop-based memories. We introduce a dual-mode operation of the memory, enabling both storage and entangling functionalities within a single device. By employing a time-domain-multiplexed approach, we successfully demonstrate both cat and Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) breeding protocols in a scalable fashion, marking a key step toward quantum error correction. Our experiment also marks the first full demonstration of an optical resonator memory performing writing, storage, and readout operations. We validate the memory by storing squeezed single-photon states with up to 93% total efficiency, and measure an energy relaxation time $T_1 =$2.3$\mu$s and dephasing time $T_{\phi} =$0.96$\mu$s. These results establish a scalable pathway to generating complex non-Gaussian states required for fault-tolerant optical quantum computing. Beyond computation, our techniques provide new tools for enhancing quantum communication, sensing, and metrology.</p>

            <p>We study the impact of noise on the dynamics of entanglement in the transverse-field Ising chain, with the field quenched linearly across one or both of the quantum critical points of the model. Taking concurrence as a measure of entanglement, we find that a quench generates entanglement between nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor spins, with noise reducing the amount of entanglement. Focusing on the next-nearest-neighbor concurrence, known to exhibit Kibble-Zurek scaling with the square root of the quench rate in the noiseless case, we find a different result when noise is present: The concurrence now scales logarithmically with the quench rate, with a noise-dependent amplitude. This is also different from the ``anti-Kibble-Zurek" scaling of defect density with quench rate when noise is present, suggesting that noisy entanglement generation is largely independent from the rate of defect formation. Intriguingly, the critical time scale beyond which no entanglement is produced by a noisy quench scales as a power law with the strength of noise, with the same exponent as that which governs the optimal quench time for which defect formation is at a minimum in a standard quantum annealing scheme.</p>

            <p>Solving short and long time dynamics of closed quantum many-body systems is one of the main challenges of both atomic and condensed matter physics. For locally interacting closed systems, the dynamics of local observables can always be expanded into (pseudolocal) eigenmodes of the Liouvillian, so called dynamical symmetries. They come in two classes - transient operators, which decay in time and perpetual operators, which either oscillate forever or stay the same (conservation laws). These operators provide a full characterization of the dynamics of the system. Deriving these operators, apart from a very limited class of models, has not been possible. Here, we present a method to numerically and analytically derive some of these dynamical symmetries in infinite closed systems by introducing a naturally emergent open boundary condition on the Krylov chain. This boundary condition defines a partitioning of the Krylov space into system and environment degrees of freedom, where non-local operators make up an effective bath for the local operators. We demonstrate the practicality of the method on some numerical examples and derive analytical results in two idealized cases. Our approach lets us directly relate the operator growth hypothesis to thermalization and exponential decay of observables in chaotic systems.</p>

            <h2>Quantifying Trapped Magnetic Vortex Losses in Niobium Resonators at mK Temperatures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> D. Bafia, B. Abdisatarov, R. Pilipenko, Y. Lu, G. Eremeev, A. Romanenko, A. Grassellino</p>
            <p>Trapped magnetic vortices in niobium introduce microwave losses that degrade the performance of superconducting resonators. While such losses have been extensively studied above 1~K, we report here their direct quantification in the millikelvin and low-photon regime relevant to quantum devices. Using a high-quality factor 3-D niobium cavity cooled through its superconducting transition in controlled magnetic fields, we isolate vortex-induced losses and find the resistive component of the sensitivity to trapped flux $S$ to be approximately 2~n$\Omega$/mG at 10~mK and 6~GHz. The decay rate is initially dominated by two-level system (TLS) losses from the native niobium pentoxide, with vortex-induced degradation of $T_1$ occurring above $B_{\text{trap}}\sim$~50~mG. In the absence of the oxide, even 10~mG of trapped flux limits performance $Q_0\sim$~10$^{10}$, or $T_1\sim$~350~ms, underscoring the need for stringent magnetic shielding. The resistive sensitivity $S$ decreases with temperature and remains largely field-independent, whereas the reactive component, $S'$, exhibits a maximum near 0.8~K. These behaviors are well modeled within the Coffey-Clem framework in the zero-creep limit, under the assumption that vortex pinning is enhanced by thermally activated processes. Our results suggest that niobium-based transmon qubits can tolerate vortex-induced dissipation at trapped field levels up to several hundred mG, but achieving long coherence times still requires careful magnetic shielding to suppress lower-field losses from other mechanisms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Angela Rosy Morgillo, Stefano Mancini, Massimiliano F. Sacchi, Chiara Macchiavello</p>
            <p>Time-varying quantum channels are essential for modeling realistic quantum systems with evolving noise properties. Here, we consider Gaussian lossy channels varying from one use to another and we employ neural networks to classify, regress, and forecast the behavior of these channels from their Choi-Jamiolkowski states. The networks achieve at least 87% of accuracy in distinguishing between non-Markovian, Markovian, memoryless, compound, and deterministic channels. In regression tasks, the model accurately reconstructs the loss parameter sequences, and in forecasting, it predicts future values, with improved performance as the memory parameter approaches 1 for Markovian channels. These results demonstrate the potential of neural networks in characterizing and predicting the dynamics of quantum channels.</p>

            <h2>Detector noise in continuous-variable quantum key distribution</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shihong Pan, Dimitri Monokandylos, Bing Qi</p>
            <p>Detector noise is a critical factor in determining the performance of a quantum key distribution (QKD) system. In continuous-variable (CV) QKD with optical coherent detection, the widely adopted \textit{trusted detector noise} model improves both the secret key rate and transmission distance. This model assumes that detector noise is inherently random and inaccessible to an adversary. Its validity depends on two key assumptions: (1) the detector can be accurately calibrated by the legitimate user and remains isolated from the adversary, and (2) the detector noise is truly random from the adversary's perspective. While substantial research has focused on strengthening the first assumption, the second is far more difficult to justify. Indeed, in quantum random number generation using optical homodyne detection, detector noise is often treated as ``untrusted'' and unsuitable for generating true randomness. In this paper, we introduce a \textit{calibrated detector noise} model for CV-QKD, which relies solely on the first assumption. Specifically, our model applies even when detector noise is predictable to the adversary. We analyze the electrical noise of a commercial balanced photoreceiver and perform numerical simulations to compare different noise models. Our results show that when the detector noise variance is an order of magnitude below the vacuum noise, the proposed model achieves a secret key rate comparable to that of the trusted detector noise model, while eliminating the questionable assumption of ``truly random'' detector noise.</p>

            <h2>Purely quantum memory in closed systems observed via imperfect measurements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jorge Tabanera-Bravo, AljaÅ¾ Godec</p>
            <p>The detection and quantification of non-Markovianity, a.k.a. memory, in quantum systems is a central problem in the theory of open quantum systems. There memory is as a result of the interaction between the system and its environment. Little is known, however, about memory effects induced by imperfect measurements on closed systems, where an entanglement with the environment is not possible. We investigate the emergence and characteristics of memory in closed systems observed via imperfect stroboscopic quantum measurements yielding coarse-grained outcomes. We consider ideal and two kinds of imperfect measurements: von Neumann measurements--the analogue of classical lumping--which destroy any coherence in the system, and genuinely quantum-lumping LÃ¼ders measurements preserving certain quantum correlations. Whereas the conditions for Markov dynamics under von Neumann lumping are the same as for classical dynamics, quantum-lumping requires stronger conditions, i.e. the absence of any detectable coherence. We introduce the concept of purely quantum memory having no classical counterpart. We illustrate our results with a quantum walk on a lattice and discuss their implications for dissipative dynamics and decoherence effects induced by more realistic measurements.</p>

            <p>Multi-dimensional entangled photon states represent an important resource in quantum communication networks. Specifically, hyperentangled states presenting simultaneous entanglement in several degrees of freedom (DoF), stand out for their noise resilience and information capacity. In this work, we demonstrate the generation of hyperentangled photon pairs in the time and frequency-bin domain by spontaneous four-wave mixing from the coherent driving of two integrated Silicon microresonators. We demonstrate entanglement in each DoF by proving the violation of the Clauser Horne Shimony Holt (CHSH) inequality by more than 27 standard deviations (STDs) in each reduced space. Genuine hyperentanglement is then assessed from the negativity of an hyperentanglement witness, which is verified by more than 60 STDs. These results mark, to the best of our knowledge, the first demonstration of time-frequency bin hyperentanglement in an integrated silicon photonic device.</p>

            <h2>A Lazy Resynthesis Approach for Simultaneous T Gate and Two-Qubit Gate Optimization of Quantum Circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mu-Te Lau, Hsiang-Chun Yang, Hsin-Yu Chen, Chung-Yang Ric Huang</p>
            <p>State-of-the-art quantum circuit optimization (QCO) algorithms for T-count reduction often lead to a substantial increase in two-qubit gate count (2Q-count) -- a drawback that existing 2Q-count optimization techniques struggle to address effectively. In this work, we propose a novel lazy resynthesis approach for modern tableau-based QCO flows that significantly mitigates the 2Q-gate surges commonly introduced during T-count optimization in Clifford+T circuits. Experimental results show that our approach reduces 2Q-count overhead by 54.8%, 15.3%, and 68.0% compared to tableau-based, ZX-calculus-based, and path-sum-based QCO algorithms, respectively. In terms of runtime, our method achieves speedups of 1.81$\times$ and 13.1$\times$ over the tableau-based and ZX-calculus-based methods, while performing comparably to the path-sum-based approach. In summary, the proposed lazy resynthesis technique not only enhances the quality and performance of tableau-based QCO algorithms but also demonstrates superior efficiency and scalability compared to alternative QCO approaches such as ZX-calculus and path-sum-based techniques.</p>

            <h2>Quantum stochastic analysis of non-linear driven light emission</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Philipp Stammer</p>
            <p>This work extends quantum optical models of high harmonic generation by considering a quantum stochastic analysis of the field modes coupled to an environment. In particular, we study the open system dynamics by solving the quantum Langevin equation for a non-linear driven cavity coupled to the environment. For an unstructured environment without memory, we show that the emission characteristics of the intense driven cavity is isomorphic to the process of high harmonic generation and a non-linear antenna. This is achieved by using the quantum regression theorem for the Markovian dynamics, and further allows to obtain the upper bound of the radiated power due to the emitter fluctuations. This opens the path to connect current quantum optical approaches of HHG with open system descriptions and towards driven-dissipative systems in the non-linear regime.</p>

            <h2>Stability of quasicrystalline ultracold fermions to dipolar interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paolo Molignini</p>
            <p>Quasiperiodic potentials can be used to interpolate between localization and delocalization in one dimension. With the rise of optical platforms engineering dipolar interactions, a key question is the stability of quasicrystalline phases under these long-range interactions. In this work, we study repulsive ultracold dipolar fermions in a quasiperiodic optical lattice to characterize the behavior of interacting quasicrystals. We simulate the full time evolution of the typical experimental protocols used to probe quasicrystalline order and localization properties. We extract experimentally measurable dynamical observables and correlation functions to characterize the three phases observed in the noninteracting setting: localized, intermediate, and extended. We then study the stability of such phases to repulsive dipolar interactions. We find that dipolar interactions can completely alter the shape of the phase diagram by stabilizing the intermediate phase, mostly at the expense of the extended phase. Moreover, in the strongly interacting regime, a resonance-like behavior characterized by density oscillations appears. Remarkably, strong dipolar repulsions can also localize particles even in the absence of quasiperiodicity if the primary lattice is sufficiently deep. Our work shows that dipolar interactions in a quasiperiodic potential can give rise to a complex, tuneable coexistence of localized and extended quantum states.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniele Toniolo, Sougato Bose</p>
            <p>In the context of the Many-Body-Localization phenomenology we consider arbitrarily large one-dimensional local spin systems, the XXZ model with random magnetic field is a prototypical example. Without assuming the existence of exponentially localized integrals of motion (LIOM), but assuming instead that the system's dynamics gives rise to a Lieb-Robinson bound (L-R) with a logarithmic lightcone, we rigorously evaluate the dynamical generation, starting from a generic product state, of $ \alpha$-RÃ©nyi entropies, with $ \alpha $ close to one, obtaining a $\log \, t$-law, that denotes a slow spread of entanglement. This is in sharp contrast with Anderson localized phases that show no dynamically generated entanglement. To prove this result we apply a general theory recently developed by us in arXiv:2408.00743 that quantitatively relates the L-R bounds of a local Hamiltonian with the dynamical generation of entanglement. Assuming instead the existence of LIOM we provide new independent proofs of the known facts that the L-R bound of the system's dynamics has a logarithmic light cone and show that the dynamical generation of the von Neumann entropy has for large times a $ \log \, t$-shape. L-R bounds, that quantify the dynamical spreading of local operators, may be easier to measure in experiments in comparison to global quantities such as entanglement.</p>

            <p>Monolithic integration, which refers to the incorporation of all device functionalities within a single material, shows significant potential for creating scalable solid-state quantum devices. This study demonstrated the coherent control of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) spins using an electronic circuit monolithically integrated within diamond: a patterned, conductive boron-doped diamond (BDD) microwave waveguide. First, we validated the high-frequency performance of the circuit by characterizing its impedance up to the microwave range, confirming its capability for efficient microwave transmission. Then, using this monolithically integrated BDD--NV hybrid system, we performed optically detected magnetic resonance and observed noticeable Rabi oscillations driven by the metallic BDD circuit. Importantly, we verified that the BDD antenna has a minimal detrimental impact on the NV spins; microwave-induced heating is negligible under both pulsed and continuous driving, and the spin relaxation time ($T_1$) remains unperturbed. This approach paves the way for a new class of compact, robust, and versatile quantum platforms suitable for sensing and information processing in various environments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ashton S. Bradley, Nils A. Krause</p>
            <p>We present a quantitative analytical framework for calculating two-point velocity correlations in compressible quantum fluids, focusing on two key classes of superfluid excitations: vortices and rarefaction pulses. We employ two complementary approaches. First, we introduce a new ansatz for vortex cores in planar quantum fluids that enhances analytic integrability. This ansatz yields closed-form expressions for power spectra and velocity correlations for general vortex distributions. Using it, we identify distinct signatures of short- and long-range velocity correlations corresponding to vortex dipoles and vortex pairs, respectively. Second, we analyze the fast rarefaction pulse regime of the Jones-Roberts soliton. By applying the asymptotic high-velocity wavefunction, we derive analytic expressions for the velocity power spectrum and correlation function, capturing the soliton characteristic length scale. We validate our analytical results for the homogeneous system against numerical treatment of a large trapped system, finding close quantitative agreement. Our findings provide the first analytic treatment of velocity correlations for Jones-Roberts solitons in quantum fluids of light [M. Baker-Rasooli et al., Physical Review Letters, 134, 233401 (2025)], and establish a foundation for characterizing vortices and solitons in compressible quantum fluids.</p>

            <h2>Quantum entanglement of fermionic symmetry-enriched quantum critical points in one dimension</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wen-Hao Zhong, Hai-Qing Lin, Xue-Jia Yu</p>
            <p>Quantum entanglement can be an effective diagnostic tool for probing topological phases protected by global symmetries. Recently, the notion of nontrivial topology in critical systems has been proposed and is attracting growing attention. In this work, as a concrete example, we explore the quantum entanglement properties of fermionic symmetry-enriched quantum critical points by constructing exactly solvable models based on stacked multiple Kitaev chains. We first analytically establish the global phase diagram using entanglement entropy and reveal three topologically distinct gapped phases with different winding numbers, along with three topologically distinct transition lines separating them. Importantly, we unambiguously demonstrate that two transition lines exhibit fundamentally different topological properties despite sharing the same central charge. Specifically, they display nontrivial topological degeneracy in the entanglement spectrum under periodic boundary conditions, thereby generalizing the Li-Haldane bulk-boundary correspondence to a broader class of fermionic symmetry-enriched criticality. Additionally, we identify a novel Lifshitz multicritical point at the intersection of the three transition lines, which also exhibits nontrivial topological degeneracy. This work provides a valuable reference for investigating gapless topological phases of matter from the perspective of quantum entanglement.</p>

            <h2>Synthetic and cosmological axion hybridization: entangled photons, (HBT) and quantum beats</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Boyanovsky</p>
            <p>In this article it is argued that synthetic axions, emergent collective excitations in topological insulators or Weyl semimetals hybridize with the cosmological axion, a compelling dark matter candidate via a common two photon decay channel since they both couple to electromagnetic fields via a Chern-Simons term. We point out an analogy to a V-type three level system with the two upper levels identified with the synthetic and cosmological axions decaying into a two-photon state. The Weisskopf-Wigner theory of spontaneous decay in multi level atoms is complemented and extended to describe the dynamics of hybridization. The final two-photon state features both kinematic and polarization entanglement and displays quantum beats as a consequence of the interference between the decay paths. An initial population of either axion induces a population of the other via hybridization. Consequently, a dark matter axion condensate induces a condensate of the synthetic axion, albeit with small amplitude. We obtain a momentum and polarization resolved Hanbury- Brown Twiss (HBT) second order coherence describing coincident correlated two-photon detection. It exhibits quantum beats with a frequency given by the difference between the energies of the synthetic and cosmological axion and \emph{perhaps may be harnessed} to detect either type of axion excitations. The case of synthetic axions individually is obtained in the limit of vanishing coupling of the cosmological axion and features similar two-photon correlations. Hence second order (HBT) two-photon coherence \emph{may} provide an alternative detection mechanism for emergent condensed matter axionic collective excitations. Similarities and differences with parametrically down converted photons are discussed.</p>

            <p>We investigate various types of quantum entanglement in the octanuclear heterometallic $3d/4f$ complexes denoted as Ni$^{2+}_4$Gd$^{3+}_4$ under an external magnetic field, using the exact diagonalization approach. These molecular magnets, which can be effectively described by Heisenberg spin models, consist of two identical $\{\text{Ni}^{2+}_2\text{Gd}^{3+}_2\}$ cubane subunits bridged by acetate and hydroxide ligands. Our analysis reveals that their magnetization exhibits intermediate plateaus at low temperatures, indicating distinct ground states characteristic of Ni-containing compounds. Using negativity as a measure of quantum entanglement, we examine the influence of single-ion anisotropy and magnetic field on tetrapartite, bipartite, 1$-$3 tangle, and 2$-$2 tangle entanglements in two families of Ni$^{2+}_4$Gd$^{3+}_4$ complexes: $\boldsymbol{(1)}$ without anisotropy and $\boldsymbol{(2)}$ with anisotropy. Complex $\boldsymbol{(1)}$ exhibits strong bipartite entanglement between Ni ions, which persists up to $T \approx 3.0\,\text{K}$ and $B \approx 4.0\,\text{T}$, but shows significantly weaker tetrapartite entanglement and vanishing bipartite entanglement between Gd$\cdots$Gd and Ni$\cdots$Gd pairs. In contrast, complex $\boldsymbol{(2)}$ displays nonzero and sizable values for all types of entanglement considered. These findings emphasis the crucial role of single-ion anisotropy in generating and shaping the entanglement landscape of heterometallic Ni$^{2+}_4$Gd$^{3+}_4$ complexes. Notably, we find that the 1$-$3 tangle entanglement between a Ni ion and the remaining sites in a cubane unit serves as a reliable indicator of ground-state phase transitions, exhibiting distinct changes across phase boundaries irrespective of the presence of single-ion anisotropy.</p>

            <p>A classical dynamical system can be viewed as a probability space equipped with a measure-preserving time evolution map, admitting a purely algebraic formulation in terms of the algebra of bounded functions on the phase space. Similarly, a quantum dynamical system can be formulated using an algebra of bounded operators in a non-commutative probability space equipped with a time evolution map. Chaos, in either setting, can be characterized by statistical independence between observables at $ t = 0 $ and $ t \to \infty $, leading to the vanishing of cumulants involving these observables. In the quantum case, the notion of independence is replaced by free independence, which only emerges in the thermodynamic limit (asymptotic freeness). In this work, we propose a definition of quantum chaos based on asymptotic freeness and investigate its emergence in quantum many-body systems including the mixed-field Ising model with a random magnetic field, a higher spin version of the same model, and the SYK model. The hallmark of asymptotic freeness is the emergence of the free convolution prediction for the spectrum of operators of the form $ A(0) + B(t) $, implying the vanishing of all free cumulants between $A(0)$ and $B(t)$ in the thermodynamic limit for an infinite-temperature thermal state. We systematically investigate the spectral properties of $ A(0) + B(t) $ in the above-mentioned models, show that fluctuations on top of the free convolution prediction follow universal Wigner-Dyson statistics, and discuss the connection with quantum chaos. Finally, we argue that free probability theory provides a rigorous framework for understanding quantum chaos, offering a unifying perspective that connects many different manifestations of it.</p>

            <p>The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, a prime example of a one-dimensional topologically nontrivial insulator, has been extensively studied in flat space-time. In recent times, many studies have been conducted to understand the properties of the low-dimensional quantum matter in curved spacetime, which can mimic the gravitational event horizon and black hole physics. However, the impact of curved spacetime on the topological properties of such systems remains unexplored. Here, we investigate the curved spacetime (CST) version of the SSH model by introducing a position-dependent hopping parameter. We show, using different topological markers, that the CST-SSH model can undergo a topological phase transition. We find that the topologically non-trivial phase can host zero-energy edge modes, but those edge modes are asymmetric, unlike the usual SSH model. Moreover, we find that at the topological transition point, a critical slowdown takes place for zero-energy wave packets near the boundary, indicating the presence of a horizon, and interestingly, if one moves even a slight distance away from the transition point, wave packets start bouncing back and reverse direction before reaching the horizon. An extended version of the CST-SSH model, which supports distinct topological phases characterized by higher winding numbers, has also been studied. We show that a similar critical slowdown of wave packets near the boundary occurs at all topological transition points between any two distinct phases. A semiclassical description of the wave packet trajectories also supports these results.</p>

While AQMBS states are closely related to quantum many-body scar (QMBS) states, they exhibit key differences.

We demonstrate that, under appropriate conditions, AQMBS states can be obtained as low-lying gapless excited states of a parent Hamiltonian, which has a QMBS state as its ground state. Furthermore, our formalism reveals a connection between QMBS and supersymmetric (SUSY) quantum mechanics. The QMBS state can be interpreted as a SUSY-unbroken ground state.</p>

A notable example is the transition between the toric code (TC) and double semion (DS) phases, which has two distinct $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders in (2 + 1)D. Previous studies reveal that the transition between them can be either first order or via an intermediate phase, thus the existence of a directly continuous transition between them remains a long-standing problem. Motivated by the fact that both phases can arise from condensing distinct anyons in the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ topological order, we introduce a perturbed $\mathbb{Z}_4$ quantum double (QD) model to study the TC-DS transition. We confirm the existence of a continuous (2 + 1)D XY* transition between the TC and DS phases by mapping it to a two-coupled quantum Ising model. Importantly, using the condensation order parameters and the area law coefficients of the Wilson loops, we further reveal that $\mathbb{Z}_4$ anyons, fractionalized from the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders, become deconfined at the transition between $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topologically ordered phases. Our results open a path toward developing a theoretical framework for topological phase transitions beyond anyon condensation.</p>

            <h2>Generation of frequency-bin-encoded dual-rail cluster states via time-frequency multiplexing of microwave photonic qubits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiling Wang, Takeaki Miyamura, Yoshiki Sunada, Keika Sunada, Jesper Ilves, Kohei Matsuura, Yasunobu Nakamura</p>
            <p>Cluster states are a class of multi-qubit entangled states with broad applications such as quantum metrology and one-way quantum computing. Here, we present a protocol to generate frequency-bin-encoded dual-rail cluster states using a superconducting circuit consisting of a fixed-frequency transmon qubit, a resonator and a Purcell filter. We implement time-frequency multiplexing by sequentially emitting co-propagating microwave photons of distinct frequencies. The frequency-bin dual-rail encoding enables erasure detection based on photon occupancy. We characterize the state fidelity using quantum tomography and quantify the multipartite entanglement using the metric of localizable entanglement. Our implementation achieves a state fidelity exceeding 50$\%$ for a cluster state consisting of up to four logical qubits. The localizable entanglement remains across chains of up to seven logical qubits. After discarding the erasure errors, the fidelity exceeds 50% for states with up to eight logical qubits, and the entanglement persists across chains of up to eleven qubits. These results highlight the improved robustness of frequency-bin dual-rail encoding against photon loss compared to conventional single-rail schemes. This work provides a scalable pathway toward high-dimensional entangled state generation and photonic quantum information processing in the microwave domain.</p>

            <h2>The Role of Entanglement in Quantum Reservoir Computing with Coupled Kerr Nonlinear Oscillators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ali Karimi, Hadi Zadeh-Haghighi, Youssef Kora, Christoph Simon</p>
            <p>Quantum Reservoir Computing (QRC) uses quantum dynamics to efficiently process temporal data. In this work, we investigate a QRC framework based on two coupled Kerr nonlinear oscillators, a system well-suited for time-series prediction tasks due to its complex nonlinear interactions and potentially high-dimensional state space. We explore how its performance in time-series prediction depends on key physical parameters: input drive strength, Kerr nonlinearity, and oscillator coupling, and analyze the role of entanglement in improving the reservoir's computational performance, focusing on its effect on predicting non-trivial time series. Using logarithmic negativity to quantify entanglement and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) to evaluate predictive accuracy, our results suggest that entanglement provides a computational advantage on average-up to a threshold in the input frequency-that persists under some levels of dissipation and dephasing. In particular, we find that higher dissipation rates can enhance performance. While the entanglement advantage manifests as improvements in both average and worst-case performance, it does not lead to improvements in the best-case error. These findings contribute to the broader understanding of quantum reservoirs for high performance, efficient quantum machine learning and time-series forecasting.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Control of Thermal Emission from Photonic Crystals with Two-Level Atoms</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chih-Wei Wang, Jhih-Sheng Wu</p>
            <p>Thermal light engineering is a field of considerable interest and potential. We study quantum light-matter interactions in a one-dimensional photonic crystal with two-level atoms as the active medium, replacing classical oscillators in traditional blackbody models. In a thermal bath with pumping, these atoms modulate thermal emission via interactions with photonic modes. The model with quantum two-level systems enables the processes of spontaneous emission, stimulated absorption, and stimulated emission. Equilibrium and nonequilibrium regimes depend on competition between pumping and thermal relaxation rates. Strong light-matter interaction and photon decay govern dynamics and steady states. In equilibrium, with a high thermal relaxation rate, photon numbers are initially determined by spontaneous emission and later stabilize due to stimulated absorption, influenced by light-matter interaction strength. In-band-gap photons reach steady states at a time scale of one or two orders of magnitude longer than outside-band-gap photons. Interestingly, for a strong light-matter interaction, all photons in the equilibrium regimes show Planckian radiation, regardless of their frequencies in or out of the band gaps. Band-gap suppression of thermal emission is more pronounced with weaker light-matter interaction or larger photon decay. In the nonequilibrium regime, the dynamics of photon numbers exhibit a multi-time-scale process transitioning to steady states due to strong pumping and stimulated processes. Steady-state electron populations of two-level atoms deviate from the Fermi-Dirac distribution, and the steady-state photon numbers exhibit super-Planckian emission. These findings enable quantum control of thermal emission spectra, which is relevant for reducing thermal noise in quantum computing or enhancing radiative cooling.</p>

            <h2>Multi-QIDA method for VQE state preparation in molecular systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fabio Tarocco, Davide Materia, Leonardo Ratini, Leonardo Guidoni</p>
            <p>The development of quantum algorithms and their application to quantum chemistry has introduced new opportunities for solving complex molecular problems that are computationally infeasible for classical methods. In quantum chemistry, the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm designed to estimate ground-state energies of molecular systems. Despite its promise, VQE faces challenges such as scalability issues, high circuit depths, and barren plateaus that make the optimization of the variational wavefunction. To mitigate these challenges, the Quantum Information Driven Ansatz (QIDA) leverages Quantum Mutual Information (QMI) to construct compact, correlation-driven circuits. In this work, we go back to the original field of application of QIDA, by applying the already defined Multi-Threshold Quantum Information Driven Ansatz (Multi-QIDA) methodology on Molecular Systems. to systematically construct shallow, layered quantum circuits starting from approximate QMI matrices obtained by Quantum Chemistry calculations. The Multi-QIDA approach combines efficient creation of the QMI map, reduction of the number of correlators required by exploiting Minimum/Maximum spanning tress, and an iterative layer-wise VQE optimization routine. These enhancements allow the method to recover missing correlations in molecular systems while maintaining computational efficiency. Additionally, the approach incorporates alternative gate constructions, such as SO(4) correlators, to enhance the circuit expressibility without significantly increasing the circuit complexity. We benchmark Multi-QIDA on systems ranging from small molecules like H2O, BeH2, and NH3 in Iterative Natural Orbitals (INOs) basis set, to active-space models such as H2O-6-31G-CAS(4,4) and N2-cc-pVTZ-CAS(6,6), comparing it to traditional hardware-efficient ansatze.</p>

            <p>The squeezed photons, as a quantum-correlated light with reduced noise, have emerged as a great resource for sensing the structures of matter. Here we study the transient absorption (TA) scheme using the squeezed photons whose spectral correlation of amplitudes can be tailored. A microscopic theory is developed, revealing a highly time-energy-resolved nature of the signal that is not attainable by conventional TA scheme. Such a capability is elaborated by applying to monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide materials (TMDs), achieving a real-time monitoring of valley excitons and their dynamics. Moreover, we show the intermediate squeezing regime-not the strong squeezing-which the time-resolved spectroscopy is in favor of. Our work offers a new paradigm for studying nonequilibrium dynamics of matter, in light of the photocatalysis and optoelectronics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rounak Chatterjee, Mayuresh Kanagal, Vikas S Bhat, Kiran Bajar, Sushil Mujumdar</p>
            <p>Biphoton systems exhibiting entanglement in position-momentum variables, known as spatial entanglement, are among the most intriguing and well-studied phenomena in quantum optics. A notable subset of these are phase entangled states, where entanglement manifests purely through correlations in the spatial phase of the wavefunction. While the generation of such states from biphotons via spontaneous parametric down-conversion has been explored, their physical implications and applications remain under-investigated. In this work, we theoretically and experimentally examine a unique form of phase entanglement known as `pure' phase entanglement. This state exhibits the unusual feature that the position of one photon is correlated with the momentum of the other. Unlike typical spatially entangled states, it shows no direct correlation in position or momentum between the two photons, underscoring that all correlations arise purely from the spatial phase of the wavefunction. We delve deeper into the theory of this state and experimentally construct it from known phase-entangled states. To certify its properties, we propose a setup that performs a "one-particle momentum measurement" and explore the various tunable parameters. We also highlight potential applications of this state in quantum optics and imaging experiments.</p>

            <h2>The Effect of Permanent Dipoles on Dark States in Molecular Dimers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthew Freed, Dominic M. Rouse, Andrea Rocco, Jim Al-Khalili, Marian Florescu, Adam Burgess</p>
            <p>Many organic molecules possess large permanent dipole moments that differ depending on the electronic state. These permanent dipoles influence both intermolecular coupling and interactions with the optical fields, yet they are often neglected in typical theoretical quantum optics treatments. Here, we investigate the optical properties and their effect on dark states of dimers possessing such permanent dipoles. We show that when monomers have excitation-dependent permanent dipoles, optical transitions between the bright and dark states of the dimer are enabled. We investigate how permanent dipoles allow for the existence of static driving terms between the ground and excited states of each monomer. In turn, these can cause the excited states of the monomers to couple indirectly to the zero excitation state of the dimer. This leads to interference between permanent and transition dipoles and can result in the formation of dark states that are entirely localised. Furthermore, dark states formed through indirect coupling exhibit enhanced robustness against energy level fluctuations, which may improve the efficiency of the design of photovoltaic devices.</p>

            <h2>Suppression of coherent light scattering in a three-dimensional atomic array</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Kun Lu, Hanzhen Lin, Jiahao Lyu, Yoo Kyung Lee, Vitaly Fedoseev, Wolfgang Ketterle</p>
            <p>Understanding how atoms collectively interact with light is not only important for fundamental science, but also crucial for designing light-matter interfaces in quantum technologies. Over the past decades, numerous studies have focused on arranging atoms in ordered arrays and using constructive (destructive) interference to enhance (suppress) the coupling to electromagnetic fields, thereby tailoring collective light-matter interactions. These studies have mainly focused on one- and two-dimensional arrays. However, only three-dimensional (3D) arrays can demonstrate destructive interference of coherent light scattering in all directions. This omnidirectional suppression of coherent light scattering in 3D atomic arrays has thus far not been experimentally demonstrated. Here, we observe a strong reduction of light scattering in a 3D atomic array prepared in the form of a Mott insulator in optical lattices. The residual light scattering is shown to be caused by the delocalization of atoms, Raman scattering, and inelastic scattering associated with saturation. We also demonstrate how light scattering can be a sensitive probe for density fluctuations in many-body states in optical lattices, enabling us to characterize the superfluid-to-Mott insulator phase transition as well as defects generated by dynamical parameter ramps. The results of our work can be used to prepare subradiant states for photon storage and probe correlations for many-body systems in optical lattices.</p>

            <p>Exciton-polaritons formed inside optical cavities offer a highly tunable platform for exploring novel quantum phenomena. Here, we introduce and theoretically characterize a light-matter moirÃ© effect (LMME) that arises when a 2D material is tilted inside a planar optical cavity, in contrast to stacking multiple layers at a twist angle as is done in forming 2D moirÃ© hetero-structures. We show that this geometric tilt produces emergent periodicity in the light-matter coupling, yielding displaced replicas of the polariton dispersion and flat bands near the Brillouin-zone center. Through time-dependent quantum dynamical simulations, we demonstrate that LMME enables coherent frequency conversion and remains robust against phonon-induced decoherence. Our findings establish LMME as a new platform for engineering polariton band structures, the generation of flat bands and performing coherent frequency conversion relevant for developing polariton-based quantum devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haiyue Kang, John F. Kam, Gary J. Mooney, Lloyd C. L. Hollenberg</p>
            <p>Quantum teleportation is not merely a fascinating corollary of quantum entanglement, it also finds utility in quantum processing and circuit compilation. In this paper, we measure and track the entanglement and fidelity of two-qubit states prepared on a 127-qubit IBM Quantum device, as one of the qubits is teleported across 19 qubits. We design, evaluate and compare two distinct approaches to teleportation: post-selected measurement categorisation and dynamic circuit corrections based on mid-circuit measurements, and compare with direct state transportation using SWAP gates. By optimally choosing the teleportation path which exhibits the highest total negativity entanglement measure across nearest-neighbour pairs, we show the entanglement of a two-qubit graph state is sustained after at least 19 hops in teleportation using the post-selection approach and 17 hops using the dynamic circuit approach. We observe a higher level of teleported entanglement in paths determined from two-qubit negativities compared to those obtained from gate errors, demonstrating an advantage in using the negativity map over the gate error map for compiling quantum circuits.</p>

            <p>Achieving and controlling non-reciprocity in engineered photonic structures is of fundamental interest in science and engineering. Here, we introduce a tunable, non-Hermitian, nonlinear microwave dimer designed to precisely implement phase-non-reciprocal hopping dynamics between two spatially separated cavities at room temperature. Our system incorporates simple components such as three-dimensional microwave cavities, unidirectional amplifiers, digital attenuators, and a digital phase shifter. By dividing the energy transfer into forward and backward paths, our platform enables precise control over the amplitude and phase of the propagating signals in each direction. Through a combination of theoretical and numerical analysis, we model the dynamics of the system under different operating conditions, including a parameter regime where the gain not only compensates for but significantly exceeds the inherent loss. Our model quantitatively reproduces the observed weak-drive transmission spectra, the amplitude and frequency of self-sustained limit cycles, and the phase locking synchronization effect between the limit cycle and an external microwave tone. Our results may have implications in areas ranging from sensing and synthetic photonic materials to neuromorphic computing and quantum networks, while providing new insight into the interplay between non-Hermitian and nonlinear dynamics.</p>

Entangling gates between qudits are implemented via moving molecule in optical traps by exploiting dipole-dipole interactions to mediate coherent coupling.

This approach enables the realization of a universal set of quantum gates. In particular, we exploit additional levels that are present in the d=3 and d=5 qudits, which allows one to simplify the decomposition of multiqubit gates. We then analyze the relevant experimental parameters to realize our schemes with SrF and 87Rb133Cs molecules. The proposed approach offers a promising route towards scalable and versatile quantum information processing with multilevel systems, which can be potentially realized using currently available experimental facilities.</p>

            <p>Variational quantum algorithms have emerged as a cornerstone of contemporary quantum algorithms research. While they have demonstrated considerable promise in solving problems of practical interest, efficiently determining the minimal quantum resources necessary to obtain such a solution remains an open question. In this work, inspired by concepts from classical machine learning, we investigate the impact of overparameterization on the performance of variational algorithms. Our study focuses on the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) -- a prominent variational quantum algorithm designed to solve combinatorial optimization problems. We investigate if circuit overparametrization is necessary and sufficient to solve such problems in QAOA, considering two representative problems -- MAX-CUT and MAX-2-SAT. For MAX-CUT we observe that overparametriation is both sufficient and (statistically) necessary for attaining exact solutions, as confirmed numerically for up to $20$ qubits. In fact, for MAX-CUT on 2-regular graphs we show the necessity to be exact, based on the analytically found optimal depth. In sharp contrast, for MAX-2-SAT, underparametrized circuits suffice to solve most instances. This result highlights the potential of QAOA in the underparametrized regime, supporting its utility for current noisy devices.</p>

            <p>Classical simulations of quantum circuits are vital for assessing potential quantum advantage and benchmarking devices, yet they require sophisticated methods to avoid the exponential growth of resources. Tensor network approaches, in particular matrix product states (MPS) combined with the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm, currently dominate large-scale circuit simulations. These methods scale efficiently when entanglement is limited but suffer rapid bond dimension growth with increasing entanglement and handle long-range gates via costly SWAP insertions. Motivated by the success of the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) in many-body physics, we reinterpret quantum circuits as a series of discrete time evolutions, using gate generators to construct an MPS-based circuit simulation via a local TDVP formulation. This addresses TEBD's key limitations by (1) naturally accommodating long-range gates and (2) optimally representing states on the MPS manifold. By diffusing entanglement more globally, the method suppresses local bond growth and reduces memory and runtime costs. We benchmark the approach on five 49-qubit circuits: three Hamiltonian circuits (1D open and periodic Heisenberg, 2D 7x7 Ising) and two algorithmic ones (quantum approximate optimization, hardware-efficient ansatz). Across all cases, our method yields substantial resource reductions over standard tools, establishing a new state-of-the-art for circuit simulation and enabling advances across quantum computing, condensed matter, and beyond.</p>

            <p>Topological quantum computing promises intrinsic fault tolerance by encoding quantum information in non-Abelian anyons, where quantum gates are implemented via braiding. While braiding operations are robust against local perturbations, a critical yet often overlooked challenge arises when scaling beyond two qubits: the naive extension of braiding based gates fails to support even the full Clifford group. To overcome this limitation, we incorporate projective measurements that enable transitions between different qubit encodings, thus restoring computational universality. We perform many-body simulations of braiding dynamics augmented with measurement-based switching, explicitly preparing the Bell state and GHZ state for systems of two and five qubits, respectively. Furthermore, we execute a random unitary circuit on five qubits, achieving a fidelity exceeding 99%. We analyze the circuit's robustness by studying its fidelity dependence on total braid duration and static potential disorder. Our results show that the fidelity remains above 99% for moderate disorder, underscoring the intrinsic fault tolerance of the architecture. Finally, we demonstrate a random circuit on a ten qubit system to showcase the scalability of our techniques.</p>

            <p>Open quantum systems described by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian exhibit rich dynamics due to the topology of their complex energy spectrum. By encircling an exceptional point degeneracy, this topology allows for topological state transport, chiral geometric phases, and eigenvalue braiding. To access these topological features, it is desirable to drive the system adiabatically. However, adiabatic transport in a system with complex spectrum is conventionally only possible for the eigenstate whose eigenenergy has the lowest loss. Previous experiments have demonstrated such adiabatic evolution for the quantum state with relative gain, yet observed a breakdown in adiabaticity for quantum states with relative loss. In this work, we harness a shortcut to adiabaticity -- counterdiabatic driving -- to avoid the effects of loss while maintaining trajectories that follow the instantaneous eigenstates in significantly shorter timescales. We experimentally investigate the robustness of this control method using a superconducting transmon circuit with engineered dissipation. We observe that counterdiabatic driving stabilizes quasistatic transport and preserves the complex energy spectrum's topology.</p>

            <p>We consider a nonstationary circuit QED system described by the quantum Rabi model, in which an artificial two-level atom with a tunable transition frequency is coupled to a single-mode resonator. We focus on regimes where the external modulation takes the form $\sin[\eta(t) t]$, with the modulation frequency $\eta(t)$ varying slowly and linearly in time near $2\nu$ and $4\nu$, $\nu$ being the resonator frequency. Starting from the vacuum state, we numerically compute the Quantum Fisher Information for single-mode phase and displacement estimation, showing that it significantly exceeds the classical limits for the same average photon number, even in the presence of dissipation. Thus, appropriate parametric modulation of the qubit not only simulates the dynamical Casimir effect but also enables the generation of nonclassical states of light that offer a metrological advantage over classical states of equivalent energy.</p>

            <p>Frequency-bin entangled photons can be efficiently produced on-chip which offers a scalable, robust and low-footprint platform for quantum communication, particularly well-suited for resource-constrained settings such as mobile or satellite-based systems. However, analyzing such entangled states typically requires active and lossy components, limiting scalability and multi-mode compatibility. We demonstrate a novel technique for processing frequency-encoded photons using linear interferometry and time-resolved detection. Our approach is fully passive and compatible with spatially multi-mode light, making it suitable for free-space and satellite to ground applications. As a proof-of-concept, we utilize frequency-bin entangled photons generated from a high-brightness multi-resonator source integrated on-chip to show the ability to perform arbitrary projective measurements over both single- and multi-mode channels. We report the first measurement of the joint temporal intensity between frequency-bin entangled photons, which allows us to certify entanglement by violating the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality, with a measured value of $|S|=2.32\pm0.05$ over multi-mode fiber. By combining time-resolved detection with energy-correlation measurements, we perform full quantum state tomography, yielding a state fidelity of up to $91\%$. We further assess our ability to produce non-classical states via a violation of time-energy entropic uncertainty relations and investigate the feasibility of a quantum key distribution protocol. Our work establishes a resource-efficient and scalable approach toward the deployment of robust frequency-bin entanglement over free-space and satellite-based links.</p>

            <h2>Light Storage and Retrieval in an Atomic Tripod System</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shan Zhong, A. J. Sudler, D. Blume, Alberto M. Marino</p>
            <p>Highly-efficient quantum memories are essential for advancing quantum information processing technologies, including scalable quantum computing and quantum networks. We experimentally demonstrate a light storage and retrieval protocol in a tripod system using an ensemble of laser-cooled $^{87}$Rb atoms. The tripod system, which consists of three ground states and an excited state, offers rich dynamics: its use to coherently store and retrieve a weak probe pulse in the $^{87}$Rb $F=1$ ground state manifold leads to the interference of two spin-wave excitations during storage time that translate to an interference in the peak intensity of the retrieved probe pulse. Our work shows that these interferences, which manifest when varying the pulse sequence or energy level structure, can be controlled experimentally by varying the storage time, optical phase, and magnetic field strength. Theoretical simulations exhibit excellent agreement with the experimental results. This work demonstrates the rich dynamics and versatile capabilities of atomic tripod systems for light storage and retrieval, with key advantages over conventional $\Lambda$-systems, highlighting the potential of atomic tripod systems for applications in quantum information processing, quantum synchronization, and atomic memory protocols.</p>

            <p>The superradiant phase transition in the dissipative Dicke lattice model, driven by on-site collective atom-photon interactions and inter-site photon hopping, is a cornerstone of nonequilibrium quantum many-body physics. However, little is still known about the influence of boundaries in experimental achievable systems of finite size. Here we investigate the dissipative superradiant phase transition in the Dicke lattice model with a small number of sites and reveal a striking sensitivity of this model to the nature of the boundary conditions. Specifically, we find that under open boundary conditions a whole zoo of superradiant phases with broken translational symmetry appears, which is not observed in the corresponding infinite lattice system. Our results demonstrate the crucial influence of boundary effects on the stationary phases of dissipative lattice models, which offers intriguing new opportunities for studying these phenomena in near term experimental realizations of such models in quantum optics and circuit QED.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Valeriia P. Kosheleva, Shahram Panahiyan, Angel Rubio, Frank Schlawin</p>
            <p>Recent advances in nanoscale and microscale photon-pair sources have enabled quantum-light-matter interactions in regimes where standard approximations, such as the paraxial limit, break down. Identifying quantum advantages in these domains requires a unified, first-principles framework that treats arbitrary quantum states of light and realistic material systems without restrictive assumptions. Here, we present a fully relativistic, beyond-paraxial theory of multiphoton ionization driven by quantum light, incorporating the full spatial structure and correlations of the field alongside material properties. As a case study, we apply the formalism to resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) of neutral sodium atoms by momentum-entangled photons. We predict cross-section enhancements of several orders of magnitude compared to coherent light, arising entirely from non-paraxial effects and vanishing in the paraxial limit. The enhancement is strongly channel-dependent, with odd multipole transitions benefiting most from favorable parity and interference conditions. The predicted enhancement is accessible with current state-of-the-art photonic and atomic technologies, highlighting a promising avenue for exploiting quantum light in high-precision ionization and spectroscopy experiments.</p>

            <p>Entanglement generation in polariton systems is fundamentally constrained by high losses and decoherence, which typically outweigh polariton nonlinearities. Here, we propose a conceptually different approach that uses optomechanical interactions, rather than polariton-polariton interactions, to generate entangled polaritons. Our double-resonant scheme relies on strong exciton-phonon coupling, found in both inorganic and molecular semiconductors, enabling room-temperature generation of spectrally disparate photon pairs. The quantum coherent and delocalized nature of polariton states inside an optical cavity ensures efficient single-mode outcoupling and allows for unconditional quantum state preparation--not relying on any post-selection or projective measurements. When conditioned on exciton-polariton emission, single phonon-polariton states can be prepared that subsequently yield bright, heralded single-photon emission in the mid-IR. We introduce a double-resonant optomechanical platform that enables scalable, room-temperature quantum polaritonics without relying on conventional excitonic nonlinearities.</p>

            <p>We propose a model of a scalable qudit-based quantum processor that uses rotational degrees of freedom of polar molecules. Entangling gates between qudits are implemented via moving molecule in optical traps by exploiting dipole-dipole interactions to mediate coherent coupling. We develop encoding schemes that map single qubits (d=2) into qudits of dimensions 2 <= d <= 5, and pairs of qubits into higher-dimensional qudits with d=4, 5. This approach enables the realization of a universal set of quantum gates. In particular, we exploit additional levels that are present in the d=3 and d=5 qudits, which allows one to simplify the decomposition of multiqubit gates. We then analyze the relevant experimental parameters to realize our schemes with SrF and 87Rb133Cs molecules. The proposed approach offers a promising route towards scalable and versatile quantum information processing with multilevel systems, which can be potentially realized using currently available experimental facilities.</p>

            <p>Ground State Energy Estimation (GSEE) is a central problem in quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics, demanding efficient algorithms to solve complex electronic structure calculations. This work introduces a structured benchmarking framework for evaluating the performance of both classical and quantum solvers on diverse GSEE problem instances. We assess three prominent methods -- Semistochastic Heat-Bath Configuration Interaction (SHCI), Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG), and Double-Factorized Quantum Phase Estimation (DF QPE) -- ighlighting their respective strengths and limitations. Our results show that fully optimized SHCI achieves near-universal solvability on the benchmark set, DMRG excels for low-entanglement systems, and DF QPE is currently constrained by hardware and algorithmic limitations. However, we observe that many benchmark Hamiltonians are drawn from datasets tailored to SHCI and related approaches, introducing a bias that favors classical solvers. To mitigate this, we propose expanding the benchmark suite to include more challenging, strongly correlated systems to enable a more balanced and forward-looking evaluation of solver capabilities. As quantum hardware and algorithms improve, this benchmarking framework will serve as a vital tool for tracking progress and identifying domains where quantum methods may surpass classical techniques.

            <p>The selection of a balanced active space is a critical step in multi-reference quantum chemistry calculations, particularly for systems with strong electron correlation. Likewise, active space selection is a key to unlock the potential of contemporary quantum computing in quantum chemistry. Albeit recent progress, there remains a lack of a unified, robust, and fully automated framework for active space selection that performs reliably across a wide range of molecular systems. In this work, we present a novel approach inspired by both the AVAS (Atomic Valence Active Space) and AutoCAS methods. Our method unifies orbital entropy analysis with atomic orbital projections to guide the construction of chemically and physically meaningful active spaces. This integrated scheme enables a more consistent and flexible selection of active orbitals while retaining automation and scalability. We validate our approach on a set of molecular systems relevant to photodynamic therapy, in particular a set of Ru(II)-complexes, selected to span increasing levels of electron correlation and structural complexity. These molecules serve as challenging test cases due to the presence of strong static correlation and the need for highly accurate electronic structure descriptions. Our results demonstrate that the method can reliably identify compact, chemically intuitive active spaces that capture the essential physics, making it suitable for both classical and quantum computational frameworks. Furthermore, we have developed this approach in a package that is intuitive to use for users and can be interfaced with both standard quantum chemistry and quantum computing applications, making it accessible to a broad research community.</p>

            <h2>Gauging the variational optimization of projected entangled-pair states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei Tang, Laurens Vanderstraeten, Jutho Haegeman</p>
            <p>Projected entangled-pair states (PEPS) constitute a powerful variational ansatz for capturing ground state physics of two-dimensional quantum systems. However, accurately computing and minimizing the energy expectation value remains challenging, in part because the impact of the gauge degrees of freedom that are present in the tensor network representation is poorly understood. We analyze the role of gauge transformations for the case of a U(1)-symmetric PEPS with point group symmetry, thereby reducing the gauge degrees of freedom to a single class. We show how gradient-based optimization strategies exploit the gauge freedom, causing the tensor network contraction to become increasingly inaccurate and to produce artificially low variational energies. Furthermore, we develop a gauge-fixed optimization strategy that largely suppresses this effect, resulting in a more robust optimization. Our study underscores the need for gauge-aware optimization strategies to guarantee reliability of variational PEPS in general settings.</p>

Proceeding in such a manner, every aspect of quantum mechanics acquires a clear physical interpretation or a logical explanation, providing, for instance, in a natural way the reason for the structure of complex algebra and the matrix structure of the formulation of Werner Heisenberg of quantum mechanics. Last but not least, the very general hypotheses assumed, allow one to state that quantum mechanics is the unique minimal description of physical reality.</p>

            <p>Proving threshold theorems for fault-tolerant quantum computation is a burdensome endeavor with many moving parts that come together in relatively formulaic but lengthy ways. It is difficult and rare to combine elements from multiple papers into a single formal threshold proof, due to the use of different measures of fault-tolerance. In this work, we introduce composable fault-tolerance, a framework that decouples the probabilistic analysis of the noise distribution from the combinatorial analysis of circuit correctness, and enables threshold proofs to compose independently analyzed gadgets easily and rigorously. Within this framework, we provide a library of standard and commonly used gadgets such as memory and logic implemented by constant-depth circuits for quantum low-density parity check codes and distillation. As sample applications, we explicitly write down a threshold proof for computation with surface code and re-derive the constant space-overhead fault-tolerant scheme of Gottesman using gadgets from this library. We expect that future fault-tolerance proofs may focus on the analysis of novel techniques while leaving the standard components to the composable fault-tolerance framework, with the formal proof following the intuitive ``napkin math'' exactly.</p>

            <h2>Can randomly structured metasurfaces be used for quantum tomography of high-dimensional spatial qudits?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuming Niu, Kai Wang</p>
            <p>Reconstructing the density matrix of the quantum state of photons through a tomographically complete set of measurements, known as quantum state tomography, is an essential task in nearly all applications of quantum science and technology, from quantum sensing to quantum communications. Recent advances in optical metasurfaces enable the design of ultra-thin nanostructured optical elements performing such state tomography tasks, promising greater simplicity, miniaturization, and scalability. However, reported metasurfaces on this goal were limited to a small Hilbert dimension, e.g., polarization qubits or spatial qudits with only a few states. When scaling up to higher-dimensional qudit tomography problems, especially those involving spatial qudits, a natural question arises: whether a metasurface with randomized nanostructures is sufficient to perform such qudit tomography, achieving optimal conditions. In this work, we attempt to answer this question through a set of numerical experiments with random metasurfaces, utilizing large-scale simulations of over 11,000 distinct metasurfaces each exceeding 200 wavelengths in size. We show that with sufficient redundancy in the number of detectors, random metasurfaces perform reasonably well in quantum photonic spatial qudit tomography encoded in Hermite-Gaussian states for up to approximately 10 states. Furthermore, we discuss additional considerations for optimizing metasurfaces in multi-photon cases. Our work opens a pathway toward computationally efficient, miniaturized, and error-tolerant quantum measurement platforms.</p>

            <p>We formulate exact sum rules (ESRs) and zeta generating formulas (ZGFs) for quantum mechanics defined by the ${\cal PT}$-symmetric potential $V_{\cal PT}(x) = x^{2K} (ix)^\varepsilon$ with $K,\varepsilon \in \mathbb{N}$, as well as the Hermitian potential $V_{\cal H}(x) = x^{2 K}$ with $K \in {\mathbb N} + 1$, based on the fusion relations of the $A_{2M-1}$ T-system in the framework of the ODE/IM correspondence. In this setup, the fusion relations on the integrable model (IM) side correspond to recurrence relations among quantization conditions on the ordinary differential equation (ODE) side, which we reformulate in terms of spectral zeta functions (SZFs), $\zeta_n(s) = \sum_{\alpha \in {\mathbb N}_0} E_{n,\alpha}^{-s}$, where $n$ denotes the fusion label. The ESRs yield algebraic relations among SZFs at fixed $n$, while the ZGFs establish explicit functional mappings between SZFs at different fusion labels. These structures are governed by a selection rule depending on both $M$ and $n$, induced in general by the combination of the structure of the Chebyshev polynomials appearing in the fusion relations and the $\mathbb{Z}_{2M+2}$ Symanzik rotational symmetry. Our results provide a novel spectral interpretation of the T-system in integrable models and point toward hidden algebraic structures governing global spectral data in $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric and Hermitian quantum mechanics.</p>

            <p>Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for producing high-fidelity data samples, yet their performance is constrained by the quality of latent representations, typically sampled from classical noise distributions. This study investigates hybrid quantum-classical GANs (HQCGANs) in which a quantum generator, implemented via parameterised quantum circuits, produces latent vectors for a classical discriminator. We evaluate a classical GAN alongside three HQCGAN variants with 3, 5, and 7 qubits, using Qiskit's AerSimulator with realistic noise models to emulate near-term quantum devices. The binary MNIST dataset (digits 0 and 1) is used to align with the low-dimensional latent spaces imposed by current quantum hardware. Models are trained for 150 epochs and assessed with Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and Kernel Inception Distance (KID). Results show that while the classical GAN achieved the best scores, the 7-qubit HQCGAN produced competitive performance, narrowing the gap in later epochs, whereas the 3-qubit model exhibited earlier convergence limitations. Efficiency analysis indicates only moderate training time increases despite quantum sampling overhead. These findings validate the feasibility of noisy quantum circuits as latent priors in GAN architectures, highlighting their potential to enhance generative modelling within the constraints of the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arash Azizi</p>
            <p>Non-Gaussian states are essential for achieving a quantum advantage in continuous-variable (CV) information processing. Among these, superpositions of squeezed states offer a rich phenomenology, yet a complete analytical understanding of their higher-order quantum statistics-such as the transition from extreme bunching ($g^{(k)} \to \infty$) to suppression ($g^{(k>2)} \to 0$)-has remained elusive. In this work, we introduce and provide an exact solution for the displaced Janus state-a coherent superposition of two squeezed coherent states. We develop a powerful analytical framework built upon a new family of Generalized Squeezing Polynomials that yields closed-form expressions for its arbitrary-order coherence functions, Wigner function, and quantum Fisher information. This enables a full characterization of the state's tunable non-Gaussianity, revealing how quantum interference can transform the extreme photon bunching of its components into strong antibunching or perfect multiphoton suppression. We identify parameter regimes that generate Wigner negativity and can be harnessed for achieving Heisenberg-limited metrological precision. Our work provides a foundational toolkit for engineering non-Gaussian states, establishing the displaced Janus state as a key resource for hybrid quantum protocols and fault-tolerant CV computation.</p>

            <p>Qubit-resolved operations and measurements are required for most current quantum information processing schemes. However, these operations can be experimentally costly due to the need for local addressing, demanding significant classical control. A more resource-efficient alternative to extract information is uniform measurement, where a site-independent rotation of qubits is performed before measuring in the computational basis. This operation can be performed in parallel, or globally, in atom- and ion-based platforms, reducing resource cost and increasing fidelity. In this work, we initiate the exploration of the utility of this operation in quantum information processing. In particular, we demonstrate that uniform measurements can certify certain graph states, a family of highly entangled and broadly useful quantum states. We provide a sample-efficient certification algorithm with a proved performance guarantee, together with an experimental scheme based on analog-mode Rydberg atom arrays. Uniform measurements, therefore, allow direct and efficient characterization of quantum states on quantum platforms in a hitherto unexplored manner.</p>

We show that this system offers excellent scaling properties, characterized by engineered zero $ZZ$-crosstalk in the idle regime, a substantial reduction of level-crowding challenges through the alternating arrangement of different qubit types within the lattice, and parameter regimes that circumvent the capacitive loading problem commonly associated with fluxoniums. In numerical simulations, we show a parametrically driven CZ-gate that achieves a closed-system infidelity that is orders of magnitude below the coherence limit for gate durations $\gtrsim 30\,\rm{ns}$ using a two-tone flux pulse on the tunable coupler. Furthermore, we show that this gate scheme retains its fidelity in the presence of spectator qubits, making it a scalable solution for large lattices. Moreover, for the implementation of error correcting codes, our approach can leverage the long coherence times and large non-linearities of fluxoniums as data qubits, while fixed-frequency transmons with established readout techniques can serve as measurement ancillas.</p>

Through analysis of the long-time dynamical behaviors of atoms and bound photons, we carry out a detailed classification of bound states and explore the connections between these dynamical behaviors and the system's intrinsic light-matter interactions. The system supports static bound states with persistent atomic excitations, and oscillating bound states with periodic atom-photon or atom-atom excitation exchange. Under certain conditions, oscillating bound states can contain more harmonic components owing to the emergence of additional quasi-dark modes, rendering them promising platforms for high-capacity quantum information processing. These findings advance the understanding of BIC in waveguide quantum electrodynamics with multiple giant atoms and reveal their prospective applications in quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Discovery of energy landscapes towards optimized quantum transport: Environmental effects and long-range tunneling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maggie Lawrence, Matthew Pocrnic, Erin Fung, Juan Carrasquilla, Erik M. Gauger, Dvira Segal</p>
            <p>Carrier transport in quantum networks is governed by a variety of factors, including network dimensionality and connectivity, on-site energies, couplings between sites and whether they are short- or long-range, and environmental effects. In this work, we identify classes of quasi-one-dimensional chains with energy profiles that optimize carrier transport under such influences. Specifically, we optimize on-site energies using Optax's optimistic gradient descent and AdaMax algorithms, enabled by the JAX automatic differentiation framework. Focusing on steady-state transport, we study the system's behavior under combined unitary and nonunitary (dephasing and dissipative) effects using the Lindblad quantum master equation. After validating our optimization scheme on short chains, we extend the study to larger systems where we identify systematic patterns in energy profiles. Our analysis reveals that different types of energy landscape enhance transport, depending on whether inter-site tunneling couplings in the chain are short- or long-range, the existence of environmental interactions, and the temperature of the environment. Our classification and insights of optimal energy landscapes offer guidance for designing efficient transport systems for electronic, photovoltaic and quantum communication applications.</p>

            <h2>Lifshitz-like Metastability and Optimal Dephasing in Dissipative Bosonic Lattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stefano Longhi</p>
            <p>In dissipative bosonic systems, dephasing is typically expected to accelerate relaxation and suppress coherent dynamics. However, we show that in networks of coherently coupled bosonic modes with non-uniform local dissipation, the presence of quasi-dark states leads to a nontrivial response to dephasing: while weak dephasing facilitates equilibration, moderate to strong dephasing induces a pronounced slowdown of relaxation, revealing the existence of an optimal dephasing rate that enhances equilibration. Using exact dynamical equations for second-order moments, we demonstrate that dephasing suppresses coherent transport and gives rise to long-lived collective modes that dominate the system's late-time behavior. This phenomenon bears striking similarities to Lifshitz-tail states, which are known in disordered systems to cause anomalously slow relaxation. Our results uncover a counterintuitive mechanism by which dephasing, rather than promoting equilibration, can dynamically decouple specific modes from dissipation, thereby protecting excitations. These findings highlight how non-Hermitian physics in open bosonic systems can give rise to unexpected dynamical regimes, paving the way for new strategies to control relaxation and decoherence in bosonic quantum systems, with broad implications for both experimental and theoretical quantum science.</p>

            <h2>Hybrid Optomechanical Cooling with Kerr Magnons and Squeezed Vacuum</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiao-Hong Fan, Qin-Geng Chen, Jiaojiao Chen, Wei Xiong</p>
            <p>Ground-state cooling is essential for accessing the quantum regime and enabling quantum control of macroscopic systems. However, achieving optomechanical cooling in the unresolved-sideband regime ($\omega_b < \kappa$) remains challenging. In this Letter, we propose an efficient cooling strategy based on a hybrid optomechanical system incorporating a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere embedded in an optomechanical cavity. Under strong cavity driving, the Kerr nonlinearity of the magnons hosted in the YIG sphere gives rise to a two-magnon process. Adiabatic elimination of the magnons yields an effective two-photon process in the cavity, which destructively interferes with all dissipative channels, surpassing the quantum backaction limit and enabling \textit{complete suppression} of heating under optimal conditions, even in the deeply unresolved sideband regime (DUSR: $\omega_b \ll \kappa$). Moreover, injecting squeezed vacuum noise into the cavity not only preserves these advantages but also delivers additional enhancements, including higher net cooling rates, reduced optomechanical coupling requirements, and improved noise robustness. Comparative analysis shows that our approach outperforms existing schemes without Kerr magnons, underscoring the potential of integrating nonlinear magnonics with optomechanics for quantum control of macroscopic mechanical systems.</p>

            <p>We study the quantum statistics of single-mode radiation emitted by an atomic ensemble when the ensemble is initially prepared in a superradiant Dicke state. We show that while the radiation is well approximated by the Glauber coherent state at early times in the evolution, the emission can be truly quantum at later times. In particular, one can observe a large amount of photon-number squeezing in the emission under certain conditions; even a Fock state can be produced. We discuss the quantum statistics of the emission for various parameters, including different initial conditions for the atomic ensemble. To obtain these results, we have developed a formalism where we are able to calculate the quantum statistics of the emission over long time-scales even when the number of atoms in the ensemble is quite large.</p>

            <p>We investigate entanglement mediated by DC current induced nonreciprocal graphene plasmon polaritons. Nonreciprocal systems are ideal for the enhancement, control, and preservation of entanglement due to the potential for unidirectional beam-like wave propagation, i.e., efficiently transporting photons from one emitter to another. Using a quantum master equation and three-dimensional Green's function analysis, we investigate a system consisting of two two-level emitters dominantly interacting via electric current induced nonreciprocal plasmonic modes of a graphene waveguide. We use concurrence as a measure of entanglement. We show that nonreciprocal graphene plasmon polaritons are a promising candidate to generate and mediate concurrence, where it is shown that there is good enhancement and control of entanglement over vacuum, which is beneficial for the broad applications of entanglement as a quantum resource. We believe our findings contribute to the development of quantum devices, enabling efficient and tunable entanglement between two-level systems, which is a central goal in quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>Quantum computing with discrete variable (DV, qubit) hardware is approaching the large scales necessary for computations beyond the reach of classical computers. However, important use cases such as quantum simulations of physical models containing bosonic modes, and quantum error correction are challenging for DV-only systems. Separately, hardware containing native continuous-variable (CV, oscillator) systems has received attention as an alternative approach, yet the universal control of such systems is non-trivial. In this work, we show that hybrid CV-DV hardware offers a great advantage in meeting these challenges, offering a powerful computational paradigm that inherits the strengths of both DV and CV processors. We provide a pedagogical introduction to CV-DV systems and the multiple abstraction layers needed to produce a full software stack connecting applications to hardware. We present a variety of new hybrid CV-DV compilation techniques, algorithms, and applications, including the extension of quantum signal processing concepts to CV-DV systems and strategies to simulate systems of interacting spins, fermions, and bosons. To facilitate the development of hybrid CV-DV processor systems, we introduce formal Abstract Machine Models and Instruction Set Architectures -- essential abstractions that enable developers to formulate applications, compile algorithms, and explore the potential of current and future hardware for realizing fault-tolerant circuits, modules, and processors. Hybrid CV-DV quantum computations are beginning to be performed in superconducting, trapped ion, and neutral atom platforms, and large-scale experiments are set to be demonstrated in the near future. We present a timely and comprehensive guide to this relatively unexplored yet promising approach to quantum computation and providing an architectural backbone to guide future development.</p>

            <p>Simulations of collisions of fundamental particles on a quantum computer are expected to have an exponential advantage over classical methods and promise to enhance searches for new physics. Furthermore, scattering in scalar field theory has been shown to be BQP-complete, making it a representative problem for which quantum computation is efficient. As a step toward large-scale quantum simulations of collision processes, scattering of wavepackets in one-dimensional scalar field theory is simulated using 120 qubits of IBM's Heron superconducting quantum computer ibm_fez. Variational circuits compressing vacuum preparation, wavepacket initialization, and time evolution are determined using classical resources. By leveraging physical properties of states in the theory, such as symmetries and locality, the variational quantum algorithm constructs scalable circuits that can be used to simulate arbitrarily-large system sizes. A new strategy is introduced to mitigate errors in quantum simulations, which enables the extraction of meaningful results from circuits with up to 4924 two-qubit gates and two-qubit gate depths of 103. The effect of interactions is clearly seen, and is found to be in agreement with classical Matrix Product State simulations. The developments that will be necessary to simulate high-energy inelastic collisions on a quantum computer are discussed.</p>

            <h2>Doubly-polylog-time-overhead fault-tolerant quantum computation by a polylog-time parallel minimum-weight perfect matching decoder</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yugo Takada, Hayata Yamasaki</p>
            <p>Reducing space and time overheads of fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC) has been receiving increasing attention as it is crucial for the development of quantum computers and also plays a fundamental role in understanding the feasibility and limitations of realizing quantum advantages. Shorter time overheads are particularly essential for demonstrating quantum computational speedups without compromising runtime advantages. However, surpassing the conventional polylogarithmic (polylog) scaling of time overheads has remained a significant challenge, since it requires addressing all potential bottlenecks, including the nonzero runtime of classical computation for decoding in practical implementations. In this work, we construct a protocol that achieves FTQC with doubly polylog time overhead while maintaining the conventional polylog space overhead. The key to our approach is the development of a highly parallelizable minimum-weight perfect matching (MWPM) decoder, which achieves a polylog parallel runtime in terms of the code size while providing theoretical guarantees on threshold existence and overhead bounds. Our protocol integrates this decoder with a topological-code protocol that incorporates single-shot decoding for efficient syndrome extraction; furthermore, we concatenate this with the concatenated Steane codes to guarantee the existence of the threshold while avoiding a backlog problem, enabling us to achieve doubly polylog time overheads even when accounting for the decoder's runtime. These results suggest the feasibility of surpassing the conventional polylog-time-overhead barrier, opening a new frontier in low-overhead FTQC.</p>

            <h2>Non-Perturbative Topological Gadgets for Many-Body Coupling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Headley, Nicholas Chancellor</p>
            <p>Continuous-time quantum hardware implementations generally lack the native capability to implement high-order terms that would facilitate efficient compilation of quantum algorithms. This limitation has, in part, motivated the development of perturbative gadgets -- multi-qubit constructions used to effect a desired Hamiltonian using engineered low-energy subspaces of a larger system constructed using simpler, usually two-body, primitives. In this work, we demonstrate how a class of non-perturbative gadgets can produce high-order multi-body interactions by taking advantage of the odd-even properties of topological defect subspaces. The simplest example is based on domain-wall defects forming an effective Ising spin-chain based on three-body coupling with linear connectivity, alongside three-, or five-body driving terms depending on the intended use. Although this will be the main focus of the paper due to conceptual simplicity, there exist systems constructed with only two-body couplings where the boundaries determine whether there are an odd or even number of defects, namely ice-like systems which may yield more complex gadget-like constructions.</p>

            <p>The creation of large-scale, high-fidelity quantum computers is not only a fundamental scientific endeavour in itself, but also provides increasingly robust proofs of quantum computational advantage (QCA) in the presence of unavoidable noise and the dynamic competition with classical algorithm improvements. To overcome the biggest challenge of photon-based QCA experiments, photon loss, we report new Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) experiments with 1024 high-efficiency squeezed states injected into a hybrid spatial-temporal encoded, 8176-mode, programmable photonic quantum processor, Jiuzhang 4.0, which produces up to 3050 photon detection events. Our experimental results outperform all classical spoofing algorithms, particularly the matrix product state (MPS) method, which was recently proposed to utilise photon loss to reduce the classical simulation complexity of GBS. Using the state-of-the-art MPS algorithm on the most powerful supercomputer EI Capitan, it would take > $10^{42}$ years to construct the required tensor network for simulation, while our Jiuzhang 4.0 quantum computer takes 25.6 $\mu$s to produce a sample.

            <p>Optically addressed atomic defects in the solid-state are widely used as single-photon sources and memories for quantum network applications. The solid-state environment allows for a high density of electron and nuclear spins with the potential to form registers for coherent information processing. However, it is challenging to reliably address individual spins at nanometer separations where interactions are large. Rare-earth ions offer a unique solution, as their narrow homogeneous optical linewidth allows frequency-domain resolution of a large number of emitters without regard to their spatial separation. In this work, we realize coherent optical and spin control of a pair of interacting Er$^{3+}$ ions, together with a nearby nuclear spin ancilla. We demonstrate two-qubit electron-electron gates and use them to perform repeated quantum non-demolition measurements on one of the Er$^{3+}$ ions. We also demonstrate electron-nuclear gates to allow coherent storage and retrieval of qubit information in a nuclear spin, and show that the nuclear spin coherence survives readout of the electron spin. These techniques can be readily scaled to larger numbers of electron and nuclear spins, paving the way for massively multiplexed quantum network nodes.</p>

            <p>We study the quantum Newman-Moore model, or quantum triangular plaquette model (qTPM), in the presence of a longitudinal field (qTPMz). We present evidence that indicates that the ground state phase diagram of the qTPMz includes various frustrated phases breaking translational symmetries, dependent on the specific sequence of system sizes used to take the large-size limit. This phase diagram includes the known first-order phase transition of the qTPM, but also additional first-order transitions due to the frustrated phases. Using the average longitudinal magnetization as an order parameter, we analyze the magnetization plateaus that characterize the ground state phases, describe their degeneracies, and obtain the qTPMz phase diagram using classical transfer matrix and quantum matrix product state techniques. We identify a region of parameter space which can be effectively described by a Rydberg blockade model on the triangular lattice and also find indications of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order connecting the quantum paramagnetic and classical frustrated phases.</p>

            <p>The dynamical trajectory of a dissipative Rydberg many-body system could be flipped under a microwave field driving, displaying an enhanced sensitivity. This is because the intersection of the folded hysteresis trajectories exhibits a sharp peak near the phase transition, amplifying the response to small changes in the microwave field. Here, we demonstrate an experiment of enhanced metrology through flipping the hysteresis trajectory in a cold atomic system, displaying an approach to improve sensitivity near the gap-closing points. By measuring the intersection points of hysteresis trajectories versus Rabi frequency of the microwave field, we quantify the equivalent sensitivity to be 1.6(5) nV cm-1 Hz-1/2. The measurement is also dependent on the interaction time, optical depth and principal quantum number since the long-range interaction between Rydberg atoms could dramatically change the shape of hysteresis trajectories. The reported results suggest that flipping trajectory features in cold Rydberg many-body systems could advance sensing and metrology applications.</p>

            <h2>Untwisted and Twisted RÃ©nyi Negativities: Toward a RÃ©nyi Proxy for Logarithmic Negativity in Fermionic Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fo-Hong Wang, Xiao Yan Xu</p>
            <p>Entanglement entropy is a fundamental measure of quantum entanglement for pure states, but for large-scale many-body systems, RÃ©nyi entanglement entropy is much more computationally accessible. For mixed states, logarithmic negativity (LN) serves as a widely used entanglement measure, but its direct computation is often intractable, leaving RÃ©nyi negativity (RN) as the practical alternative. In fermionic systems, RN is further classified into untwisted and twisted types, depending on the definition of the fermionic partial transpose. However, which of these serves as the true RÃ©nyi proxy for LN has remained unclear -- until now. In this work, we address this question by developing a robust quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) method to compute both untwisted and twisted RNs, focusing on the rank-4 twisted RN, where non-trivial behavior emerges. We identify and overcome two major challenges: the singularity of the Green's function matrix and the exponentially large variance of RN estimators. Our method is demonstrated in the Hubbard model and the spinless $t$-$V$ model, revealing critical distinctions between untwisted and twisted RNs, as well as between rank-2 and high-rank RNs. Remarkably, we find that the twisted RÃ©nyi negativity ratio (RNR) adheres to the area law and decreases monotonically with temperature, in contrast to the untwisted RNR but consistent with prior studies of bosonic systems. This study not only establishes the twisted RNR as a more pertinent RÃ©nyi proxy for LN in fermionic systems but also provides comprehensive technical details for the stable and efficient computation of high-rank RNs. Our work lays the foundation for future studies of mixed-state entanglement in large-scale fermionic many-body systems.</p>

            <p>The fuzzy onion model formed by connecting a set of concentric fuzzy spheres of increasing radius is motivated by studies of quantum space but can also be used to study standard physics. The main feature of the model is that functions in three-dimensional space -- like scalar fields or wavefunctions -- are expressed in terms of Hermitian matrices of a certain structure. Relevant equations are then matrix equations, and some problems, such as searching for the energy spectrum for fixed quantum numbers $(l,m)$, can be expressed as an eigenvalue problem. We show how this simple approach can reproduce the results of other studies analyzing the hydrogen atom in a spherical cavity. We also test the effect of the short-distance quantum structure of the space on these solutions -- not looking for the phenomenological consequences, as the scale of quantum space is many orders below the order of the Bohr radius, but to understand the effect of quantum space in general. We observe a set of solutions without a classical counterpart which have been suggested also in a former theoretical study.</p>

            <p>Single neutral atoms in optical tweezer arrays offer a promising platform for high-fidelity quantum computing at local nodes. Nonetheless, creating entanglement between remote nodes in a distributed quantum network remains challenging due to inherently weak atom-light coupling. Here, we design a distributed quantum network architecture in which cold atomic ensembles with strong atom-light interactions act as quantum antennas, interfacing single-atom qubits with flying photons to enable high-efficiency atom-photon entanglement generation -- analogous to the role of antennas in classical communication. Using realistic experimental parameters, we estimate an efficiency of $\eta \simeq 0.548$ for generating atom-photon entanglement, a probability of $P_{E} \simeq 6 \%$ for generating atom-atom entanglement, and a remote entanglement generation rate of $16.6 $ kHz. This performance not only surpasses that of state-of-the-art cavity-based or high-numerical-aperture-lens-based architectures but also offers notable advantages in simplicity, tunability, and experimental accessibility. Our scheme also integrates a long-lived quantum memory, providing a storage advantage for quantum repeater design. By leveraging the complementary strengths of single-atom qubits for local operations and cold atomic ensembles for networking, this approach paves the way for scalable distributed quantum computing and sensing.</p>

We demonstrate the split spectroscopy exhibits a single delta-function peak if and only if the investigated eigenstate is triseparable. Our framework is illustrated using two paradigmatic spin models that undergo quantum phase transitions. Furthermore, we show that the spectral entropy serves as a powerful indicator of quantum phase transitions and captures the scaling behavior of entanglement.

            <p>In this study, the energy spectrum and thermal equilibrium states of the finite-size Dicke-Stark model were numerically obtained within the extended coherent state space by solving the dressed master equation for strongly coupled light-atom systems. The critical point of the superradiant phase transition in the infinite-size Dicke-Stark model was analytically derived using the mean-field approach and confirmed with numerical calculation. Under thermal equilibrium conditions, analyses of the negativity, zero-time-delay two-photon correlation function, and atom-spin squeezing parameters in the finite-size Dicke-Stark model reveal that as the coupling strength increases, the light field undergoes a transition from photon bunching to anti-bunching and then back to bunching. The Stark field can modulate both the maximum and minimum values of the two-photon correlation function and their corresponding coupling strengths. At low temperatures, the system exhibits entanglement and spin squeezing. As temperature rises, entanglement gradually diminishes, while strong coupling facilitates the preservation of entanglement in the system state. Atom-spin squeezing spin squeezing is highly sensitive to temperature and vanishes rapidly with increasing temperature. This work contributes to the fundamental understanding of quantum phenomena in Dicke-Stark systems.</p>

In this work, we show that attosecond interferometry experiments can be seen as a weak measurement, which unveils how this notion is connected to strong field physics and attosecond science. In particular, we show how the electron trajectory picks up a new phase, which occurs due to the weak measurement of the process. This phase can show significant contributions in the presence of spectral features of the measured system. Furthermore, extending this approach to include non-classical driving fields shows that the generated harmonics exhibit non-trivial features in their quantum state and photon statistics. This opens the path towards investigations of attosecond quantum interferometry experiments.</p>

            <h2>Waveguide quantum electrodynamics at the onset of spin-spin correlations</h2>

            <p>We explore the competition between light-mediated and intrinsic matter-matter interactions in waveguide quantum electrodynamics. For this, we couple a superconducting transmission line to a model magnetic material, made of organic free radical molecules with a spin $S=1/2$ and a $g_{S}$ factor very close to that of a free electron. The microwave transmission has been measured in a wide range of temperatures ($0.013$ K $\leq T \leq 2$ K), magnetic fields ($0\leq B \leq 0.5$ T) and frequencies ($0 \leq \omega/2 \pi \leq 14$ GHz). We find that molecules belonging to one of the two crystal sublattices form one-dimensional spin chains. Temperature then controls the intrinsic correlations along these chains in a continuous and monotonic way. In the paramagnetic region ($T > 0.7$ K), the microwave transmission shows evidences for the collective coupling of quasi-identical spins to the propagating photons, with coupling strengths that reach values close to the dissipation rates. As $T$ decreases, the growth of spin correlations, combined with the anisotropy in the spin-spin exchange constants, tend to suppress the collective spin-photon coupling. In this regime, the spin visibility in transmission reflects also a gradual change in the nature of the dominant spin excitations, from single spin flips to bosonic magnons.</p>

            <h2>Sub-Poissonian Light in a Waveguide Kerr-medium</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> R. Singh, A. E. Teretenkov, A. V. Masalov</p>
            <p>Waveguides on a chip represent a new medium for implementing nonlinear optical transformations of light. Modern $\text{Si}_3\text{N}_4$ chip waveguides are attractive due to their high Kerr nonlinearity, suppressed Brillouin scattering on guided acoustic waves (GAWBS), and lengths up to one meter. The capabilities of waveguides for generating sub-Poissonian light in the form of a displaced Kerr state are analyzed. We offer new analytical formulas for estimating the capabilities of suppressing photon fluctuations of a displaced Kerr state for any value of input light amplitude. The results of numerical calculations are presented. It is shown that the degree of photon noise suppression can reach values of 5 - 15 dB with 100 mW light power in waveguides a few meters long.</p>

            <h2>Learning to stabilize nonequilibrium phases of matter with active feedback using partial information</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giovanni Cemin, Markus Schmitt, Marin Bukov</p>
            <p>We investigate the role of information in active feedback control of quantum many-body systems using reinforcement learning. Active feedback breaks detailed balance, enabling the engineering of steady states and dynamical phases of matter otherwise inaccessible in equilibrium. We train reinforcement learning agents using partial state information to prevent entanglement spreading in (1+1)-dimensional stabilizer circuits with up to 128 qubits. We find that, above a critical information threshold, learned near-optimal strategies are non-greedy, stochastic, and reduce volume-law entangled steady states to area-law scaling. The agents achieve this by placing a series of bottlenecks that induce pyramidal structures in the long-time spatial entanglement distribution, which effectively split the system and reduce the maximum accessible entanglement. Crucially, learned strategies are inherently out of equilibrium and require real-time active feedback; we find that the learned behavior cannot be replaced by simple human-designed control rules. This work establishes the foundations for classically implemented, information-driven individual control of many interacting quantum degrees of freedom, demonstrating the capabilities of reinforcement learning to stabilize and uncover novel critical properties of many-body nonequilibrium steady states.</p>

            <h2>Nondegenerate Josephson Mixers with Enhanced Bandwidth and Saturation Power for Quantum Signal Amplification and Transduction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Baleegh Abdo, Dongbing Shao, Shayne Cairns, Jae-woong Nah, Oblesh Jinka, Srikanth Srinivasan, Thomas McConkey, Vincent Arena, Corrado Mancini</p>
            <p>Nondegenerate Josephson mixers (JMs), formed by coupling two different transmission-line resonators to Josephson ring modulators (JRMs), are vital and versatile devices capable of processing microwave signals at the quantum limit. Owing to the lossless nondegenerate three-wave mixing process enabled by the JRM, JMs can perform phase preserving amplification of quantum signals, generate two-mode squeezed states, and perform noiseless frequency conversion. However, due to their limited bandwidth and saturation power, such resonator-based JMs are generally unable to simultaneously process frequency-multiplexed signals required in large quantum processors. To overcome this longstanding dual challenge, we redesign the JRM parameters by optimizing its inductances to suppress higher order mixing products and engineer its electromagnetic environment by incorporating lumped-element coupled-mode networks between the JRM and the two distinct ports of the JM. By implementing these strategies, we measure for JMs realized with four coupled modes per port, operated in amplification (conversion), bandwidths of about 400 MHz (700 MHz) with power reflections above 10 dB (below -10 dB) and saturation powers of about -110 dBm at 15 dB (-91 dBm at -26 dB). Similarly, we demonstrate for a low external quality factor resonant-mode JM operated in conversion, a maximum bandwidth of about $670$ MHz with power reflections below -10 dB and a maximum saturation power of about -86 dBm at -17 dB. Such nondegenerate JMs with enhanced bandwidths and saturation powers could serve in a variety of frequency-multiplexed settings ranging from high fidelity qubit readout and unidirectional routing of quantum signals to generation of remote entanglement with continuous variables.</p>

            <p>Many quantum networking applications require efficient photonic interfaces to quantum memories which can be produced at scale and with high yield. Synthetic diamond offers unique potential for the implementation of this technology as it hosts color centers which retain coherent optical interfaces and long spin coherence times in nanophotonic structures. Here, we report a technique enabling wafer-scale processing of thin-film diamond that combines ion implantation and membrane liftoff, high-quality overgrowth, targeted color center implantation, and serial, high-throughput thermocompression bonding with yields approaching unity. The deterministic deposition of thin diamond membranes onto semiconductor substrates facilitates consistent integration of photonic crystal cavities with silicon-vacancy (SiV) quantum memories. We demonstrate reliable, strong coupling of SiVs to photons with cooperativities approaching 100. Furthermore, we show that photonic crystal cavities can be reliably fabricated across several membranes bonded to the same handling chip. Our platform enables modular fabrication where the photonic layer can be integrated with functionalized substrates featuring electronic control lines such as coplanar waveguides for microwave delivery. Finally, we implement passive optical packaging with sub-decibel insertion loss. Together, these advances pave the way to the scalable assembly of optically addressable quantum memory arrays which are a key building block for modular photonic quantum interconnects.</p>

            <h2>Rotation Errors Due to Field Quantization for Simultaneously Driven Atoms</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hunter Lindemann, Shanon Vuglar, Julio Gea-Banacloche</p>
            <p>When an electromagnetic field in a coherent or quasiclassical (e.g., squeezed) state is used to simultaneously drive an ensemble of two-level atoms, the quantum nature of the field will, in general, cause the final state of the atoms to differ from the one predicted for a totally classical field. This is a potential source of error in quantum logic gates in which the gate is the rotation of the atoms by a laser. In this paper, we use second order perturbation theory to find how this error scales with the number of atoms, $N$, being driven simultaneously, for an arbitrary rotation angle. The result depends on the initial atomic state: for some highly entangled states, and a field in a coherent state, the error may scale as $N^2$, yet we find that the average over a random distribution of initial states only scales as $N$. We discuss possible ways to mitigate the error, including the use of squeezed states, as well as adjusting the interaction time between the field and atoms to be different from what would be expected from the classical-field treatment.</p>

            <h2>Squeezed Magnons-Induced Nonreciprocal Entanglement in a Magnomechanical Cavity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ziyad Imara, Khadija El Anouz, Ä°lkay Demir, Abderrahim El Allati</p>
            <p>Magnomechanical cavities offer a new frontier in quantum electrodynamics that give rise to several significant theoretical and experimental results. In this paper, we propose a novel theoretical mechanism for achieving a nonreciprocal macroscopic entanglement between magnons, photons and phonons, based on the use of an alternative squeezed magnons method. Indeed, in contrast to conventional approaches, we show how precise control of the amplitude and phase of the squeezed mode allows to obtain a tunable nonreciprocity of entanglement. The magnons resulting from the collective motion of the spin in a macroscopic ferrimagnet become coupled to the microwave photons via magnetic dipole interaction and to the phonons via magnetostrictive interaction. Moreover, we establish that the proposed scheme achieves ideal nonreciprocity, which can be optimized by cavity-magnon coupling and bath temperature control. Finally, by using the parameters that are experimentally feasible with current technologies, this work provides new perspectives for hybrid magnon-based quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>Non-phase-matched spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) in atomically thin materials provides new degrees of freedom and enhanced quantum information capacity compared to conventional phase-matched sources. These systems emerged as promising platforms for quantum computing, communication, and imaging, with the potential to support higher-order nonlinear processes. However, direct observation of photon-pair emission from a monolayer has remained experimentally challenging. In this work, we theoretically modeled SPDC emission across the full angular space from a monolayer GaSe film and experimentally validated the model through measurements of both co- and counter-propagating photon pairs. We demonstrated two-photon quantum correlations in the telecom C-band from the thinnest SPDC source reported to date. The spatially symmetric, broadband emission predicted by theory was confirmed experimentally. Furthermore, we observed high-fidelity Bell states in the counter-propagating configuration, marking the first realization of polarization-entangled photon pairs from a monolayer. Our results revealed the emission characteristics of SPDC in the deeply subwavelength, non-phase-matched regime, and introduced atomically thin, counterpropagating SPDC as a scalable and integrable platform for programmable quantum state generation, extendable via moirÃ© superlattice engineering.</p>

            <h2>Optimal Quantum Estimation with Stabilizer-Based Local Measurements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jia-Xuan Liu, Hai-Long Shi, Chunfeng Wu, Sixia Yu</p>
            <p>A central challenge in quantum metrology is to identify optimal protocols under measurement constraints that reflect realistic experimental conditions, e.g., local measurements in multipartite scenarios. Here, we present a sufficient criterion for metrological schemes to saturate the quantum CramÃ©r-Rao bound (QCRB) using local measurements, based on stabilizer formalism. In ideal settings, we show that graph states always admit local estimation protocols with an optimal estimation precision determined only by the underlying graph structure. A family of graph states is identified as probe states that achieve suboptimal precision scaling. In noisy environments, we construct several subspaces of probe states (mixed in general) that not only saturate the QCRB with local measurements but also maintain approximately invariant precision scaling. These subspaces offer multiple metrological advantages, including high precision, partial noise resilience, and noise-correcting capability prior to parameter encoding. Under dephasing noise, they exhibit markedly better performance than Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states. Our results advance the framework for local-measurement quantum metrology, achieving a robust trade-off between precision and noise tolerance.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tom Schmit, Catalin-Mihai Halati, Tobias Donner, Giovanna Morigi, Simon B. JÃ¤ger</p>
            <p>Quantum gases of atoms and molecules in optical cavities offer a formidable laboratory for studying the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of long-range interacting systems. Multiple scattering of cavity photons mediate interactions, and the emerging phases of matter are determined by the interplay of photon-mediated forces, dissipation, and quantum and thermal fluctuations. Control of these dynamics requires a detailed understanding of the mechanisms at play. Due to the number of degrees of freedom, however, effective theoretical models often work in specific limits, where either the cavity field is treated as a semiclassical variable or the cavity state is a slightly perturbed vacuum state. In this work, we present the derivation of an effective Lindblad master equation for the dynamics of the sole motional variables of polarizable particles, such as atoms or molecules, that dispersively couple to the cavity field. The master equation is valid even for relatively large intracavity photon numbers, and is apt to study both the steady-state regime and the out-of-equilibrium dynamics where quantum fluctuations of the field seed the onset of macroscopic coherences. We validate the theoretical description by showing that it captures the dynamics across a wide temperature interval, from Doppler cooling down to the ultra-cold regime, and from weak to strong cavity-mediated interactions. Our theory provides a powerful framework for the description of the dynamics of quantum gases in cavities and permits, amongst others, to connect models and hypotheses of statistical mechanics with a versatile experimental platform.</p>

            <h2>$\bf A^2$-robust superradiant phase transition in hybrid qubit-cavity optomechanics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gang Liu, Wei Xiong</p>
            <p>The $\mathbf{A}^2$ term presents a fundamental challenge to realizing the superradiant phase transition (SPT) in cavity quantum electrodynamics. Here, we propose a hybrid quantum system enabling SPT regardless of the presence of the $\mathbf{A}^2$ term. The system consisting of a qubit, a mechanical mode, and an optical cavity, where the qubit and mechanical mode constitute a quantum Rabi model, while the mechanical mode and cavity form an optomechanical system. Crucially, the auxiliary cavity introduces a switchable $\mathbf{A}^2$ term that effectively counteracts or even fully eliminates the original $\mathbf{A}^2$ effect. This allows controllable observation of SPT, diagnosed via the second-order equal-time correlation function $g^{(2)}(0)$ of phonons. Furthermore, the auxiliary cavity exponentially reduces the critical coupling strength, significantly relaxing experimental requirements. Besides, we show that phonons in the normal phase are bunching, but coherent in the superradiant phase. Interestly, higher-order squeezing is found in both phases, with near-perfect higher-order squeezing achieved at SPT point, establishing it as a probe for SPT behavior. Our work demonstrates that hybridizing optomechanics and cavity quantum electrodynamics provides a promising route to accessing SPT physics in the presence of the $\mathbf{A}^2$ term.</p>

            <p>Quantum electrodynamics (QED), a cornerstone framework that describes light-matter interactions rooted in Abelian symmetries, renders the harnessing of synthetic non-Abelian gauge fields as a fundamental yet uncharted frontier. Here, we develop a general theory of light-matter interaction of quantum emitters embedded in non-Abelian photonic lattices. Based on analytical solutions to the non-Abelian Landau dressed states beyond the continuum limit, we reveal chiral photon emission and vortices with emergent nonreciprocity enabled by selective coupling between emitters and spin-momentum-locked bands. When coexisting with Abelian and non-Abelian magnetic fields, emitters hybridize with Landau dressed orbits to form spin-polarized, squeezed Landau polaritons that carry quantized angular momenta, with Rabi frequencies tunable via Landau levels and pseudospin interactions. Multi-emitter dynamics further exhibit collective phenomena governed by real-space staggered phases induced by nonsymmorphic crystalline symmetry. These results bridge non-Abelian physics with quantum optics, and establish non-Abelian gauge fields as a versatile tool for synthesizing topological quantum optical states, angular momentum transfer, and controlling photon-mediated correlations in QED systems, relevant for applications in quantum simulations and chiral quantum optical networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akihiko Sekine, Ryo Murakami, Yoshiyasu Doi</p>
            <p>The quantum transduction, or equivalently quantum frequency conversion, between microwave and optical photons is essential for realizing scalable quantum computers with superconducting qubits. Due to the large frequency difference between microwave and optical ranges, the transduction needs to be done via intermediate bosonic modes or nonlinear processes. Regarding the transduction mediated by magnons, previous studies have so far utilized ferromagnetic magnons in ferromagnets. Here, we formulate a theory for the microwave-to-optical quantum transduction mediated by antiferromagnetic magnons in antiferromagnets. We derive analytical expressions for the transduction efficiency in the cases with and without an optical cavity, where a microwave cavity is used in both cases. In contrast to the case of the quantum transduction using ferromagnets, we find that the quantum transduction can occur even in the absence of an external static magnetic field. We also find that, in the case with an optical cavity the transduction efficiency takes a peak structure with respect to the sample thickness, indicating that there exists an optimal thickness, whereas in the case without an optical cavity the transduction efficiency is a monotonically increasing function of the sample thickness. Our study opens up a way for possible applications of antiferromagnetic materials in future quantum interconnects.</p>

            <p>We investigate how low-frequency gravitational waves (LFGWs), originating from distant astrophysical or cosmological sources, can induce purely quantum geometric phases in mesoscopic optomechanical systems. These phases represent subtle imprints with no classical counterpart, going beyond standard dynamical or Berry-type contributions that admit Hannay-angle analogues. Such ultra-weak waves couple to the motion of a mechanical mirror and generate distinctive phase shifts in the system's quantum state that cannot arise in any classical description. To access this effect, we propose a Ramsey-type interferometric protocol in which the photon-number states of a quantized optical mode become entangled with the mirror's center-of-mass motion, enabling a direct readout of the LFGW-induced geometric phase. This framework establishes a distinctly quantum approach for probing low-frequency gravitational wave modes, offering an alternative to conventional detection strategies based on spacetime strain.</p>

Here we demonstrate sideband-resolved diamond OMCs with mechanical quality factors in excess of $10^6$ at cryogenic temperatures, and find coherence times up to $T_2$ = 270 $\mu$s for embedded nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers. Furthermore, we measure these devices across five orders of magnitude in intracavity optical power, demonstrating robust power handling and a high optomechanical cooperativity ($C\gg1$) at cryogenic temperatures that is essential for a broad range of quantum protocols requiring strong, coherent interactions between photons and phonons.

            <p>Recently, it was shown that quantum interference in a system containing a polarized and unpolarized emitter can allow directional emission of photons into a circulating cavity. Here, we ask whether high directionality of photon emission in this system implies a high degree of quantum correlation between the two emitters. We show that the answer is a qualified "yes", with photon emission directionality and emitter-emitter entanglement showing a monotonic relationship over a broad parameter range. The relationship only breaks down in the limit of perfect directionality. Furthermore, under reasonable assumptions for experimental parameters and stability, we show that the statistics of measured directionality allow a reliable estimate of the concurrence. This result implies that directionality of photon emission in the state preparation stage can be used to determine the entanglement between the emitters, with potential applications to more generic cases including quantum networks.</p>

            <p>Optical switching remains a key outstanding challenge for scalable fault-tolerant photonic quantum computing due to the trade-off between speed, bandwidth, and loss. Scalable quantum photonics demands all three, to enable high computational clock rates and resource efficient scaling to large systems. We present a cavity-based optical switch that overcomes this limitation, demonstrating 22 ns rise time, insertion loss of 2.4 dB, and 17.5 dB extinction ratio. All-optical control is achieved via phase modulation of a signal field detuned from the near-degenerate two-photon absorption ladder in warm rubidium vapor. The ultimate performance of our switch, combining both speed and efficiency, will find applications in active multiplexing, loop-based quantum memory, and feedforward for quantum error-correction protocols.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Geometric Phases as a New Window on Gravitational Waves</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Partha Nandi Frederik G. Scholtz</p>
            <p>We investigate how low-frequency gravitational waves (LFGWs), originating from distant astrophysical or cosmological sources, can induce purely quantum geometric phases in mesoscopic optomechanical systems. These phases represent subtle imprints with no classical counterpart, going beyond standard dynamical or Berry-type contributions that admit Hannay-angle analogues. Such ultra-weak waves couple to the motion of a mechanical mirror and generate distinctive phase shifts in the system's quantum state that cannot arise in any classical description. To access this effect, we propose a Ramsey-type interferometric protocol in which the photon-number states of a quantized optical mode become entangled with the mirror's center-of-mass motion, enabling a direct readout of the LFGW-induced geometric phase. This framework establishes a distinctly quantum approach for probing low-frequency gravitational wave modes, offering an alternative to conventional detection strategies based on spacetime strain.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oskar Stachowiak, Hubert Dunikowski, Emilia Witkowska</p>
            <p>We investigate the influence of non-zero magnetization on the ground-state phase diagram of the two-component Bose-Hubbard model. Employing a mean-field theoretical framework, both analytically and numerically, we demonstrate that positions and sizes of specific phases on the diagram are magnetization dependent. In particular, non-zero magnetization introduces different Mott insulator phase boundaries for each of the two components. This effect leads to the emergence of a hybrid phase characterized by the coexistence of superfluid in one of the components and Mott insulator in the another one. Our findings highlight the important role of a conserved quantities, which is magnetization here, in reshaping the phase landscape, significantly influencing the stability and emergence of distinct quantum phases.</p>

            <h2>Simulating Floquet non-Abelian topological insulator with photonic quantum walks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Quan Lin, Tianyu Li, Haiping Hu, Wei Yi, Peng Xue</p>
            <p>Floquet non-Abelian topological phases emerge in periodically driven systems and exhibit properties that are absent in their Abelian or static counterparts. Dubbed the Floquet non-Abelian topological insulators (FNATIs), they are characterized by non-Abelian topological charges and feature multifold bulk-boundary correspondence, making their experimental observation challenging. Here we simulate the FNATI using a higher-dimensional photonic quantum walk and develop dynamic measurement schemes to demonstrate key signatures of the FNATI. Importantly, combining a direct bulk-dynamic detection for the underlying quaternion topological charge, and a spatially-resolved injection spectroscopy for the edge states, we experimentally establish the multifold bulk-boundary correspondence, and, in particular, identify the anomalous non-Abelian phase where edge states appear in all band gaps, despite the presence of a trivial topological charge. Our experiment marks the first experimental characterization of the FNATI, providing general insight into the non-Abelian topological phases.</p>

            <p>Entanglement is unanimously recognized as the key communication resource of the Quantum Internet. Yet, the possibility of implementing novel network functionalities by exploiting the marvels of entanglement has been poorly investigated so far, by mainly restricting the attention to bipartite entanglement. Conversely, in this paper, we aim at exploiting multipartite entanglement as inter-network resource. Specifically, we consider the interconnection of different Quantum Local Area Networks (QLANs), and we show that multipartite entanglement allows to dynamically generate an inter-QLAN artificial topology, by means of local operations only, that overcomes the limitations of the physical QLAN topologies. To this aim, we first design the multipartite entangled state to be distributed within each QLAN. Then, we show how such a state can be engineered to: i) interconnect nodes belonging to different QLANs, and ii) dynamically adapt to different inter-QLAN traffic patterns. Our contribution aims at providing the network engineering community with a hands-on guideline towards the concept of artificial topology and artificial neighborhood.</p>

            <p>Multimode multiphoton states are at the center of many photonic quantum technologies, from photonic quantum computing to quantum sensing. In this work, we derive a procedure to generate exactly, and with a controlled number of steps, any such state by using only multiport interferometers, photon number resolving detectors, photon additions, and displacements. We achieve this goal by establishing a connection between photonic quantum state engineering and the algebraic problem of symmetric tensor decomposition. This connection allows us to solve the problem by using corresponding results from algebraic geometry and unveils a mechanism of photon catalysis, where photons are injected and subsequently retrieved in measurements, to generate entanglement that cannot be obtained through Gaussian operations. We also introduce a tensor decomposition, that generalizes our method and allows to construct optimal circuits for particular classes of states. As a benchmark, we numerically evaluate our method and compare its performance with state-of-the art results, confirming 100% fidelity on different classes of states.</p>

The authors argue that their findings challenge the validity of Bohmian particle dynamics because, according to the Bohmian guiding equation, the velocities in the classically forbidden region would be zero. In this note, we explain why this claim is false and the experimental findings are in perfect agreement with Bohmian mechanics. We also clarify why the operationally defined speeds reported in the paper are unrelated to particle velocities in the sense described by Bohmian mechanics. In contrast to other recent replies, our analysis relies solely on the standard Bohmian guidance equation for single particles.</p>

            <h2>Power and Limitations of Linear Programming Decoder for Quantum LDPC Codes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shouzhen Gu, Mehdi Soleimanifar</p>
            <p>Decoding quantum error-correcting codes is a key challenge in enabling fault-tolerant quantum computation. In the classical setting, linear programming (LP) decoders offer provable performance guarantees and can leverage fast practical optimization algorithms. Although LP decoders have been proposed for quantum codes, their performance and limitations remain relatively underexplored. In this work, we uncover a key limitation of LP decoding for quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes: certain constant-weight error patterns lead to ambiguous fractional solutions that cannot be resolved through independent rounding. To address this issue, we incorporate a post-processing technique known as ordered statistics decoding (OSD), which significantly enhances LP decoding performance in practice. Our results show that LP decoding, when augmented with OSD, can outperform belief propagation with the same post-processing for intermediate code sizes of up to hundreds of qubits. These findings suggest that LP-based decoders, equipped with effective post-processing, offer a promising approach for decoding near-term quantum LDPC codes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dara Murphy, Anthony Kiely, Irene D'Amico, Steve Campbell</p>
            <p>We examine the transport of useful energy, i.e. extractable work as quantified by the ergotropy, along a spin chain with tuneable exchange couplings between the sites. We focus on, and interpolate between, the two physically relevant limits of uniform interaction strengths and engineered couplings which achieve perfect state transfer (PST). By modelling the individual constituents as quantum batteries, we consider how the manner in which the extractable work appears in the initial state of the first site impacts the chain's ability to transport ergotropy to the final site. For non-PST couplings, we establish that there is a clear quantum advantage when the ergotropy is initially endowed in quantum coherences and demonstrate that this ergotropy is more efficiently transferred. For extractable work encoded in a population inverted state, we show that this considerably limits the length of chain over which any ergotropy can be faithfully transported. For PST couplings, we consider the robustness to disorder and again demonstrate a quantum advantage for coherently endowed ergotropy. Finally, we examine the work probability distribution associated with quenching on the interactions which provides insight into the work cost in switching on the couplings. We show that PST couplings lead to smaller fluctuations in this work cost, indicating that they are more stable.</p>

            <h2>Universal quantum phase classification on quantum computers from machine learning</h2>

            <p>The classification of quantum phases of matter remains a fundamental challenge in condensed matter physics. We present a novel framework that combines shadow tomography with modern time-series machine learning models to enable efficient and practical quantum phase classification. Our approach leverages the definition of quantum phases based on connectivity through finite-depth local unitary circuits, generating abundant training data by applying Haar random evolution to representative quantum states for a given phase. In this way, the training data can be efficiently obtained from a quantum simulator. Additionally, we demonstrate that advanced time-series models can be used to process the training data and achieve universal quantum phase classification that does not rely on local order parameters. To validate the universality and versatility of our method, we test the model against one-dimensional quantum spin chains such as the Ising model and the axial next-nearest-neighbor Ising (ANNNI) model, showing excellent agreement with known phase boundaries.</p>

We present an updated survey of various techniques to generate such strongly entangled states, including those going beyond the standard construction of graph and stabilizer states. Our contribution includes, in particular, analysis of the degree of entanglement of reduced states obtained by partial trace of AME projectors, states obtained by a symmetric superposition of GHZ states, an orthogonal frequency square representation of the "golden" AME state and an updated summary of the number of local unitary equivalence classes.</p>

            <p>We outline a theoretical framework for quantum metrology in non-Hermitian systems, demonstrating both significant failure and exceptional regimes in PT-symmetric Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer chains. Through biorthogonal quantum Fisher information analysis, we identify two distinct regimes: exponential sensitivity suppression in the non-Hermitian skin effect phase ($F_Q \propto N^3 e^{-2\kappa N}$) where eigenstates localize exponentially, and quadratic enhancement near PT-breaking exceptional points [1-4] ($F_Q \propto N^2/\delta$) achieving Heisenberg scaling. Our multiparameter analysis establishes optimal simultaneous estimation of chemical potential, Peierls phase, and gain/loss strength with quantum Fisher information matrix scaling as $N^2$, surpassing the standard quantum limit by factors exceeding $10^2$. For realistic parameters ($t/2\pi=10$ MHz, $\Delta/2\pi=1$ MHz, $N=50$), we predict enhancement factors $\eta_\mu \approx 20\sqrt{N}=141$ for chemical potential estimation and $\eta_\phi \approx t^2 \sqrt{3N/2}=100\sqrt{N}$ over classical sensing.

            <p>We construct stabilizer states and error-correcting codes on combinations of discrete- and continuous-variable systems, generalizing the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) quantum lattice formalism. Our framework absorbs the discrete phase space of a qudit into a hybrid phase space parameterizable entirely by the continuous variables of a harmonic oscillator. The unit cell of a hybrid quantum lattice grows with the qudit dimension, yielding a way to simultaneously measure an arbitrarily large range of non-commuting position and momentum displacements. Simple hybrid states can be obtained by applying a conditional displacement to a Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) state and a Pauli eigenstate, or by encoding some of the physical qudits of a stabilizer state into a GKP code. The states' oscillator-qudit entanglement cannot be generated using symplectic (i.e., Gaussian-Clifford) operations, distinguishing them as a resource from tensor products of oscillator and qudit stabilizer states. We construct general hybrid error-correcting codes by relating stabilizer codes to non-commutative tori and obtaining logical operators via Morita equivalence. We provide examples using commutation matrices, integer symplectic matrices, and binary codes.</p>

            <p>Fast and accurate quantum error correction (QEC) decoding is crucial for scalable fault-tolerant quantum computation. Most-Likely-Error (MLE) decoding, while being near-optimal, is intractable on general quantum Low-Density Parity-Check (qLDPC) codes and typically relies on approximation and heuristics. We propose HyperBlossom, a unified framework that formulates MLE decoding as a Minimum-Weight Parity Factor (MWPF) problem and generalizes the blossom algorithm to hypergraphs via a similar primal-dual linear programming model with certifiable proximity bounds. HyperBlossom unifies all the existing graph-based decoders like (Hypergraph) Union-Find decoders and Minimum-Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) decoder, thus bridging the gap between heuristic and certifying decoders. We implement HyperBlossom in software, namely Hyperion. Hyperion achieves a 4.8x lower logical error rate compared to the MWPM decoder on the distance-11 surface code and 1.6x lower logical error rate compared to a fine-tuned BPOSD decoder on the $[[90, 8, 10]]$ bivariate bicycle code under code-capacity noise. It also achieves an almost-linear average runtime scaling on both the surface code and the color code, with numerical results up to sufficiently large code distances of 99 and 31 for code-capacity noise and circuit-level noise, respectively.</p>

            <p>The ability to prepare states for quantum chemistry is a promising feature of quantum computers, and efficient techniques for chemical state preparation is an active area of research. In this paper, we implement and investigate two methods of quantum circuit preparation for multiconfigurational states for quantum chemical applications. It has previously been shown that controlled Givens rotations are universal for quantum chemistry. To prepare a selected linear combination of Slater determinants (represented as occupation number configurations) using Givens rotations, the gates that rotate between the reference and excited determinants need to be controlled on qubits outside the excitation (external controls), in general. We implement a method to automatically find the external controls required for utilizing Givens rotations to prepare multiconfigurational states on a quantum circuit. We compare this approach to an alternative technique that exploits the sparsity of the chemical state vector and find that the latter can outperform the method of externally controlled Givens rotations; highly reduced circuits can be obtained by taking advantage of the sparse nature (where the number of basis states is significantly less than 2$^{n_q}$ for $n_q$ qubits) of chemical wavefunctions. We demonstrate the benefits of these techniques in a range of applications, including the ground states of a strongly correlated molecule, matrix elements of the Q-SCEOM algorithm for excited states, as well as correlated initial states for a quantum subspace method based on quantum computed moments and quantum phase estimation.</p>

By employing a real-space scattering approach, we obtain analytical solutions for the scattering amplitudes that remain valid in both Markovian and non-Markovian regimes. We observe that an external driving field induces a splitting of the transmission spectrum's dip into double dips, with the distance between the two dips increasing as the strength of the driving field increases. The chiral nature of the coupling allows for controlled switching between complete transmission and perfect reflection of incident photons. In the Markovian limit, we predict robust perfect transmission at specific phase values, independent of the driving field this http URL, in the non-Markovian regime, as the size of the giant atom increases, the oscillatory behavior of the scattering spectrum becomes more pronounced.

Our approach involves partitioning the Pauli operators into mutually commuting clusters and finding Clifford unitaries that diagonalize each cluster. We then design an ansatz that uses these Clifford unitaries for efficient switching between the clusters, complemented by a layer of parameterized single qubit rotations for each individual cluster. By conducting numerical simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in accurately determining the ground state energy of different quantum chemistry Hamiltonians.

Several methods to detect and characterize DPT have been suggested in the literature, the most famous of which -- the $\textit{Liouvillian gap}$ -- can be derived from a spectral analysis of the Liouvillian super-operator that governs the complex interplay between coherent and dissipative dynamics. Here, we consider the $\textit{output current}$, defined as the average total quantum jumps per unit time between the open quantum system and the environment. We propose that output current fluctuations, and in particular their dynamical correlations, their power spectrum, and their characteristic timescale can provide valuable information about DPT, confirming a dramatic change of behavior at the critical point. We validate our proposal using the dissipative XYZ model and the nonlinear driven-dissipative Kerr model, showing good agreement with previous estimates of the location of the critical point. Compared to previous approaches, our proposal could be already experimentally tested in optical systems, providing a practical method to detect criticality in quantum open systems.</p>

            <h2>Fidelity-Aware Multipath Routing for Multipartite State Distribution in Quantum Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Evan Sutcliffe, Alejandra Beghelli</p>
            <p>We consider the problem of distributing entangled multipartite states across a quantum network with improved distribution rate and fidelity. For this, we propose fidelity-aware multi-path routing protocols, assess their performance in terms of the rate and fidelity of the distributed Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states, and compare such performance against that of single-path routing. Simulation results show that the proposed multi-path routing protocols select routes that require more Bell states compared to single-path routing, but also require fewer rounds of Bell state generation. We also optimised the trade-off between distribution rate and fidelity by selecting an appropriate cutoff to the quantum memory storage time. Using such a cutoff technique, the proposed multi-path protocols can achieve up to an 8.3 times higher distribution rate and up to a 28% improvement in GHZ state fidelity compared to single-path routing. These results show that multi-path routing both improves the distribution rates and enhances fidelity for multipartite state distribution.</p>

            <h2>Tesseract: A Search-Based Decoder for Quantum Error Correction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Laleh Aghababaie Beni, Oscar Higgott, Noah Shutty</p>
            <p>Tesseract is a Most-Likely Error decoder designed for low-density-parity-check quantum error-correcting codes. Tesseract conducts a search through a graph on the set of all subsets of errors to find the lowest cost subset of errors consistent with the input syndrome. Although this graph is exponentially large, the search can be made efficient in practice for random errors using $A^*$ search technique along with a few pruning heuristics. We show through benchmark circuits for surface, color, and bivariate-bicycle codes that Tesseract is significantly faster than integer programming-based decoders while retaining comparable accuracy at moderate physical error rates. We also find that Tesseract can decode transversal CNOT protocols for surface codes on neutral atom quantum computers. Finally, we compare surface code and bivariate bicycle code circuits, finding that the [[144,12,12]] bivariate bicycle code is $14\times$ to $19\times$ more efficient than surface codes using our most-likely error decoding, whereas using correlated matching and BP+OSD decoders would have implied only a $10\times$ improvement. Assuming instead that long-range couplers are $10\times$ noisier, the improvement drops to around $4\times$ using Tesseract or $2\times$ using correlated matching and BP+OSD.</p>

            <p>The four-legged cat code is a quantum error-correcting code designed to address the predominant error in bosonic modes: single-photon loss. It was the first such code to surpass the break-even point, thereby demonstrating the practical utility of quantum error correction. In this work, we propose a planar fault-tolerant architecture for this code by concatenating it with the XZZX code via fusion-based error-correction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first 2D nearest-neighbor architecture for fault-tolerant fusion-based error-correction. We demonstrate how all the required operations, namely resource state preparation and Bell measurements, can be carried out using standard circuit-QED techniques, such as intercavity beam-splitter coupling, cavity displacements, cavity-transmon dispersive coupling, and transmon drives. We show analytically and numerically that all dominant hardware errors in the bosonic modes and control ancillae are corrected, to first-order, at the hardware level. Consequently, the outer XZZX code only needs to address smaller residual errors, which are quadratically suppressed, effectively doubling the architecture's fault-distance. Moreover, the performance of our architecture is not limited by unwanted nonlinearities such as cavity self-Kerr, and it avoids demanding coupling techniques like $\chi$-matching or high-order coupling. Overall, our architecture substantially reduces the hardware complexity needed to achieve fault tolerance with the four-legged cat code.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Finn Voichick, Liyi Li, Robert Rand, Michael Hicks</p>
            <p>We introduce Qunity, a new quantum programming language designed to treat quantum computing as a natural generalization of classical computing. Qunity presents a unified syntax where familiar programming constructs can have both quantum and classical effects. For example, one can use sum types to implement the direct sum of linear operators, exception-handling syntax to implement projective measurements, and aliasing to induce entanglement. Further, Qunity takes advantage of the overlooked BQP subroutine theorem, allowing one to construct reversible subroutines from irreversible quantum algorithms through the uncomputation of "garbage" outputs. Unlike existing languages that enable quantum aspects with separate add-ons (like a classical language with quantum gates bolted on), Qunity provides a unified syntax and a novel denotational semantics that guarantees that programs are quantum mechanically valid. We present Qunity's syntax, type system, and denotational semantics, showing how it can cleanly express several quantum algorithms. We also detail how Qunity can be compiled into a low-level qubit circuit language like OpenQASM, proving the realizability of our design.</p>

We show that the anisotropy parameter of the {\it XXZ} model can be tuned by applying a magnetic field, and in particular, that it changes drastically near the FÃ¶rster resonance points. Based on this result, we propose experimental realizations of spin-1/2 and spin-1 Heisenberg-type quantum spin models in Rydberg atom quantum simulators, without relying on Floquet engineering. Our results provide guidance for future experiments of Rydberg atom quantum simulators and offer insight into quantum many-body phenomena emerging in the Heisenberg model.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amer Alrakik, Gian Luigi Bendazzoli, Stefano Evangelisti, J. Arjan Berger</p>
            <p>We present a general theory to treat periodic solids with quantum-chemistry methods. It relies on two main developments: 1) the modeling of a solid as a Clifford torus which is a torus that is both periodic and flat and 2) the introduction of a periodic gaussian basis set that is compatible with the topology of the Clifford torus. We illustrate our approach by calculating the ground-state energy of a periodic chain of hydrogen atoms within both Hartree-Fock and coupled cluster theory. We demonstrate that our approach yields the correct ground-state energy in the thermodynamic limit by comparing it to the ground-state energy of a ring of hydrogen atoms in the same limit. Since equivalent ring-like calculations for three-dimensional solids are impossible, our approach is an excellent alternative to perform quantum-chemistry calculations of solids. Our Clifford formalism can be seamlessly combined with current implementations of quantum-chemistry methods designed for atoms and molecules to make them applicable to solids.</p>

            <p>Accurately simulating molecular vibronic spectra remains computationally challenging due to the exponential scaling of required calculations. Here, we show that employing the linear coupling model within the gaussian boson sampling framework effectively addresses this limitation. We implement the algorithm for simulating the pentacene molecule through three distinct approaches, using numerical simulation on a classical computer and experimentally using two optical setups equipped with different photon detectors (SNSPD and SPAD). High fidelity $(F>0.999)$ was achieved between the simulated Franck-Condon profiles and analytically calculated profiles obtained by enumerating all possible transitions within the linear coupling model. Furthermore, simulations were performed for larger molecular systems using 48 vibrational modes of naphthalene and 64 vibrational modes of anthracene. Comparison with experimental data confirms that the simulated spectra accurately reproduce both the positions and shapes of the measured spectral bands. A notable advantage of our algorithm is its scalability, requiring only a fixed minimal set of optical components irrespective of the size of the studied system.</p>

            <p>Nonreciprocity-the ability to transmit signals in one direction while blocking them in the reverse-has become a powerful resource in quantum technologies, enabling directional amplification, routing of quantum information, and topologically protected quantum states. Recent experimental advances have demonstrated nonreciprocal behavior in low-loss, fully integrated devices operating with weak or no magnetic bias, enabled by synthetic gauge fields, optomechanical interactions, and chiral light-matter coupling. These achievements overcome the limitations of more traditional approaches, making nonreciprocity compatible with superconducting circuits and scalable quantum photonic architectures as well as an integral part of the next generation of modular quantum computers, distributed quantum networks, and precision metrology. Here we highlight the key concepts for engineering nonreciprocity in quantum systems and describe how this functionality can be employed for high-fidelity qubit readout, robust quantum state transfer, and boosting the sensitivity of quantum sensors.</p>

            <h2>Coupling phase enabled level transitions in pseudo-Hermitian magnon-polariton systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Huang Xin, Liu Jingyu, Lin Shirong</p>
            <p>While cavity-magnon hybridization offers intriguing physics, its practical implementation is hindered by intrinsic damping in both cavity and magnon modes, leading to short coherence times and constrained applications. Recently, with the emergence of tunable external gain at the macroscopic scale, the research focus has shifted from purely lossy systems to gain-loss balanced non-Hermitian systems. Here, we propose a pseudo-Hermitian model with two magnon and two cavity modes coupled via phase-dependent interaction. We link the energy spectrum to phase transitions, observing exceptional points when pseudo-Hermitian symmetry breaks. We also observed level attraction and level repulsion. The former corresponds to four phase transitions and manifests as a double Z-shaped energy spectrum, the latter corresponds to two phase transitions, with the repulsive gap depending on the coupling phase. In the phase diagram defined by non-Hermiticity and coupling phase, we reveal a distinctive correspondence: pseudo-Hermitian symmetry breaking is intrinsically linked to coupling mode transitions, enabling new strategies for controlling hybrid quantum states in spintronic systems.</p>

            <p>Multimode squeezed light is a key resource for high-dimensional photonic quantum technologies, enabling applications in quantum-enhanced sensing, quantum communication, and quantum computing. Efficient detection of such a multimode squeezed state is essential for unlocking its full potential. Optical parametric amplification (OPA) has recently gained attention as a powerful technique offering loss-tolerant, direct broadband detection, and multimode operation. While OPA has been used to characterize spatially multimode squeezing, its application to spectrally multimode squeezing has not yet been demonstrated. Here, we report on the first experimental demonstration of spectrally multimode squeezing detection using OPA. We achieve simultaneous detection of squeezing across more than 60 spectral modes of a broadband squeezed vacuum state. The observed squeezing is nearly uniform, ranging from -6.5 to -7 dB, which makes the source particularly suitable for constructing continuous-variable cluster states, and indicates the multimode capability of the OPA. The results extend the capabilities of OPA detection into the spectral domain, advancing spectral-mode-based high-dimensional photonic quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>The entanglement swapping protocol (ESP) is a fundamental primitive for distributing quantum correlations across distant nodes in a quantum network. Recent studies have demonstrated that even when the involved qubit pairs are only partially entangled, it is still possible to concentrate and transmit entanglement via Bell-basis measurements. In this work, we extend these ideas to quantum networks with various topologies - including linear, star, and hybrid configurations - by analyzing the application of the ESP to initially partially entangled states. We investigate how entanglement evolves under such protocols by examining the transformations of the initial states and evaluating the success probabilities for generating maximally entangled states at the output. Our results offer new insights into the dynamics of the entanglement distribution in quantum networks and provide practical guidelines for designing robust quantum communication strategies under realistic conditions.</p>

The von Neumann entropy obtained via QuGIT simulations is compared with analytic RÃ©nyi entropy bounds, thereby validating the accuracy of our circuit implementation of the cosmological squeezing Hamiltonian in both accelerating and decelerating scenarios.

            <p>Quantifying correlation and entanglement between molecular orbitals can elucidate the role of quantum effects in strongly correlated reaction processes. However, accurately storing the wavefunction for a classical computation of those quantities can be prohibitive. Here we use the Quantinuum H1-1 trapped-ion quantum computer to calculate von Neumann entropies which quantify the orbital correlation and entanglement in a strongly correlated molecular system relevant to lithium-ion batteries (vinylene carbonate interacting with an O$_2$ molecule). As shown in previous works, fermionic superselection rules decrease correlations and reduce measurement overheads for constructing orbital reduced density matrices. Taking into account superselection rules we further reduce the number of measurements by finding commuting sets of Pauli operators. Using low overhead noise reduction techniques we calculate von Neumann entropies in excellent agreement with noiseless benchmarks, indicating that correlations and entanglement between molecular orbitals can be accurately estimated from a quantum computation. Our results show that the one-orbital entanglement vanishes unless opposite-spin open shell configurations are present in the wavefunction.</p>

            <p>We implement a quantum generalization of a neural network on trapped-ion and IBM superconducting quantum computers to classify MNIST images, a common benchmark in computer vision. The network feedforward involves qubit rotations whose angles depend on the results of measurements in the previous layer. The network is trained via simulation, but inference is performed experimentally on quantum hardware. The classical-to-quantum correspondence is controlled by an interpolation parameter, $a$, which is zero in the classical limit. Increasing $a$ introduces quantum uncertainty into the measurements, which is shown to improve network performance at moderate values of the interpolation parameter. We then focus on particular images that fail to be classified by a classical neural network but are detected correctly in the quantum network. For such borderline cases, we observe strong deviations from the simulated behavior. We attribute this to physical noise, which causes the output to fluctuate between nearby minima of the classification energy landscape. Such strong sensitivity to physical noise is absent for clear images. We further benchmark physical noise by inserting additional single-qubit and two-qubit gate pairs into the neural network circuits. Our work provides a springboard toward more complex quantum neural networks on current devices: while the approach is rooted in standard classical machine learning, scaling up such networks may prove classically non-simulable and could offer a route to near-term quantum advantage.</p>

            <p>Quantum batteries (QBs) have emerged as promising platforms for microscale energy storage, yet most existing studies assume weak system-environment coupling and Markovian dynamics. Here we explore how physical catalysis can regulate the maximum extractable work (ergotropy) of a spin-chain QB strongly coupled to a cavity environment. We model the system using a Nakajima-Zwanzig-type non-Markovian master equation and simulate the time evolution of ergotropy under various physical parameters. Our results show that increasing the catalyst-spin coupling, spin energy or cavity frequency can effectively suppress ergotropy oscillations and yield quasi-stationary ergotropy regime, while overly strong catalyst, especially when accompanied by increasing system-environment coupling under such conditions, can destabilize work extraction. This study demonstrates how quantum catalysis can serve as a control knob for optimizing battery performance in strongly coupled non-Markovian regimes.</p>

            <p>We report the observation of the Purcell effect in a cavity-metallic magnet hybrid system using electric-field-mediated coupling. In this configuration, microwave-induced axial currents in the microwire induce circular magnetic fields that drive the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) of the magnetized microwire. Field-dependent transmission and reflection spectroscopies reveal a clear cavity perturbation consistent with the Purcell regime, in which the magnetic loss rate exceeds the light-matter coupling strength. Despite the small magnetic volume ($\sim 10^{-13}\,\text{m}^3$), measurements performed at both room temperature and 7 mK show coupling rates as high as 56 MHz, one order of magnitude stronger than expected from conventional coupling at the magnetic antinode. Time-domain ringdown measurements directly show the magnetic-field-dependent modification of the cavity photon lifetime, in agreement with theoretical predictions. These results establish a versatile approach for coupling microwave fields to metallic magnets via geometric and electric-field-mediated interactions, opening new opportunities for hybrid cavity-magnet systems.</p>

            <p>We investigate the advantage of using squeezed input light for generating gravity-induced entanglement (GIE) through Fourier-domain analysis. Based on the findings of [1], which demonstrated the feasibility of detecting GIE in optomechanical systems under quantum control, we further demonstrate that squeezed input light can reduce the optical noise in the mechanical conditional state and enhance GIE. Furthermore, we estimate the systematic and statistical errors in the measurement of GIE using the Fourier transformation over a finite measurement time. Based on the error estimations using the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in GIE detection, we find that a total measurement time of 10^6 s is required to achieve SNR=1 when using squeezed input light, whereas 10^{6.8} s is needed without squeezed input light. This result highlights the effectiveness of optomechanical systems and the critical role of squeezed input light in enhancing the detectability of GIE.</p>

            <h2>Ultimate resolution limits in coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering imaging</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giacomo Sorelli, Manuel Gessner, Frank Schlawin</p>
            <p>Coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering is a widely used imaging technique that provides chemical contrast without the need for labels, making it an extremely valuable tool in physics, chemistry, and biology. In this work, we explore its fundamental precision limits by applying tools from quantum information theory. We identify optimal measurement strategies and show that spatial mode demultiplexing--a technique already accessible in current experimental setups--can achieve these quantum limits and in many situations improve the sensitivity of conventional intensity measurements. Building on this, we introduce an advanced imaging scheme based on vortex beams, which we predict to enhance the image information in the final quantum state of light and thereby lead to even higher resolution and sensitivity. These findings establish a clear path for enhancing nonlinear imaging techniques using concepts from quantum science, bridging the gap between established microscopy methods and the emerging capabilities of quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>As quantum computing, sensing, timing, and networking technologies mature, quantum network testbeds are being deployed across the United States and around the world. To support the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL)'s mission of building heterogeneous quantum networks, we report on the development of Quantum Local Area Networks (QLANs) operating at telecommunications-band frequencies. The multi-node, reconfigurable QLANs include deployed optical fiber and free-space links connected to pristine laboratory environments and rugged outdoor test facilities. Each QLAN is tailored to distinct operating conditions and use cases, with unique environmental characteristics and capabilities. We present network topologies and in-depth link characterization data for three such networks. Using photonic integrated circuit-based sources of entangled photons, we demonstrate entanglement distribution of time-energy Bell states across deployed fiber in a wooded environment. The high quality of the entanglement is confirmed by a Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality violation of $S=2.700$, approaching the theoretical maximum of $S=2.828$. We conclude with a discussion of future work aimed at expanding QLAN functionality and enabling entanglement distribution between heterogeneous matter-based quantum systems, including superconducting qubits and trapped ions. These results underscore the practical viability of field-deployable, qubit-agnostic quantum network infrastructure.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joseph D. Broz, Jesse C. Hoke, Edwin Acuna, Jason R. Petta</p>
            <p>In conventional exchange-only (EO) spin qubit demonstrations, quantum gates have been implemented using sequences of individually pulsed pairwise exchange interactions with only one exchange coupling active at a time. Alternatively, multiple non-commuting exchange interactions can be pulsed simultaneously, reducing circuit depths and providing protection against leakage. We demonstrate high-fidelity quantum control of an always-on exchange-only (AEON) qubit, operated using simultaneous exchange pulses in a triangular quantum dot (QD) array. We use blind randomized benchmarking to characterize the performance of the full AEON single-qubit Clifford gate set, achieving an average Clifford gate fidelity $F_{\rm C1}$ = 99.86\%. Extensions of this work may enable more efficient EO two-qubit entangling gates as well as the implementation of native $i$-Toffoli gates in Loss-DiVincenzo single-spin qubits.</p>

            <p>We report a two-stage, heterodyne rf-to-microwave transducer that combines a tunable electrostatic pre-amplifier with a superconducting electromechanical cavity. A metalized Si$_3$N$_4$ membrane (3 MHz frequency) forms the movable plate of a vacuum-gap capacitor in a microwave LC resonator. A dc bias across the gap converts any small rf signal into a resonant electrostatic force proportional to the bias, providing a voltage-controlled gain that multiplies the cavity's intrinsic electromechanical gain. In a flip-chip device with a 1.5 $\mathrm{\mu}$m gap operated at 10 mK we observe dc-tunable anti-spring shifts, and rf-to-microwave transduction at 49 V bias, achieving a charge sensitivity of 87 $\mathrm{\mu}$e/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ (0.9 nV/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$). Extrapolation to sub-micron gaps and state-of-the-art $Q>10^8$ membrane resonators predicts sub-200 fV/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ sensitivity, establishing dc-biased electromechanics as a practical route towards quantum-grade rf electrometers and low-noise modular heterodyne links for superconducting microwave circuits and charge or voltage sensing.</p>

            <p>We investigate the advantage of using squeezed input light for generating gravity-induced entanglement (GIE) through Fourier-domain analysis. Based on the findings of [1], which demonstrated the feasibility of detecting GIE in optomechanical systems under quantum control, we further demonstrate that squeezed input light can reduce the optical noise in the mechanical conditional state and enhance GIE.

            <p>The realization of long-distance quantum communication and the envisioned quantum internet relies on coherent hybrid light-matter interfaces connecting quantum light emitters with quantum memory (QM) systems. Unlike probabilistic photon pair sources such as spontaneous parametric down-conversion, deterministic quantum light emitters enable the on-demand production of pure and bright single and entangled photons, essential for scalable quantum networks. In this work, we present the first experimental realization of a coherent hybrid light-matter interface between a chip-integrated InAsP/InP nanowire quantum dot (QD) and a solid-state QM based on Er$^{3+}$ ions doped in a glass silica fiber (erbium-doped fiber, EDF). The emission spectrum of the InAsP/InP nanowire QD aligns with the absorption bandwidth of the EDF at 980 nm at cryogenic temperatures, allowing efficient interaction between the two systems. To demonstrate this, we present a spectroscopic characterization of the $^{4}I_{15/2} \leftrightarrow ^{4}I_{11/2}$ optical transition in EDF at 980 nm. Our measurements reveal substantial inhomogeneous broadening of this optical transition and a long spin population lifetime, underscoring EDFs potential for broadband QM implementation. We implement an 8 GHz bandwidth multimode QM based on the Atomic Frequency Comb protocol, enabling the storage and retrieval of 59 weak coherent pulses. Furthermore, we characterize single-photon emission from an InAsP/InP nanowire QD at 980 nm and demonstrate its deterministic storage and recall in the EDF QM. Notably, this is achieved without spectral tuning of the QD emission, demonstrating its direct compatibility with a solid-state QM.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Sensing with Bright Two-Mode Squeezed Light in a Distributed Network of Gyroscopes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Priyanka M. Kannath, Girish S. Agarwal, Ashok Kumar</p>
            <p>Recent developments in quantum technologies have enabled significant improvements in the precision of optical sensing systems. This work explores the integration of distributed quantum sensing (DQS) with optical gyroscopes to improve the estimation accuracy of angular velocity. Utilizing bright two-mode squeezed states (bTMSS), which offer high photon numbers and strong bipartite quantum correlations, we propose a novel configuration that leverages continuous-variable entanglement across multiple spatially separated optical gyroscopes. Unlike traditional quantum sensing that enhances a single sensor, our approach focuses on estimating a global phase shift corresponding to the average angular rotation across distributed optical gyroscopes with quantum-enhanced sensitivity. We analyze the phase sensitivities of different bTMSS configurations, including M mode-entangled bTMSS and separable M-bTMSS, and evaluate their performance through the quantum CramÃ©r-Rao bound. The analysis shows that, with 5% photon loss in every channel in the system, the proposed scheme shows a sensitivity enhancement of ~9.3 dB beyond the shot-noise limit, with an initial squeezing of ~9.8 dB. The present scheme has potential applications in quantum-enhanced inertial navigation and precision metrology within emerging quantum networks.</p>

            <h2>Theory of quantum comb enhanced interferometry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haowei Shi, Quntao Zhuang</p>
            <p>Optical frequency combs, named for their comb-like peaks in the spectrum, are essential for various sensing applications. As the technology develops, its performance has reached the standard quantum limit dictated by the quantum fluctuations of coherent light field. Quantum combs, with their quantum fluctuation engineered via squeezing and entanglement, are the necessary ingredient for overcoming such limits. We develop the theory for designing and analyzing quantum combs, focusing on dual-comb interferometric measurement. Our analyses cover both squeezed and entangled quantum combs with division receivers and heterodyne receivers, leading to four protocols with quantum advantages scalable with squeezing/entanglement strength. In the spectroscopy of a single absorption line, whereas the division receiver with the squeezed comb suffers from amplified thermal noise, the other three protocols demonstrate a surprising robustness to loss at a few comb lines. Such a unique loss-robustness of a scalable quantum advantage has not been found in any traditional quantum sensing protocols.</p>

            <h2>Microscopic analysis of above-threshold ionization driven by squeezed light</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. Rivera-Dean, P. Stammer, C. Figueira de Morisson Faria, M. Lewenstein</p>
            <p>Above-threshold ionization (ATI) is a strong-field-driven process where electrons absorb more photons than required for ionization. While ATI dynamics and outputs are well-understood when driven by classical, perfectly coherent light, the recent development of non-classical light sources for strong-field phenomena has spurred interest in their effect on the involved electron dynamics. In this work, we present a microscopic quantum optical theory describing ATI under the influence of strong squeezed light. We observe that squeezed light significantly enhances the coupling between light and matter, making their mutual backaction more important than under classical driving. This backaction profoundly impacts the electronic ionization times, as well as the non-classical properties of the joint electron-light state. This results in pronounced entanglement features, both immediately after ionization, and at later times. These entanglement features are reflected in the properties of the quantum optical state of the driving field revealing notable non-Gaussian features that depend on both, the amount of squeezing, and the number of ionization events occurring during the interaction.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fazilah Nothlawala, Kiki Dekkers, Moslem Mahdavifar, Jonathan Leach, Andrew Forbes, Isaac Nape</p>
            <p>Orbital angular momentum (OAM) as both classical and quantum states of light has proven essential in numerous applications, from high-capacity information transfer to enhanced precision and accuracy in metrology. Here, we extend OAM metrology to relativistic scenarios to determine the Lorentz factor of a moving reference frame, exploiting the fact that OAM is not Lorentz invariant. Using OAM correlations of entangled states, we show that their joint OAM spectrum is modified by length contraction, where the rescaling of spatial dimensions alters the orthogonality of the OAM modes themselves. In an emulated experiment, we confirm the predicted broadening of the OAM spectrum and use this to quantitatively infer the Lorentz (contraction) factor, reaching experimentally simulated velocities of up to 0.99c. Our work provides a pathway for novel measurement techniques suitable for relativistic conditions that leverages OAM structured light as a resource.</p>

            <h2>Distributed fault-tolerant quantum memories over a 2xL array of qubit modules</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Edwin Tham, Min Ye, Ilia Khait, John Gamble, Nicolas Delfosse</p>
            <p>We propose an architecture for a quantum memory distributed over a $2 \times L$ array of modules equipped with a cyclic shift implemented via flying qubits. The logical information is distributed across the first row of $L$ modules and quantum error correction is executed using ancilla modules on the second row equipped with a cyclic shift. This work proves that quantum LDPC codes such as BB codes can maintain their performance in a distributed setting while using solely one simple connector: a cyclic shift. We propose two strategies to perform quantum error correction on a $2 \times L$ module array: (i) The cyclic layout which applies to any stabilizer codes, whereas previous results for qubit arrays are limited to CSS codes. (ii) The sparse cyclic layout, specific to bivariate bicycle (BB) codes. For the $[[144,12,12]]$ BB code, using the sparse cyclic layout we obtain a quantum memory with $12$ logical qubits distributed over $12$ modules, containing $12$ physical qubits each. We propose physical implementations of this architecture using flying qubits, that can be faithfully transported, and include qubits encoded in ions, neutral atoms, electrons or photons. We performed numerical simulations when modules are long ion chains and when modules are single-qubit arrays of ions showing that the distributed BB code achieves a logical error rate below $2 \cdot 10^{-6}$ when the physical error rate is $10^{-3}$.</p>

            <p>Distributed quantum sensing, which estimates a global parameter across distant nodes, has attracted significant interest for applications such as quantum imaging, sensor networks, and global-scale clock synchronization. $N00N$ states are regarded as one of the optimal quantum resources for quantum metrology, enabling the Heisenberg scaling. Recently, the concept of $N00N$ states has been extended to multi-mode $N00N$ states for quantum-enhanced multiple-parameter estimation. However, the application of multi-mode $N00N$ states in distributed quantum sensing remains unexplored. Here, we propose a distributed quantum sensing scheme that achieves the Heisenberg scaling using multi-mode $N00N$ states. We theoretically show that multi-mode $N00N$ states can reach the Heisenberg scaling by examining both the CramÃ©r-Rao bound and the quantum CramÃ©r-Rao bound. For experimental demonstration, we employ a four-mode $2002$ state to estimate the average of two spatially distributed phases, achieving a 2.74 dB sensitivity enhancement over the standard quantum limit. We believe that utilizing multi-mode $N00N$ states for distributed quantum sensing offers a promising approach for developing entanglement-enhanced sensor networks.</p>

            <p>We propose an all-optical MoirÃ©-like exciton confinement by means of spatially periodic optical cavities. Such periodic photonic structures can control the material properties by coupling the matter excitations to the confined photons and their quantum fluctuations. We develop a low energy non-perturbative quantum electro-dynamical description of strongly coupled excitons and photons at finite momentum transfer. We find that in the classical limit of a laser driven cavity the induced optical confinement directly emulates MoirÃ© physics. In a dark cavity instead, the sole presence of quantum fluctuations of light generates a sizable renormalization of the excitonic bands and effective mass. We attribute these effects to long-range cavity-mediated exciton-exciton interactions which can only be captured in a non-perturbative treatment. With these findings we propose spatially structured cavities as a promising avenue for cavity material engineering.</p>

            <h2>Quantum thermalization in a dimerized J1-J2 model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Smitarani Mishra, Shaon Sahoo</p>
            <p>We revisit the J1-J2 frustrated Heisenberg spin-1/2 chain with dimerization ({\delta}) or modulation in the nearest-neighbor couplings to investigate its thermalization behavior. While the dimerization tends to induce localization, the next-nearest-neighbor interaction J2 generally favors thermalization, making the assessment of the model's compliance with the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) particularly subtle. The challenge is further compounded by the model's SU(2) symmetry; the study of ETH compliance is necessarily done for each symmetry sector but separating different sectors of this symmetry is known to be a computationally demanding task. The current study is driven by two main motivations: first, to explore whether the well-known ground-state phases of the model have any bearing on its thermalization properties; and second, to understand how the interplay between two competing factors, namely, the non-uniformity (via {\delta}) and the beyond-nearest-neighbor interactions (via J2) governs the system's approach to thermal equilibrium. A systematic analysis shows that the ETH is most strongly satisfied for intermediate values of {\delta} (~ 0.5) with J2 ranging from intermediate (~ 0.5) to large (~ 1)- a parameter regime falls within the spiral ground-state phase. It is also found that when the system is in the gapless ground-state phase (which falls within the N'eel phase), the ETH is more prone to violation. In the regime of large {\delta} and small J2, the system is seen to enter a localized phase (characterized here by modulation in density-of-states; assessing ETH compliance is less meaningful for this phase.</p>

            <p>The Tavis-Cummings (TC) model, which serves as a natural physical realization of a quantum battery, comprises $N_b$ atoms as battery cells that collectively interact with a shared photon field, functioning as the charger, initially containing $n_0$ photons. In this study, we introduce the invariant subspace method to effectively represent the quantum dynamics of the TC battery. Our findings indicate that in the limiting case of $n_0\!\gg\! N_b$ or $N_b\!\gg\! n_0$, a distinct SU(2) symmetry emerges in the dynamics, thereby ensuring the realization of optimal energy storage. We also establish a negative relationship between the battery-charger entanglement and the energy storage capacity. As a result, we demonstrate that the asymptotically optimal energy storage can be achieved in the scenario where $N_b\!=\!n_0\!\gg\! 1$. Our approach not only enhances our comprehension of the algebraic structure inherent in the TC model but also contributes to the broader theoretical framework of quantum batteries. Furthermore, it provides crucial insights into the relation between energy transfer and quantum correlations.</p>

            <p>The dynamical trajectory of a dissipative Rydberg many-body system could be flipped under a microwave field driving, displaying an enhanced sensitivity. This is because the intersection of the folded hysteresis trajectories exhibits a sharp peak near the phase transition, amplifying the response to small changes in the microwave field. Here, we demonstrate an experiment of enhanced metrology through flipping the hysteresis trajectory in a cold atomic system, displaying an approach to improve sensitivity near the gap-closing points. By measuring the intersection points of hysteresis trajectories versus Rabi frequency of the microwave field, we quantify the equivalent sensitivity to be 1.6(5) nV cm-1 Hz-1/2. The measurement is also dependent on the interaction time, optical depth and principal quantum number since the long-range interaction between Rydberg atoms could dramatically change the shape of hysteresis trajectories. The reported results suggest that flipping trajectory features in cold Rydberg many-body systems could advance sensing and metrology applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Panagiotis Dorlis, Nick E. Mavromatos, Sarben Sarkar, Sotirios-Neilos Vlachos</p>
            <p>We propose, in (3+1)-dimensional spacetimes, a novel astrophysical source of squeezed graviton states, due to superradiant axionic clouds surrounding rotating (Kerr-type) black holes (BH). The microscopic origin of these axions is diverse, ranging from the Kalb-Ramond (model-independent) axions and compactification axions in string theory, to \cm contorted geometries exemplified by a totally antisymmetric component of torsion in Einstein-Cartan theory. The axion fields couple to chiral gauge and gravitational Chern-Simons (CS) anomaly terms in the effective gravitational actions. In the presence of a Kerr BH background, such axions lead, upon acquiring a mass, to superradiance and the production of pairs of entangled gravitons in a squeezed state. The specific microscopic origin of the axions is not important, provided they are massive. This multimode squeezed-graviton state is examined through a Takagi-like decomposition, used in quantum optics. In the effective action it is shown that squeezing effects associated with conventional general relativity (GR) dominate, by many orders of magnitude, the corresponding effects due to the CS gravitational anomaly terms. For a sufficiently long lifetime of the axionic cloud of the BH, we find that significant squeezing (quantified through the average number of gravitons with respect to the appropriate vacuum) can be produced from the GR effects. It is also demonstrated explicitly that the structure of the entangled states (when the latter are expressed in a left-right polarization basis) depends highly on whether the GR or the anomalous CS effects produce the entanglement.</p>

At low thickness, the force density is proportional to the square of the thickness, but this is the case at low thicknesses, when the continuum model is no longer applicable.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> H. Solki, Ali Motazedifard, M. H. Naderi, A. Youssefi, R. Roknizadeh</p>
            <p>We propose an experimentally feasible optomechanical system (OMS) that is dispersively driven and operates in the reversed dissipation regime (RDR), where the mechanical damping rate far exceeds the cavity decay rate. We demonstrate that coherent, fast-time modulation of the driving laser frequency-on time scales longer than the mechanical decoherence time-allows for adiabatic elimination of the mechanical mode, resulting in strong parametric amplification of quantum vacuum fluctuations of the intracavity field. This mechanism, known as the parametric dynamical Casimir effect (parametric-DCE), leads to the generation of Casimir photons. In the dispersive RDR, we find that the total system Hamiltonian-including the DCE term-is intrinsically modified by a generalized optomechanical Kerr-type nonlinearity. This nonlinearity not only saturates the mean number of radiated Casimir photons on short time scales, even without dissipation, but also induces oscillatory behavior in their dynamics and quantum characteristics. Remarkably, the presence of the Kerr nonlinearity causes the generated DCE photons to exhibit nonclassical features, including sub-Poissonian statistics, negative Wigner function and quadrature squeezing which can be controlled by adjusting the system parameters. The proposed nonclassical microwave radiation source possesses the potential to be applied in quantum information processing, quantum computing as well as microwave quantum sensing.</p>

            <h2>There is no ultrastrong coupling with photons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Diego FernÃ¡ndez de la Pradilla, Esteban Moreno, Johannes Feist</p>
            <p>Theoretical accounts of ultrastrongly coupled light-matter systems commonly assume that it arises from the interaction of an emitter with propagating photon modes supported by a structure, understanding photons as the excitations of the transverse electromagnetic field. This description discards the Coulomb interaction between the emitter and structure charges. Here, we show with a general argument based on electromagnetic constraints that the emitter-photon coupling strength is fundamentally limited. Accordingly, we conclude that the ultrastrong coupling regime cannot be reached with photons. Instead, it must originate from the Coulomb interactions between charges. A further corollary is that the so-called polarization self-energy term does not need to be included. We illustrate our claims by solving an analytical model of the paradigmatic case of an emitter next to a metallic nanosphere. These findings shed light on the fundamental processes underlying ultrastrong coupling, clarify the role of the polarization self-energy term and compel a reevaluation of previous literature.</p>

However, no general approach for quantizing the electromagnetic fields and treating quantum light-matter interactions in such structures exists.

We use our approach to propose a framework for strong light-matter coupling in which collective excitations of periodic arrays of quantum emitters are strongly coupled to the light modes supported by the metasurface, leading to the formation of crystal polaritons. As a proof-of-principle example of their potential, we show that interactions between crystal polaritons can lead to an efficient and directional generation of entangled photon pairs.</p>

            <h2>Photon-mediated interactions and dynamics of coherently driven quantum emitters in complex photonic environments</h2>

            <p>In recent years, Born-Markov master equations based on tracing out the electromagnetic degrees of freedom have been extensively employed in the description of quantum optical phenomena originating from photon-mediated interactions in quantum emitter ensembles. The breakdown of these effective models, built on assumptions such as ensemble spectral homogeneity, an unstructured photonic density of states, and weak light-matter coupling, has also recently attracted considerable attention. Here, we investigate the accuracy of this well-established framework beyond the most conventional, and extensively explored, spontaneous emission configuration. Specifically, we consider a system comprising two coherently driven and detuned quantum emitters, embedded within a hybrid photonic-plasmonic cavity, formed by a metallic nanorod integrated into a high-refractive-index dielectric microresonator. The local density of photonic states in this structure exhibits a complex frequency dependence, making it a compelling platform for exploring photon-mediated interactions beyond the assumptions above. We benchmark this modeling approach for the quantum dynamics of the emitter pair against exact calculations based on a macroscopic field quantization formalism, providing an illustrative assessment of its validity in significantly structured and dispersive photonic environments. Our analysis reveals four distinct regimes of laser driving and frequency splitting that lead to markedly different levels of accuracy in the effective model.</p>

            <p>We study the entanglement properties of two-mode bosonic Gaussian states based on their multi-mode counting statistics. We exploit the idea that measuring high-order correlations of particle numbers can reveal entanglement without making any assumptions about the coherence of the fields. We show that the two- and four-body number correlations are sufficient to fully characterize the entanglement of two-mode bosonic Gaussian states for which each mode exhibits a thermal distribution. In addition, we derive an entanglement witness based on two-body correlations alone. Our findings are of great importance because it becomes possible to reveal entanglement in a series of recent experiments.</p>

            <p>Quantum observables of generic many-body systems exhibit a universal pattern of growth in the Krylov space of operators. This pattern becomes particularly manifest in the Lanczos basis, where the evolution superoperator assumes the tridiagonal form. According to the universal operator growth hypothesis, the nonzero elements of the superoperator, known as Lanczos coefficients, grow asymptotically linearly. We introduce and explore broad families of Lanczos coefficients that are consistent with the universal operator growth and lead to the exactly solvable dynamics. Within these families, the subleading terms of asymptotic expansion of the Lanczos sequence can be controlled and fine-tuned to produce diverse dynamical patterns. For one of the families, the Krylov complexity is computed exactly.</p>

            <p>Understanding and controlling non-equilibrium dynamics in quantum many-body systems is a fundamental challenge in modern physics, with profound implications for advancing quantum technologies. Typically, periodically driven systems in the absence of conservation laws thermalize to a featureless "infinite-temperature" state, erasing all memory of their initial conditions. However, this paradigm can break down through mechanisms such as integrability, many-body localization, quantum many-body scars, and Hilbert space fragmentation. Here, we report the experimental observation of dynamical freezing, a distinct mechanism of thermalization breakdown in driven systems, and demonstrate its application in quantum sensing using an ensemble of approximately $10^4$ interacting nitrogen-vacancy spins in diamond. By precisely controlling the driving frequency and detuning, we observe emergent long-lived spin magnetization and coherent oscillatory micromotions, persisting over timescales exceeding the interaction-limited coherence time ($T_2$) by more than an order of magnitude. Leveraging these unconventional dynamics, we develop a dynamical-freezing-enhanced ac magnetometry that extends optimal sensing times far beyond $T_2$, outperforming conventional dynamical decoupling magnetometry with a 4.3 dB sensitivity enhancement. Our results not only provide clear experimental observation of dynamical freezing -- a peculiar mechanism defying thermalization through emergent conservation laws -- but also establish a robust control method generally applicable to diverse physical platforms, with broad implications in quantum metrology and beyond.</p>

            <p>Majorization theory is a powerful mathematical tool to compare the disorder in distributions, with wide-ranging applications in many fields including mathematics, physics, information theory, and economics. While majorization theory typically focuses on probability distributions, quasiprobability distributions provide a pivotal framework for advancing our understanding of quantum mechanics, quantum information, and signal processing. Here, we introduce a notion of majorization for continuous quasiprobability distributions over infinite measure spaces. Generalizing a seminal theorem by Hardy, Littlewood, and PÃ³lya, we prove the equivalence of four definitions for both majorization and relative majorization in this setting. We give several applications of our results in the context of quantum resource theories, obtaining new families of resource monotones and no-goes for quantum state conversions. A prominent example we explore is the Wigner function in quantum optics. More generally, our results provide an extensive majorization framework for assessing the disorder of integrable functions over infinite measure spaces.</p>

            <p>Pump-probe spectroscopy is a powerful tool for probing response dynamics of quantum many-body systems in and out-of-equilibrium. Quantum computers have proved useful in simulating such experiments by exciting the system, evolving, and then measuring observables to first order, all in one setting. Here, we use this approach to investigate the mixed-field Ising model, where the longitudinal field plays the role of a confining potential that prohibits the spread of the excitations, spinons, or domain walls into space. We study the discrete bound states that arise from such a setting and their evolution under different quench dynamics by initially pumping the chain out of equilibrium and then probing various non-equal time correlation functions. Finally, we study false vacuum decay, where initially one expects unhindered propagation of the ground state, or true vacuum, bubbles into the lattice, but instead sees the emergence of Bloch oscillations that are directly the reason for the long-lived oscillations in this finite-size model. Our work sets the stage for simulating systems out-of-equilibrium on classical and quantum computers using pump-probe experiments without needing ancillary qubits.</p>

            <h2>Improved Simulation of Asynchronous Entanglement Distribution in Noisy Quantum Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emma Hughes, William Munizzi, Prineha Narang</p>
            <p>This work introduces a lightweight simulation framework for evaluating asynchronous entanglement distribution protocols under realistic error models. We focus on two contemporary protocols: sequential, where entanglement is established one node at a time, and parallel, where all nodes attempt to generate entanglement simultaneously. We evaluate the performance of each protocol using two key metrics: the fidelity of distributed entangled states, and the hashing rate, a measure of entanglement efficiency. These metrics are compared between both protocols across a range of network sizes and noise parameters. We demonstrate that the parallel protocol consistently outperforms the sequential, particularly in the hashing rate metric due to reduced runtime, suggesting that parallel protocols are a strong candidate for a realizable quantum Internet. Our framework offers an accessible and scalable tool for evaluating entanglement distribution strategies, by reducing the simulation of complex quantum processes to simple memory time calculations.</p>

            <p>Full reconstruction of quantum states from measurement samples is often a prohibitively complex task, both in terms of the experimental setup and the scaling of the sample size with the system. This motivates the relatively easier task of certifying application-specific quantities using measurements that are not tomographically complete, i.e. that provide only partial information about the state related to the application of interest. Here, we focus on simplifying the measurements needed to certify non-Gaussianity in bosonic systems, a resource related to quantum advantage in various information processing tasks. We show that the statistics of a single quadrature measurement, corresponding to standard homodyne detection in quantum optics, can witness arbitrary degrees of non-Gaussianity as quantified by stellar rank. Our results are based on a version of Hudson's theorem for wavefunctions, proved in a companion paper [1], revealing that the zeros in a homodyne distribution are signatures of quantum non-Gaussianity and higher stellar ranks. The validity of our witnesses is supported by a technical result showing that sets of states with bounded energy and finite stellar rank are compact. We provide an analysis of sample complexity, noise robustness, and experimental prospects. Our work drastically simplifies the setup required to detect quantum non-Gaussianity in bosonic quantum states. and experimental prospects.

            <h2>Context-Dependent Time-Energy Uncertainty Relations from Projective Quantum Measurements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mathieu Beau</p>
            <p>We introduce a general framework for defining context-dependent time distributions in quantum systems using projective measurements. The time-of-flow (TF) distribution, derived from population transfer rates into a measurement subspace, yields a time--energy uncertainty relation of the form $\Delta \mathcal{T} \cdot \Delta H \geq \hbar / (6\sqrt{3}) \cdot \delta\theta$, where $\delta\theta$ quantifies net population transfer. This bound applies to arbitrary projectors under unitary dynamics and reveals that time uncertainty is inherently measurement-dependent. We demonstrate the framework with two applications: a general time-of-arrival (TOA)-energy uncertainty relation and a driven three-level system under detuned coherent driving. The TF framework unifies timing observables across spin, atomic, and matter-wave systems, and offers an experimentally accessible route to probing quantum timing in controlled measurements.</p>

            <p>A scaled trapped-ion quantum computer will require efficient fluorescence collection across a large area. Here we propose and demonstrate a compact monolithically integrated system featuring a metalens fabricated on the backside of a surface ion trap. A 40$\times$100 $\mu$m aperture enables a simulated point-source collection efficiency of 0.91% and a measured point-source detection efficiency of 0.58%. Increasing the aperture area to 40$\times$600 $\mu$m boosts the simulated collection efficiency to 3.17%$-$comparable to that of a conventional objective with a numerical aperture of 0.35. Further improvements are possible by co-optimizing the electrode and aperture geometry. An undercut of the electrode substrate at the aperture ensures a large distance between the ion and dielectric substrate without compromising collection efficiency. The metalens directly collimates the collected fluorescence, eliminating the need for a high numerical aperture objective. An array of such readout zones will offer a compact, scalable solution for high-fidelity parallel readout in next-generation trapped-ion quantum processors.</p>

Both rigorous mathematical proofs and numerical simulations conclusively indicate Bayesian statistics is the source of this advantage, a finding that invites further inquiry into the power of statistics to expedite the search for quantum utility.</p>

            <p>Inspired by environmental sciences, we develop a framework to quantify the energy needed to generate quantum entanglement via noisy quantum channels, focusing on the hardware-independent, i.e. fundamental cost. Within this framework, we define a measure of the minimal fundamental energy consumption rate per distributed entanglement (expressed in Joule per ebit). We then derive a lower bound on the energy cost of distributing a maximally entangled state via a quantum channel, which yields a quantitative estimate of energy investment per entangled bit for future quantum networks. We thereby show that irreversibility in entanglement theory implies a non-zero energy cost in standard entanglement distribution protocols. We further establish an upper bound on the fundamental energy consumption rate of entanglement distribution by determining the minimal energy required to implement quantum operations via classical control. To this end, we formulate the axioms for an energy cost measure and introduce a Hamiltonian model for classically-controlled quantum operations. The fundamental cost is then defined as the infimum energy over all such Hamiltonian protocols, with or without specific hardware constraints. The study of the energy cost of a quantum operation is general enough to be naturally applicable to quantum computing and is of independent interest. Finally, we evaluate the energy demands of three entanglement distillation protocols for photonic polarization qubits, finding that, due to entanglement irreversibility, their required energy exceeds the fundamental lower bound by many orders of magnitude. The introduced paradigm can be applied to other quantum resources, with appropriate changes depending on their nature.</p>

            <p>Device-independent quantum key distribution (DI QKD) offers unparalleled cryptographic security by eliminating trust requirements for quantum devices, yet has remained impractical for long-distance implementation due to fundamental rate limitations. Here, we propose the first experimentally viable schemes for long-distance DI QKD using two fully photonic approaches with heralded entanglement distribution using spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) sources. Both schemes achieve key rate scaling with the square root of channel transmissivity $\eta_t$, matching the twin-field protocol advantage rather than the prohibitive linear decay of conventional QKD. We demonstrate positive key rates at detector efficiencies as low as 83\%, bringing DI QKD within reach of the current superconducting detector technology. Our security analysis employs the Entropy Accumulation Theorem to establish rigorous finite-size bounds, while numerical optimization yields custom Bell certificates that surpass standard approaches by 2--3 times at maximum transmission distances. This work represents a critical milestone toward device-independent security in quantum communication networks, providing experimentalists with practical implementation pathways while maintaining the strongest possible security guarantees against quantum adversaries.</p>

            <p>Silicon carbide (SiC) has attracted significant attention as a promising quantum material due to its ability to host long-lived, optically addressable color centers with solid-state photonic interfaces. The CMOS compatibility of 4H-SiCOI (silicon-carbide-on-insulator) makes it an ideal platform for integrated quantum photonic devices and circuits. However, the deterministic integration of single spin defects into high-performance photonic cavities on this platform has remained a key challenge. In this work, we demonstrate the deterministic and scalable coupling of both ensemble (PL4) and single PL6 spin defects into monolithic bullseye cavities on the 4H-SiCOI platform. By tuning the cavity resonance, we achieve a 40-fold enhancement of the zero-phonon line (ZPL) intensity from ensemble PL4 defects, corresponding to a Purcell factor of approximately 5.0. For deterministically coupled single PL6 defects, we observe a threefold increase in the saturated photon count rate, confirm single-photon emission, and demonstrate coherent control of the spin state through optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR), resonant excitation, and Rabi oscillations. These advancements establish a viable pathway for developing scalable, high-performance SiC-based quantum photonic circuits.</p>

            <p>This paper presents strategies for enhancing the robustness of bidirectional quantum teleportation (BQT) through environment-assisted and weak measurement techniques. BQT is a crucial component of distributed quantum networks, allowing for the bilateral transfer of quantum information between two nodes. While perfect teleportation necessitates maximally entangled states, these are vulnerable to degradation due to inherent decoherence. We propose a BQT scheme that enables the bilateral transfer of arbitrary qubits between nodes via amplitude damping channels (ADC), aiming to optimize fidelity using weak measurements in the final step of the process. Environment-assisted measurements (EAM) are used to establish a four-qubit channel composed of two Bell states. We explore two situations: (I) where only the recovery qubits pass through amplitude damping channels and (II) where the entire four-qubit channel is subjected to ADC. Our findings demonstrate a balance between average fidelity and success probability when the weak measurement strength ($q_w$) is constrained by the decay rate ($p$), specifically $q_w \in {[0,p]}$. Perfect BQT is achieved when $q_w = p$, indicating complete suppression of ADC effects. On the other hand, a decline in both average fidelity and success probability is noted when the weak measurement strength surpasses the ADC strength, marking the prohibited domain as $q_w \in {(p,1]}$. Additionally, our secured BQT protocol consistently outperforms the unprotected scheme in both scenarios, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed protection strategies.</p>

            <p>It is shown that both, standard general relativity (GR) and Chern-Simons (CS) gravity, the latter containing chiral gravitational anomaly terms, seed the production of pairs of entangled gravitons in a multi-mode squeezed state. This involves the interaction of gravitons with the axionic cloud surrounding a superradiant Kerr (rotating) black hole background. The order of magnitude of the squeezing effect, specifically the number of graviton excitations in the squeezed vacuum, is estimated in the non-relativistic limit, relevant for the superradiance process. It is found analytically that the squeezing from the GR process of annihilation of two axions into two gravitons, dominates, by many orders of magnitude, that coming from the axion decay into two gravitons, induced by the higher-derivative CS term. It is also shown that significant squeezing effects are produced in the case of long-lived axionic clouds, whose lifetimes are much longer than the timescale for which superradiance is effective.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chris Gustin, Juanjuan Ren, Sebastian Franke, Stephen Hughes</p>
            <p>Phenomenological approaches to photon loss have long been the workhorse of cavity-QED, but prove inadequate in the presence of sufficiently broadband light-matter interactions. We present a rigorous and ab initio derivation of a quantum master equation for a quantized optical cavity mode coupled to a dipole, using a quasinormal mode (QNM) quantization procedure for plasmonic and dielectric open-system cavity-QED, which is valid in broadband light-matter interaction regimes, including ultrastrong coupling (USC). The theory supports general three-dimensional resonators with arbitrary dispersion and loss, and thus can be applied to a wide range of open cavities. Our ab initio and gauge-invariant approach fully recovers the recent result of Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 123601 (2025) for the spectral density of a quantized cavity with a single dipole, exhibits a dissipative classical-quantum correspondence for bosonic Hopfield model systems, and reveals important departures from previous heuristic assumptions about system-bath coupling. We identify a new criterion for what we term the "broadband" dissipative regime of cavity-QED, where phenomenological models require corrections in accordance with the intrinsic and spatially-dependent complex phase of the QNM, and also shed light on fundamental limits to single-mode models in extreme coupling regimes. Using plasmonic and dielectric cavity examples, we show validity ranges of our QNM master equation and spectral USC calculations, and discuss prospects for near-term experimental observation of broadband dissipative effects.</p>

            <p>Luttinger liquids occupy a special place in physics as the most understood case of essentially quantum many-body systems. The experimental mission of measuring its main prediction, power laws in observable quantities, has already produced a body of exponents in different semiconductor and metallic structures. Here, we combine tunneling spectroscopy with density-dependent transport measurements in the same quantum wires over more than two orders of magnitude in temperature to very low electron temperatures down to $\sim$40 mK. This reveals that, when the second 1D subband becomes populated, the temperature dependence splits into two ranges with different exponents in the power-law dependence of the conductance, both dominated by the finite-size effect of the end-tunneling process.

            <p>We develop, in the AdS/CFT correspondence, a method to compute correlation functions when the CFT is governed by the Lindblad equation for open quantum systems, via the AdS theory. Using a simple example in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, we demonstrate that the predictions of the AdS theory based on our method match the direct computations in the dual CFT. We also briefly discuss the relaxation problem and the holographic entropy in this example.</p>

            <h2>Protected quantum gates using qubit doublons in dynamical optical lattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yann Kiefer, Zijie Zhu, Lars Fischer, Samuel Jele, Marius GÃ¤chter, Giacomo Bisson, Konrad Viebahn, Tilman Esslinger</p>
            <p>Quantum computing represents a central challenge in modern science. Neutral atoms in optical lattices have emerged as a leading computing platform, with collisional gates offering a stable mechanism for quantum logic. However, previous experiments have treated ultracold collisions as a dynamically fine-tuned process, which obscures the underlying quantum- geometry and statistics crucial for realising intrinsically robust operations. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a purely geometric two-qubit swap gate by transiently populating qubit doublon states of fermionic atoms in a dynamical optical lattice. The presence of these doublon states, together with fermionic exchange anti-symmetry, enables a two-particle quantum holonomy -- a geometric evolution where dynamical phases are absent. This yields a gate mechanism that is intrinsically protected against fluctuations and inhomogeneities of the confining potentials. The resilience of the gate is further reinforced by time-reversal and chiral symmetries of the Hamiltonian. We experimentally validate this exceptional protection, achieving a loss-corrected amplitude fidelity of $99.91(7)\%$ measured across the entire system consisting of more than $17'000$ atom pairs. When combined with recently developed topological pumping methods for atom transport, our results pave the way for large-scale, highly connected quantum processors. This work introduces a new paradigm for quantum logic, transforming fundamental symmetries and quantum statistics into a powerful resource for fault-tolerant computation.</p>

            <h2>Quantum complexity phase transition in fermionic quantum circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei Xia, Yijia Zhou, Xingze Qiu, Xiaopeng Li</p>
            <p>Understanding the complexity of quantum many-body systems has been attracting much attention recently for its fundamental importance in characterizing complex quantum phases beyond the scope of quantum entanglement. Here, we investigate Krylov complexity in quantum percolation models (QPM) and establish unconventional phase transitions emergent from the interplay of exponential scaling of the Krylov complexity and the number of spanning clusters in QPM. We develop a general scaling theory for Krylov complexity phase transitions (KCPT) on QPM, and obtain exact results for the critical probabilities and exponents. For non-interacting systems across diverse lattices (1D/2D/3D regular, Bethe, and quasicrystals), our scaling theory reveals that the KCPT coincides with the classical percolation transition. In contrast, for interacting systems, we find the KCPT develops a generic separation from the percolation transition due to the highly complex quantum many-body effects, which is analogous to the Griffiths effect in the critical disorder phase transition. To test our theoretical predictions, we provide a concrete protocol for measuring the Krylov complexity, which is accessible to present experiments.</p>

            <h2>Physical Emulation of Nonlinear Spin System Hamiltonians via Closed Loop Feedforward Control of a Collective Atomic Spin</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ian Pannemarsh</p>
            <p>In recent decades the field of quantum computation has seen remarkable development. While much progress has been made toward the realization of a fully digital, scalable, and fault tolerant quantum computer, there are still many essential challenges to overcome. In the interim, direct emulation of quantum systems of interest can fill an important gap not only for exploring fundamental questions about many-body physics and the quantum to classical transition, but also for potentially providing alternative methods to verify results from quantum simulations. In this work we will demonstrate a method utilizing closed loop control of the collective magnetic moment of an ensemble of cold neutral atoms via non-destructive measurements to emulate various spin system Hamiltonians. By modifying the feedback control law appropriately we are able to generate nonlinear dynamical behavior in the ensemble, allowing us to explore the physics of collective spin systems at mesoscopic scales. Moreover, controlling the number of atoms in the collective spin can potentially allow us to investigate these dynamics in the transition from fully quantum to the classical limit. In particular, we emulate two models: the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) Hamiltonian, and a closely related model, the Kicked Top. In the former case, we show that our system undergoes a symmetry-breaking phase transition in the expected parameter regime. In the latter, we explore two interesting aspects: the formation of chaos, and a dynamically driven time crystal phase. We will then discuss the advantages and limits of this approach.</p>

            <h2>Evaluation of Noise and Crosstalk in Neutral Atom Quantum Computers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pranet Sharma, Yizhuo Tan, Konstantinos-Nikolaos Papadopoulos, Jakub Szefer</p>
            <p>This work explores and evaluates noise and crosstalk in neutral atom quantum computers. Neutral atom quantum computers are a promising platform for analog Hamiltonian simulations, which rely on a sequence of time-dependent Hamiltonians to model the dynamics of the larger system and are particularly useful for problems in optimization, physics, and molecular dynamics. However, the viability of running multiple simulations in a co-located or multi-tenant environment is limited by noise and crosstalk. This work conducts an analysis of how noise faced by simulations changes over time, and investigates the effects of spatial co-location on simulation fidelity. Findings of this work demonstrate that the close proximity of concurrent simulations can increase crosstalk between them. To mitigate this issue, a Moving Target Defense (MTD) strategy is proposed and evaluated. The results confirm that the MTD is a viable technique for enabling safe and reliable co-location of simulations on neutral atom quantum hardware.</p>

            <h2>Interference between lossy quantum evolutions activates information backflow</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sutapa Saha, Ujjwal Sen</p>
            <p>Quantum evolutions are often non-unitary and in such cases, they are frequently regarded as lossy. Such lossiness, however, does not necessarily persist throughout the evolution, and there can often be intermediate time-spans during which information ebbs in the environment to re-flood the system -- an event known as information backflow. This phenomenon serves as a well-established and sufficient indicator of non-Markovian behavior of open quantum dynamics. Nevertheless, not all non-Markovian dynamics exhibit such backflow. We find that when interference is allowed between two quantum evolutions that individually generate non-Markovianity and yet do not exhibit information backflow, it becomes possible to retrieve information from the environment. Furthermore, we show that this setup involving coherently-controlled quantum operation trajectories provides enhanced performance and is more robust compared to an alternate coherently-controlled arrangement of the quantum switch.</p>

            <h2>Quantum optical experiments towards atom-photon entanglement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Markus Weber</p>
            <p>In 1935 EPR used the assumption of local realism to conclude in a Gedankenexperiment with two entangled particles that quantum mechanics is not complete. Based on this idea Bell constructed an inequality whereby experimental tests could distinguish between quantum mechanics and local-realistic theories. Many experiments have since been done that are consistent with quantum mechanics, disproving the concept of local realism. But all these tests suffered from loopholes allowing a local-realistic explanation of the experimental observations. In this context, of special interest is entanglement between different quantum objects like atoms and photons, because it allows one to entangle distant atoms by the interference of photons. The resulting space-like separation together with the almost perfect detection efficiency of the atoms will allow a first event-ready Bell test closing detection and locality loopholes. The primary goal of the present thesis was the experimental realization of entanglement between a single localized atom and a single spontaneously emitted photon. In the experiment a single optically trapped R87 atom is excited to a state which has two selected decay channels. In the following spontaneous decay a photon is emitted coherently with equal probability into both decay channels. This accounts for perfect correlations between the polarization state of the emitted photon and the Zeeman state of the atom after spontaneous decay. Because these decay channels are spectrally and in all other degrees of freedom indistinguishable, the spin state of the atom is entangled with the polarization state of the photon. To verify entanglement, appropriate correlation measurements in complementary bases of the photon polarization and the internal quantum state of the atom were performed. It is shown, that the generated atom-photon state yields an entanglement fidelity of 0.82.</p>

            <h2>Complexity in multiqubit and many-body systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Imre Varga</p>
            <p>The complexity of $n$-qubit and many body systems is investigated. In case of an $n$-qubit system the disturbance due to depolarization and dephasing is identified based on a certain complexity quantity defined as the difference of the Shannon-entropy and the RÃ©nyi entropy of order two. In case of the effect of the depolarization the quantum system is replaced by a fully separable, i.e. classical state with probability $p$ while it remains unchanged with probability $1-p$. Whereas dephasing is modelled by destructing the appropriate off-diagonal elements of the density matrix also with probability $p$. For both cases the state with maximal complexity marks the border between the most quantum and most classical limits. Furthermore we also show that many body systems modelled using deformed random matrix ensembles, deformed two-body random interaction ensembles and also the system of one-dimensional Heisenberg-model of spins subject to a random, local magnetic field exhibiting many body localization transition, the states with maximal complexity mark the cross-over or the transition point between integrability and full quantum chaos. Finally we address the question of identifying the cross-over in the thermalization properties within large sets of quantum chaotic states using the survival probability of an excitation of a many body system. All these results show that the complexity parameter defined on a combination of the von Neumann entropy and the RÃ©nyi entropy of 2nd order is a meaningful and informative parameter to detect whenever a system is in a cross-over state between the otherwise trivial extremal cases of integrability or localization and quantum chaos or ergodic behavior.</p>

            <h2>Towards Practical Quantum Phase Estimation: A Modular, Scalable, and Adaptive Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alok Shukla, Prakash Vedula</p>
            <p>Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) is a cornerstone algorithm in quantum computing, with applications ranging from integer factorization to quantum chemistry simulations. However, the resource demands of standard QPE, which require a large number of coherent qubits and deep circuits, pose significant challenges for current Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. In this work, we introduce the Adaptive Windowed Quantum Phase Estimation (AWQPE) algorithm, a novel method designed to address the limitations of standard QPE. AWQPE utilizes small, independent blocks of $m > 1$ control qubits to estimate multiple phase bits simultaneously within a "window,'' thereby significantly reducing the number of iterations required to achieve a desired precision. These independent blocks are amenable to parallelization and, when combined with a robust least-significant-bit (LSB) to most-significant-bit (MSB) ambiguity resolution mechanism, enhance the algorithm's accuracy while mitigating the risk of error propagation. Our numerical simulations demonstrate AWQPE's accuracy and robustness, showcasing a distinct balance between resource efficiency and computational speed. This makes AWQPE particularly well-suited for near-term quantum platforms.</p>

            <h2>Scalable and (quantum-accessible) adaptive pseudorandom quantum states and pseudorandom function-like quantum state generators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rishabh Batra, Zhili Chen, Rahul Jain, YaoNan Zhang</p>
            <p>Pseudorandom quantum states (PRS) and pseudorandom function-like quantum state (PRFS) generators are quantum analogues of pseudorandom generators and pseudorandom functions. It is known that PRS (and PRFS) can exist even if BQP = QMA (relative to a quantum oracle) or if P = NP (relative to a classical oracle), which does not allow for the existence of one-way functions (relative to these oracles). Hence, these are potentially weaker objects than quantum-secure one-way functions, which can be used to do quantum cryptography. A desirable property of PRS and PRFS constructions is scalability, which ensures that the security parameter $\lambda$ (which determines indistinguishability from their Haar-random counterparts) is much larger than $n$ (the number of qubits of the output states). This may be important in some applications where PRS and PRFS primitives are used. We present an isometric procedure to prepare quantum states that can be arbitrarily random (i.e., the trace distance from the Haar-random state can be arbitrarily small for the true random case, or the distinguishing advantage can be arbitrarily small for the pseudorandom case). Our procedure provides a new method for scalable PRS that introduces no entanglement or correlations with the environment. This naturally gives the first construction for scalable and (quantum-accessible) adaptive PRFS assuming quantum-secure one-way functions. Our PRFS construction implies various primitives, including long-input PRFS, short-input PRFS, short-output PRFS, non-adaptive PRFS, and classical-accessible adaptive PRFS. This new construction may be helpful in some simplification of the microcrypt zoo.</p>

Our construction is based on defining 2D coproducts through horizontal and vertical maps that satisfy compatibility and associativity conditions, enabling the consistent growth of vector spaces over lattice sites. We present several examples of 2D bialgebras, including group-like and Lie algebra-inspired constructions and a quasi-1D coproduct instance that is applicable to Taft-Hopf algebras and to quantum groups. The approach is further applied to the quantum group $U_q[su(2)]$, for which we construct 2D generalizations of its generators, analyze $q$-deformed singlet states, and derive a 2D R-matrix satisfying an intertwining relation in the semiclassical limit. Additionally, we show how tensor network states, particularly PEPS, naturally induce 2D coalgebra structures when supplemented with appropriate boundary conditions. Our results establish a local and algebraically consistent method to embed quantum group symmetries into higher-dimensional lattice systems, potentially connecting to the emerging theory of fusion 2-categories and categorical symmetries in quantum many-body physics.</p>

            <p>In the context of Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs), selecting an appropriate ansatz is crucial for efficient problem-solving. Hamiltonian expressibility has been introduced as a metric to quantify a circuit's ability to uniformly explore the energy landscape associated with a Hamiltonian ground state search problem. However, its influence on solution quality remains largely unexplored. In this work, we estimate the Hamiltonian expressibility of a well-defined set of circuits applied to various Hamiltonians using a Monte Carlo-based approach. We analyze how ansatz depth influences expressibility and identify the most and least expressive circuits across different problem types. We then train each ansatz using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and analyze the correlation between solution quality and this http URL results indicate that, under ideal or low-noise conditions and particularly for small-scale problems, ansÃ¤tze with high Hamiltonian expressibility yield better performance for problems with non-diagonal Hamiltonians and superposition-state solutions. Conversely, circuits with low expressibility are more effective for problems whose solutions are basis states, including those defined by diagonal Hamiltonians. Under noisy conditions, low-expressibility circuits remain preferable for basis-state problems, while intermediate expressibility yields better results for some problems involving superposition-state solutions.</p>

Using symmetric time dynamics, we show that it is possible to recover real-valued Krylov matrix elements, which significantly reduces the circuit depth and enhances compatibility with shallow quantum architectures. We validate our method through numerical simulations on paradigmatic Hamiltonians exhibiting time-reversal symmetry, including the transverse-field Ising model and a lattice gauge theory, demonstrating accurate spectral estimation and favorable circuit constructions.</p>

A proof that this enables universal control over bosonic modes is provided, expanding the toolkit for continuous-variable quantum information processing. Using modulated Jaynes-Cummings interactions in circuit QED, the simulation predicts intra-cavity squeezing of 13dB (single-mode), 4dB (superimposed single-mode), and 12dB (two-mode), with the latter two yet to be demonstrated experimentally.

Here, we construct a generic quantum solver for NP problems based on Grover's search algorithm, specifically tailored for Rydberg-atom quantum computing platforms. We design the quantum oracles in the search algorithm using parallelizable single-qubit and multi-qubit entangling gates in the Rydberg atom system, yielding a unified framework for solving a broad class of NP problems with provable quadratic quantum speedup. We analyze the experimental resource requirements considering the unique qubit connectivity of the dynamically reconfigurable qubits in the optical tweezer array. The required qubit number scales linearly with the problem size, representing a significant improvement over existing Rydberg-based quantum annealing approaches that incur quadratic overhead. These results provide a concrete roadmap for future experimental efforts towards demonstrating quantum advantage in NP problem solving using Rydberg atomic systems.

            <p>Efficient simulation of many-body quantum systems is central to advances in physics, chemistry, and quantum computing, with a key question being whether the simulation cost scales polynomially with the system size. In this work, we analyze many-body quantum systems with Coulomb interactions, which are fundamental to electronic and molecular systems. We prove that Trotterization for such unbounded Hamiltonians achieves a $1/4$-order convergence rate, with explicit polynomial dependence on the number of particles. The result holds for all initial wavefunctions in the domain of the Hamiltonian, and the $1/4$-order convergence rate is optimal, as previous studies have shown that it can be saturated by a specific initial eigenstate. The main challenges arise from the many-body structure and the singular nature of the Coulomb potential. Our proof strategy differs from prior state-of-the-art Trotter analyses, addressing both difficulties in a unified framework.</p>

The three terms respectively represent coherent coupling, loss (on state $|1\rangle$), and gain (on state $|0\rangle$). However, realizing the gain term $+i\gamma|0\rangle\langle0|$ has remained an outstanding challenge for quantum system, especially on ground state -- no theoretical or experimental schemes have definitively demonstrated its achievement. While systems omitting this gain term can exhibit a passively $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric energy spectrum (featuring a parallel imaginary shift) and display related phenomena, they fail to capture the full physical behavior and unique properties inherent to truly $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric systems. In this manuscript, we propose a method to achieve effective gain on the ground state $|0\rangle$ ($+i\gamma|0\rangle\langle0|$) after averaging all trajectories, by integrating the SÃ¸rensen-Reiter effective operator method with the Wiseman-Milburn master equation for continuous measurement and instantaneous feedback control after averaging the evolution over all trajectories. This approach provides a possible pathway to efficiently construct truly $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric quantum devices, offering a powerful platform for engineering quantum resources vital for quantum information technology applications.</p>

            <p>We propose a physical system consisting of two optical cavities and a two-level system (TLS), which can be viewed as a double single-sided cavity system. The two cavities are crossed each other in a mutually perpendicular way and are both single-sided. The TLS is coupled to the two cavities. The universal input-output relation of the system, the reflection and transmission coefficients are derived by exploiting the probability amplitude method. Then by using the nitrogen-vacancy center instead of the TLS, we generate the controlled-phase gate and the controlled-controlled-phase gate on the photon qubits, with simple protocols that can be accomplished in both weak and strong coupling regimes. The protocols are shown to give rise to high fidelities and gate efficiencies.</p>

            <h2>Genuine multipartite entanglement as a probe of many-body localization in disordered spin chains with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Triyas Sapui, Keshav Das Agarwal, Tanoy Kanti Konar, Leela Ganesh Chandra Lakkaraju, Aditi Sen De</p>
            <p>We demonstrate that the quenched average genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) can approach its maximum value in the ergodic phase of a disordered quantum spin model. In contrast, GME vanishes in the many-body localized (MBL) phase, both in equilibrium and in the long-time dynamical steady state, indicating a lack of useful entanglement in the localized regime. To establish this, we analyze the disordered Heisenberg spin chain subjected to a random magnetic field and incorporating two- and three-body Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions. We exhibit that the behavior of GME, in both static eigenstates and in dynamically evolved states from an initial Neel configuration, serves as a reliable indicator of the critical disorder strength required for the ergodic-to-MBL transition. The identified transition point aligns well with standard indicators such as the gap ratio and correlation length. Moreover, we find that the presence of DM interactions, particularly the three-body one, significantly stabilizes the thermal phase and delays the onset of localization. This shift in the transition point is consistently reflected in both static and dynamical analyses, reinforcing GME as a robust probe for MBL transitions.</p>

            <p>We analyze a system of three or more qubits collectively interacting with a zero-temperature bosonic bath characterized by a Lorentzian spectral density. Our study focuses on the emergence of decoherence-free subspaces and the genuine-entanglement dynamics. Specifically, we study the three qubit system in detail, where the genuine entanglement is quantified through the convex roof extension of negativity. By examining the transition between Markovian and non-Markovian regimes, we reveal how the entanglement in the system evolves under the influence of the environment. Notably, we observe transitions between genuinely multi-qubit entangled and bi-separable states, including a revival of entanglement even in the Markovian regime. These findings provide insights into the robustness of quantum correlations and the conditions under which decoherence-protected states can be sustained.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Simulation of Nuclear Dynamics in First Quantization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luca Spagnoli, Chiara Lissoni, Alessandro Roggero</p>
            <p>The study of real time dynamics of nuclear systems is of great importance to provide theoretical predictions of cross sections relevant for both terrestrial experiments as well as applications in astrophysics. First principles simulations of these dynamical processes is however hindered by an exponential cost in classical resources and the possibility of performing scalable simulations using quantum computers is currently an active field of research. In this work we provide the first complete characterization of the resource requirements for studying nuclear dynamics with the full Leading Order (LO) pionless EFT Hamiltonian in first quantization employing simulation strategies using both product formulas as well as Quantum Signal Processing. In particular, we show that time evolution of such an Hamiltonian can be performed with polynomial resources in the number of particles, and logarithmic resources in the number of single-particle basis states. This result provides an exponential improvement compared with previous work on the same Hamiltonian model in second quantization. We find that interesting simulations for low energy nuclear scattering could be achievable with tens of millions of T gates and few hundred logical qubits suggesting that the study of simple nuclear reactions could be amenable for early fault tolerant quantum platforms.</p>

            <p>Cluster states are a fundamental resource for continuous-variable quantum computing, enabling measurement-based protocols that can scale beyond the limitations of qubit-based architectures. Here, we demonstrate on-demand generation of multimode entangled microwave cluster states using a programmable Josephson Traveling-Wave Parametric Amplifier (JTWPA) operated in the three-wave mixing regime. By injecting a tailored, non-equidistant set of pump tones via an arbitrary waveform generator, we engineer frequency-specific nonlinear couplings between multiple frequency modes. The entanglement structure is verified via frequency-resolved heterodyne detection of quadrature nullifiers, confirming the target graph topology of the cluster state. Our approach allows reconfigurability through the pumps spectrum and supports scalability by leveraging the wide bandwidth and spatial homogeneity of the JTWPA. This platform opens new avenues for scalable measurement-based quantum information processing in the microwave domain, compatible with superconducting circuit architectures.</p>

            <p>A quantum computing circuit is presented that approximates a single spin wave quantum on a linear chain of spin 1/2 particles described by a Heisenberg Hamiltonian. The circuit is a product state where each qubit represents a spin. The spin wave motion is represented by opening the cone angle using Y rotations and then adding progressive Z rotations along the chain to represent wave propagation. We show analytically that this product state yields the correct dispersion relation in the limit of an unbounded chain. This surprising observation is confirmed using both a simulator and various quantum processors. The quantum circuit calculation leads to insight into the connection between classical and quantum descriptions of spin waves, and may also be useful for characterizing the error in quantum processors.</p>

            <p>Understanding transport phenomena in quantum spin systems has long intrigued physicists due to their potential applications in spintronic devices and spin qubits. Here, using a superconducting-qubit-based transmon device, we show that pre-fault-tolerant digital quantum simulation is reliable for studying transport phenomena via spin-current autocorrelation function (ACF). While quantum simulations of the spin-spin ACF have been used to probe spin transport, methods based on the spin-current ACF have yet to be demonstrated due to their high gate cost, despite offering more direct information relevant to the transport properties. Overcoming the resource constraints set by indirect measurement schemes like the Hadamard test, we showcase a direct measurement scheme that utilizes non-unitary operations, in particular mid-circuit measurements, to investigate spin transport for the 40-site 1D XXZ Heisenberg model in the near-ballistic, superdiffusive, and diffusive regimes. We successfully reproduce the expected power-law behavior in the superdiffusive regime and vanishing of the Drude weight in the diffusive regime.</p>

            <h2>Solitons, chaos, and quantum phenomena: a deterministic approach to the SchrÃ¶dinger equation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> DamiÃ  Gomila</p>
            <p>We show that the SchrÃ¶dinger equation describes the ensemble mean dynamics of solitons in a Galilean invariant field theory where we interpret solitons as particles. On a zero background, solitons move classically, following Newton`s second law, however, on a non-zero amplitude chaotic background, their momentum and position fluctuate fulfilling an exact uncertainty relation, which give rise to the emergence of quantum phenomena. The Schrodinger equation for the ensemble of solitons is obtained from this exact uncertainty relation, and the amplitude of the background fluctuations is what corresponds to the value of $\hbar$. We confirm our analytical results running simulations of solitons moving against a potential barrier and comparing the ensemble probabilities with the predictions of the time dependent SchrÃ¶dinger equation, providing a deterministic version of the quantum tunneling effect. We conclude with a discussion of how our theory does not present statistical independence between measurement and experiment outcome.</p>

            <p>A quantum thermodynamic system can conserve non-commuting observables, but the consequences of this phenomenon on relaxation are still not fully understood. We investigate this problem by leveraging an observable-dependent approach to equilibration and thermalization in isolated quantum systems. We extend such approach to scenarios with non-commuting charges, and show that it can accurately estimate the equilibrium distribution of coarse observables without access to the energy eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Our predictions do not require weak coupling and are not restricted to local observables, thus providing an advantage over the non-Abelian thermal state. Within this approach, weak values and quasiprobability distributions emerge naturally and play a crucial role in characterizing the equilibrium distributions of observables. We show and numerically confirm that, due to charges' non-commutativity, these weak values can be anomalous even at equilibrium, which has been proven to be a proxy for non-classicality. Our work thus uncovers a novel connection between the relaxation of observables under non-commuting charges, weak values, and Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability distributions.</p>

            <h2>Operational interpretation of the Stabilizer Entropy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lennart Bittel, Lorenzo Leone</p>
            <p>Magic-state resource theory is a fundamental framework with far-reaching applications in quantum error correction and the classical simulation of quantum systems. Recent advances have significantly deepened our understanding of magic as a resource across diverse domains, including many-body physics, nuclear and particle physics, and quantum chemistry. Central to this progress is the stabilizer RÃ©nyi entropy, a computable and experimentally accessible magic monotone. Despite its widespread adoption, a rigorous operational interpretation of the stabilizer entropy has remained an open problem. In this work, we provide such an interpretation in the context of quantum property testing. By showing that the stabilizer entropy is the most robust measurable magic monotone, we demonstrate that the Clifford orbit of a quantum state becomes exponentially indistinguishable from Haar-random states, at a rate governed by the stabilizer entropy $M(\psi)$ and the number of available copies. This implies that the Clifford orbit forms an approximate state $k$-design, with an approximation error $\Theta(\exp(-M(\psi))$. Conversely, we establish that the optimal probability of distinguishing a given quantum state from the set of stabilizer states is also governed by its stabilizer entropy. These results reveal that the stabilizer entropy quantitatively characterizes the transition from stabilizer states to universal quantum states, thereby offering a comprehensive operational perspective of the stabilizer entropy as a quantum resource.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional many-body quantum systems can exhibit topological order and support collective excitations with anyonic statistics different from the usual fermionic or bosonic ones. With the emergence of these exotic point-like particles, it is natural to ask what phases can arise in interacting many-anyon systems. To study this topic, we consider the particular case of Fibonacci anyons subject to an anyonic tight-binding model with nearest-neighbor repulsion on a two-leg ladder. Focusing on the case of half-filling, for low interaction strengths an ''anyonic'' metal is found, whereas for strong repulsion, the anyons form an insulating charge-density wave. Within the latter regime, we introduce an effective one-dimensional model up to sixth order in perturbation theory arising from anyonic superexchange processes. We numerically identify four distinct phases of the effective model, which we characterize using matrix product state methods. These include both the ferro- and antiferromagnetic golden chain, a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ phase, and an incommensurate phase.</p>

We then pinpoint that these quantum effects are supported by intraband and interband torsion leading to nontrivial Dixmier-Douady classes in most known Hopf phases and in more general topological insulators realizing gerbe invariants falling beyond the tenfold classification of topological phases of matter. We furthermore provide an interacting generalization upon introducing many-body gerbe invariants by employing twisted boundary conditions. This opens an avenue to study gerbe invariants realized through higher-dimensional charge fractionalizations that can be electromagnetically probed.</p>

            <p>Quantum complexity of conformal field theory (CFT) states has recently gained significant attention, both as a diagnostic tool in condensed matter systems and in connection with holographic observables probing black hole interiors. Previous studies have primarily focused on cases where all generators of the conformal group contribute equally to the cost of building a circuit. In this work, we present a general framework for studying the complexity of circuits in generic Lie groups, where penalty factors assign relative weights to different generators. Our approach constructs a metric on the coset space of quantum states, induced from a (pseudo-)Riemannian norm on the space of unitary circuits. The geodesics of this metric are interpreted as optimal circuits. The method builds on the formalism of (pseudo-)Riemannian submersions and connects naturally to other prescriptions in the literature, including cost function minimization along stabilizer directions and constructions based on coadjoint orbits. As a concrete application, we compute state complexity for states in one- and two-dimensional CFTs. For specific choices of penalty factors, our prescription yields a positive-definite metric with a viable interpretation as complexity; in other cases, the resulting metric is indefinite. In the viable regime, we derive analytic results when a specific penalty factor is turned off, develop perturbative expansions for small values of the penalty factors, and provide numerical results in the general case. We comment on the relation of our measure of complexity to holography.</p>

            <p>Overcoming the decoherence bottleneck remains a central challenge for advancing coherent superconducting quantum device and information technologies. Solitons -- non-dispersive wave packets stabilized by the collective synchronization of quantum excitations -- offer a robust pathway to mitigating dephasing, yet their realization in superconductors has remained experimentally elusive. Here, we report the observation of a driven soliton state in epitaxial thin films of an iron-based superconductor (Co-doped BaFe$_2$As$_2$), induced by intense, multi-cycle terahertz (THz) periodic driving. The dynamical transition to this soliton state is marked by the emergence of Floquet-like spectral sidebands that exhibit a strongly nonlinear dependence on THz laser field strength and a resonant enhancement with temperature. Quantum kinetic simulations corroborate these observations, allowing us to underpin the emergence of synchronized Anderson pseudo-spin oscillations -- analogous to Dicke superradiance -- mediated by persistent order parameter oscillations. In this coherently driven state, the observed sidebands result from difference-frequency mixing between the THz drive and persistent soliton dynamics. These findings establish a robust framework for coherently driving and controlling superconducting soliton time-crystal-like phases using low dissipation, time-periodic THz fields, enabling prospects for THz-speed quantum gate operations, long-lived quantum memory, and robust quantum sensing based on enhanced macroscopic pseudo-spin coherence.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nathanan Tantivasadakarn, Xinyu Liu, Xie Chen</p>
            <p>Generalized symmetry extends the usual notion of symmetry to ones that are of higher-form, acting on subsystems, non-invertible, etc. The concept was originally defined in the field theory context using the idea of topological defects. On the lattice, an immediate consequence is that a symmetry twist is moved across the system by a sequential quantum circuit. In this paper, we ask how to obtain the full, potentially non-invertible symmetry action from the unitary sequential circuit and how the connection to sequential circuit constrains the properties of the generalized symmetries. We find that for symmetries that contain the trivial symmetry operator as a fusion outcome, which we call annihilable symmetries, the sequential circuit fully determines the symmetry action and puts various constraints on their fusion. In contrast, for unannihilable symmetries, like that whose corresponding twist is the Cheshire string, a further 1D sequential circuit is needed for the full description. Matrix product operator and tensor network operator representations play an important role in our discussion.</p>

            <p>Lattice vibrations critically shape charge and spin transport by governing carrier scattering, spin-charge interactions and spectral redistribution in nanostructures. In this study, we investigate how electron-phonon coupling (EPC) and structural configurations intertwine in magnetic and nonmagnetic $\beta_{12}$-borophene nanoribbons (BNRs). Using a tight-binding framework with site-dependent hopping parameters extracted from ab initio calculations and incorporating phonons within the Holstein model, we compute phonon-renormalized Green's functions and transport currents via the Landauer-BÃ¼ttiker formalism. We find that spin-dependent EPC enhances spin-dependent current in magnetic zigzag (ZZ) nanoribbons, driven by phonon-induced inelastic scattering and spin-selective band renormalization. Additionally, we observe an enhancement of charge transport current in the nonmagnetic configurations of $\beta_{12}$-BNRs. Structural variations further induce anisotropic EPC effects, significantly reshaping charge and spin transport. These insights establish EPC as a powerful design lever for optimizing borophene-based logic devices through tailored edge engineering.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cristian A. Galvis-Florez, Ahmad Farooq, Simo SÃ¤rkkÃ¤</p>
            <p>Probabilistic machine learning models are distinguished by their ability to integrate prior knowledge of noise statistics, smoothness parameters, and training data uncertainty. A common approach involves modeling data with Gaussian processes; however, their computational complexity quickly becomes intractable as the training dataset grows. To address this limitation, we introduce a quantum-assisted algorithm for sparse Gaussian process regression based on the random Fourier feature kernel approximation. We start by encoding the data matrix into a quantum state using a multi-controlled unitary operation, which encodes the classical representation of the random Fourier features matrix used for kernel approximation. We then employ a quantum principal component analysis along with a quantum phase estimation technique to extract the spectral decomposition of the kernel matrix. We apply a conditional rotation operator to the ancillary qubit based on the eigenvalue. We then use Hadamard and swap tests to compute the mean and variance of the posterior Gaussian distribution. We achieve a polynomial-order computational speedup relative to the classical method.</p>

            <h2>Unconventional hybrid-order topological insulators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei Jia, Yuping Tian, Huanhuan Yang, Xiangru Kong, Zhi-Hao Huang, Wei-Jiang Gong, Jun-Hong An</p>
            <p>Exploring topological matters with exotic quantum states can update the understanding of topological phases and broaden the classification of topological materials. Here, we report a class of unconventional hybrid-order topological insulators (HyOTIs), which simultaneously host various different higher-order topological states in a single $d$-dimensional ($d$D) system. Such topological states exhibit a unique bulk-boundary correspondence that is different from first-order topological states, higher-order topological states, and the coexistence of both. Remarkably, we develop a generic surface theory to precisely capture them and firstly discover a $3$D unconventional HyOTI protected by inversion symmetry, which renders both second-order (helical) and third-order (corner) topological states in one band gap and exhibits a novel bulk-edge-corner correspondence. By adjusting the parameters of the system, we also observe the nontrivial phase transitions between the inversion-symmetric HyOTI and other conventional phases. We further propose a circuit-based experimental scheme to detect these interesting results. Particularly, we demonstrate that a modified tight-binding model of bismuth can support the unconventional HyOTI, suggesting a possible route for its material realization. This work shall significantly advance the research of hybrid topological states in both theory and experiment.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tao-Ran Hu, Su Chen, Katsuyoshi Sone, Feng-Kun Guo, Tetsuo Hyodo, Ian Low</p>
            <p>Recently entanglement suppression was proposed to be one potential origin of emergent symmetries. In this work, we extend this theoretical framework to accommodate particles with arbitrary spins and/or arbitrary group representations. As case studies, we discuss recent efforts to test the entanglement-suppression conjecture in two hadron systems that exhibit possible emergent symmetries. The first concerns interactions involving spin-3/2 baryons, where entanglement suppression gives rise to symmetries such as $\text{SU}(40)$ spin-flavor symmetry. The second system involves low-energy scattering of heavy mesons, where entanglement suppression leads to an enhancement of the inherent heavy-quark spin symmetry to a light-quark spin symmetry, predicting additional siblings for the prominent exotic double-charm meson $T_{cc}(3875)^+$. These predictions should be confronted against experimental data and lattice results to further test the minimal-entanglement conjecture.</p>

            <p>Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells are T-cells engineered to recognize and kill specific tumor cells. Through their extracellular domains, CAR T-cells bind tumor cell antigens which triggers CAR T activation and proliferation. These processes are regulated by co-stimulatory domains present in the intracellular region of the CAR T-cell. Through integrating novel signaling components into the co-stimulatory domains, it is possible to modify CAR T-cell phenotype. Identifying and experimentally testing new CAR constructs based on libraries of co-stimulatory domains is nontrivial given the vast combinatorial space defined by such libraries. This leads to a highly data constrained, poorly explored combinatorial problem, where the experiments undersample all possible combinations. We propose a quantum approach using a Projected Quantum Kernel (PQK) to address this challenge. PQK operates by embedding classical data into a high dimensional Hilbert space and employs a kernel method to measure sample similarity. Using 61 qubits on a gate-based quantum computer, we demonstrate the largest PQK application to date and an enhancement in the classification performance over purely classical machine learning methods for CAR T cytotoxicity prediction. Importantly, we show improved learning for specific signaling domains and domain positions, particularly where there was lower information highlighting the potential for quantum computing in data-constrained problems.</p>

            <p>We use Floquet theory and the High-Frequency expansion to derive an effective Hamiltonian for electrons coupled to an off resonant cavity mode, either in its vacuum or driven by classical light. For vacuum fields, we show that long-range hopping and cavity-mediated interactions arise as a direct consequence of quantum fluctuations. As an application, this method is applied to the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. At high light-matter coupling, our results reveal significant deviations from mean-field predictions, with our framework capturing light-matter entanglement through the Floquet micromotion. Furthermore, the cavity-mediated interactions appearing at first order are shown to be crucial to the description of the system at sufficiently strong light-matter coupling for a fixed cavity frequency. Finally, a drive resonant with the cavity is added with the SSH chain displaying dynamical behavior dependent on the cavity parameters.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adit Vishnu, Abhay Shastry, Dhruva Kashyap, Chiranjib Bhattacharyya</p>
            <p>Density operators, quantum generalizations of probability distributions, are gaining prominence in machine learning due to their foundational role in quantum computing. Generative modeling based on density operator models (\textbf{DOMs}) is an emerging field, but existing training algorithms -- such as those for the Quantum Boltzmann Machine -- do not scale to real-world data, such as the MNIST dataset. The Expectation-Maximization algorithm has played a fundamental role in enabling scalable training of probabilistic latent variable models on real-world datasets. \textit{In this paper, we develop an Expectation-Maximization framework to learn latent variable models defined through \textbf{DOMs} on classical hardware, with resources comparable to those used for probabilistic models, while scaling to real-world data.} However, designing such an algorithm is nontrivial due to the absence of a well-defined quantum analogue to conditional probability, which complicates the Expectation step. To overcome this, we reformulate the Expectation step as a quantum information projection (QIP) problem and show that the Petz Recovery Map provides a solution under sufficient conditions. Using this formulation, we introduce the Density Operator Expectation Maximization (DO-EM) algorithm -- an iterative Minorant-Maximization procedure that optimizes a quantum evidence lower bound. We show that the \textbf{DO-EM} algorithm ensures non-decreasing log-likelihood across iterations for a broad class of models. Finally, we present Quantum Interleaved Deep Boltzmann Machines (\textbf{QiDBMs}), a \textbf{DOM} that can be trained with the same resources as a DBM. When trained with \textbf{DO-EM} under Contrastive Divergence, a \textbf{QiDBM} outperforms larger classical DBMs in image generation on the MNIST dataset, achieving a 40--60\% reduction in the FrÃ©chet Inception Distance.</p>

            <h2>A Bit of Freedom Goes a Long Way: Classical and Quantum Algorithms for Reinforcement Learning under a Generative Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andris Ambainis, Joao F. Doriguello, Debbie Lim</p>
            <p>We propose novel classical and quantum online algorithms for learning finite-horizon and infinite-horizon average-reward Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Our algorithms are based on a hybrid exploration-generative reinforcement learning (RL) model wherein the agent can, from time to time, freely interact with the environment in a generative sampling fashion, i.e., by having access to a "simulator". By employing known classical and new quantum algorithms for approximating optimal policies under a generative model within our learning algorithms, we show that it is possible to avoid several paradigms from RL like "optimism in the face of uncertainty" and "posterior sampling" and instead compute and use optimal policies directly, which yields better regret bounds compared to previous works. For finite-horizon MDPs, our quantum algorithms obtain regret bounds which only depend logarithmically on the number of time steps $T$, thus breaking the $O(\sqrt{T})$ classical barrier. This matches the time dependence of the prior quantum works of Ganguly et al. (arXiv'23) and Zhong et al. (ICML'24), but with improved dependence on other parameters like state space size $S$ and action space size $A$. For infinite-horizon MDPs, our classical and quantum bounds still maintain the $O(\sqrt{T})$ dependence but with better $S$ and $A$ factors. Nonetheless, we propose a novel measure of regret for infinite-horizon MDPs with respect to which our quantum algorithms have $\operatorname{poly}\log{T}$ regret, exponentially better compared to classical algorithms. Finally, we generalise all of our results to compact state spaces.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Osama A. Alsaiari, Adrien Bouhon, Robert-Jan Slager, F. Nur Ãnal</p>
            <p>While the landscape of free-fermion phases has drastically been expanded in the last decades, recently novel multi-gap topological phases were proposed where groups of bands can acquire new invariants such as Euler class. As in conventional single-gap topologies, obstruction plays an inherent role that so far has only been incidentally addressed. We here systematically investigate the nuances of the relation between the non-Bravais lattice configurations and the Brillouin zone boundary conditions (BZBCs) for any number of dimensions. Clarifying the nomenclature, we provide a general periodictization recipe to obtain a gauge with an almost Brillouin-zone-periodic Bloch Hamiltonian both generally and upon imposing a reality condition on Hamiltonians for Euler class. Focusing on three-band $\mathcal{C}_2$ symmetric Euler systems in two dimensions as a guiding example, we present a procedure to enumerate the possible lattice configurations, and thus the unique BZBCs possibilities. We establish a comprehensive classification for the identified BZBC patterns according to the parity constraints they impose on the Euler invariant, highlighting how it extends to more bands and higher dimensions. Moreover, by building upon previous work utilizing Hopf maps, we illustrate physical consequences of non-trivial BZBCs in the quench dynamics of non-Bravais lattice Euler systems, reflecting the parity of the Euler invariant. We numerically confirm our results and corresponding observable signatures, and discuss possible experimental implementations. Our work presents a general framework to study the role of non-trivial boundary conditions and obstructions on multi-gap topology that can be employed for arbitrary number bands or in higher dimensions.</p>

            <h2>The Stochastic-Quantum Correspondence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jacob A. Barandes</p>
            <p>This paper argues that every quantum system can be understood as a sufficiently general kind of stochastic process unfolding in an old-fashioned configuration space according to ordinary notions of probability. This argument is based on an exact correspondence between the class of `indivisible' stochastic processes and quantum theory. This new stochastic-quantum correspondence demotes the wave function from a primary ontological ingredient to a secondary mathematical tool, and yields a deflationary account of exotic quantum phenomena, such as interference, decoherence, entanglement, noncommutative observables, and wave-function collapse. At a more practical level, the stochastic-quantum correspondence leads to a novel reconstruction of quantum theory, alongside the Hilbert-space, path-integral, and quasiprobability representations, and also provides a framework for using Hilbert-space methods to formulate highly generic, non-Markovian types of stochastic dynamics, with potential applications throughout the sciences.</p>

            <p>A major obstacle for quantum optimizers is the reformulation of constraints as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO). Current QUBO translators exaggerate the weight $M$ of the penalty terms. Classically known as the "Big-$M$" problem, the issue becomes even more daunting for quantum solvers, since it affects the physical energy scale. We take a systematic, encompassing look at the quantum big-$M$ problem, revealing NP-hardness in finding the optimal $M$ and establishing bounds on the Hamiltonian spectral gap $\Delta$, inversely related to the expected run-time of quantum solvers. We propose a practical translation algorithm, based on SDP relaxation, that outperforms previous methods in numerical benchmarks. Our algorithm gives values of $\Delta$ orders of magnitude greater, e.g. for portfolio optimization instances. Solving such instances with an adiabatic algorithm on 6-qubits of an IonQ device, we observe significant advantages in time to solution and average solution quality. Our findings are relevant to quantum and quantum-inspired solvers alike.</p>

            <p>Quantum metrology employs entanglement to enhance measurement precision. The focus and progress so far have primarily centered on estimating a single parameter. In diverse application scenarios, the estimation of more than one single parameter is often required. Joint estimation of multiple parameters can benefit from additional advantages for further enhanced precision. Here we report quantum-enhanced measurement of simultaneous spin rotations around two orthogonal axes, making use of spin-nematic squeezing in an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate. Aided by the $F=2$ atomic ground hyperfine manifold coupled to the nematic-squeezed $F=1$ states as an auxiliary field through a sequence of microwave (MW) pulses, simultaneous measurement of multiple spin-1 observables is demonstrated, reaching an enhancement of 3.3 to 6.3 decibels (dB) beyond the classical limit over a wide range of rotation angles. Our work realizes the first enhanced multi-parameter estimation using entangled massive particles as a probe. The techniques developed and the protocols implemented also highlight the application of two-mode squeezed vacuum states in quantum-enhanced sensing of noncommuting spin rotations simultaneously.</p>

            <h2>Imperfect Entangling Power of Quantum Gates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sudipta Mondal, Samir Kumar Hazra, Aditi Sen De</p>
            <p>Achieving perfect control over the parameters defining a quantum gate is, in general, a very challenging task, and at the same time, environmental interactions can introduce disturbances to the initial states as well. Here we address the problem of how the imperfections in unitaries and noise present in the input states affect the entanglement-generating power of a given quantum gate -- we refer to it as imperfect (noisy) entangling power. We observe that, when the parameters of a given unitary are chosen randomly from a Gaussian distribution centered around the desired mean, the quenched average entangling power -- averaged across multiple random samplings -- exhibits intriguing behavior like it may increase or show nonmonotonic behavior with the increase of disorder strength for certain classes of diagonal unitary operators. For arbitrary unitary operators, the quenched average power tends to stabilize, showing almost constant behavior with variation in the parameters instead of oscillating. Our observations also reveal that, in the presence of a local noise model, the input states that maximize the entangling power of a given unitary operator differ considerably from the noiseless scenario. Additionally, we report that the rankings among unitary operators according to their entangling power in the noiseless case change depending on the noise model and noise strength.</p>

            <h2>Symmetrically Threaded Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices As Next Generation Kerr-cat Qubits</h2>

            <p>We theoretically explore an alternative circuit for Kerr-cat qubits based on symmetrically threaded Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices (SQUID). The Symmetrically Threaded SQUIDs (STS) architecture employs a simplified flux-pumped design that suppresses two-photon dissipation, a dominant loss mechanism in high-Kerr regimes, by engineering the drive Hamiltonian's flux operator to generate only even-order harmonics. By fulfilling two critical criteria for practical Kerr-cat qubit operation, the STS emerges as an ideal platform: (1) a static Hamiltonian with diluted Kerr nonlinearity (achieved via the STS's middle branch) and (2) a drive Hamiltonian restricted to even harmonics, which ensures robust two-photon driving with reduced dissipation. For weak Kerr nonlinearity, we find that the coherent state lifetime ($T_\alpha$) is similar between STS and SNAIL circuits. However, STS Kerr-cat qubits exhibit enhanced resistance to higher-order photon dissipation, enabling significantly extended $T_\alpha$ even with stronger Kerr nonlinearities ($\sim$10 MHz). In contrast to SNAIL, STS Kerr-cat qubits display a $T_\alpha$ dip under weak two-photon driving for high Kerr coefficient. We demonstrate that this dip can be suppressed by applying drive-dependent detuning, enabling Kerr-cat qubit operation with only eight Josephson junctions (of energies 80 GHz); fewer junctions suffice for higher junction energies. We further validate the robustness of the STS design by studying the impact of strong flux driving and asymmetric Josephson junctions on $T_\alpha$. With the proposed design and considering a cat size of 10 photons, we predict $T_\alpha$ of the order of tens of milliseconds, even in the presence of multi-photon heating and dephasing effects.</p>

            <p>Bayes' rule, which is routinely used to update beliefs based on new evidence, can be derived from a principle of minimum change. This principle states that updated beliefs must be consistent with new data, while deviating minimally from the prior belief. Here, we introduce a quantum analog of the minimum change principle and use it to derive a quantum Bayes' rule by minimizing the change between two quantum input-output processes, not just their marginals. This is analogous to the classical case, where Bayes' rule is obtained by minimizing several distances between the joint input-output distributions. When the change maximizes the fidelity, the quantum minimum change principle has a unique solution, and the resulting quantum Bayes' rule recovers the Petz transpose map in many cases.</p>

To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we apply it to describe real-time dynamics, starting from an initial symmetry-preserving state and evolving into a randomly distributed, symmetry-breaking final state. Our model serves as a quantum framework for the transition process, from disordered states to ordered ones, where symmetry is spontaneously broken.</p>

Additionally, we show that the error rate for entanglement measured using state estimation from a limited number of measurement copies is significantly lower when using MBN compared to negativity. This demonstrates the robustness of MBN under practical constraints.</p>

            <p>We propose an efficient block-encoding technique for the implementation of the Linear Combination of Hamiltonian Simulations (LCHS) for modeling dissipative initial-value problems. This algorithm approximates a target nonunitary operator as a weighted sum of Hamiltonian evolutions, thereby emulating a dissipative problem by mixing various time scales. We introduce an efficient encoding of the LCHS into a quantum circuit based on a simple coordinate transformation that turns the dependence on the summation index into a trigonometric function. This significantly simplifies block-encoding of a dissipative problem and allows one to perform an exponential number of Hamiltonian simulations by a single Quantum Signal Processing (QSP) circuit. The resulting LCHS circuit has high success probability and scales logarithmically with the number of terms in the LCHS sum and linearly with time. We verify the quantum circuit and its scaling by simulating it on a digital emulator of fault-tolerant quantum computers and, as a test problem, solve the advection-diffusion equation. The proposed algorithm can be used for modeling a wide class of nonunitary initial-value problems including the Liouville equation and linear embeddings of nonlinear systems.</p>

            <p>We present efficient classical algorithms to approximate expectation values and probability amplitudes in linear optical circuits. Specifically, our classical algorithm efficiently approximates the expectation values of observables in linear optical circuits for arbitrary product input states within an additive error under a mild condition. This result suggests that certain applications of linear optical circuits relying on expectation value estimation, such as photonic variational algorithms, may face challenges in achieving quantum advantage. In addition, the (marginal) output probabilities of boson sampling with arbitrary product input states can be efficiently approximated using our algorithm, implying that boson sampling can be efficiently simulated if its output probability distribution is polynomially sparse. Moreover, our method generalizes Gurvits's algorithm, originally designed to approximate the permanent, to also approximate the hafnian of complex symmetric matrices with an additive error. The algorithm also solves a molecular vibronic spectra problem for arbitrary product input states as precisely as boson samplers. Finally, our method extends to near-Clifford circuits, enabling the classical approximation of their expectation values of any observables and (marginal) output probabilities.</p>

            <p>Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) plays a vital role in remote sensing due to its ability to capture high-resolution images regardless of weather conditions or daylight. However, to transform the raw SAR signals into interpretable imagery, advanced data processing techniques are essential.

However, the computational cost of this approach becomes significant when dealing with large datasets. This paper presents a Quantum Range Doppler Algorithm (QRDA) that utilizes the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) to accelerate processing compared to the classical FFT. Furthermore, it introduces a quantum implementation of the Range Cell Migration Correction (RCMC) in the Fourier domain, a critical step in the RDA pipeline that realigns the received echoes so that the energy from a target is concentrated in a single range bin across all azimuth positions. The performance of the quantum RCMC is evaluated and compared against its classical counterpart, demonstrating the potential of quantum computing in advanced SAR imaging.</p>

            <h2>Measurement compatibility in multiparameter quantum interferometry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jayanth Jayakumar, Marco Barbieri, Magdalena StobiÅska</p>
            <p>The CramÃ©r-Rao bound captures completely the performance of single-parameter quantum sensors. On the other hand, its extension to multiple parameters demands more caution. Different aspects need to be captured at once, including, critically, compatibility. In this article we consider compatibility in quantum interferometry for an important class of probe states, measured by double homodyne or photon counters, standard benchmarks for these applications. We include the presence of loss and phase diffusion in the estimation of a phase. Our results illustrate how different weighting of the precision on individual parameters affects their compatibility, adding to the list of considerations for quantum multiparameter estimation.</p>

            <h2>Tree tensor network hierarchical equations of motion based on time-dependent variational principle for efficient open quantum dynamics in structured thermal environments</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinxian Chen, Ignacio Franco</p>
            <p>We introduce an efficient method TTN-HEOM for exactly calculating the open quantum dynamics for driven quantum systems interacting with highly structured bosonic baths by combining the tree tensor network (TTN) decomposition scheme to the bexcitonic generalization of the numerically-exact hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM). The method yields a series of quantum master equations for all core tensors in the TTN that efficiently and accurately capture the open quantum dynamics for non-Markovian environments to all orders in the system-bath interaction. These master equations are constructed based on the time-dependent Dirac--Frenkel variational principle which isolates the optimal dynamics for the core tensors given the TTN ansatz. The dynamics converges to the HEOM when increasing the rank of the core tensors, a limit in which the TTN ansatz becomes exact. We introduce TENSO, Tensor Equations for Non-Markovian Structured Open systems, as a general-purpose Python code to propagate the TTN-HEOM dynamics. We implement three general propagators for the coupled master equations: Two fixed-rank methods that require a constant memory footprint during the dynamics, and one adaptive-rank method with variable memory footprint controlled by the target level of computational error. We exemplify the utility of these methods by simulating a two-level system coupled to a structured bath containing one Drude--Lorentz component and eight Brownian oscillators, which is beyond what can presently be computed using the standard HEOM. Our results show that the TTN-HEOM is capable to simulate both dephasing and relaxation dynamics of driven quantum system interacting with structured baths, even those of chemical complexity, with affordable computational cost.</p>

            <p>We report the fabrication of the first 24-mode universal photonic processor (UPP) realized through femtosecond laser writing (FLW), marking the most complex UPP demonstrated to date. Optimized for quantum dot emission at 925 nm, the device exhibits total insertion losses averaging only 4.35 dB, enabling its direct application in advanced multi-photon quantum experiments. Leveraging the versatility of FLW, we introduce suspended waveguides and precisely engineered 2D and 3D microstructures, significantly enhancing thermal isolation and minimizing power dissipation. As a result, our processor operates efficiently at less than 10 W, requiring only a simple thermo-electric cooler for stable thermal management. The device exhibits exceptional performance after calibration, implementing Haar-random unitary transformations with an amplitude fidelity of 99.7 %. This work establishes FLW-based integrated photonics as a scalable and robust platform for advancing quantum computing, communication, and sensing technologies.</p>

            <h2>Unitary reformulation of the thermofield double state and limits of cyclic multi-mode squeezing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arash Azizi</p>
            <p>We investigate the structure and uniqueness of squeezed vacuum states defined by annihilation conditions of the form $(a - \alpha a^\dagger)|\psi\rangle = 0$ and their multimode generalizations, with applications to the Thermofield Double (TFD) state in quantum field theory. For $N=1$ and $N=2$, we demonstrate that these conditions uniquely define the single- and two-mode squeezed vacua, generated by unitary squeezing operators. A key result is the unitary reformulation of the TFD state, expressed as a product of two-mode squeezing operators, ensuring invertibility and resolving the non-unitary paradox in the Minkowski--Rindler vacuum correspondence. Extending to cyclic annihilation conditions $(a_i - \alpha_i a_{i+1}^\dagger)|\psi\rangle = 0$ with $a_{N+1} \equiv a_1$, we find that non-trivial squeezed states exist only for $N=2$. For $N > 2$, we establish a no-go theorem, proving no normalizable, non-trivial solutions exist, revealing a fundamental limit on cyclic multi-mode entanglement. These results highlight the bipartite nature of TFD-like entanglement and constrain multipartite generalizations in multi-region quantum field theories.</p>

Recently, superconducting multi-qubit processors demonstrated quantum supremacy and quantum error correction below the surface code threshold. However, the decoherence-induced loss of quantum information still remains a challenge for more than 100 qubit quantum computing. Here, we review the key aspects of superconducting quantum circuits protection from stray electromagnetic fields and infrared radiation, namely, multilayer shielding design, materials, filtering of the fridge lines and attenuation, cryogenic setup configurations, and methods for shielding efficiency evaluation developed over the last 10 years. In summary, we make recommendations for creation of an efficient and compact shielding system as well as microwave filtering for a large-scale superconducting quantum systems.</p>

            <p>Microwave quantum memory represents a critical component for quantum radars and resource-efficient approaches to quantum error correction. Superconducting microwave resonators provide highly efficient storage, long coherence times, on-demand reading and even in memory pulse engineering, but it is still challenging to overcome design and materials induced loss channels for on-chip realization. In this work, we present a novel architecture of integrated superconducting quantum memory with a dynamically controlled RF-SQUID coupling element in pulse regime, thus ensuring high efficiency storage and cycling storage time. It demonstrates a memory cycle time of 1.51 $\mu s$ and 57.5% storage fidelity with preservation of the stored pulse shape during the retrieval at single-photon level excitations. We establish that while the proposed active coupler realization introduces no measurable fidelity degradation, the primary limitation arises from impedance matching and materials imperfections. The proposed architecture highlights a disruptive potential for on-chip qubit and memory integration for scalable quantum error correction, while identifying specific avenues for near-unity storage fidelity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sacha Greenfield, Archana Kamal, Justin Dressel, Eli Levenson-Falk</p>
            <p>The quantum Zeno effect is a striking feature of quantum mechanics with foundational implications and practical applications in quantum control, error suppression, and error correction. The effect has branched off into a variety of different interpretations, making it easy to miss the unifying features of the underlying effect. In particular, the quantum Zeno effect has been studied in the context of both selective and nonselective measurements; for both pulsed and continuous interactions; for suppression and enhancement of decay (Zeno / anti-Zeno effects); and even in the absence of measurement entirely. This concise review presents a unified picture of these effects by examining how they all arise in the context of a driven qubit subjected to measurements or dissipation. Zeno and anti-Zeno effects are revealed as regimes of a unified effect that appears whenever a measurement-like process competes with a non-commuting evolution. The current landscape of Zeno and anti-Zeno effects is reviewed through this unifying lens, with a focus on experimental applications and implementations. The quantum Zeno effect is found to be both ubiquitous and essential for the future of near-term quantum computing.</p>

            <p>Improving quantum algorithms run-time performance involves several strategies such as reducing the quantum gate counts, decreasing the number of measurements, advancement in QPU technology for faster gate operations, or optimizing the classical processing. This work focuses on the latter, specifically reducing classical processing and compilation time via hardware-assisted parameterized circuit execution (PCE) for computing dynamical properties of quantum systems. PCE was previously validated for QCVV protocols, which leverages structural circuit equivalencies. We demonstrate the applicability of this approach to computing dynamical properties of quantum many-body systems using structurally equivalent time evolution circuits, specifically calculating correlation functions of spin models using constant-depth circuits generated via Cartan decomposition. Implementing this for spin-spin correlation functions in Transverse field XY (up to 6-sites) and Heisenberg spin models (up to 3-sites), we observed a run-time reduction of up to 50\% compared to standard compilation methods. This highlights the adaptability of time-evolution circuit with hardware-assisted PCE to potentially mitigate the classical bottlenecks in near-term quantum algorithms.</p>

            <p>We study temperature estimation using quantum probes, including single-mode initial states and two-mode states generated via stimulated parametric down-conversion in a nonlinear crystal at finite temperature. We explore both transient and equilibrium regimes and compare the performance of Gaussian and non-Gaussian probe states for temperature estimation. In the non-equilibrium regime, we show that single-mode non-Gaussian probe states - such as Fock, odd cat, and Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill states - can significantly enhance the speed of estimation, particularly at short interaction times. In the two-mode setting, entangled states such as the two-mode squeezed vacuum, NOON state, and entangled cat state can enable access to temperature information at earlier times. In the equilibrium regime, we analyze temperature estimation using two-mode squeezed thermal states, which outperform single-mode strategies. We evaluate practical measurement strategies and find that energy-based observables yield optimal precision, population difference observables provide near-optimal precision, while quadrature-based measurements are suboptimal. The precision gain arises from squeezing, which suppresses fluctuations in the population difference.</p>

            <h2>Shallow quantum circuit for generating O(1)-entangled approximate state designs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wonjun Lee, Minki Hhan, Gil Young Cho, Hyukjoon Kwon</p>
            <p>Random quantum states have various applications in quantum information science. In this work, we discover a new ensemble of quantum states that serve as an $\epsilon$-approximate state $t$-design while possessing extremely low entanglement, magic, and coherence. These resources can reach their theoretical lower bounds, $\Omega(\log (t/\epsilon))$, which are also proven in this work. This implies that for fixed $t$ and $\epsilon$, entanglement, magic, and coherence do not scale with the system size, i.e., $O(1)$ with respect to the total number of qubits $n$. Moreover, we explicitly construct an ancilla-free shallow quantum circuit for generating such states by transforming $k$-qubit approximate state designs into $n$-qubit ones without increasing the support size. The depth of such a quantum circuit, $O(t [\log t]^3 \log n \log(1/\epsilon))$, is the most efficient among existing algorithms without ancilla qubits. A class of quantum circuits proposed in our work offers reduced cost for classical simulation of random quantum states, leading to potential applications in quantum information processing. As a concrete example, we propose classical shadow tomography using an estimator with superpositions between only two states, which improves the runtime of a state certification task by requiring only $O(1)$ measurements and queries.</p>

            <p>Accurate and resource-efficient estimation of quantum Hamiltonians is crucial for developing practical quantum technologies, yet current methods typically demand entanglement resources or dynamical control. Here, we demonstrate a method that surpasses the standard quantum limit without requiring entanglement resources, coherent measurements, or dynamical control. Our method relies on trajectory-based Hamiltonian learning, in which we apply local, randomized pre-processing to probe states and apply the maximum-likelihood estimation to optimally scheduled Pauli measurements. Analytically, we establish the emergence of a transient Heisenberg-limited regime for short-time probes for our procedure. Furthermore, we outline how to estimate all Hamiltonian parameters in parallel using ensembles of probe states, removing the need for parameter isolation and structural priors. Finally, we supplement our findings with a numerical study, learning multiple disordered, anisotropic Heisenberg models for a 1D chain of spin-1/2 particles, featuring local transverse fields with both nearest- and next-nearest-neighbour interactions, as well as a gapless XXZ Hamiltonian. Our numerics show that our method needs only one shot per Pauli measurement, making it well-suited for experimental scenarios. The code for our method is available online and open-source.</p>

            <p>Although many quantum channels satisfy Completely Positive Trace Preserving (CPTP) condition, there are valid quantum channels that can be non-completely positive (NCP). In a search of the conditions of noisy evolution to be a useful resource for quantum computing, we study the relation of complete positivity (CP) with unitality, where we find that a map must be non-unital in order to be NCP, but not vice-versa. As memory effects can provide advantages in the dynamics of noisy quantum systems, we investigate the relative CP condition and the CP-divisibility condition of the system and environment subsystems of a joint system-environment quantum state evolving noiselessly. We show that the system and environment channels must be both CP (NCP) or CP-divisible (CP-indivisible) for the evolution in the joint system-environment space to be unitary. We illustrate our results with examples of Bell state created from $|00\rangle$, GHZ state created from $|000\rangle$, W state created from $|100\rangle$, and the partial transpose (PT) operation acting on the Bell state.</p>

Building on Grover's amplitude amplification, the algorithm encodes all candidate paths in superposition and evaluates their proximity to the goal using a reversible fitness operator based on quantum arithmetic. A Grover-compatible oracle marks high-fitness states, and an adaptive cutoff strategy refines the search iteratively. We provide formal definitions, unitary constructions, and convergence guarantees, along with a resource analysis showing efficient scaling with maze size and path length. The framework serves as a foundation for quantum-hybrid pathfinding and planning. The full algorithmic pipeline is specified from encoding to amplification, including oracle design and fitness evaluation. The approach is readily extensible to other search domains, including navigation over tree-like or acyclic graphs.</p>

We consider specifically the approach to the ground state phase transition of this quantum TPM (QTPM, or quantum Newman-Moore model) as a function of the system size and type of boundary conditions. Using cellular automata methods, we obtain a full characterization of the minimum energy configurations of the TPM for arbitrary tori sizes. For the QTPM, we use these cycle patterns to obtain the symmetries of the model, which we argue determine its quantum phase transition: we find it to be a first-order phase transition, with the addition of spontaneous symmetry breaking for system sizes which have degenerate classical ground states. For sizes accessible to numerics, we also find that this classification is consistent with exact diagonalization, Matrix Product States and Quantum Monte Carlo simulations.</p>

            <h2>Miscibility-Immiscibility transition of strongly interacting bosonic mixtures in optical lattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rukmani Bai, Soumik Bandyopadhyay</p>
            <p>Interaction plays key role in the mixing properties of a multi-component system. The miscibility-immiscibility transition (MIT) in a weakly interacting mixture of Bose gases is predominantly determined by the strengths of the intra and inter-component two-body contact interactions. On the other hand, in the strongly interacting regime interaction induced processes become relevant. Despite previous studies on bosonic mixtures in optical lattices, the effects of the interaction induced processes on the MIT remains unexplored. In this work, we investigate the MIT in the strongly interacting phases of two-component bosonic mixture trapped in a homogeneous two-dimensional square optical lattice. Particularly we examine the MIT condition when both the components are in superfluid (SF), one-body staggered superfluid (OSSF), or supersolid (SS) phases. Our study uncovers that MIT condition is significantly shaped by the interplay of competing non-local intra- and inter-component density-induced tunneling effects, as well as off-site interactions. Notably, we demonstrate that the MIT condition for the staggered superfluid phase exhibits an inequality that is inverted compared to the conventional MIT condition associated with superfluid or supersolid phases driven by local contact interactions. In addition, we present the phase diagram of the Bose-Hubbard Model incorporating non-local processes, derived using a site-decoupling mean-field approach with the Gutzwiller ansatz. Our study contributes to the better understanding of miscibility properties of multi-component systems in the strongly interacting regime.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sandip Maiti, Debasish Banerjee, Bipasha Chakraborty, Emilie Huffman</p>
            <p>The simulation of various properties of quantum field theories is rapidly becoming a testing ground for demonstrating the prowess of quantum algorithms. Some examples include the preparation of ground states, as well as the investigation of various simple wave packets relevant for scattering phenomena. In this paper, we study the ability of quantum algorithms to prepare ground states in a matter-free non-Abelian $SO(3)$ lattice gauge theory in $2+1$D in a phase where the global charge conjugation symmetry is spontaneously broken. This is challenging for two reasons: the necessity of dealing with a large Hilbert space for gauge theories compared to that of quantum spin models, and the closing of the gap between the two ground states, which becomes exponentially small as a function of the volume. To deal with the large Hilbert space of gauge fields, we demonstrate how the exact imposition of the non-Abelian Gauss Law in the rishon representation of the quantum link operator significantly reduces the degrees of freedom. Further, to resolve the gap, we introduce symmetry-guided ansÃ¤tze in the Gauss-Law-resolved basis for trial states as the starting point for the quantum algorithms to prepare the two lowest energy states. In addition to simulation results for a range of two-dimensional system sizes, we also provide experimental results from the trapped-ion-based quantum hardware, IonQ, when working on systems with four quantum links. The experimental/simulation results derived from our theoretical developments indicate the role of metrics--such as the energy and the infidelity--to assess the obtained results.</p>

Two teleportation-like phenomena have been predicted by quantum mechanics: quantum teleportation and, more recently, quantum particle teleportation.

It seems to be a natural consequence of the Standard Model's indistinguishable elementary particles and antiparticles. We illustrate the idea within a 1+1D toy model of particle-antiparticle creation and space-time evolution obeying transport locality. Furthermore, we propose a novel method to observe apparent teleportation driven by strong interactions through measurements of correlations between the momenta of charm and anticharm hadrons in nuclear collisions. Observing the apparent teleportation would uncover the basic transport properties of indistinguishable particles.</p>

            <p>We provide a complete classification of Clifford quantum cellular automata (QCAs) on arbitrary metric spaces and any qudits (of prime or composite dimensions) in terms of algebraic L-theory. Building on the delooping formalism of Pedersen and Weibel, we reinterpret Clifford QCAs as symmetric formations in a filtered additive category constructed from the geometry of the underlying space. This perspective allows us to identify the group of stabilized Clifford QCAs, modulo circuits and separated automorphisms, with the Witt group of the corresponding Pedersen--Weibel category. Notably, because the Pedersen--Weibel category depends only on the large-scale (coarse) structure of the metric space, so too does the classification of Clifford QCAs. For Euclidean lattices, the classification reproduces and expands upon known results, while for more general spaces -- including open cones over finite simplicial complexes -- we relate nontrivial QCAs to generalized homology theories with coefficients in the L-theory spectrum. We also outline extensions to QCAs with symmetry and mixed qudit dimensions, and discuss how these fit naturally into the L-theoretic framework.</p>

            <h2>Time Glasses: Symmetry Broken Chaotic Phase with a Finite Gap</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Taiki Haga</p>
            <p>We introduce the time glass, a non-periodic analogue of the discrete time crystal that arises in periodically driven dissipative quantum many-body systems. This phase is defined by two key features: (i) spatial long-range order arising from the spontaneous breaking of an internal symmetry, and (ii) temporally chaotic oscillations of the order parameter, whose lifetime diverges with system size. In other words, a time glass is a state of matter in which all components evolve in a synchronized yet chaotic manner. To characterize the time glass phase, we focus on the spectral gap of the one-cycle (Floquet) Liouvillian, which determines the decay rate of the slowest relaxation mode. Numerical studies of periodically driven dissipative Ising models show that, in the time glass phase, the Liouvillian gap remains finite in the thermodynamic limit, in contrast to time crystals where the gap closes exponentially with system size. We further demonstrate that the Liouvillian gap converges to the decay rate of the order-parameter autocorrelation derived from the classical (mean-field) dynamics in the thermodynamic limit. This result establishes a direct correspondence between microscopic spectral features and emergent macroscopic dynamics in driven dissipative quantum systems. At first glance, the existence of a nonzero Liouvillian gap appears incompatible with the presence of indefinitely persistent chaotic oscillations. We resolve this apparent paradox by showing that the quantum RÃ©nyi divergence between a localized coherent initial state and the highly delocalized steady state grows unboundedly with system size. This divergence allows long-lived transients to persist even in the presence of a finite Liouvillian gap.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adith Sai Aramthottil, Ali Emami Kopaei, Piotr Sierant, Lev Vidmar, Jakub Zakrzewski</p>
            <p>Ergodic isolated quantum many-body systems satisfy the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), i.e., the expectation values of local observables in the system's eigenstates approach the predictions of the microcanonical ensemble. However, the ETH does not specify what happens to expectation values of local observables within an energy window when the average over disorder realizations is taken. As a result, the expectation values of local observables can be distributed over a relatively wide interval and may exhibit nontrivial structure, as shown in [Phys. Rev. B \textbf{104}, 214201 (2021)] for a quasiperiodic disordered system for site-resolved magnetization. We argue that the non-Gaussian form of this distribution may \textit{falsely} suggest non-ergodicity and a breakdown of ETH. By considering various types of disorder, we find that the functional forms of the distributions of matrix elements of the site-resolved magnetization operator mirror the distribution of the onsite disorder. We argue that this distribution is a direct consequence of the local observable having a finite overlap with moments of the Hamiltonian. We then demonstrate how to adjust the energy window when analyzing expectation values of local observables in disordered quantum many-body systems to correctly assess the system's adherence to ETH, and provide a link between the distribution of expectation values in eigenstates and the outcomes of quench experiments.</p>

            <h2>Multi-Gap superconductivity in HgS under pressure</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pietro Maria Forcella, Cesare Tresca, Antonio Sanna, Gianni Profeta</p>
            <p>Mercury chalcogenides are a class of materials that exhibit diverse structural phases under pressure, leading to a range of exotic physical properties, including topological phases and chiral phonons. In particular, the phase diagram of mercury sulfide (HgS) remains difficult to characterize, with significant uncertainty surrounding the transition pressure between phases. Based on recent experimental results, we employ Density Functional Theory and Superconducting Density Functional Theory to investigate the pressure-induced structural phase transition in HgS and its interplay with the emergence of superconductivity as the crystal transitions from the cinnabar phase (space group P3$_1$21) to the rock salt phase (space group Fm$\bar{3}$m). Remarkably, the rocksalt phase hosts a multigap superconducting state driven by distinct Fermi surface sheets, with two dominant gaps; the unusually high critical temperature of $\sim$11 K emerges naturally within this multiband scenario, highlighting the role of interband coupling beyond isotropic models. These results place HgS among the few systems where multiband superconducting gap structures emerge under pressure.</p>

            <h2>Vacuum-Induced Quantum Gate</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arash Azizi</p>
            <p>We demonstrate that the quantum vacuum, as perceived by a uniformly accelerating observer, can be harnessed to perform a quantum Z-gate. A two-level Unruh-DeWitt detector, prepared in a superposition of its ground and excited states, undergoes a second-order interaction with the vacuum, resulting in a two-photon emission. We derive the exact analytical form of the final entangled detector-field state and show that this emission is conditional on a phase flip of the detector's initial state-the defining feature of the gate's operation. This process harvests entanglement from the Minkowski vacuum, producing photon pairs entangled across causally disconnected Rindler wedges. This work reframes acceleration-induced radiation not as thermal noise but as a coherent computational resource, offering new pathways for relativistic quantum information.</p>

            <h2>Robust qubit interactions mediated by photonic topological edge states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Boris Gurevich, Weihua Xie, Mohsen Yarmohammadi, Michael H. Kolodrubetz</p>
            <p>We investigate the coupling of two spatially separated qubits via topologically protected edge states in a two-dimensional Hofstadter lattice. In this hybrid platform, the qubits are coupled to distinct edge sites of the lattice, enabling long-range interactions mediated by topological edge modes. We solve the full system Hamiltonian and analyze the resulting eigenstate structure to uncover the conditions under which coherent qubit interactions emerge. Our analysis reveals that the effective coupling is highly sensitive to the qubit placement, energy detuning, and the topological character of the edge spectrum. We obtain an analytical solution that goes beyond the perturbative regime, capturing the full interplay between the qubits and edge modes. These results provide a foundation for exploring information transport and many-body effects in engineered quantum systems where interactions are mediated by topological edge modes.</p>

            <h2>Dissipation in the Broadband and Ultrastrong Coupling Regimes of Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics: An \emph{Ab Initio} Quantized Quasinormal Mode Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chris Gustin, Juanjuan Ren, Sebastian Franke, Stephen Hughes</p>
            <p>Phenomenological approaches to photon loss have long been the workhorse of cavity-QED, but prove inadequate in the presence of sufficiently broadband light-matter interactions. We present a rigorous and \emph{ab initio} derivation of a quantum master equation for a quantized optical cavity mode coupled to a dipole, using a quasinormal mode (QNM) quantization procedure for plasmonic and dielectric open-system cavity-QED, which is valid in broadband light-matter interaction regimes, including ultrastrong coupling (USC). The theory supports general three-dimensional resonators with arbitrary dispersion and loss, and thus can be applied to a wide range of open cavities. Our \emph{ab initio} and gauge-invariant approach fully recovers the recent result of Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 123601 (2025) for the spectral density of a quantized cavity with a single dipole, exhibits a dissipative classical-quantum correspondence for bosonic Hopfield model systems, and reveals important departures from previous heuristic assumptions about system-bath coupling. We identify a new criterion for what we term the ``broadband'' dissipative regime of cavity-QED, where phenomenological models require corrections in accordance with the intrinsic and spatially-dependent complex phase of the QNM, and also shed light on \emph{fundamental limits} to single-mode models in extreme coupling regimes. Using plasmonic and dielectric cavity examples, we show validity ranges of our QNM master equation and spectral USC calculations, and discuss prospects for near-term experimental observation of broadband dissipative effects.</p>

            <h2>High-harmonic generation under electronic strong coupling: A time-dependent combined quantum electrodynamics/quantum chemistry study</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paul A. Albrecht, Eric W. Fischer, Tillmann Klamroth, Peter Saalfrank</p>
            <p>The creation of light-matter hybrid states, polaritons, in a cavity offers new intriguing opportunities to manipulate the electronic structure and electron dynamics of atoms and molecules. Here, we investigate the effect of electronic strong coupling (ESC) between atoms or molecules and field modes of a Fabry-PÃ©rot cavity on High-Harmonic Generation (HHG) spectra within a theoretical model study. We assume that the atom or molecule is driven by an intense classical laser field, giving rise to HHG, while being strongly coupled to quantized cavity modes as described by the Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian in the framework of molecular quantum electrodynamics (QED). Specifically, as a test case, we first consider a model Hamiltonian of a one-dimensional hydrogen atom coupled to a cavity mode, which can be treated ``numerically exact'' using grid methods. Further, a hydrogen molecule coupled to a cavity mode is considered and treated within a recently suggested QED-TD-CI (Quantum Electrodynamics Time-Dependent Configuration Interaction) method [Weidman $\textit{et al.}$, J. Chem. Phys. $\textbf{160}$, 094111 (2024)]. The resulting HHG spectra show (i) a suppression of the harmonic cutoff in line with excitation of quantum light in the cavity and, in some cases, (ii) enhancement of some harmonics of the coupled light-matter system.</p>

            <h2>The Janus State: Strong Photon Antibunching from a Superposition of Squeezed Vacua</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arash Azizi</p>
            <p>Fundamental principles of quantum mechanics, such as superposition, have long been used to create nonclassical "cat states" from classical-like components. We push this concept into the fully quantum regime by introducing the "Janus State"-a superposition of two squeezed vacuum states. Here, we report the discovery that this state, born from two photon-bunched components, exhibits strong photon antibunching. Our exact analytical theory reveals this emergent nonclassicality is driven by pure quantum interference. We identify a universal lower bound of $g^{(2)}=1/2$ in the asymptotic limit of vanishing squeezing, and also find a local minimum of $g^{(2)} \approx 0.567$ in a more experimentally accessible regime. The existence of this operational sweet spot fundamentally challenges the paradigm that strong antibunching requires non-Gaussian resources or post-selection. The Janus State thus constitutes a new foundational tool for quantum engineering, providing a deterministic route to generating highly nonclassical light.</p>

            <h2>Can gravity mediate the transmission of quantum information?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrea Mari, Stefano Zippilli, David Vitali</p>
            <p>We propose an experiment to test the non-classicality of the gravitational interaction. We consider two optomechanical systems that are perfectly isolated, except for a weak gravitational coupling. If a suitable resonance condition is satisfied, an optical signal can be transmitted from one system to the other over a narrow frequency band, a phenomenon that we call gravitationally induced transparency. In this framework, the challenging problem of testing the quantum nature of gravity is mapped to the easier task of determining the non-classicality of the gravitationally-induced optical channel: If the optical channel is not entanglement-breaking, then gravity must have a quantum nature. This approach is applicable without making any assumption on the, currently unknown, correct model of gravity in the quantum regime. In the second part of this work, we model gravity as a quadratic Hamiltonian interaction (e.g. a weak Newtonian force), resulting in a Gaussian thermal attenuator channel between the two systems. Depending on the strength of thermal noise, the system presents a sharp transition from an entanglement-breaking to a non-classical channel capable not only of entanglement preservation but also of asymptotically perfect quantum communication.</p>

            <h2>Controllable single-photon wave packet scattering in two-dimensional resonator array by a giant atom</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weijun Cheng, Zhihai Wang, Yu-Xi Liu</p>
            <p>Nonlocal interactions between photonic resonator array and giant atoms have attracted extensive attentions. Optimization and control of quantum states via giant atoms have been shown. We here study the dynamical scattering of a single-photon wave packet by a giant atom coupled to a two-dimensional photonic resonator array via multiple spatial points. Using several iterations of time evolutions, we can prepare an expected wave packet with a stable size and use it as the incident state for the scattering process. We show that spatially symmetric or asymmetric target scattering states of single-photon wave packet can be generated by adjusting the coupling strengths between the giant atom and different lattice sites of the resonator array. Furthermore, the dynamical scattering of the wave packets enables us to study the atomic excitation and propagating properties of the scattering states. We find that the atomic excitation has negligibly small probability during the scattering process. Our study may provide a new way to generate an expected photon state via photon scattering by a giant atom in two-dimensional photonic array.</p>

            <p>We analyze the domain of validity of a quantum optical model describing the effects of gravitational redshift on the quantum state of photons that propagate in curved spacetime. We find that the model is consistent for small redshift, but fails for larger redshifts. Surprisingly, the range of the redshift for which the model applies is conditional not only to the gravitational parameters, but also to those that define the photonic modes. We provide an analysis to characterize this aspect and propose a solution. Finally, we discuss implications for theoretical science as well as for the development of quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>Gaussian quantum probes have been widely used in quantum metrology and thermometry, where the goal is to estimate the temperature of an environment with which the probe interacts. It was recently shown that introducing initial position-momentum (PM) correlations in such probes can enhance the estimation precision compared to standard, uncorrelated Gaussian states. Motivated by these findings, we investigate whether PM correlations can also be advantageous in a simultaneous estimation setting, specifically, when estimating both the PM correlations themselves and the effective environment temperature that interacts with the probe. Using the Quantum Fisher Information Matrix, we derive new precision bounds for this joint estimation task. Additionally, we demonstrate that such correlations can serve as a resource to improve temperature estimation within this multiparameter context. Finally, we analyze the compatibility between the two parameters, establishing conditions under which the derived bounds can be saturated.</p>

            <p>We present an extraction of Compton Form Factors (CFFs) from Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DVCS) experiments conducted at Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, utilizing Quantum Deep Neural Networks (QDNNs). The analysis employs the standard Belitsky, Kirchner, and MÃ¼ller formalism at twist-two, complemented by a fitting procedure designed to minimize model dependence in a manner analogous to conventional local fits. A pseudodata extraction test of the CFFs is performed using both Classical Deep Neural Networks (CDNNs) and QDNNs, with a detailed comparative analysis. Results indicate that QDNNs can outperform CDNNs in particular cases, offering enhanced predictive accuracy and precision even with limited model complexity. Motivated by this, we develop a metric to quantify the extent of the quantum advantage based on characteristics of DVCS experimental data. These findings underscore the promising role of QDNNs in advancing future investigations into multidimensional parton distributions and hadronic physics.</p>

            <h2>Light and divergences: History and outlook</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gerd Leuchs, Luis L. Sanchez-Soto</p>
            <p>All experimental evidence {indicates} that the vacuum is not void, but filled with something truly quantum. This is reflected by terms such as {zero-point} fluctuations, and Dirac's sea of virtual particle-antiparticle pairs, and last but not least the vacuum is the medium responsible for Maxwell's displacement current. While quantum electrodynamics (QED) is an exceptionally successful theory, it remains a perturbative framework rather than a fully self-contained one. Inherently, it includes singularities and divergences, which prevent the precise calculation of fundamental quantities such as the fine-structure constant $\alpha$. Any direct attempt to compute $\alpha$ results in divergent values. However, and most remarkable, what can be determined is how $\alpha$ ``runs", meaning how it varies with energy or exchanged momentum. In this article, we review the historical development of these ideas, the current state of knowledge, and ongoing efforts to find ways to move further. This includes a simple model to describe vacuum polarization in the low-energy regime, when considering only small (linear) deviations from the equilibrium {state}, relating {Maxwell's displacement} in the vacuum, to the quantum properties of the vacuum.</p>

            <p>Quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories (LGTs) with both dynamical matter and gauge fields provide a promising approach to studying strongly coupled problems beyond classical computational reach. Yet, implementing gauge-invariant encodings and real-time evolution remains experimentally challenging. Here, we demonstrate a resource-efficient encoding of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT using a hybrid qubit-oscillator trapped-ion quantum device, where qubits represent gauge fields and vibrational modes naturally encode bosonic matter fields. This architecture utilises synthetic dimensions to construct higher-dimensional lattice geometries and combines digital and analogue techniques to prepare initial states, realise gauge-invariant real-time evolution, and measure the relevant observables. We experimentally probe dynamics obeying Gauss's law in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ link and extend this to a loop geometry, marking the first steps towards higher-dimensional LGTs. In this quasi-2D setup, we observe Aharonov-Bohm interference for the first time with dynamical gauge fields encoding magnetic flux, demonstrating the interplay between charge and flux. Our results chart a promising path for scalable quantum simulations of bosonic gauge theories and outline a roadmap for realising exotic LGTs in higher dimensions.</p>

            <h2>Characterization of Polariton Dynamics in a Multimode Cavity (II): Coherent-Incoherent Transition Driven by Photon Loss</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Md Qutubuddin, Ilia Tutunnikov, Jianshu Cao</p>
            <p>Motivated by the recent advances in optical imaging and tracking of wave-packet propagation in optical cavities, we systematically explore the non-Hermitian polariton dynamics within a decay- tunable multimode cavity model. The complex eigen-spectrum of the model Hamiltonian allows us to predict the incoherent-coherent transition induced by photon losses, which defines an exceptional point at resonance and evolves analytically as the wavevector shifts off-resonantly. The resulting dispersion relation, group velocity, and relaxation rate exhibit striking signatures, such as curve crossing, level repulsion, turnover, bifurcation, and coalescence, as the decay rate crosses the critical transition or the wavevector crosses the resonance. The spectral characterization leads to surprising features in the non-Hermitian wave packet dynamics: (i) maximal population relaxation rate at the critical transition; (ii) reversed propagation in the center-of-mass motion; (iii) ballistic-to-diffusion transition; (iv) contraction in the displacement and width of the polariton wave-packet. These dynamical features have complementary symmetry between the upper-polariton (UP) branch and lower-polariton (LP) branch in the two-dimensional phase diagram spanned by the photon decay rate and wavevector. Thus, the combination of complex spectral characterization and non-Hermitian wave packet propagation establishes the photon decay rate as a powerful control parameter for polariton transport, reveals the underlying symmetry in lossy cavities, and presents a starting point to incorporate other dissipative mechanisms.</p>

We uncover a universal relationship between bipartite entanglement entropy and particle number after the barrier in a one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard system with an external asymmetric potential. Using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks - a novel machine learning architecture - we learn this relationship across a broad range of interaction strengths with near-perfect predictive accuracy. Furthermore, we propose a simple analytical binary-entropy-like expression that quantitatively captures the observed correlation for fixed parameters. Our findings open new avenues for characterizing quantum correlations in transport phenomena and provide a powerful framework for predicting entanglement evolution in quantum systems.</p>

            <p>In this work, we study the electromagnetic energy and energy rate spectra produced by a point particle in the presence of plane wave fields. Our approach is based on a semiclassical formulation, in which the current distribution that generates electromagnetic radiation is treated classically while the radiation field is quantum. Unlike the classical energy spectrum--which exhibits divergences linked to the duration of interaction between the particle and the external field--the semiclassical spectrum is finite because radiation is produced during the quantum transition from an initial state without photons to the final state with photons at time $t$. In our formulation, we find that the maximum energy spectrum emitted by the particle is linearly proportional to time or phase, depending on the external field. This allowed us not only to extract the maximum energy rate spectra emitted by the particle but also to correlate them with energy rates derived in the framework of Classical Electrodynamics and Quantum Electrodynamics.</p>

            <p>Young's double slit experiment has often been used to illustrate the concept of complementarity in quantum mechanics. If information can in principle be obtained about the path of the photon, then the visibility of the interference fringes is reduced or even destroyed. This Gedanken experiment discussed by Bohr and Einstein can be realized when the slit is replaced by individual atoms sensitive to the transferred recoil momentum of a photon which "passes through the slit". Early pioneering experiments were done with trapped ions and atom pairs created via photo-dissociation. Recently, it became possible to perform interference experiments with single neutral atoms cooled to the absolute ground state of a harmonic oscillator potential. The slits are now single atoms representing a two-level system, and the excitation in the harmonic oscillator potential is the which-way marker. In this note, we analyze and generalize two recent experiments performed with single atoms and emphasize the different ways they record which-way information.</p>

This formulation naturally accommodates bosonic operators, as commonly encountered in quantum chemistry and quantum optics. By parameterizing a dissipative quantum optical system, we minimize its steady-state energy to approximate the ground state of a target Hamiltonian. The system converges to a unique steady state regardless of its initial condition, and the design inherently guarantees physical realizability. To enhance robustness against persistent disturbances, we incorporate H-infinity control into the system architecture. Numerical comparisons with the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) highlight the method's structural advantages, stability, and physical implementability. This framework is compatible with experimental platforms such as cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) and photonic crystal circuits.</p>

Employing a full polaron transform, we derive the effective Hamiltonian and obtain analytical expressions for the quantum Fisher information (QFI) of equilibrium states in both weak coupling (WC) and strong coupling (SC) regimes for a general parameter, explicitly accounting for finite-size (FS) effects. Furthermore, we utilize Hill's nanothermodynamics to calculate an effective QFI expression at SC. Our results reveal a potential advantage of SC for thermometry at low temperatures and demonstrate enhanced magnetometric precision through control of the anisotropy parameter. Crucially, we show that neglecting FS effects leads to considerable errors in ultimate precision bounds for equilibrium thermometry. This work also highlights the inadequacy of phenomenological approaches in describing the metrological capability and thermodynamic behavior of systems at SC.

            <p>Cluster states are a useful resource in quantum computation, and can be generated by applying entangling gates between next-neighbor qubits. Heralded entangling gates offer the advantage of high post-selected fidelity, and can be used to create cluster states at the expense of large space-time overheads. We propose a low-overhead protocol to generate and merge high-fidelity many-atom entangled states into a 3D cluster state that supports fault-tolerant universal logical operations. Our simulations indicate that a state-of-the-art high-finesse optical cavity is sufficient for constructing a scalable fault-tolerant cluster state with loss and Pauli errors remaining an order of magnitude below their respective thresholds. This protocol reduces the space-time resource requirements for cluster state construction, highlighting the measurement-based method as an alternative approach to achieving large-scale error-corrected quantum processing with neutral atoms.</p>

            <p>Bosons with density-dependent hopping on a one dimensional lattice have been shown to emulate anyonic particles with fractional exchange statistics. Leveraging this, we construct a Josephson junction setup, where an insulating barrier in the form of a Mott-insulator is sandwiched between two superfluid phases. This is obtained by spatially varying either the statistical phase or the strength of the on-site interaction potential on which the ground state of the system depends. Utilizing numerical methods such as exact diagonalization and density renormalization group theory, the ground state properties of this setup are investigated to understand the Josephson effect in a strongly correlated regime. The dynamical properties of this model for different configurations of this model are analyzed to find the configurations that can produce the Josephson effect. Furthermore, it is observed that continuous particle flow over time is achievable in this proposed model solely by creating an initial phase difference without any external biasing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jen-Tsung Hsiang, Bei-Lok Hu</p>
            <p>This third paper in this series continues the investigation of atom-field interactions in the presence of a conductor or a dielectric medium, focusing on quantum information related basic issues such as decoherence and entanglement. Here we consider the entanglement between two atoms with internal degrees of freedom modeled by a harmonic oscillator, with varying separations between them and varying distances between them and a conducting surface. These are configurations familiar in the Casimir-Polder effect, but the behavior of atom-surface entanglement is quite different from the well-studied behavior of field-induced forces. For one, while the attractive force between an atom and a conducting surface increases as they come closer, the entanglement between the atom and the quantum field actually decreases as the atom gets closer to the conductor, as shown in \cite{Rong,AFD2}. We show how different factors play out, ranging from the coupling between the atoms and the field to the coupling between the atoms, going beyond the weak coupling restrictions often found necessary in the literature. Gathering our results for the entanglement dependence on each variable concerned, we can provide a spatial topography of quantum entanglement, thus enabling a visualized understanding of the behavior of quantum field-mediated entanglement. In particular we can quantify the definition of a three-dimensional \textit{entanglement domain} between the two atoms, how it varies with their coupling, their separation and their distances from the conducting surface, and for practical applications, how to exercise effective control of the entanglement between two atoms by changing these parameters. Our findings are expected to be useful for studies of atom-field-medium interactions in vacuum and surface physics.</p>

            <p>First-quantized, real-space formulations of quantum chemistry on quantum computers are appealing: qubit count scales logarithmically with spatial resolution, and Coulomb operators achieve quadratic instead of quartic computational scaling of two-electron interactions. However, existing schemes employ uniform discretizations, so the resolution required to capture electron-nuclear cusps in high-density regions oversamples low-density regions, wasting computational resources. We address this by deploying non-uniform, molecule-adaptive grids that concentrate points where electronic density is high. Using Voronoi partitions of these grids, the molecular Hamiltonian is expressed in a Hermitian form and in a transcorrelated, isospectral form that eliminates Coulomb singularities and yields cusp-free eigenfunctions. Both formulations slot naturally into quantum eigenvalue solvers: Hermitian Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) and the recent generalised Quantum Eigenvalue Estimation (QEVE) protocol for its non-Hermitian, transcorrelated counterpart. Numerical validation on benchmark systems confirms that this non-heuristic ab initio framework offers a promising path for accurate ground-state chemistry on quantum hardware.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Domenico Pomarico, Federico Dell'Anna, Riccardo Cioli, Saverio Pascazio, Francesco V. Pepe, Paolo Facchi, Elisa Ercolessi</p>
            <p>We present the simulation of the quench dynamics of the Z3 Schwinger model, that describes an approximation of one-dimensional Quantum Electrodynamics, on a digital noisy Rydberg atom platform, aiming at the observation of multiple dynamical quantum phase transitions. In order to reach long-time dynamics, we exploit an enconding dictated by the symmetries, combined with a circuit compression procedure. We focus on a quench that evolves the Dirac vacuum by means of a Hamiltonian depending on a negative mass parameter. This leads to resonant Rabi oscillations between the Dirac vacuum and mesonic states. The population concentration exhibits oscillations with negligible fluctuations of detuned states also with the inclusion of combined noise sources, from which we can clearly detect multiple dynamical phase transitions.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Circuit Caches and Compressors for Low Latency, High Throughput Computing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ioana Moflic, Alan Robertson, Simon J. Devitt, Alexandru Paler</p>
            <p>Utility-scale quantum programs contain operations on the order of $>10^{15}$ which must be prepared and piped from a classical co-processor to the control unit of the quantum device. The latency of this process significantly increases with the size of the program: existing high-level classical representations of quantum programs are typically memory intensive and do not naÃ¯vely efficiently scale to the degree required to execute utility-scale programs in real-time. To combat this limitation, we propose the utilization of high-level quantum circuit caches and compressors. The first save on the time associated with repetitive tasks and sub-circuits, and the latter are useful for representing the programs/circuits in memory-efficient formats. We present numerical evidence that caches and compressors can offer five orders of magnitude lower latencies during the automatic transpilation of extremely large quantum circuits.</p>

            <h2>Phase structure of below-threshold harmonics in aligned molecules: a few-level model system</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samuel SchÃ¶pa, Falk-Erik Wiechmann, Franziska Fennel, Dieter Bauer</p>
            <p>We utilize few-level model systems to analyze the polarization and phase properties of below-threshold harmonics (BTH) in aligned molecules. In a two-level system (TLS), we find that the phase of emitted harmonics undergoes a distinct change. For harmonics with photon energies below the transition between the dominant field-dressed states, the phase alternates by $\pi$ between successive odd harmonic orders but remains constant above. Exploiting this behavior, we construct a four-level model composed of two uncoupled TLS subsystems aligned along orthogonal directions. We demonstrate that with selected transition frequencies lower-order harmonics follow the polarization of the linearly polarized driving field while higher-order harmonics exhibit a mirrored polarization. The model predicts that aligned systems with orthogonal transition dipoles may show analogous phase and polarization features in the BTH regime.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Rademacher, A. Pontin, J. M. H. Gosling, P. F. Barker, M. ToroÅ¡</p>
            <p>Levitated optomechanics, the interaction between light and small levitated objects, is a new macroscopic quantum system that is being used as a testing ground for fundamental physics and for the development of sensors with exquisite sensitivity. The utility of this system, when compared to other quantum optomechanical systems, is its extreme isolation from the environment and, by the relatively few degrees of freedom that a levitated object has. While work in the field has strongly focused on the three translational degrees of freedom of this system, it has become increasingly important to understand the induced rotational motion of levitated objects, particularly in optical trapping fields, but also in magnetic and electric traps. These additional three degrees of freedom, which are intrinsic to levitated systems, offer a new set of optomechanical nonlinear interactions that lead to a rich and yet largely unexplored roto-translational motion. The control and utilization of these interactions promise to extend the utility of levitated optomechanics in both fundamental studies and applications. In this review, we provide an overview of levitated optomechanics, before focusing on the roto-translational motion of optically levitated anisotropic objects. We first present a classical treatment of this induced motion, bridging the gap between classical and quantum formalisms. We describe the different types of roto-translational motion for different particle shapes via their interaction with polarized optical trapping fields. Subsequently, we provide an overview of the theoretical and experimental approaches as well as applications that have established this new field. The review concludes with an outlook of promising experiments and applications, including the creation of non-classical states of roto-translational motion, quantum-limited torque sensing and particle characterization methods.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Simulation of Molecular Dynamics Processes - A Benchmark Study Using Classical Simulator and Present-Day Quantum Hardware</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tamila Kuanysheva, Brian Kendrick, Lukasz Cincio, Dmitri Babikov</p>
            <p>We explore how the fundamental problems in quantum molecular dynamics can be modelled using classical simulators (emulators) of quantum computers and the actual quantum hardware available to us today. The list of problems we tackle includes propagation of a free wave packet, vibration of a harmonic oscillator, and tunneling through a barrier. Each of these problems starts with the initial wave packet setup. Although Qiskit provides a general method for initializing wavefunctions, in most cases it generates deep quantum circuits. While these circuits perform well on noiseless simulators, they suffer from excessive noise on quantum hardware. To overcome this issue, we designed a shallower quantum circuit for preparing a Gaussian-like initial wave packet, which improves the performance on real hardware. Next, quantum circuits are implemented to apply the kinetic and potential energy operators for the evolution of a wavefunction over time. The results of our modelling on classical emulators of quantum hardware agree perfectly with the results obtained using the traditional (classical) methods. This serves as a benchmark and demonstrates that the quantum algorithms and Qiskit codes we developed are accurate. However, the results obtained on the actual quantum hardware available today, such as IBM's superconducting qubits and IonQ's trapped ions, indicate large discrepancies due to hardware limitations. This work highlights both the potential and challenges of using quantum computers to solve fundamental quantum molecular dynamics problems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Byungmin Kang, Patrick A. Lee</p>
            <p>We propose cyclotron resonance as an optical probe for emergent fractionalized excitations in $\mathrm{U}(1)$ quantum spin liquids, focusing on kagome antiferromagnets. In contrast to conventional systems, where cyclotron resonance directly couples to charged carriers, spinons in spin liquids are charge-neutral and interact only through an emergent gauge field. We identify two key mechanisms by which an external physical electromagnetic field induces emergent electric and magnetic fields, enabling indirect coupling to spinons. Using these mechanisms, we compute the absorption rate of the cyclotron resonance response for Dirac spinons forming Landau levels. Our analysis shows that, although the absorption per layer is small, the absence of a skin-depth limitation in insulating spin liquids allows for cumulative absorption comparable to graphene in realistic sample sizes for the recently discovered spin-liquid candidate material YCu${}_3$(OH)${}_6$Br${}_2$[Br${}_{1-y}$(OH)${}_y$]. Our findings shows that cyclotron resonance is a viable experimental probe of spinon Landau quantization and emergent gauge fields, providing powerful positive experimental signatures of quantum spin liquids.</p>

            <p>Recently discovered 2D van der Waals magnetic materials, and specifically Iron-Germanium-Telluride ($\rm Fe_{5}GeTe_{2}$), have attracted significant attention both from a fundamental perspective and for potential applications. Key open questions concern their domain structure and magnetic phase transition temperature as a function of sample thickness and external field, as well as implications for integration into devices such as magnetic memories and logic. Here we address key questions using a nitrogen-vacancy center based quantum magnetic microscope, enabling direct imaging of the magnetization of $\rm Fe_{5}GeTe_{2}$ at sub-micron spatial resolution as a function of temperature, magnetic field, and thickness. We employ spatially resolved measures, including magnetization variance and cross-correlation, and find a significant spread in transition temperature yet with no clear dependence on thickness down to 15 nm. We also identify previously unknown stripe features in the optical as well as magnetic images, which we attribute to modulations of the constituting elements during crystal synthesis and subsequent oxidation. Our results suggest that the magnetic anisotropy in this material does not play a crucial role in their magnetic properties, leading to a magnetic phase transition of $\rm Fe_{5}GeTe_{2}$ which is largely thickness-independent down to 15 nm. Our findings could be significant in designing future spintronic devices, magnetic memories and logic with 2D van der Waals magnetic materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ahmik Virani, Devraj, Anirudh Suresh, Lei Zhang, M V Panduranga Rao</p>
            <p>Quantum computing in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era presents significant challenges in differentiating quantum software bugs from hardware noise. Traditional debugging techniques from classical software engineering cannot directly resolve this issue due to the inherently stochastic nature of quantum computation mixed with noises from NISQ computers. To address this gap, we propose a statistical approach leveraging probabilistic metrics to differentiate between quantum software bugs and hardware noise. We evaluate our methodology empirically using well-known quantum algorithms, including Grover's algorithm, Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, and Simon's algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy and practical applicability of our approach, providing quantum software developers with a reliable analytical tool to identify and classify unexpected behavior in quantum programs.</p>

            <p>Fluctuations are fundamental in physics and important for understanding and characterizing phase transitions. In this spirit, the phase transition to the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) is of specific importance. Whereas fluctuations of the condensate particle number in atomic BECs have been studied in continuous systems, experimental and theoretical studies for lattice systems were so far missing. Here, we explore the condensate particle number fluctuations in an optical lattice BEC across the phase transition in a combined experimental and theoretical study. We present both experimental data using ultracold $^{87}$Rb atoms and numerical simulations based on a hybrid approach combining the Bogoliubov quasiparticle framework with a master equation analysis for modeling the system. We find strongly anomalous fluctuations, where the variance of the condensate number $\delta N_{\rm BEC}^2$ scales with the total atom number as $N^{1+\gamma}$ with an exponent around $\gamma_{\rm theo}=0.74$ and $\gamma_{\rm exp}=0.62$, which we attribute to the 2D/3D crossover geometry and the interactions. Our study highlights the importance of the trap geometry on the character of fluctuations and on fundamental quantum mechanical properties.</p>

            <p>We extend the $(1+1)$-dimensional Dirac-Moshinsky oscillator by changing the standard derivative by the Dunkl derivative. We demonstrate in a general way that for the Dirac-Dunkl oscillator be parity invariant, one of the spinor component must be even, and the other spinor component must be odd, and vice versa. We decouple the differential equations for each of the spinor component and introduce an appropriate $su(1,1)$ algebraic realization for the cases when one of these functions is even and the other function is odd. The eigenfunctions and the energy spectrum are obtained by using the $su(1,1)$ irreducible representation theory. Finally, by setting the Dunkl parameter to vanish, we show that our results reduce to those of the standard Dirac-Moshinsky oscillator.</p>

            <p>We propose and analyze a method for improving quantum chemical energy calculations on a quantum computer impaired by decoherence and shot noise. The error mitigation approach relies on the fact that the one- and two-particle reduced density matrices (1- and 2-RDM) of a chemical system need to obey so-called N-representability constraints. We post-process the result of an RDM measurement by projecting it into the subspace where certain N-representability conditions are fulfilled. Furthermore, we utilize that such constraints also hold in the hole and particle-hole sector and perform projections in these sectors as well. We expand earlier work by conducting a careful analysis of the method's performance in the context of quantum computing. Specifically, we consider typical decoherence channels (dephasing, damping, and depolarizing noise) as well as shot noise due to a finite number of projective measurements. We provide analytical considerations and examine numerically three example systems, \ch{H2}, \ch{LiH}, and \ch{BeH2}. From these investigations, we derive our own practical yet effective method to best employ the various projection options. Our results show the approach to significantly lower energy errors and measurement variances of (simulated) quantum computations.</p>

            <h2>Virtual Quantum Markov Chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Ao Chen, Chengkai Zhu, Keming He, Mingrui Jing, Xin Wang</p>
            <p>Quantum Markov chains generalize classical Markov chains for random variables to the quantum realm and exhibit unique inherent properties, making them an important feature in quantum information theory. In this work, we propose the concept of virtual quantum Markov chains (VQMCs), focusing on scenarios where subsystems retain classical information about global systems from measurement statistics. As a generalization of quantum Markov chains, VQMCs characterize states where arbitrary global shadow information can be recovered from subsystems through local quantum operations and measurements. We present an algebraic characterization for virtual quantum Markov chains and show that the virtual quantum recovery is fully determined by the block matrices of a quantum state on its subsystems. Notably, we find a distinction between two classes of tripartite entanglement by showing that the W state is a VQMC while the GHZ state is not. Furthermore, we introduce the virtual non-Markovianity to quantify the non-Markovianity of a given quantum state, which also assesses the optimal sampling overhead for virtually recovering this state. Our findings elucidate distinctions between quantum Markov chains and virtual quantum Markov chains, extending our understanding of quantum recovery to scenarios prioritizing classical information from measurement statistics.</p>

            <p>We introduce ``dual-unitary shadow tomography'' (DUST), a classical shadow tomography protocol based on dual-unitary brick-wall circuits. To quantify the performance of DUST, we study operator spreading and Pauli weight dynamics in one-dimensional qubit systems, evolved by random two-local dual-unitary gates arranged in a brick-wall structure, ending with a measurement layer. We do this by deriving general constraints on the Pauli weight transfer matrix and specializing to the case of dual-unitarity. Remarkably, we find that operator spreading in these circuits have a rich structure resembling that of relativistic quantum field theories, with massless chiral excitations that can decay or fuse into each other, which we call left- or right-movers. We develop a mean-field description of the Pauli weight in terms of $\rho(x,t)$, which represents the probability of having nontrivial support at site $x$ and depth $t$ starting from a fixed weight distribution. We develop an equation of state for $\rho(x,t)$ and simulate it numerically using Monte Carlo simulations. For the task of predicting operators with (nearly) full support, we show that DUST outperforms brick-wall Clifford shadows of equal depth. This advantage is further pronounced for small system sizes and our results are generally robust to finite-size effects.</p>

            <p>Non-stabilizer states are a fundamental resource for universal quantum computation. However,despite broad significance in quantum computing, the emergence of "many-body" non-stabilizerness in interacting quantum systems remains poorly understood due to its analytical intractability. Here we show that Rydberg atom arrays provide a natural reservoir of non-stabilizerness that extends beyond single qubits and arises from quantum correlations engendered by the Rydberg blockade. We demonstrate that this non-stabilizerness can be experimentally accessed in two complementary ways, either by performing quench dynamics or via adiabatic ground state preparation. Using the analytical framework based on matrix product states, we explain the origin of Rydberg nonstabilizerness via a quantum circuit decomposition of the wave function.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zekun He, A. F. Kemper, J. K. Freericks</p>
            <p>Adiabatic state preparation provides an analytical solution for generating the ground state of a target Hamiltonian, starting from an easily prepared ground state of the initial Hamiltonian. While effective for time-dependent Hamiltonians with an energy gap to the first coupled excited state, the process becomes exceedingly slow as the gap narrows. Rather than strictly following the adiabatic theorem, a more robust approach allows controlled diabatic excitations during the evolution and numerically optimizes the path to eliminate these excitations by the end. In this work, this is achieved via modulated time evolution, using a time dependent oscillating field lambda(t) to modulate the Hamiltonian, in conjunction with a transverse field B(t) whose optimized shape closely resembles a local adiabatic ramp. Beyond modulated time evolution, the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA), which also employs a transverse field defined as beta(t) over gamma(t), exhibits a shape similar to the local adiabatic ramp. This resemblance offers a more intuitive and physically motivated way to understand the QAOA algorithm through the lens of time evolution.</p>

            <p>We explore the important task of applying a phase $\exp(i\,f(x))$ to a computational basis state $\left| x \right>$. The closely related task of rotating a target qubit by an angle depending on $f(x)$ is also studied. Such operations are key in many quantum subroutines, and frequently $f(x)$ can be well-approximated by a piecewise function; examples range from the application of diagonal Hamiltonian terms (such as the Coulomb interaction) in grid-based many-body simulation, to derivative pricing algorithms. Here we exploit a parallelisation of the piecewise approach so that all constituent elementary rotations are performed simultaneously, that is, we achieve a total rotation depth of one. Moreover, we explore the use of recursive catalyst `towers' to implement these elementary rotations efficiently. We find that strategies prioritising execution speed can achieve circuit depth as low as $O(\log{n}{+}\log{S})$ for a register of $n$ qubits and a piecewise approximation of $S$ sections (presuming prior preparation of enabling resource states), albeit total qubit count then scales with $S$. In the limit of multiple repetitions of the oracle, we find that catalyst tower approaches have an $O(S\cdot n)$ T-count.</p>

            <h2>Multipartite Embezzlement of Entanglement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lauritz van Luijk, Alexander Stottmeister, Henrik Wilming</p>
            <p>Embezzlement of entanglement refers to the task of extracting entanglement from an entanglement resource via local operations and without communication while perturbing the resource arbitrarily little. Recently, the existence of embezzling states of bipartite systems of type III von Neumann algebras was shown. However, both the multipartite case and the precise relation between embezzling states and the notion of embezzling families, as originally defined by van Dam and Hayden, was left open. Here, we show that finite-dimensional approximations of multipartite embezzling states form multipartite embezzling families. In contrast, not every embezzling family converges to an embezzling state. We identify an additional consistency condition that ensures that an embezzling family converges to an embezzling state. This criterion distinguishes the embezzling family of van Dam and Hayden from the one by Leung, Toner, and Watrous. The latter generalizes to the multipartite setting. By taking a limit, we obtain a multipartite system of commuting type III$_1$ factors on which every state is an embezzling state. We discuss our results in the context of quantum field theory and quantum many-body physics. As open problems, we ask whether vacua of relativistic quantum fields in more than two spacetime dimensions are multipartite embezzling states and whether multipartite embezzlement allows for an operator-algebraic characterization.</p>

            <p>Solid-state spin systems hold great promise for quantum information processing and the construction of quantum networks. However, the considerable inhomogeneity of spins in solids poses a significant challenge to the scaling of solid-state quantum systems. A practical protocol to individually control and entangle spins remains elusive. To this end, we propose a hybrid spin-phonon architecture based on spin-embedded SiC optomechanical crystal (OMC) cavities, which integrates photonic and phononic channels allowing for interactions between multiple spins. With a Raman-facilitated process, the OMC cavities support coupling between the spin and the zero-point motion of the OMC cavity mode reaching 0.57 MHz, facilitating phonon preparation and spin Rabi swap processes. Based on this, we develop a spin-phonon interface that achieves a two-qubit controlled-Z gate with a simulated fidelity of $96.80\%$ and efficiently generates highly entangled Dicke states with over $99\%$ fidelity, by engineering the strongly coupled spin-phonon dark state which is robust against loss from excited state relaxation as well as spectral inhomogeneity of the defect centers. This provides a hybrid platform for exploring spin entanglement with potential scalability and full connectivity in addition to an optical link, and offers a pathway to investigate quantum acoustics in solid-state systems.</p>

            <p>Machine learning offers a promising methodology to tackle complex challenges in quantum physics.

Here, we propose a cavity-Heisenberg spin chain quantum battery (QB) model with spin-$j (j=1/2,1,3/2)$ and investigate the charging performance under both closed and open quantum cases, considering spin-spin interactions, ambient temperature, and cavity dissipation. It is shown that the charging energy and power of QB are significantly improved with the spin size. By employing a reinforcement learning algorithm to modulate the cavity-battery coupling, we further optimize the QB performance, enabling the stored energy to approach, even exceed its upper bound in the absence of spin-spin interaction. We analyze the optimization mechanism and find an intrinsic relationship between cavity-spin entanglement and charging performance: increased entanglement enhances the charging energy in closed systems, whereas the opposite effect occurs in open systems.

            <p>TThe organization and structure of bipartite mixed-state quantum entanglement (QE) are more complex and less well understood compared to bipartite pure-state QE. Bipartite mixed-state QEs and their measures play a crucial role in both theory and practical applications.

In this context, we propose a method termed Reduction-induced Variation of Partial Von Neumann Entropy to quantify QE in any bipartite states, particularly focusing on bipartite mixed states. Partial Von Neumann Entropy is merely a special case of this method,Its intuitive and clear physical representation, along with easy computation and wide applicability, facilitates exploring its potential applications.

            <p>Quantum simulations of strongly interacting fermionic systems, such as those described by the Hubbard model, are promising candidates for useful early fault-tolerant quantum computing applications. This paper presents Tile Trotterization, a generalization of plaquette Trotterization (PLAQ), which uses a set of tiles to construct Trotter decompositions of arbitrary lattice Hubbard models. The Tile Trotterization scheme also enables the simulation of more complex models, including the extended Hubbard model. We improve previous Hubbard model commutator bounds, further provide tight commutator bounds for periodic extended Hubbard models, and demonstrate the use of tensor network methods for this task. We consider applications of Tile Trotterization to simulate hexagonal lattice Hubbard models and compare the resource requirements of Tile Trotterization for performing quantum phase estimation to a qubitization-based approach, demonstrating that Tile Trotterization scales more efficiently with system size. These advancements significantly broaden the potential applications of early fault-tolerant quantum computers to models of practical interest in materials research and organic chemistry.</p>

            <h2>Randomized Benchmarking with Leakage Errors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi-Hsiang Chen, Charles H. Baldwin</p>
            <p>Leakage errors are unwanted transfer of population outside of a defined computational subspace and they occur in almost every platform for quantum computing. While prevalent, leakage is often overlooked when measuring and reporting the fidelity of quantum gates with standard methods. In fact, when leakage is substantial it can cause a large overestimation of fidelity from the typi- cal method used to measure fidelity, randomized benchmarking. We provide several methods for properly estimating fidelity in the presence of leakage errors that are applicable in different error regimes with carefully chosen sequence lengths. Then, we numerically demonstrate the methods for two-qubit randomized benchmarking, which often have the largest errors. Finally, we reanalyze previously shared data from Quantinuum systems with some of the methods provided.</p>

            <h2>Revealing quantum operator scrambling via measuring Holevo information on digital quantum simulators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bin Sun, Geng-Bin Cao, Xi-Dan Hu, Dan-Bo Zhang</p>
            <p>Quantum operator scrambling describes the spreading of local operators into the whole system in the picture of Heisenberg evolution, which is often quantified by the operator size growth. Here we propose a measure of quantum operator scrambling via Holevo information of operators, by taking its capacity to distinguish operator information locally. We show that the operator size is closely related to a special kind of Holevo information of operators. Moreover, we propose a feasible protocol for measuring Holevo information of operators on digital quantum simulators based on random states. \textcolor{black}{For the mixed-field Ising model,} our numerical simulations show that the integrable system can be told apart from the chaotic system by measuring the spatial-temporal patterns of Holevo information. Furthermore, we find that error mitigation is required to restore the time-oscillation behavior of Holevo information for the integrable system, a crucial feature distinct from the chaotic one. Our work provides a new perspective to understand the information scrambling and quantum chaos from aspects of Holevo information of operators.</p>

            <p>These notes review a description of quantum mechanics in terms of the topology of spaces, basing on the axioms of Topological Quantum Field Theory and path integral formalism. In this description quantum states and operators are encoded by the topology of spaces that are used as modules to build the quantum mechanical model, while expectation values and probabilities are given by topological invariants of spaces, knots and links. The notes focus on the specific way the topology encodes quantum mechanical features, or, equivalently, on how these features can be controlled through the topology. A topological classification of entanglement is discussed, as well as properties of entanglement entropy and basic quantum protocols. The primary aim is to build a less conventional diagrammatic intuition about quantum mechanics, expanding the paradigm of ``Quantum Picturalism".</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthew Brooks, Foster Sabatino, Charles Tahan, Silas Hoffman</p>
            <p>While the adiabatic exchange of Majorana zero modes (MZMs) enables a non-universal set of geometrically protected gates, realising an experimental implementation of MZM braiding remains challenging. In an alternative proposal, charge-parity measurement of two neighboring MZMs supports braiding by teleportation. Moreover, owing to the lack of definitive evidence of MZMs in semiconducting systems, there have been several simulations of MZMs on NISQ devices which more naturally lend themselves to braiding. In this work, measurement-based braiding about MZM Y-junctions are simulated by multi-qubit Pauli-parity measurements of a logical qubit. Logical single-qubit geometric $S^{(\dagger)}$-gates and entangling two-qubit gates is shown using two-physical-qubit joint measurements alone, whilst partial phase rotations such as a $T^{(\dagger)}$-gates require at least one three-qubit joint measurement. These relatively small scale circuits offer both novel measurement-based geometric gates as well as a measurement-based demonstration of quantum Hamiltonian simulation.</p>

            <h2>Quantum synchronization blockade induced by nonreciprocal coupling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tobias Kehrer, Christoph Bruder</p>
            <p>Recently, the synchronization of coupled quantum oscillators has attracted a great deal of interest. Synchronization requires driven constituents, and in such systems, the coupling can be designed to be nonreciprocal. Nonreciprocally coupled oscillators exhibit a rich variety of behavior including active traveling-wave-type states. In this work, we study the interplay of three competing synchronization mechanisms in a setup of two nonreciprocally coupled quantum van der Pol oscillators. One of the oscillators is driven externally which induces phase locking. A dissipative interaction leads to antiphase locking, whereas a coherent interaction nurtures bistable phase locking and active states. We approximate the phase diagram of the quantum case by evaluating the synchronization measure of a perturbation expansion of the steady state. Effective unidirectional interactions lead to synchronization blockades between the undriven oscillator and the external drive as well as between both oscillators. Furthermore, we study the phase diagrams of two and three oscillators in the mean-field limit and find highly nontrivial active states.</p>

Also explores symmetric Quantum Private Information Retrieval (QPIR) protocols that achieve sub-linear communication complexity while ensuring robustness against specious adversaries: A post-quantum cryptography based protocol that can be authenticated for the specious server; A ring-LWE-based protocol for post-quantum security in a single-server setting, ensuring robustness against quantum attacks; A multi-server protocol optimized for hardware practicality, reducing implementation overhead while maintaining sub-linear efficiency. These protocols address critical gaps in secure database queries, offering exponential communication improvements over classical linear-complexity methods.

            <p>The Quantum Internet, a network of quantum-enabled infrastructure, represents the next frontier in telecommunications, promising capabilities that cannot be attained by classical counterparts. A crucial step in realizing such large-scale quantum networks is the integration of entanglement distribution within existing telecommunication infrastructure. Here, we demonstrate a real-world scalable quantum networking testbed deployed within Deutsche Telekom's metropolitan fibers in Berlin. Using commercially available quantum devices and standard add-drop multiplexing hardware, we distributed polarization-entangled photon pairs over dynamically selectable fiber paths ranging from 10~m to 60 km, and showed entanglement distribution over up to approximately 100~km. Quantum signals, transmitted at 1324~nm (O-band), coexist with conventional bidirectional C-band traffic without dedicated fibers or infrastructure changes. Active stabilization of the polarization enables robust long-term performance, achieving entanglement Bell-state fidelity bounds between 85-99% and Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt parameter $S$-values between 2.36-2.74 during continuous multiday operation. By achieving a high-fidelity entanglement distribution with less than 1.5% downtime, we confirm the feasibility of hybrid quantum-classical networks under real-world conditions at the metropolitan scale. These results establish deployment benchmarks and provide a practical roadmap for telecom operators to integrate quantum capabilities.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pervez Hoodbhoy, M. Haashir Ismail, M. Mufassir</p>
            <p>Coupled instantons are introduced by generalizing the double well potential to multiple mutually coupled wells. Physically this corresponds to the simultaneous tunneling of multiple degrees of freedom. A system with four equal minima is examined in detail. It has three instanton types or flavors with distinct actions. For weak coupling and subject to there being a single large (or small) parameter, the interactive system can be handled perturbatively. The zero mode problem arising from time translation symmetry is handled via the Fadeev-Popov procedure. A diagrammatic procedure allows corrections to the fluctuation determinant to be calculated systematically. Independent instanton contributions are summed over by extending the dilute gas approximation to three flavors and energy splittings of the lowest four states is calculated. All tunneling amplitudes are concisely expressed in terms of elementary functions. While the model is possibly useful for a variety of physical systems, an application is made here to the tunneling of a composite particle in one dimension.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate how a single heat exchange between a probe thermal qubit and multi-qubit thermal machine encoding a Boolean function, can determine whether the function is balanced or constant, thus providing a novel thermodynamic solution to the Deutsch-Jozsa problem. We introduce a thermodynamic model of quantum query complexity, showing how qubit thermal machines can act as oracles, queried via heat exchange with a probe. While the Deutsch-Jozsa problem requires an exponential encoding in the number of oracle bits, we also explore the Bernstein-Vazirani problem, which admits a linear thermal oracle and a single thermal query solution. We establish bounds on the number of samples needed to determine the probe temperature encoding the solution for the Deutsch-Jozsa problem, showing that it remains constant with problem size. Additionally, we propose a proof-of-principle experimental implementation to solve the 3-bit Bernstein-Vazirani problem via thermal kickback.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xu-Dan Xie, Zheng-Yuan Xue, Dan-Bo Zhang</p>
            <p>In open quantum systems, the Liouvillian gap characterizes the relaxation time toward the steady state. However, accurately computing this quantity is notoriously difficult due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space and the non-Hermitian nature of the Liouvillian superoperator. In this work, we propose a variational quantum algorithm for efficiently estimating the Liouvillian gap. By utilizing the Choi-Jamiokowski isomorphism, we reformulate the problem as finding the first excitation energy of an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Our method employs variance minimization with an orthogonality constraint to locate the first excited state and adopts a two-stage optimization scheme to enhance convergence. Moreover, to address scenarios with degenerate steady states, we introduce an iterative energy-offset scanning technique. Numerical simulations on the dissipative XXZ model confirm the accuracy and robustness of our algorithm across a range of system sizes and dissipation strengths. These results demonstrate the promise of variational quantum algorithms for simulating open quantum many-body systems on near-term quantum hardware.</p>

            <p>We establish and analyse the performance and resource requirements of an end-to-end fault-tolerant quantum algorithm for computing the absorption spectrum and population dynamics of photoexcited pyrazine. The quantum circuit construction consists of initial state preparation using uniformly controlled rotations, the time-dependent Hamiltonian propagation based on the grid-based Split Operator Quantum Fourier Transform (SO-QFT) method, and cost-effective measurements including statistical and canonical phase estimation. We use classical emulations to validate the quantum resources required for the task, and propose generalised formulae for the qubit count and gate depth calculation. Simulating the vibronic dynamics of pyrazine in a low-dimensional abstraction requires 17-qubit circuits with a gate depth of $\mathcal{O}(10^4)$, whereas a full-dimensional simulation of pyrazine in 24 modes requires at least 97-qubit circuits with a gate depth of $\mathcal{O}(10^6)$. Our work provides a foundational framework for understanding high-dimensional wavepacket-based quantum simulations of photo-induced dynamics and vibronic spectra, anticipating future applications in the simulation of even larger molecular systems on fault-tolerant quantum computers.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fionnuala Curran, Morteza Moradi, Gabriel Senno, Magdalena Stobinska, Antonio AcÃ­n</p>
            <p>Quantum physics exhibits an intrinsic and private form of randomness with no classical counterpart. Any setup for quantum randomness generation involves measurements acting on quantum states. In this work, we consider the following question: Given a quantum measurement, how much randomness can be generated from it? In real life, measurements are noisy and thus contain an additional, extrinsic form of randomness due to ignorance. This extrinsic randomness is not private since, in an adversarial model, it takes the form of quantum side information held by an eavesdropper who can use it to predict the measurement outcomes. Randomness of measurements is then quantified by the guessing probability of this eavesdropper, when minimized over all possible input states. This optimization is in general hard to compute, but we solve it here for any two-outcome qubit measurement and for projective measurements in arbitrary dimension mixed with white noise. We also construct, for a given measured probability distribution, different realizations with (i) a noisy state and noiseless measurement (ii) a noiseless state and noisy measurement and (iii) a noisy state and measurement, and we show that the latter gives an eavesdropper significantly higher guessing power.</p>

            <p>We present a novel framework for Linear Combination of Unitaries (LCU)-style decomposition tailored to structured sparse matrices, which frequently arise in the numerical solution of partial differential equations (PDEs). While LCU is a foundational primitive in both variational and fault-tolerant quantum algorithms, conventional approaches based on the Pauli basis can require a number of terms that scales quadratically with matrix size. We introduce the Sigma basis, a compact set of simple, non-unitary operators that can better capture sparsity and structure, enabling decompositions with only polylogarithmic scaling in the number of terms. We develop both numerical and semi-analytical methods for computing Sigma basis decompositions of arbitrary matrices. Given this new basis is comprised of non-unitary operators, we leverage the concept of unitary completion to design efficient quantum circuits for evaluating observables in variational quantum algorithms and for constructing block encodings in fault-tolerant quantum algorithms. We compare our method to related techniques like unitary dilation, and demonstrate its effectiveness through several PDE examples, showing exponential improvements in decomposition size while retaining circuit efficiency.</p>

            <p>Substitutional nitrogen atoms in a diamond crystal (P1 centers) are, on one hand, a resource for creation of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers, that have been widely employed as nanoscale quantum sensors. On the other hand, P1's electron spin is a source of paramagnetic noise that degrades the NV's performance by shortening its coherence time. Accurate quantification of nitrogen concentration is therefore essential for optimizing diamond-based quantum devices. However, bulk characterization methods based on optical absorption or electron paramagnetic resonance often overlook local variations in nitrogen content. In this work, we use a helium ion microscope to fabricate nanoscale NV center ensembles at predefined sites in a diamond crystal containing low concentrations of nitrogen. We then utilize these NV-based probes to measure the local nitrogen concentration on the level of 230 ppb (atomic parts per billion) using the double electron-electron resonance (DEER) technique. Moreover, by comparing the DEER spectra with numerical simulations, we managed to determine the concentration of other unknown paramagnetic defects created during the ion implantation, reaching 15 ppb depending on the implantation dose.</p>

            <p>Simulating nuclear matter described by quantum chromodynamics using quantum computers is notoriously inefficient because of the assortment of quark degrees of freedom such as matter/antimatter, flavor, color, and spin. Here, we propose to address this resource efficiency challenge by encoding three qubits within individual ytterbium-171 atoms of a neutral atom quantum processor. The three qubits are encoded in three distinct sectors: an electronic "clock" transition, the spin-1/2 nucleus, and the lowest two motional states in one radial direction of the harmonic trapping potential. We develop a family of composite sideband pulses and demonstrate a universal gate set and readout protocol for this three-qubit system. We then apply it to single-flavor quantum chromodynamics in 1+1D axial gauge for which the three qubits directly represent the occupancy of quarks in the three colors. We show that two atoms are sufficient to simulate both vacuum persistence oscillations and string breaking. We consider resource requirements and connections to error detection/correction. Our work is a step towards resource-efficient digital simulation of nuclear matter and opens new opportunities for versatile qubit encoding in neutral atom quantum processors.</p>

            <p>Rydberg atom array experiments have demonstrated the ability to act as powerful quantum simulators, preparing strongly-correlated phases of matter which are challenging to study for conventional computer simulations. A key direction has been the implementation of interactions on frustrated geometries, in an effort to prepare exotic many-body states such as spin liquids and glasses. In this paper, we apply two-dimensional recurrent neural network (RNN) wave functions to study the ground states of Rydberg atom arrays on the kagome lattice. We implement an annealing scheme to find the RNN variational parameters in regions of the phase diagram where exotic phases may occur, corresponding to rough optimization landscapes. For Rydberg atom array Hamiltonians studied previously on the kagome lattice, our RNN ground states show no evidence of exotic spin liquid or emergent glassy behavior. In the latter case, we argue that the presence of a non-zero Edwards-Anderson order parameter is an artifact of the long autocorrelations times experienced with quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations, and we show that autocorrelations can be systematically reduced by increasing numerical effort. This result emphasizes the utility of autoregressive models, such as RNNs, in conjunction with QMC, to explore Rydberg atom array physics on frustrated lattices and beyond.</p>

We show that measurement of the final state distributions for a process that involves only several metastable intermediate states is sufficient to identify the PES that captures the long-range interactions properly. Furthermore, we show that a modest increase in the experimental energy resolution will allow for resolving individual Feshbach resonances and enable a quantitative probe of the interactions at short and intermediate range.</p>

            <p>We establish an analytical criterion for dynamical thermalization within harmonic systems, applicable to both classical and quantum models. Specifically, we prove that thermalization of various observables, such as particle energies in physically relevant random quadratic Hamiltonians, is typical for large systems ($N \gg 1$) with initial conditions drawn from the microcanonical distribution. Moreover, we show that thermalization can also arise from non-typical initial conditions, where only a finite fraction of the normal modes is excited. A different choice of initial conditions, such as all the initial energy localized in a single particle, instead leads to energy equipartition without thermalization. Since the models we consider are integrable, our findings provide a general dynamical basis for an approach to thermalization that bypasses chaos and ergodicity, focusing instead on the physical requirement that thermodynamic observables depend on a large number of normal modes, and build a bridge between the classical and quantum theories of thermalization.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Si-Han Li, Si-Han Shang, Shu-Min Wu</p>
            <p>In a relativistic framework, it is generally accepted that quantum steering of maximally entangled states provide greater advantages in practical applications compared to non-maximally entangled states. In this paper, we investigate quantum steering for four different types of Bell-like states of fermionic modes near the event horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole. In some parameter spaces, the peak of steering asymmetry corresponds to a transition from two-way to one-way steerability for Bell-like states under the influence of the Hawking effect. It is intriguing to find that the fermionic steerability of the maximally entangled states experiences sudden death with the Hawking temperature, while the fermionic steerability of the non-maximally entangled states maintains indefinite persistence at infinite Hawking temperature. In contrast to prior research, this finding suggests that quantum steering of non-maximally entangled states is more advantageous than that of maximally entangled states for processing quantum tasks in the gravitational background. This surprising result overturns the traditional idea of ``the advantage of maximally entangled steering in the relativistic framework" and provides a new perspective for understanding the Hawking effect of the black hole.</p>

Here, we combine these two crucial ingredients for the first time by proposing a completely new orbital optical Raman lattice scheme to explore exotic high-orbital Bose condensates with Raman-induced SOC in a square lattice. We find that both the SOC and p-orbital interactions influence the condensed state of bosons. Their interplay results in two novel high-orbital many-body quantum phases: the uniform angular momentum superfluid phase, which exhibits a global topological chiral orbital current characterized by a uniform Chern number, and the two-dimensional topological spin-orbital supersolid phase, which is characterized by the spin and orbital angular momentum density wave patterns and topological excitations with opposite Chern numbers, respectively protecting the chiral and antichiral edge modes in the neighboring supersolid clusters. Our scheme may open a new avenue for exploring exotic SOC and high-orbital physics in optical lattices, and is expected to advance the experimental realization of novel supersolids in higher dimensions.</p>

It can further be saturated in two-terminal settings with boxcar-shaped transmission functions and reduces to its classical counterpart in linear response. Upon insertion of a numerical factor, our bound also extends to systems with broken time-reversal symmetry. As an application, we derive trade-off relations between the figures of merit of coherent thermoelectric heat engines and refrigerators, which show that such devices can attain ideal efficiency only at vanishing mean power or diverging power fluctuations. To illustrate our results, we work out a model of a coherent conductor consisting of a chain of quantum dots.</p>

            <p>Diamond lattice magnets, formed by a framework of corner-sharing tetrahedra of magnetic cations, offer unique opportunities to realize novel states of matter for potential utility in information technology. However, research has mostly focused on AB2X4 spinels with Td magnetic ions. This hinders the atomically enabled tunability of competing interactions at different energy scales and the ability to harness many-body electronic states in quantum materials, making the discovery of quantum fluctuations and spin dynamics less accessible. We discover a new material CaCo2TeO6 featuring a diamond lattice of two distinct Oh-Co2+ sites. This material displays strong quantum fluctuations, increased competing magnetic exchange interactions, and field-induced tunability of magnetic structures. The results demonstrate how simple, fundamental refinements in ligand fields can profoundly influence the phase space of quantum matter.</p>

            <h2>Experimental Observation of Single- and Multi-Site Matter-Wave Solitons in 1D Optical Lattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robbie Cruickshank, Francesco Lorenzi, Arthur La Rooij, Ethan Kerr, Timon Hilker, Stefan Kuhr, Luca Salasnich, Elmar Haller</p>
            <p>We report the experimental observation of discrete bright matter-wave solitons with attractive interaction in an optical lattice. Using an accordion lattice with adjustable spacing, we prepare a Bose-Einstein condensate of cesium atoms across a defined number of lattice sites. By quenching the interaction strength and the trapping potential, we generate both single-site and multi-site solitons. Our results reveal the existence and characteristics of these solitons across a range of lattice depths and spacings. We identify stable regions of the solitons, based on interaction strength and lattice properties, and compare these findings with theoretical predictions. The experimental results qualitatively agree with a Gaussian variational model and match quantitatively with numerical simulations of the three-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation, extended with a quintic term to account for the loss of atoms. Our results provide insights into the quench dynamics and collapse mechanisms, paving the way for further studies on transport and dynamical properties of matter-wave solitons in lattices.</p>

            <h2>Zitterbewegung, Momentum and spin dynamics of photon in linear dielectric medium</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adam B. Cahaya</p>
            <p>The momentum of light in dielectric media has been a century-long controversy that continues to attract significant interest. In a linear dielectric medium with refractive index n, the momentum is predicted to be smaller by a factor of n according to Max Abraham, and larger by the same factor according to Hermann Minkowski. By studying the coupled dynamics of electromagnetic waves and dipoles in a dielectric medium, we show that the change in momentum of the dipole, expressed by the Lorentz force, corresponds to the Abraham momentum. On the other hand, the Minkowski momentum arises as the eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian and determines the direction of refraction in accordance with Snell's law. Our model also predicts a zitterbewegung-like oscillation due to helicity mixing between left- and right-handed wave components, mediated by dipole oscillation. These internal wave dynamics may be observable via wavepacket motion or polarization-sensitive measurements.</p>

            <h2>A Hybrid Classical-Quantum Rainbow Table Attack on Human Passwords</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> MA. Khajeian</p>
            <p>Long, human-generated passwords pose significant challenges to both classical and quantum attacks due to their irregular structure and large search space. In this work, we propose an enhanced classical-quantum hybrid attack specifically designed for this scenario. Our approach constructs rainbow tables using dictionary-based password generation augmented with transformation rules that better capture real-world user behavior. These tables are organized into buckets, enabling faster lookup and reduced space complexity. For the search within each bucket, we employ a distributed exact variant of Grover's algorithm. This method provides deterministic success and significantly lower circuit depth, enhancing robustness against noise-particularly depolarizing errors common in near-term quantum devices. Overall, our hybrid framework improves the efficiency and practicality of password recovery for long, human-readable passwords in realistic adversarial settings.</p>

            <h2>Temporal Entanglement from Holographic Entanglement Entropy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michal P. Heller, Fabio Ori, Alexandre Serantes</p>
            <p>Recently, several notions of entanglement in time have emerged as a novel frontier in quantum many-body physics, quantum field theory and gravity. We propose a systematic prescription to characterize temporal entanglement in relativistic quantum field theory in a general state for an arbitrary subregion on a flat, constant-time slice in a flat spacetime. Our prescriptions starts with the standard entanglement entropy of a spatial subregion and amounts to transporting the unchanged subregion to boosted time slices all the way across the light cone when it becomes in general a complex characterization of the corresponding temporal subregion. For holographic quantum field theories, our prescription amounts to an analytic continuation of all codimension-two bulk extremal surfaces satisfying the homology constraint and picking the one with the smallest real value of the area as the leading saddle point. We implement this prescription for holographic conformal field theories in thermal states on both a two-dimensional Lorentzian cylinder and three-dimensional Minkowski space, and show that it leads to results with self-consistent physical properties of temporal entanglement.</p>

            <p>The Josephson junction and shunt capacitor form a transmon qubit, which is the cornerstone of modern quantum computing platforms. For reliable quantum computing, it is important how long a qubit can remain in a superposition of quantum states, which is determined by the coherence time (T1). The coherence time of a qubit effectively sets the "lifetime" of usable quantum information, determining how long quantum computations can be performed before errors occur and information is lost. There are several sources of decoherence in transmon qubits, but the predominant one is generally considered to be dielectric losses in the natural oxide layer formed on the surface of the superconductor. In this paper, we present a numerical study of microwave surface losses in planar superconducting antennas of different transmon qubit designs. An asymptotic method for estimating the energy participation ratio in ultrathin films of nanometer scales is proposed, and estimates are given for the limits of achievable minimum RF losses depending on the electrical properties of the surface oxide and the interface of the qubit with the substrate material.</p>

            <h2>Average-computation benchmarking for local expectation values in digital quantum devices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Flavio Baccari, Pavel Kos, Georgios Styliaris</p>
            <p>As quantum devices progress towards a quantum advantage regime, they become harder to benchmark. A particularly relevant challenge is to assess the quality of the whole computation, beyond testing the performance of each single operation. Here we introduce a scheme for this task that combines the target computation with variants of it, which, when averaged, allow for classically solvable correlation functions. Importantly, the variants exactly preserve the circuit architecture and depth, without simplifying the gates into a classically-simulable set. The method is based on replacing each gate by an ensemble of similar gates, which when averaged together form space-time channels [P. Kos and G. Styliaris, Quantum 7, 1020 (2023)]. We introduce explicit constructions for ensembles producing such channels, all applicable to arbitrary brickwork circuits, and provide a general recipe to find new ones through semidefinite programming. The resulting average computation retains important information about the original circuit and is able to detect noise beyond a Clifford benchmarking regime. Moreover, we provide evidence that estimating average-computation expectation values requires running only a limited number of different circuit realizations.</p>

            <h2>Secure One-Sided Device-Independent Quantum Key Distribution Under Collective Attacks with Enhanced Robustness</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pritam Roy, Subhankar Bera, A. S. Majumdar</p>
            <p>We study the security of a quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol under the one-sided device-independent (1sDI) setting, which assumes trust in only one party's measurement device. This approach effectively provides a balance between the experimental viability of device-dependent (DD-QKD) and the minimal trust assumptions of device-independent (DI-QKD). An analytical lower bound on the asymptotic key rate is derived to provide security against collective attacks, in which the eavesdropper's information is limited only by the function of observed violation of a linear quantum steering inequality, specifically the three-setting Cavalcanti--Jones--Wiseman--Reid (CJWR) inequality. We provide a closed-form key rate formula by reducing the security analysis to mixtures of Bell-diagonal states by utilizing symmetries of the steering functional. We show that the protocol tolerates higher quantum bit error rates (QBER) than present DI-QKD protocols by benchmarking its performance under depolarizing noise. Furthermore, we explore the impact of detection inefficiencies and show that, in contrast to DI-QKD, which requires near-perfect detection, secure key generation can be achieved even with lower detection efficiency on the untrusted side. These findings demonstrate the viability of using 1sDI-QKD with current technology and highlight its advantages as a steering-based substitute for secure quantum communication.</p>

            <p>The process in which Raman scattering produces correlated Stokes and anti-Stokes radiation is known as Stokes-anti-Stokes (SaS) scattering. It has been shown recently that this process can generate entangled photon pairs, making it a promising tool for quantum optical technologies, but a proper quantum theoretical description was lacking. In this paper, a fully quantum derivation of the electric polarization in a medium with vibrational Raman response, with quantized electromagnetic fields, is developed. Using quantum perturbation theory for Heisenberg operators, we find the solution for the material electric polarization and show that the correlated SaS scattering appears in the first order of perturbation, corresponding to a four-wave mixing phenomenon. We also discuss how to construct the third-order non-linear optical susceptibility for the SaS scattering from the quantum formalism, and show that it coincides with the one derived for classical fields in stimulated Raman.</p>

            <p>Color centers defects in solids, and particularly the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, are crucial physical platforms for quantum technology applications. Therefore, a precise and rigorous numerical modeling of the NV system is indispensable for the continued advancement of the field. Within this context, this work develops a Python software for simulating the NV spin dynamics in pulsed sequences under general experimental conditions, i.e. a digital twin. The library accounts for electromagnetic pulses and other environmental inputs, which are used to solve the system's time-evolution dynamics, resulting in a physical output in the form of a quantum mechanical observable given by the fluorescence. The simulations framework is based on a non-perturbative time-dependent Hamiltonian model, solved in the laboratory frame. Whereby eliminating oversimplifications such as the assumption of instantaneous $\delta$-pulses and rotating wave approximations, our simulations reveal subtle dynamics from the realistic pulse constraints that impact quantum systems. Three use-case examples illustrate the use of the software and validate it by comparing the simulation results with well-established experimental works, relevant to the fields of quantum computing (two-qubit conditional logic gates), sensing (noise resilient dynamical decoupling sequences between NV and couples spins) and networks (teleportation of a quantum state between entangled NVs). Overall, this digital twin delivers a robust and detailed numerical modeling of the NV spin dynamics, with simple and accessible usability, for an extensive application range.</p>

Using phthalocyanine assemblies as a structurally constrained prototype, we model a continuous deformation from a Lieb to a kagome lattice, revealing frustration-driven disorder and magnetic field-induced reordering in the spin structure. The annealer provides access to observables such as the static structure factor and magnetization over a wide parameter space, enabling the characterization of magnetic arrangements beyond the reach of current molecular architectures. This surrogate modeling approach supports a feedback loop between experiment and programmable quantum hardware, offering a pathway to explore and iteratively design tunable magnetic states in synthetic quantum materials. The synthetic design, structural characterization, and quantum simulation framework established here defines a modular and scalable paradigm for probing the limits of engineered quantum matter across chemistry, condensed matter, and quantum information science.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peng Zhao, Peng Xu, Zheng-Yuan Xue</p>
            <p>Fluxoniums have emerged as a compelling qubit modality for superconducting quantum computing, owing to their strong anharmonicity and high coherence. However, it remains to be seen whether the implementation of high-fidelity entangling gates in a scalable manner will be achieved or not for fluxoniums. Here, we show that fluxonium architectures with tunable plasmon interactions have the capability to implement scalable multi-qubit gates natively while remaining compatible with existing single- and two-qubit gate realizations. Within the architecture, even though qubit states are decoupled, engineered interactions in noncomputational manifolds can facilitate the realization of $(C^{\otimes N})Z$ gates (for $N\geq 2$). This is accomplished by driving qubit-state selective transitions into noncomputational manifolds. Our case studies show that CCZ, CCCZ, and CCCCZ gates with errors of approximately 0.01 (0.001) are achievable, with gate lengths of $50\,(100)\,\text{ns}$, $100\,(250)\,\text{ns}$, and $150\,(300)\,\text{ns}$, respectively. These results underscore the potential of the fluxonium architecture for scalable quantum computation through fast, high-fidelity native multi-qubit gates.</p>

Furthermore, exploiting point-group symmetry enables the assignment of polaritonic excited states as well as their targeted calculation. Using our implementation, the aromatic species benzene, fluorobenzene and azulene are investigated. We demonstrate that molecules in unpolarized cavities have a complicated excited-state landscapes with a plethora of avoided-crossings. We compare the results for a cavity with a single polarization to those of an unpolarized cavity described by two perpendicular polarization vectors using the excited states of the H$_2$ molecule as an example.</p>

            <p>Multimode multiphoton states are at the center of many photonic quantum technologies, from photonic quantum computing to quantum sensing. In this work, we derive a procedure to generate exactly, and with a controlled number of steps, any such state by using only multiport interferometers, photon number resolving detectors, photon additions, and displacements. We achieve this goal by establishing a connection between photonic quantum state engineering and the algebraic problem of symmetric tensor decomposition. This connection allows us to solve the problem by using corresponding results from algebraic geometry and unveils a mechanism of photon catalysis, where photons are injected and subsequently retrieved in measurements, to generate entanglement that cannot be obtained through Gaussian operations. We also introduce a tensor decomposition, that generalizes our method and allows to construct optimal circuits for particular classes of states. As a benchmark, we numerically evaluate our method and compare its performance with state-of-the art results, confirming 100% fidelity on different classes of states.</p>

Metasurfaces, two-dimensional arrays of nanostructures, have been studied intensively to enhance and control pair generation via spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC). Van der Waals (VdW) layered materials have emerged as promising candidates for nonlinear materials in quantum light sources, owing to their high nonlinear susceptibility and compatibility with on-chip integration. In this work, we present the first demonstration of SPDC from a metasurface composed of the VdW material 3R-MoS2. The nanoresonators support quasi-bound states in the continuum (qBIC) with a quality factor of up to 120, enhancing light-matter interactions. This design achieves a 20-fold increase in SPDC rate compared to an unstructured film and significantly higher brightness, resulting in enhanced quantum photon-pair generation.

            <p>Cavity polaritons, quasiparticles formed by coherent light-matter coupling, are at the heart of fundamental concepts of quantum optics. The quintessential signature of this coherent coupling is the Rabi oscillation, which results from the neglect of the counter-rotating-wave (CRW) effect in the weak-coupling regime. The goal of this letter is to predict resonant beatings that envelop the Rabi oscillation on the second or higher excitation manifold. These polariton beatings arise from the CRW term in the Dicke or Pauli-Fierz model and are directly correlated with the asymmetry in polariton eigenenergies. Our findings highlight the relevance of the CRW effect even in the weak-coupling regime, offer novel perspectives about coherent polariton dynamics, and shed new light on experiments of coupled quantum systems.</p>

We employ a back-gated graphene Josephson junction, comprising high-mobility CVD-grown graphene encapsulated in hexagonal Boron Nitride (hBN) and contacted by Nb leads. Superconducting pockets are detected persisting beyond the QH onset, up to 2.4 T, hence approaching the upper critical field of the Nb contacts. We observe an approximate $\Phi_0=h/2e$ periodicity of the QH-supercurrent as a function of the magnetic field, indicating superconducting interference in a proximitized percolative phase. These results provide a promising experimental platform to investigate the transport regime of percolative supercurrents, leveraging the flexibility of van der Waals devices.</p>

            <p>Random quantum states have various applications in quantum information science, including quantum cryptography, quantum simulation, and benchmarking quantum devices. In this work, we discover a new ensemble of quantum states that serve as an $\epsilon$-approximate state $t$-design while possessing extremely low entanglement, magic, and coherence. We show that those resources such quantum states can reach their theoretical lower bounds, $\Omega\left(\log (t/\epsilon)\right)$, which are also proven in this work. This implies that for fixed $t$ and $\epsilon$, those resources do not scale with the system size, i.e., $O(1)$ with respect to the total number of qubits $n$ in the system. Moreover, we explicitly construct an ancilla-free shallow quantum circuit for generating such states. To this end, we develop an algorithm that transforms $k$-qubit approximate state designs into $n$-qubit ones through a sequence of multi-controlled gates, without increasing the support size. The depth of such a quantum circuit is $O\left(t [\log t]^3 \log n \log(1/\epsilon)\right)$, which is the most efficient among existing algorithms without ancilla qubits. A class of shallow quantum circuits proposed in our work offers reduced cost for classical simulation of random quantum states, leading to potential applications in various quantum information processing tasks. As a concrete example for demonstrating utility of our algorithm, we propose classical shadow tomography using an $O(1)$-entangled estimator, which can achieve shorter runtime compared to conventional schemes.</p>

In particular, we examine the influence of the squeezed generalized amplitude damping (SGAD) channel, along with its subchannels -- generalized amplitude damping (GAD) and amplitude damping (AD) -- on the QFI with respect to entanglement weight ($\theta$) and phase ($\phi$) parameters. Our results show that under strong squeezing ($r = 1$), the QFI with respect to $\theta$ becomes completely resistant to variations in the Hawking temperature ($T_H$), while still exhibiting degradation with increasing channel temperature ($T_C$). The QFI decay is significantly slower at $r = 1$ compared to $r = 0$, suggesting that squeezing can function as an error mitigation strategy. For QFI with respect to $\phi$, a transient spike is observed at $T_C = 2$, potentially due to thermal resonance or non-monotonic decoherence, and this behavior is unaffected by $T_H$. Similar patterns are noted in the GAD and AD channels, where $T_C$ consistently dominates as the principal source of decoherence. Overall, the results highlight the intricate interplay between environmental noise, relativistic effects, and quantum error resilience in curved spacetime.</p>

            <p>Pushing the boundaries of measurement precision is central for sensing and metrology, pursued by nonclassical resources such as squeezing, and non-Hermitian degeneracies with distinct spectral response. Their convergence, however, remains challenging. We find extraordinary enhancement of sensitivity by unifying both effects in a general framework for quantum sensing in open systems. At the parametric oscillation threshold and an exceptional point, the sensing precision exhibits a unique quartic scaling with the perturbation strength. The result generalizes to multimode squeezed-state sensors with higher-order exceptional points catered to various quantum sensing platforms.</p>

            <h2>Spatial correlations in four-wave mixing with structured light</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mateus R. L. da Motta, Sandra S. Vianna</p>
            <p>We present a detailed theoretical treatment of four-wave mixing (FWM) in a quantized paraxial framework, capturing the multi-spatial-mode nature of the biphoton state generated in the process. By analyzing the biphoton state both in position and momentum representations, we identify the conditions under which these descriptions become equivalent. We also highlight formal and physical similarities between FWM and spontaneous parametric down-conversion (PDC), showing that the transfer of pump structure to the spatial coincidence profile, an important and well-known characteristic of the biphoton state, carries over naturally to FWM. In addition, our treatment captures the transition from position correlations in the near field to momentum correlations in the far field, reflecting the underlying spatial entanglement. The measures of entanglement, including the spiral bandwidth and the Schmidt rank, are discussed. Our work consolidates known and new results on spatial correlations in FWM and provides a theoretical framework that may support future studies in nonlinear and quantum optics with structured light.</p>

            <p>We extend correlated sampling from classical auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo to the quantum-classical (QC-AFQMC) framework, enabling accurate nuclear force computations crucial for geometry optimization and reaction dynamics. Stochastic electronic structure methods typically encounter prohibitive statistical noise when computing gradients via finite differences. To address this, our approach maximizes correlation between nearby geometries by synchronizing random number streams, aligning orbitals, using deterministic integral decompositions, and employing a consistent set of classical shadow measurements defined at a single reference geometry. Crucially, reusing this single, reference-defined shadow ensemble eliminates the need for additional quantum measurements at displaced geometries. Together, these methodological choices substantially reduce statistical variance in computed forces. We validate the method across hydrogen chains, confirming accuracy throughout varying correlation regimes, and demonstrate significant improvements over single-reference methods in force evaluations for N$_2$ and stretched linear H$_4$, particularly in strongly correlated regions where conventional coupled cluster approaches qualitatively fail. Orbital-optimized trial wave functions further boost accuracy for demanding cases such as stretched CO$_2$, without increasing quantum resource requirements. Finally, we apply our methodology to the MEA-CO$_2$ carbon capture reaction, employing quantum information metrics for active space selection and matchgate shadows for efficient overlap evaluations, establishing QC-AFQMC as a robust framework for exploring complex reaction pathways.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chanaprom Cholsuk, Sujin Suwanna, Tobias Vogl</p>
            <p>Quantum emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have gained significant attention due to a wide range of defects that offer high quantum efficiency and single-photon purity at room temperature. Most theoretical studies on hBN defects simulate monolayers, as this is computationally cheaper than calculating bulk structures. However, most experimental studies are carried out on multilayer to bulk hBN, which creates additional possibilities for discrepancies between theory and experiment. In this work, we present an extended database of hBN defects that includes a comprehensive set of bulk hBN defects along with their excited-state photophysical properties. The database features over 120 neutral defects, systematically evaluated across charge states ranging from -2 to 2 (600 defects in total). For each defect, the most stable charge and spin configurations are identified and used to compute the zero-phonon line, photoluminescence spectrum, absorption spectrum, Huang-Rhys (HR) factor, interactive radiative lifetimes, transition dipole moments, and polarization characteristics. Our analysis reveals that the electron-phonon coupling strength is primarily influenced by the presence of vacancies, which tend to induce stronger lattice distortions and broaden phonon sidebands. Additionally, correlation analysis shows that while most properties are independent, the HR factor strongly correlates with the configuration coordinates. All data are publicly available at this https URL, along with a new application programming interface (API) to facilitate integration with machine learning workflows. This database is therefore designed to bridge the gap between theory and experiment, aid in the reliable identification of quantum emitters, and support the development of machine-learning-driven approaches in quantum materials research.</p>

            <p>Silicon single-photon detectors (Si SPDs) play a crucial role in detecting single photons in the visible spectrum. For various applications, photon detection efficiency (PDE) is the most critical characteristic for effectively collecting photons. Here, we present a Si SPD with a remarkable PDE of up to 84.4% at 785 nm, supporting multiple operation modes. We design and fabricate a thick-junction Si single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) that enhances the avalanche probability through a backside-illumination structure, while minimizing noise through the design of a doping-compensated avalanche region. To maximize PDE, we implement a readout circuit with a 50 V quenching voltage, enabling operation in free-running, gating, or hybrid modes. The SPAD, along with its readout circuits and affiliated circuits, is integrated into a compact SPD module. In free-running mode, the module achieves a maximum PDE of 84.4%, with a dark count rate of 260 cps, and an afterpulse probability of 2.9% at 268 K. This work provides a practical solution for applications requiring ultra-high-efficiency Si SPD with multiple operation modes.</p>

            <p>Exploring potential empirical manifestations of quantum gravity is a challenging pursuit. In this study, we utilise a lattice representation of a (2+1)D massive gravity toy model interacting with Dirac fermions that can support specific spacetime fluctuations. We focus on the evolution of the fermion's spin due to its coupling to spacetime fluctuations. To monitor their dynamics a minimal model is required that comprises two bosonic modes describing spacetime geometry fluctuations coupled with the spin of the fermion. A possible emulation of this system involves encoding spin degrees of freedom in an atom coupled with a bimodal optical cavity that provides the two bosonic modes. We observe diverse spin evolution patterns based on its interaction with fluctuating spacetime geometry. Our proposal introduces a novel approach for modelling the effect of interactions between quantum gravity and matter that can be probed with current technology.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Machine Learning for Predicting Binding Free Energies in Structure-Based Virtual Screening</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pei-Kun Yang</p>
            <p>In structure-based virtual screening, it is often necessary to evaluate the binding free energy of protein-ligand complexes by considering not only molecular conformations but also how these structures shift and rotate in space. The number of possible combinations grows rapidly and can become overwhelming. While classical computing has limitations in this context, quantum computing offers a promising alternative due to its inherent parallelism. In this study, we introduce a quantum machine learning approach that encodes molecular information into quantum states and processes them using parameterized quantum gates. The model is implemented and trained using PyTorch, and its performance is evaluated under three settings: ideal simulation, limited-shot sampling, and simulations with quantum noise. With six quantum circuit units, the model achieves an RMSD of 2.37 kcal/mol and a Pearson correlation of 0.650. Even when using 100,000 shots, the predictions remain consistent, indicating that the model is compatible with near-term quantum hardware. Although noise slightly reduces accuracy, the ranking of ligand affinities remains largely unchanged. These findings point to a practical and scalable strategy that balances robustness and predictive power, offering a viable path to accelerate virtual screening through moderately deep quantum circuits.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> William Huie, Cianan Conefrey-Shinozaki, Zhubing Jia, Patrick Draper, Jacob P. Covey</p>
            <p>Simulating nuclear matter described by quantum chromodynamics using quantum computers is notoriously inefficient because of the assortment of quark degrees of freedom such as matter/antimatter, flavor, color, and spin. Here, we propose to address this resource efficiency challenge by encoding three qubits within individual ytterbium-171 atoms of a neutral atom quantum processor. The three qubits are encoded in three distinct sectors: an electronic "clock" transition, the spin-1/2 nucleus, and the lowest two motional states in one radial direction of the harmonic trapping potential. We develop a family of composite sideband pulses and demonstrate a universal gate set and readout protocol for this three-qubit system. We then apply it to single-flavor quantum chromodynamics in 1+1D axial gauge for which the three qubits directly represent the occupancy of quarks in the three colors. We show that two atoms are sufficient to simulate both vacuum persistence oscillations and string breaking. We consider resource requirements and connections to error detection/correction. Our work is a step towards resource-efficient digital simulation of nuclear matter and opens new opportunities for versatile qubit encoding in neutral atom quantum processors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jugal Talukdar, Scott E. Smart, Prineha Narang</p>
            <p>Quantum states of motion are critical components in the second quantum revolution. We investigate the generation and control of non-Gaussian motional states in a tripartite hybrid quantum system consisting of a collection of qubits coupled to a mechanical resonator, which in turn interacts with an externally driven photonic cavity. This hybrid architecture provides a versatile platform for quantum control by integrating nonlinear interactions and multiple control parameters. Operating in the strong coupling regime, we study the transient dynamics resulting from a time-dependent external drive that has a boxcar profile. Starting from coherent states in both the mechanical and cavity subsystems, we show that this drive protocol, combined with time-independent interaction and frequency configurations, leads to the emergence of highly non-Gaussian quantum states in the intermediary mechanical degree of freedom. These states are characterized by a pronounced negative volume in the Wigner quasi-probability distribution and enhanced quantum Fisher information, indicative of their quantum utility. We systematically analyze the impact of the qubit phase, interaction strengths, and drive parameters on the degree of non-Gaussianity. Our findings underscore the tunability and richness of this hybrid platform, paving the way for advanced quantum state engineering and applications in quantum sensing, metrology, and information processing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gilberto Cunha, Alexandra RamÃ´a, AndrÃ© Sequeira, Michael de Oliveira, LuÃ­s Barbosa</p>
            <p>Reinforcement learning (RL) provides a principled framework for decision-making in partially observable environments, which can be modeled as Markov decision processes and compactly represented through dynamic decision Bayesian networks. Recent advances demonstrate that inference on sparse Bayesian networks can be accelerated using quantum rejection sampling combined with amplitude amplification, leading to a computational speedup in estimating acceptance probabilities.\\ Building on this result, we introduce Quantum Bayesian Reinforcement Learning (QBRL), a hybrid quantum-classical look-ahead algorithm for model-based RL in partially observable environments. We present a rigorous, oracle-free time complexity analysis under fault-tolerant assumptions for the quantum device. Unlike standard treatments that assume a black-box oracle, we explicitly specify the inference process, allowing our bounds to more accurately reflect the true computational cost. We show that, for environments whose dynamics form a sparse Bayesian network, horizon-based near-optimal planning can be achieved sub-quadratically faster through quantum-enhanced belief updates. Furthermore, we present numerical experiments benchmarking QBRL against its classical counterpart on simple yet illustrative decision-making tasks. Our results offer a detailed analysis of how the quantum computational advantage translates into decision-making performance, highlighting that the magnitude of the advantage can vary significantly across different deployment settings.</p>

            <p>We explore how recent advances in the manipulation of single-ion wave packets open new avenues for detecting weak magnetic fields sourced by ultralight dark matter. A trapped ion in a ``SchrÃ¶dinger cat'' state can be prepared with its spin and motional degrees of freedom entangled and be used as a matter-wave interferometer that is sensitive to the Aharonov-Bohm-like phase shift accumulated by the ion over its trajectory. The result of the spin-motion entanglement is a parametrically-enhanced sensitivity to weak magnetic fields as compared with an un-entangled ion in a trap. Taking into account the relevant boundary conditions, we demonstrate that a single trapped ion can probe unexplored regions of kinetically-mixed dark-photon dark matter parameter space in the $10^{-15}~\text{eV} \lesssim m_{A'} \lesssim 10^{-14}$~eV mass window. We also show how such a table-top quantum device will also serve as a complementary probe of axion-like particle dark matter in the same mass window.</p>

            <h2>Temporal Entanglement from Holographic Entanglement Entropy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michal P. Heller, Fabio Ori, Alexandre Serantes</p>
            <p>Recently, several notions of entanglement in time have emerged as a novel frontier in quantum many-body physics, quantum field theory and gravity. We propose a systematic prescription to characterize temporal entanglement in relativistic quantum field theory in a general state for an arbitrary subregion on a flat, constant-time slice in a flat spacetime. Our prescriptions starts with the standard entanglement entropy of a spatial subregion and amounts to transporting the unchanged subregion to boosted time slices all the way across the light cone when it becomes in general a complex characterization of the corresponding temporal subregion. For holographic quantum field theories, our prescription amounts to an analytic continuation of all codimension-two bulk extremal surfaces satisfying the homology constraint and picking the one with the smallest real value of the area as the leading saddle point. We implement this prescription for the holographic conformal field theories in thermal states on both a two-dimensional Lorentzian cylinder and three-dimensional Minkowski space, and show that it leads to results with self-consistent physical properties of temporal entanglement.</p>

            <p>Efficient coupling between light and bulk plasmons (BPs) remains a central challenge because of their inherent mode mismatch, limited penetration depth, and pronounced resonant energy mismatch between visible-range photons and BPs. In this work, we demonstrate that ultrafast free electrons can coherently mediate an interaction between electromagnetic fields and BPs at the nanoscale. An electron pulse emitted from the photocathode of ultrafast transmission electron microscope, functions as a quantum intermediary that is capable of simultaneously interacting with the laser field by multiphoton processes and BPs by perturbative scattering. Electron energy-loss spectroscopy can capture this indirect interaction, the final electron energy distribution encodes both quantum pathways arising from distinct combinations of multiphoton absorption and emission and BP scattering events. Interference among these pathways gives rise to characteristic spectral modulations, directly revealing the exchange of energy and information between photons and BPs via the electron delivery. Our results show that femtosecond-driven, ultrafast electrons provide a viable route to modulate and even control bulk plasmon excitations in a volume, thereby extending beyond the conventional nanoplasmonics schemes on manipulating surface plasmons by light. This indirect light-BP interaction paves the promising way for exploring fundamental light-matter interaction at ultrafast and nanometer scales.</p>

            <p>Due to the merits of high efficiency and strong security against timing and side-channel attacks, ChaCha has been widely applied in real-time communication and data streaming scenarios. However, with the rapid development of AI-assisted cryptanalysis and quantum computing technologies, there are serious challenges to the secure implementation of ChaCha cipher. To further strengthen the security of ChaCha cipher, we propose an improved variant based on quantum random numbers, i.e., Quantum Random Number Enhanced ChaCha (QRE-ChaCha). Specifically, the design XORs the initial constants with quantum random numbers and periodically injects quantum random numbers into selected state words during odd rounds to enhance diffusion. Compared with the original ChaCha, the present variant shows stronger resistance to differential attacks and generates a keystream with statistical randomness, thereby offering increased robustness against both classical and quantum attacks. To evaluate the security and performance of the present ChaCha, our analysis proceeds in three main parts. Firstly, we analyze its theoretical security in terms of quantum randomness and attack testing, and conduct differential cryptanalysis with an automated search method based on the Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT). Secondly, we subject the keystream generated by the cipher to randomness tests using the NIST statistical test suite and the GM/T 0005-2021 randomness testing standard. Finally, we assess its encryption and decryption performance by measuring its encryption speed on files of various sizes. According to the results, the present ChaCha is significantly improved to resist differential attacks while maintaining the high efficiency of the original ChaCha cipher, and its keystream successfully passes statistical randomness tests using the NIST and GM/T 0005-2021 standards, meeting cryptographic application requirements.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryota Kojima, Masahiko Kamoshita, Keita Kanno</p>
            <p>Quantum chemistry is a key target for quantum computing, but benchmarking quantum algorithms for large molecular systems remains challenging due to the lack of exactly solvable yet structurally realistic models. In particular, molecular Hamiltonians typically contain $O(N^4)$ Pauli terms, significantly increasing the cost of quantum simulations, while many exactly solvable models, such as the one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard (1D FH) model, contain only $O(N)$ terms. In this work, we introduce the orbital-rotated Fermi-Hubbard (ORFH) model as a scalable and exactly solvable benchmarking problem for quantum chemistry algorithms. Starting from the 1D FH model, we apply a spin-involved orbital rotation to construct a Hamiltonian that retains the exact ground-state energy but exhibits a Pauli term count scaling as $O(N^4)$, similar to real molecular systems. We analyze the ORFH Hamiltonian from multiple perspectives, including operator norm and electronic correlation. We benchmark variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) optimizers and Pauli term grouping methods, and compare their performance with those for hydrogen chains. Furthermore, we show that the ORFH Hamiltonian increases the computational difficulty for classical methods such as the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), offering a nontrivial benchmark beyond quantum algorithms. Our results demonstrate that the ORFH model provides a versatile and scalable testbed for benchmarking quantum chemistry algorithms under realistic structural conditions, while maintaining exact solvability even at large system sizes.</p>

            <p>A non-local quantum computation (NLQC) replaces an interaction between two quantum systems with a single simultaneous round of communication and shared entanglement. We study two classes of NLQC, $f$-routing and $f$-BB84, which are of relevance to classical information theoretic cryptography and quantum position-verification. We give the first non-trivial lower bounds on entanglement in both settings, but are restricted to lower bounding protocols with perfect correctness. Within this setting, we give a lower bound on the Schmidt rank of any entangled state that completes these tasks for a given function $f(x,y)$ in terms of the rank of a matrix $g(x,y)$ whose entries are zero when $f(x,y)=0$, and strictly positive otherwise. This also leads to a lower bound on the Schmidt rank in terms of the non-deterministic quantum communication complexity of $f(x,y)$. Because of a relationship between $f$-routing and the conditional disclosure of secrets (CDS) primitive studied in information theoretic cryptography, we obtain a new technique for lower bounding the randomness complexity of CDS.</p>

The efficiency of the algorithm is evaluated by comparison with a quantum algorithm based on binary clauses. Furthermore, we analyse the impact of traspilation and introduce an appropriate metric to assess the complexity of the algorithm, the \emph{quantum circuit area}. We explicitly analyse three-, four- and five-eloop topologies, which have not previously been explored due to their higher complexity and the current limitations of quantum simulators.</p>
