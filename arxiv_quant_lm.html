            <h2>A no-go result for QBism</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shan Gao</p>
            <p>In QBism the wave function does not represent an element of physical reality external to the agent, but represent an agent's personal probability assignments, reflecting his subjective degrees of belief about the future content of his experience. In this paper, I argue that this view of the wave function is not consistent with protective measurements. The argument does not rely on the realist assumption of the psi-ontology theorems, namely the existence of the underlying ontic state of a quantum system.</p>

            <h2>MEMSDuino: An Arduino-Based MEMS Switch Controller</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lafe Spietz, Adam Sirois, Nathan Flowers-Jacobs, Steve Waltman, Samuel Benz, Peter Hopkins</p>
            <p>Radio frequency cryogenic switches are a critical enabling technology for quantum information science for both calibration and high throughput testing of samples. Traditionally, solenoid-based switches have been used [1,2], but a transition is being made to MEMS-based (Micro Electro Mechanical Systems) switches due to their lower power dissipation and smaller size, and to minimize the risk that solenoid switches tend to produce current pulses that destroy expensive cryogenic amplifiers and can cause electrostatic damage to devices. These MEMS switches require a 90-volt signal to be applied to the control lines to determine the state of the switches. Switches exist that have built-in CMOS-based (Complimentary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) control electronics to drive the 90 V, but these do not work at the cryogenic temperatures used in quantum information science. There is no currently available room temperature control system with direct control of the switches. The instrument presented here is a 19-inch rack-mount controller for a cryogenic MEMS switch network that allows a human operator to see the state of the switch via a row of clearly marked indicator lights and to change the state manually via buttons on an LED-based indicator board or automatically via Python-based serial port commands to the Arduino, an open source microcontroller platform available from multiple vendors. The design can also be modified to control other switches that require either a large voltage or current to switch.</p>

            <h2>Lindblad estimation with fast and precise quantum control</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> James W. Gardner, Simon A. Haine, Joseph J. Hope, Yanbei Chen, Tuvia Gefen</p>
            <p>Enhancing precision sensors for stochastic signals using quantum techniques is a promising emerging field of physics. Estimating a weak stochastic waveform is the core task of many fundamental physics experiments including searches for stochastic gravitational waves, quantum gravity, and axionic dark matter. Simultaneously, noise spectroscopy and characterisation, e.g. estimation of various decay mechanisms in quantum devices, is relevant to a broad range of fundamental and technological applications. We consider the ultimate limit on the sensitivity of these devices for Lindblad estimation given any quantum state, fast and precise control sequence, and measurement scheme. We show that it is optimal to rapidly projectively measure and re-initialise the quantum state. We develop optimal protocols for a wide range of applications including stochastic waveform estimation, spectroscopy with qubits, and Lindblad estimation.</p>

            <h2>Demonstration of Quantum Polarization Microscopy using an Entangled-Photon Source</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mousume Samad, Maki Shimizu, Yasuto Hijikata</p>
            <p>With the advancement of non-classical light sources such as single-photon and entangled-photon sources, innovative microscopy based on the quantum principles has been proposed over traditional microscopy. This paper introduces the experimental demonstration of a quantum polarization microscopic technique that incorporates a quantum-entangled photon source. Although the point that employs the variation of polarization angle due to reflection or transmission at the sample is similar to classical polarization microscopy, the method for constructing image contrast is significantly different. Image contrast is constructed by the coincidence count of signal and idler photons. In the case that coincidence count is recorded from both the signal and idler photons, the photon statistics resemble a thermal state, similar to the blackbody radiation, but with a significantly higher peak intensity in the second order autocorrelation function at zero delay that is derived from coincidence count. While, when the coincidence count is taken from either the signal or idler photon only, though the photon state exhibits a thermal state again, the photon statistics become more dispersive and result in a lower peak intensity of the autocorrelation function. These different thermal states can be switched by slightly changing the photon polarization, which is suddenly aroused within narrow range of analyzer angle. This polarization microscopic technique can provide a superior imaging technique compared to the classical method, opening a new frontier for research in material sciences, biology, and other fields requiring high-resolution imaging.</p>

            <h2>Zeno Freezing and Anti-Zeno Acceleration of the Dynamic Evolution of Acoustic Topological Boundary States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiao-Meng Zhang, Ze-Guo Chen, Guancong Ma, Ming-Hui Lu, Yan-Feng Chen</p>
            <p>Quantum measurements severely disrupt the dynamic evolution of a quantum system by collapsing the probabilistic wavefunction. This principle can be leveraged to control quantum states by effectively freezing the system's dynamics or enhancing transitions between states. These are known as the quantum Zeno effect (ZE) and anti-Zeno effect (AZE), respectively. However, it remains elusive how quantum measurements affect topological states, which are famous for their robustness against disorder and perturbations. Here, we theoretically and experimentally show that the dynamic evolution of topological boundary states (TBSs) can be controlled by quantum-like measurement (QLM). Our work is based on spatially modulated topological acoustic waveguide systems with varying parameters that adiabatically pump the TBS across the bulk to the opposite boundary. Therein, the QLM is emulated using a perturbation to the Hamiltonian known as the Zeno subspace. With the help of quantum metrics, we identify the general conditions for ZE and AZE, and experimentally demonstrate their effects in freezing and accelerating the tunneling of the TBS. Furthermore, we discover a tunneling mechanism by varying the strength of the QLM. These results highlight QLM as a versatile tool for manipulating topological states and wave propagation.</p>

            <h2>Highly sensitive temperature sensing via quadratic optomechanical coupling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Sheng Tang, Xun-Wei Xu, Jie-Qiao Liao, Hui Jing, Le-Man Kuang</p>
            <p>The effective frequency of a mechanical resonator can be tuned via the spring effect induced by quadratic optomechanical (QOM) coupling, and both spontaneous symmetry breaking and anti-parity-time phase transition were predicted in the QOM systems. Here, we show that the mechanical susceptibility can be enhanced significantly by driving the QOM system with a strong external optical field, and divergence will happen as the driving strength approaches the critical point (CP) for spontaneous symmetry breaking. Based on the CP, we propose a highly sensitive temperature sensor with a mechanical resonator quadratically coupled to an optical mode. We find that the sensitivity of the temperature sensor can be enhanced by several orders of magnitude as the driving strength approaches the CP, and the sensitivity of the temperature sensor remains high in the low-temperature limit. Our work provides an effective way to realize highly sensitive temperature sensing at ultra-low temperature in the QOM systems.</p>

            <p>Quantum imaging is an ever expanding research field, in which the aim is to exploit the quantum nature of light to enhance image reconstruction capabilities. Despite a number of successful demonstrations for quantum imaging, quantum microscopy still seems out of the range for practical applications, due to different physical and technical reasons. Here we propose an imaging method exploiting the quantum correlations of photon pairs and a scanning microscope to achieve fast, single mode quantum imaging. We first test our technique on a metal grating to estimate the resolution capabilities of our system. Moreover, we asses its potential in terms of the number of available independent pixels at full resolution compared to different quantum imaging approaches. Finally, we demonstrate scanning quantum microscopy of onion epithelial cells, paving the way towards scalable quantum microscopy for bio-physical applications. Our results, combined with the rapidly evolving photon-pair generation and detection technology towards the mid-infrared, could lead to an extension of quantum microscopy applications towards the mid-infrared, to access the molecular fingerprint region.</p>

            <h2>Single-molecule Scale Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy using Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers in Diamond</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiangfeng Du, Fazhan Shi, Xi Kong, Fedor Jekezko, J√∂rg Wrachtrup</p>
            <p>Single-molecule technology stands as a powerful tool, enabling the characterization of intricate structural and dynamic information that would otherwise remain concealed within the averaged behaviors of numerous molecules. This technology finds extensive application across diverse fields including physics, chemistry, biology, and medicine. Quantum sensing, particularly leveraging nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers within diamond structures, presents a promising avenue for single-molecule magnetic resonance, offering prospects for sensing and imaging technology at the single-molecule level. Notably, while significant strides have been made in single-molecule scale magnetic resonance using NV centers over the past two decades, current approaches still exhibit limitations in magnetic sensitivity, spectral resolution, and spatial resolution. Particularly, the full reconstruction of three-dimensional positions of nuclear spins within single molecules remains an unattained goal. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art in single-molecule scale magnetic resonance, encompassing an analysis of various relevant techniques involving NV centers. Additionally, it explores the optimization of technical parameters associated with these methods. This detailed analysis serves as a foundation for the development of new technologies and the exploration of potential applications.</p>

            <h2>Modes, states and superselection rules in quantum optics and quantum information</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eloi Descamps, Astghik Saharyan, Adrien Chivet, Arne Keller, P√©rola Milman</p>
            <p>A convenient way to represent quantum optical states is through the quadrature basis of single-modes of the field. This framework provides intuitive definitions for quasi-classical states, their phase-space representations, and a robust toolbox for quantum state manipulation using universal gates. In this widely adopted representation of quantum optics, most pure states consist of coherent superpositions of photon-number states. However, this approach neglects the particle-number superselection rule - which prohibits coherence between states of differing photon numbers - and implicitly assumes a common phase reference - even though global phases are unmeasurable in quantum optics. We adopt a representation of quantum optical states that respects the superselection rule and revisit key tools and results in quantum optics and information encoding within quantum optics. In the introduced framework, general pure states are described using two orthogonal modes in the Fock basis. We show that this approach preserves the intuitive aspects of the traditional quadrature representation while unifying insights from quantum optics with those from symmetric spin-like and angular momentum systems. Moreover, the superselection rule-compliant representation provides a consistent definition of non-purity and coherence for optical modes and states. It offers a clearer and general perspective on quantum universality, non-classicality, and the (im)possibility of efficient classical simulation across various quantum information encoding schemes involving quantum optical modes and states.</p>

            <h2>Squeezed states of light after high-harmonic generation in excited atomic systems</h2>

            <p>High-harmonic generation (HHG) has recently emerged as a promising method for generating non-classical states of light with frequencies spanning from the infrared up to the extreme ultraviolet regime. In this work, we theoretically investigate the generation of squeezed states of light through HHG processes in atomic systems that had been initially driven to their first excited state. Our study reveals significant single-mode squeezing in both the driving field and low-order harmonic modes. Additionally, we characterize two-mode squeezing features in the generated states, both between fundamental and harmonic modes, and among the harmonic modes themselves. Using these correlations, we demonstrate the generation of optical Schr√∂dinger kitten states through heralding measurements, specifically via photon subtraction in one of the modes influenced by two-mode squeezing.</p>

            <h2>Quantum and classical correlations in four-wave mixing from cold ensembles of two-level atoms</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lucas S. Marinho, Michelle O. Ara√∫jo, Daniel Felinto</p>
            <p>Quantum correlations in four-wave-mixing from ensembles of cold two-level atoms may prevail without filtering over background light with well-known classical interpretations, such as Rayleigh scattering, as recently experimentally demonstrated in Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 128}, 083601 (2022). Here we provide an extended investigation of this effect, in which we detail the experimental procedure and the variation of the quantum correlation with various parameters of the system. Particularly, we show that the decay rate of the quantum correlations changes with the number of atoms in the sample, providing another indication of its superradiance-like nature. The nonclassical aspects of the signal occur for short timescales, but the long timescales carry as well a lot of information on the classical correlations of the system. This slow classical regime presents also two clearly distinct timescales, which we explain by two different pathways for the creation of biphotons. From the global analysis of the data in all its timescales, we are able to derive an empirical expression to fit the data, resulting in information on, among other parameters, the sample's temperature and superradiant-like acceleration. In general, the reported quantum correlations present a dependence on critical parameters of the system, such as optical depth and excitation power, that is quite different from other systems used for biphoton generation, and are more robust to changes in these parameters. This opens the possibility of exploring this process for efficient generation of narrow-band biphotons or of other quantum-correlated photonic states of higher order.</p>

            <h2>Non-classicality induces recombination in high-harmonic generation with circularly polarized fields</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. Rivera-Dean, P. Stammer, M. F. Ciappina, M. Lewenstein</p>
            <p>High-harmonic generation (HHG) is a nonlinear process in which a strong driving field interacts with a material, resulting in the frequency up-conversion of the driver into its high-order harmonics. This process is highly sensitive to the field's polarization: circular polarization, for instance, inhibits HHG. In this work, we demonstrate that the use of non-classical structured light enables HHG in this otherwise prohibitive configuration for classical drivers. In particular, we consider circularly polarized light with non-classical fluctuations, introduced via squeezing along one polarization direction, and show that these non-classical features prompt the HHG process, with the spectral properties of the emitted harmonics depending on the type of squeezing applied. We examine the electron dynamics during HHG, revealing that non-classical fluctuations act as an effective force that guides the electron trajectories toward recombination. This approach opens new pathways for integrating quantum optics in HHG, providing novel means of controlling the light-matter interaction dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Reducing PEC Overhead by Pauli Error Propagation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Timon Scheiber, Paul Haubenwallner, Matthias Heller</p>
            <p>Quantum error mitigation is regarded as a possible path to near-term quantum utility. The methods under the quantum error mitigation umbrella term, such as probabilistic error cancellation, zero-noise extrapolation or Clifford data regression are able to significantly reduce the error for the estimation of expectation values, although at an exponentially scaling cost, i.e., in the sampling overhead. In this work, we present a straightforward method for reducing the sampling overhead of PEC on Clifford circuits (and Clifford subcircuits) via Pauli error propagation alongside some classical preprocessing. While the methods presented in this work are restricted to Clifford circuits, we argue that Clifford sub circuits often occur in relevant calculations as for example the resource state generation in measurement based quantum computing.</p>

            <h2>End-to-end switchless architecture for fault-tolerant photonic quantum computing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paul Renault, Patrick Yard, Raphael C. Pooser, Miller Eaton, Hussain Asim Zaidi</p>
            <p>Photonics represents one of the most promising approaches to large-scale quantum computation with millions of qubits and billions of gates, owing to the potential for room-temperature operation, high clock speeds, miniaturization of photonic circuits, and repeatable fabrication processes in commercial photonic foundries. We present an end-to-end architecture for fault-tolerant continuous variable (CV) quantum computation using only passive on-chip components that can produce photonic qubits above the fault tolerance threshold with probabilities above 90%, and encodes logical qubits using physical qubits sampled from a distribution around the fault tolerance threshold. By requiring only low photon number resolution, the architecture enables the use of high-bandwidth photodetectors in CV quantum computing. Simulations of our qubit generation and logical encoding processes show a Gaussian cluster squeezing threshold of 12 dB to 13 dB. Additionally, we present a novel magic state generation protocol which requires only 13 dB of cluster squeezing to produce magic states with an order of magnitude higher probability than existing approaches, opening up the path to universal fault-tolerant quantum computation at less than 13 dB of cluster squeezing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kai-Xuan Zhang, Giung Park, Youjin Lee, Beom Hyun Kim, Je-Geun Park</p>
            <p>The magnetoelectric (ME) effect is a fundamental concept in modern condensed matter physics and represents the electrical control of magnetic polarisations or vice versa. Two-dimensional (2D) van-der-Waals (vdW) magnets have emerged as a new class of materials and exhibit novel ME effects with diverse manifestations. This review emphasizes some important recent discoveries unique to vdW magnets: multiferroicity on two dimensions, spin-charge correlation, atomic ME effect and current-induced intrinsic spin-orbit torque, and electrical gating control and magnetic control of their electronic properties. We also highlight the promising route of utilizing quantum magnetic hetero- or homo-structures to engineer the ME effect and corresponding spintronic and optoelectronic device applications. Due to the intrinsic two-dimensionality, vdW magnets with those ME effects are expected to form a new, exciting research direction.</p>

            <h2>Equalities and inequalities from entanglement, loss, and beam splitters</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anaelle Hertz, Noah Lupu-Gladstein, Khabat Heshami, Aaron Z. Goldberg</p>
            <p>Quantum optics bridges esoteric notions of entanglement and superposition with practical applications like metrology and communication. Throughout, there is an interplay between information theoretic concepts such as entropy and physical considerations such as quantum system design, noise, and loss. Therefore, a fundamental result at the heart of these fields has numerous ramifications in development of applications and advancing our understanding of quantum physics. Our recent proof for the entanglement properties of states interfering with the vacuum on a beam splitter led to monotonicity and convexity properties for quantum states undergoing photon loss [Lupu-Gladstein et al., arXiv:2411.03423 (2024)] by breathing life into a decades-old conjecture. In this work, we extend these fundamental properties to measures of similarity between states, provide inequalities for creation and annihilation operators beyond the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, prove a conjecture [Hertz et al., PRA 110, 012408 (2024)] dictating that nonclassicality through the quadrature coherence scale is uncertifiable beyond a loss of 50%, and place constraints on quasiprobability distributions of all physical states. These ideas can now circulate afresh throughout quantum optics.</p>

            <p>Defect-free single atom array in optical tweezers is a promising platform for scalable quantum computing, quantum simulation, and quantum metrology. Extending single-species array to mixed-species one promise to offer new possibilities. In our recent proof of principle realization of defect-free two-dimensional assembly of mixed-species $^{85}$Rb ($^{87}$Rb) atom arrays [C. Sheng et al.\href{this https URL}{{\color{blue} Phys. Rev. Lett. 128, 083202(2022)}}], the filling fractions were limited by the imperfect transfer of atoms and the occurrence of logjams during the atom rearrangement. In order to scale up the size of defect-free mixed-species atom array, we scale up the tweezer array and improve the atom transfer, and upgrade the heuristic heteronuclear algorithm so as to facilitate multiple rearrangement cycles. Consequently, we successfully create defect-free atom arrays with 120 mixed-species single atoms. The corresponding filling fraction and defect-free probability are improved to be 98.6(1)\% and 14(2)\%, respectively. It is anticipated that the enhanced algorithm can be extended to other combinations of atomic species, and this mixed-species atom array is readily for studies of many-body physics, quantum error correction, and quantum metrology.</p>

            <h2>Photon Blockade in Cavity Magnomechanical Systems using Phase-Controlled Feedback</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mounes Eslami, Kurosh Javidan</p>
            <p>In this paper, we optimize photon blockade in a cavity magnomechanical system using feedback by introducing optimized values for the phase and magnetic field coupling strength at each drive frequency. It is shown that the computed values significantly reduce the photon second-order correlation function in the dynamic Schrodinger equation. The Radau method, an implicit Runge-Kutta method, has been employed, which provides more accurate results. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a frequency detuning between the magnon and photon can result in deep values of photon blockade. Utilizing these optimized parameters outperforms scenarios that rely on constant, non-optimized values. This approach provides strong potential for applications in quantum sensing and quantum computation.</p>

            <p>We investigate the superradiance of two-level target atoms (TAs) coupled to a photonic waveguide, demonstrating that the scaling of the superradiance strength can be controlled on demand by an ensemble of control atoms (CAs). The scaling with respect to the number of TAs can be lower, higher, or equal to the traditional Dicke superradiance, depending on the relative positioning of the ensembles and the type of CAs (e.g., small or giant). These phenomena are attributed to unconventional atomic correlations. Furthermore, we observe chiral superradiance of the TAs, where the degree of chirality can be enhanced by giant CAs instead of small ones. The effects discussed in this work could be observed in waveguide QED experiments, offering a potential avenue for manipulating superradiance.</p>

            <p>In this work, we present an approach for transferring quantum states from superconducting qubits to the internal states of trapped atoms or ions. To achieve state transfer, we utilize the Rydberg levels of those trapped atomic particles, which interact indirectly with the superconducting qubits via their mutual coupling to a microwave cavity. We investigate two protocols for this transfer: resonant interaction between the cavity, the atom/ion and the superconducting qubit, and dispersive interaction. We analyze the robustness of the state transfer fidelity against various noise and damping mechanisms, including cavity decay, Rydberg state decay, and the relaxation and dephasing of the superconducting qubit. For experimentally demonstrated parameters of interaction strengths, dissipation, and dephasing, our scheme achieves fidelities above 95\%.</p>

            <h2>Cavity quantum electrodynamics of photonic temporal crystals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junhyeon Bae, Kyungmin Lee, Bumki Min, Kun Woo Kim</p>
            <p>Photonic temporal crystals host a variety of intriguing phenomena, from wave amplification and mixing to exotic band structures, all stemming from the time-periodic modulation of optical properties. While these features have been well described classically, their quantum manifestation has remained elusive. Here, we introduce a quantum electrodynamical model of PTCs that reveals a deeper connection between classical and quantum pictures: the classical momentum gap arises from a localization-delocalization quantum phase transition in a Floquet-photonic synthetic lattice. Leveraging an effective Hamiltonian perspective, we pinpoint the critical momenta and highlight how classical exponential field growth manifests itself as wave-packet acceleration in the quantum synthetic space. Remarkably, when a two-level atom is embedded in such a cavity, its Rabi oscillations undergo irreversible decay to a half-and-half mixed state-a previously unobserved phenomenon driven by photonic delocalization within the momentum gap, even with just a single frequency mode. Our findings establish photonic temporal crystals as versatile platforms for studying nonequilibrium quantum photonics and suggest new avenues for controlling light matter interactions through time domain engineering.</p>

            <p>Quantum communications technologies require a network of quantum processors connected with low loss and low noise communication channels capable of distributing entangled states. Superconducting microwave qubits operating in cryogenic environments have emerged as promising candidates for quantum processor nodes. However, scaling these systems is challenging because they require bulky microwave components with high thermal loads that can quickly overwhelm the cooling power of a dilution refrigerator. Telecommunication frequency optical signals, meanwhile, can be fabricated in significantly smaller form factors while avoiding challenges due to high signal loss, noise sensitivity, and thermal loads due to their high carrier frequency and propagation in silica optical fibers. Transduction of information via coherent links between optical and microwave frequencies is therefore critical to leverage the advantages of optics for superconducting microwave qubits, while also enabling superconducting processors to be linked with low-loss optical interconnects. Here, we demonstrate coherent optical control of a superconducting qubit. We achieve this by developing a microwave-optical quantum transducer that operates with up to 1.18% conversion efficiency with low added microwave noise, and demonstrate optically-driven Rabi oscillations in a superconducting qubit.</p>

            <h2>Photon pair generation via down-conversion in III-V semiconductor microrings: modal dispersion and quasi-phase matching</h2>

            <p>We explore how III-V semiconductor microring resonators can efficiently generate photon pairs and squeezed vacuum states via spontaneous parametric down-conversion by utilizing their built-in quasi phase matching and modal dispersion. We present an analytic expression for the biphoton wave function of photon pairs generated by weak pump pulses, and characterize the squeezed states that result under stronger pumping conditions. Our model includes loss, and captures the statistics of the scattered photons. A detailed sample calculation shows that for low pump powers conversion efficiencies of 10$^{-5}$, corresponding to a rate of 39 MHz for a pump power of 1 $\mu$W, are attainable for rudimentary structures such as a simple microring coupled to a waveguide, in both the continuous wave and pulsed excitation regimes. Our results suggest that high levels of squeezing and pump depletion are attainable, possibly leading to the deterministic generation of non-Gaussian states</p>

            <p>We study the implementation of quantum engines and quantum heat pumps where the quantum adiabatic transformations are replaced by quantum Zeno strokes. During these strokes, frequent measurements are selectively performed on the external state of the system avoiding transition between different levels. This effectively delivers almost ideal isentropic transformations. We concentrate on the characterization of the performance of a quantum Zeno heat pump implemented with a quantum harmonic oscillator, showing that optimal performance can be achieved faster than with shortcut-to-adiabaticity techniques.</p>

            <h2>Noise-Mitigated Variational Quantum Eigensolver with Pre-training and Zero-Noise Extrapolation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wanqi Sun, Jungang Xu, Chenghua Duan</p>
            <p>The variational quantum eigensolver, as a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm, is widely applied in quantum chemistry simulations, especially in computing the electronic structure of complex molecular systems. However, on existing noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, factors such as quantum decoherence, measurement errors, and gate operation imprecisions are unavoidable. To overcome these challenges, this study proposes an efficient noise-mitigating variational quantum eigensolver for accurate computation of molecular ground state energies in noisy environments. We design the quantum circuit with reference to the structure of matrix product states and utilize it to pre-train the circuit parameters, which ensures circuit stability and mitigates fluctuations caused by initialization. We also employ zero-noise extrapolation to mitigate quantum noise and combine it with neural networks to improve the accuracy of the noise-fitting function, which significantly eliminates noise interference. Furthermore, we implement intelligent grouping measurements of Hamiltonian Pauli strings, which not only reduces measurement errors but also improves sampling efficiency. We conduct experiments to solve the ground state energy of the $H_4$ molecule on the Mindquantum quantum computing platform, and the results demonstrate that our algorithm can constrain noise errors within the range of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-2}) \sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-1})$, outperforming mainstream variational quantum eigensolver methods. This work provides a new strategy for high-precision quantum chemistry calculations on near-term noisy quantum hardware.</p>

            <h2>Quantum state transfer of superposed multi-photon states via phonon-induced dynamic resonance in an optomechanical system</h2>

            <p>We propose a method to transfer macroscopically superposed states between two optical cavities mediated by a mechanical oscillator, which works in a nonlinear regime of optomechanical interaction. Our approach relies on the phonon-induced dynamic resonance, where the motion of mechanical oscillator dynamically sets on/off the resonance between two cavities. Our method assumes high amplitude limit of oscillator, weak coupling between optical cavities, and adiabatic approximation. We show that, under these conditions, various multi-photon quantum states, especially, Schr{√∂}dinger cat states, can be transferred with nearly perfect fidelity in a deterministic process. We show that transfer fidelity of 0.99 can be achieved using the experimental parameters in currently available technology.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement transfer between giant atoms in waveguide-QED systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jie Liu, Zhi-Qiang Liu, Yu Sang, Lei Tan</p>
            <p>We investigate the entanglement transfer between giant atoms in waveguide-QED systems. The system consists of two pairs of two-level giant atoms, $ab$ and $cd$, each independently coupled to its respective one-dimensional waveguide. Initially, entangled states are stored in atom pair $ac$. There we consider three giant atom coupling configurations: separated, braided, and nested. For comparison, the entanglement transfer for small atoms configuration is also studied here. We focus on the entanglement transfer from atom pair $ac$ to atoms pair $bd$ and atom pair $ab$ in these four coupling configurations. It is shown that the transfer of entanglement in each coupling configuration strongly depends on phase shift. In particular, the braided configuration demonstrates superior performance in entanglement transfer. For the entanglement transfer from atom pair $ac$ to atom pair $bd$, complete entanglement transfer is presented in braided configuration, a behavior not found in small atom or other giant atom configurations. For the entanglement transfer from atom pair $ac$ to atom pair $ab$, although the maximum entanglement transferred to atom pair $ab$ in the braided configuration is half of that one to atom pair $bd$, it is still higher than that in the small atom, separated, and nested configurations. This study lays the foundation for entanglement transfer between giant atoms in waveguide-QED platforms.</p>

Here we report on such a source based on a single atom with three energy levels in ladder configuration and coupled to two optical fiber cavities. We efficiently generate photon pairs with in-fiber emission efficiency of $\eta_{\mathrm{pair}}=16(1)\%$ and study their temporal correlation properties. We simulate theoretically a regime with strong atom-cavity coupling and find that photons are directly emitted from the ground state, i.e. without atomic population in any intermediate state.

We also developed a microscopic framework of opto-mechanical electron-phonon coupling in molecular nanojunctions based on the Marcus electron hopping. Systematically varying electrical conductance of the molecules in the junction and laser intensity, we observed the transition between a photo-assisted tunnelling regime and an electron hopping process. Our findings provide a microscopic description for vibrational, optical, and electronic phenomena in plasmonic nanocavities, representing the first attempt to exploit conductive molecules as practically implementable quantum-mechanical oscillators.</p>

            <h2>Exciton Dynamics and Quantum Efficiencies in Optically Coupled OLEDs: A Unified Quantum Master Equation Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Olli Siltanen, Kimmo Luoma, Konstantinos S. Daskalakis</p>
            <p>The primary function of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) is to convert electrons into photons. However, only 25 % of the electronic states (singlets) in electrically excited fluorescent molecules can emit light, which is why triplet harvesting has attracted significant attention. Specifically, one often aims to maximize the rate of triplet-to-singlet conversion, while at the same time, it is crucial to depopulate the singlets fast enough -- before they convert to triplets or interact with other excited states, potentially breaking molecular bonds. Planar microcavities provide a viable architecture to address these issues. By confining the emitters within planar microcavities one can couple the excitons to cavity modes and engineer the population dynamics to one's liking. While the weak-coupling regime is renowned for Purcell-enhanced emission, strongly coupled excitons and photons hybridize to form entirely new energy eigenstates known as polaritons. To fully understand and optimize exciton-photon interactions and light-emission mechanisms across various coupling regimes, a unified theory of optically coupled (and uncoupled) OLEDs is needed. In this article, we introduce a quantum master equation model spanning the zero-, weak-, and strong-coupling regimes. We derive the different rates using Fermi's golden rule and Marcus theory, show how the different regimes converge, and finally evaluate the internal quantum efficiencies in all cases.</p>

            <h2>Efficient Generation of Multi-partite Entanglement between Non-local Superconducting Qubits using Classical Feedback</h2>

            <p>Quantum entanglement is one of the primary features which distinguishes quantum computers from classical computers. In gate-based quantum computing, the creation of entangled states or the distribution of entanglement across a quantum processor often requires circuit depths which grow with the number of entangled qubits. However, in teleportation-based quantum computing, one can deterministically generate entangled states with a circuit depth that is constant in the number of qubits, provided that one has access to an entangled resource state, the ability to perform mid-circuit measurements, and can rapidly transmit classical information. In this work, aided by fast classical FPGA-based control hardware with a feedback latency of only 150 ns, we explore the utility of teleportation-based protocols for generating non-local, multi-partite entanglement between superconducting qubits. First, we demonstrate well-known protocols for generating Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states and non-local CNOT gates in constant depth. Next, we utilize both protocols for implementing an unbounded fan-out (i.e., controlled-NOT-NOT) gate in constant depth between three non-local qubits. Finally, we demonstrate deterministic state teleportation and entanglement swapping between qubits on opposite side of our quantum processor.</p>

By manipulating both the ground-state and optical qubits, we observe the real-time dynamics of the spin excitation, measuring the transfer rate in several regimes of adiabaticity and relaxation dynamics. Our results provide a testing ground for increasingly rich models of molecular excitation transfer processes that are relevant for molecular electronics and light-harvesting systems.</p>

            <p>Entangled two-photon absorption can enable a linear scaling of fluorescence emission with the excitation power. In comparison to classical two-photon absorption with a quadratic scaling, this can allow fluorescence imaging or photolithography with high axial resolution at minimal exposure intensities. However, most experimental studies on two-photon absorption were not able to show an unambiguous proof of fluorescence emission driven by entangled photon pairs. On the other hand, existing theoretical models struggle to accurately predict the entangled two-photon absorption behavior of chemically complex dyes. In this paper, we introduce an approach to simulate entangled two-photon absorption in common fluorescence dyes considering their chemical properties. Our theoretical model allows a deeper understanding of experimental results and thus the occurrence of entangled two-photon absorption. In particular, we found a remarkable dependency of the absorption probability on the phase-matching temperature of the nonlinear material. Further, we compared results of our theoretical approach to experimental data for Nile Red.</p>

            <p>Fock states of the quantum harmonic oscillator are fundamental to quantum sensing and information processing, serving as key resources for exploiting bosonic degrees of freedom. Here, we prepare high Fock states in a high-overtone bulk acoustic wave resonator (HBAR) by coupling it to a superconducting qubit and applying microwave pulses designed using quantum optimal control. We characterize the experimentally realized states by employing a criterion for genuine quantum non-Gaussianity (QNG) designed to reveal multiphonon contributions. Although energy relaxation and decoherence limit the achievable fidelities, we demonstrate genuine QNG features compatible with Fock state $\vert 6\rangle$, confirming that the prepared states cannot be generated through Gaussian operations on states with up to Fock state $\vert 5\rangle$ contributions. We further investigate the robustness of these QNG features to losses and their utility in sensing displacement amplitudes. In particular, we introduce a hierarchy based on the quantum Fisher information and show that, despite decoherence and measurement imperfections, the prepared states achieve a displacement sensitivity surpassing that of an ideal Fock state $\vert 3\rangle$. Our results have immediate applications in quantum sensing and simulations with HBAR devices.</p>

            <h2>Optical Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill qubit generation via approximate squeezed coherent state superposition breeding</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrew J. Pizzimenti, Daniel Soh</p>
            <p>Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) qubits, known for their exceptional error-correction capabilities, are highly coveted in quantum computing. However, generating optical GKP qubits has been a significant challenge. Measurement-based methods, where a portion of entangled squeezed vacuum modes are measured with photon number resolving detectors heralding a desired state in the undetected modes, have emerged as leading candidates for optical GKP qubit generation due their minimal resource requirements. While the current measurement-based methods can produce high-quality GKP qubits, they suffer from low success probabilities limiting experimental realization. The heart of the problem lies in the duality of photon number resolving measurements, being both the source of nonlinearity needed to generate quality GKP qubits and the component driving down their probability of successful production. Our method, breeding approximate squeezed coherent state superpositions created by generalized photon subtraction, overcomes this problem by supplementing two photon number resolving measurements with a single high success probability homodyne measurement. This scheme achieves success probabilities $\geq 10^{-5}$, two orders of magnitude higher than strictly photon number resolving measurement-based methods, while still producing states with high fidelity, possessing error-correction capabilities equivalent to up to a 10 dB squeezed GKP qubit. This breakthrough significantly advances the practical use of the optical GKP qubit encoding.</p>

            <p>We present and experimentally demonstrate a novel approach to verification and benchmarking of quantum computing, implementing it on an ion-trap quantum computer. Unlike previous information-theoretically secure verification protocols, which typically require quantum communication between client and server, our approach is implemented entirely on-chip. This eliminates the need for a quantum client and significantly enhances practicality. We perform tomography to justify the additionally required assumption that the noise is independent of the secret used to prepare the Server's single-qubit states. We quantify the soundness error which may be caused by residual secret dependencies. We demonstrate our protocol on the 20-qubit Quantinuum H1-1 ion-trap quantum processing unit, using qubit measurements and resets to construct measurement patterns with up to 52 vertices. To our knowledge, these are the largest verified measurement-based quantum computations performed to date. Our results pave the way for more accessible and efficient verification and benchmarking strategies in near-term quantum devices, enabling robust performance assessment without the added cost of external quantum infrastructure.</p>

            <p>Recent advances in the engineering of diamond surface make it possible to stabilize the charge state of 7-30 nanometers deep nitrogen-vacancy (NV) quantum sensors in diamond and to principally remove the charge noise at the surface. However, it is still a challenge to simultaneously increase the action volume of the quantum sensor by placing NV centers 0.5-2 nanometers deep and maintain their favorable spin coherence properties which will be definitely limited by the magnetic noise from the fluctuating nuclear spins of the terminating surface species of diamond. Here we show that leveraging the interplay of the surface induced strain and small constant magnetic fields, the spin coherence times of the ultra-shallow 1-nanometer deep NV center can be significantly enhanced up to the spin-phonon limited regime at room temperature in $^{12}$C enriched diamonds. We demonstrate that our measurement protocol is beneficial to $\sim$10-nanometers deep NV centers too in diamonds with naturally abundant carbon isotopes where the variable response of the spin bath to the direction of the small constant magnetic fields establishes vector magnetometry at the nanoscale.</p>

            <p>Interactions among sensors can provide, in addition to entanglement, an important resource for boosting the precision in quantum estimation protocols. Dephasing noise, however, remains a leading source of decoherence in state-of-the-art quantum sensing platforms. We analyze the impact of classical {\em collective dephasing with arbitrary temporal correlations} on the performance of generalized Ramsey interferometry protocols with \emph{quadratic} encoding of a target frequency parameter. The optimal asymptotic precision bounds are derived for both product coherent spin states and for a class of experimentally relevant entangled spin-squeezed states of $N$ qubit sensors. While, as in linear metrology, entanglement offers no advantage if the noise is Markovian, a precision scaling of $N^{-1}$ is reachable with classical input states in the quadratic setting, which is improved to $N^{-5/4}$ when temporal correlations are present and the Zeno regime is accessible. The use of nonclassical spin-squeezed states and a nonlinear readout further allows for an $N^{-3/2}$ precision scaling, which we prove is asymptotically optimal. We also show how to counter {\em noise-induced bias} by introducing a simple ratio estimator which relies on detecting two suitable system observables, and show that it remains asymptotically unbiased in the presence of dephasing, without detriment to the achievable precision.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qile Su, Rodrigo G. Corti√±as, Jayameenakshi Venkatraman, Shruti Puri</p>
            <p>The spontaneous switching of a quantum particle between the wells of a double-well potential is a phenomenon of general interest to physics and chemistry. It was broadly believed that the switching rate decreases steadily with the size of the energy barrier. This view was challenged by a recent experiment on a driven superconducting Kerr nonlinear oscillator (often called the Kerr-cat qubit or the Kerr parametric oscillator), whose energy barrier can be increased by ramping up the drive. Remarkably, as the drive amplitude increases, the switching rate exhibits a step-like decrease termed the "staircase". The view challenged by the experiment demands a deep review of our understanding of quantum effects in double wells. In this work, we derive a semi-analytical formula for the switching rate that resolves a continuous transition between tunneling- and dissipation-dominated dynamics. These two dynamics are observed respectively in the flat and the steep parts of each step in the staircase. Our formula exposes two distinct dissipative processes that limit tunneling: dephasing and decay. This allows us to predict the critical drive amplitudes where steps occur. In addition, we show that in the regime of a few states in the well and under moderate to low temperatures, highly excited states are populated predominantly via cascaded and direct thermal heating rather than quantum heating. At very low temperatures, however, the perturbation induced by the nonhermitian Hamiltonian becomes important and facilitates a new form of quantum heating. We numerically map the activation mechanism as a function of drive amplitude, damping rate, and temperature. Our theory deepens the understanding of switching dynamics between metastable quantum states, highlights the importance of a general interplay between tunneling and dissipation, and identifies a novel quantum regime in activated transitions.</p>

In order to apply perturbation theory, we transform our Hamiltonian to polaron frame, so that the effective system-bath coupling gets reduced. We employ coherence defined by l1-norm to analyze the non-Markovian effects in the spin-boson model. In the transformed frame of reference, the correlation timescales for the bath are significantly shorter than the system's relaxation timescale-a key assumption for Markovian dynamics. However, intriguingly, we demonstrate that under the large polaron theory, the reduced dynamics exhibit effective non-Markovian behaviour within a specific range of couplings, while remaining Markovian beyond this range.</p>

To simplify calculations under strong coupling, we adopt the Lang-Firsov transformation, effectively minimizing system-bath interactions. Within the polaron perspective using Ohmic bath spectral density with a Gaussian cutoff, we identify a fundamental timescale $s$ (equivalently a length scale $l$), dictating coherence decay. Utilizing a quantum master equation in the energy eigen basis while maintaining fixed particle number, we demonstrate that coherence persists for small $s$ values but diminishes for larger ones. Additionally, we explore the utilization of $\pi$-pulses to manipulate decoherence within the system.</p>

By employing the paradigmatic model of a Kiteav chain with power-law decaying interaction, we focus on the impacts of long-range interaction on the critical sensing for the scenarios with and without uncertainty in system this http URL show that the long-range interaction can be used as a valuable resource for enhancing the sensitivity of critical parameter estimation in both scenarios. Our findings not only provide more insights into the features of the long-range interacting systems, but also verify the usefulness of long-range interacting systems in quantum metrology.</p>

            <p>This study presents the coherent and dissipative coupling realized in the hybrid photonic resonators that have been achieved via the constructive and destructive interference of the photonic resonator fields with the radiation of a common transmission line fed with microwave photons. In the dissipative coupling regime we have found the coexistence of a peculiar phenomenon bound state in the continuum (BIC) near the crossing of frequency of the uncoupled resonators by satisfying the Friedrich-Wintgen BICs condition. Again just by rotating one of the samples and with the dynamic adjustment of a parameter we have achieved coupling induced transparency between the photonic resonators. This transition from BIC in the absorption regime to transparency opens avenues for different sorts of plain or programmable oscillators, filters, quantum information processors, sensors etc.</p>

            <h2>Pseudorandom quantum authentication</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tobias Haug, Nikhil Bansal, Wai-Keong Mok, Dax Enshan Koh, Kishor Bharti</p>
            <p>We introduce the pseudorandom quantum authentication scheme (PQAS), an efficient method for encrypting quantum states that relies solely on the existence of pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs). The scheme guarantees that for any eavesdropper with quantum polynomial-time (QPT) computational power, the encrypted states are indistinguishable from the maximally mixed state. Furthermore, the receiver can verify that the state has not been tampered with and recover the original state with asymptotically unit fidelity. Our scheme is cost-effective, requiring only polylogarithmic circuit depth and a single shared key to encrypt a polynomial number of states. Notably, the PQAS can potentially exist even without quantum-secure one-way functions, requiring fundamentally weaker computational assumptions than semantic classical cryptography. Additionally, PQAS is secure against attacks that plague protocols based on QPT indistinguishability from Haar random states, such as chosen-plaintext attacks (CPAs) and attacks that reveal meta-information such as quantum resources. We relate the amount of meta-information that is leaked to quantum pseudoresources, giving the concept a practical meaning. As an application, we construct important cryptographic primitives, such as verifiable pseudorandom density matrices (VPRDMs), which are QPT-indistinguishable from random mixed states while being efficiently verifiable via a secret key, as well as verifiable noise-robust EFI pairs and one-way state generators (OWSGs). Our results establish a new paradigm of quantum information processing with weaker computational assumptions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jin-Min Liang, Shuheng Liu, Shao-Ming Fei, Qiongyi He</p>
            <p>The characterization of high-dimensional entanglement plays a crucial role in the field of quantum information science. Conventional methods perform either fixed measurement bases or randomized measurements with high-order moments. Here, we introduce a criterion for estimating the Schmidt number of bipartite high-dimensional states based on local randomized projections with first-order moments. To extract more information from limited experimental data, we propose an estimation algorithm of the Schmidt number. We exhibit the performance of the proposed approach by considering the maximally entangled state under depolarizing and random noise models. Our approach not only obtains a more accurate estimation of the Schmidt number but also reduces the number of projections compared to known methods.</p>

            <p>Increasing the size and complexity of quantum information systems requires highly-multiplexed readout architectures, as well as amplifier chains operating near the quantum limit (QL) of added noise. While documented prior efforts in KITWPA integration in quantum systems are scarce, in this work we demonstrate integration of a KI-TWPA with a multiplexed-qubit device. To quantify the system noise improvement we perform an ac Stark shift calibration to precisely determine noise power levels on-chip (at each cavity's reference plane) and the total system gain. We then characterize the qubit state measurement fidelity and the corresponding signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To conduct the most faithful measurement of the benefits offered by the KI-TWPA we perform these measurements for readout chains where the high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) amplifier is the first-stage amplifier (FSA) - with none of the external hardware required to operate the KI-TWPA - and with the KI-TWPA as the FSA. While some readout cavities fall outside the KI-TWPA bandwidth, for those inside the bandwidth we demonstrate a maximum improvement in the state measurement SNR by a factor of 1.45, and increase the fidelity from 96.2% to 97.8%. These measurements demonstrate a system noise below 5 quanta referenced on-chip and we bound the KI-TWPA excess noise to be below 4 quanta for the six cavities inside its bandwidth. These results show a promising path forward for realizing quantum-limited readout chains in large qubit systems using a single parametric amplifier.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muhammad Shuraim, Muhammad Waseem, Shahid Qamar, Muhammad Irfan</p>
            <p>Atom-field interactions, induced by the vacuum of the electromagnetic field, exhibit a variety of fundamental phenomena and effects. In this paper, we study the electromagnetically induced atomic grating due to the vacuum state of the radiation field. Using an ensemble of cold atoms, strongly coupled to an optical cavity, we show that a probe field, propagating through the atomic medium, diffracts to zeroth and first-order diffraction peaks with few photons and even by the electromagnetic vacuum field of the cavity mode. As the number of photons in the cavity increases, the intensity of the first-order diffraction peak initially rises and then exhibits a decreasing trend. Furthermore, we observe that the first-order peak intensity reaches its maximum at resonance for both the vacuum and single-photon cavity state. However, as the number of photons increases further, this peak at resonance transforms into a dip, accompanied by two side peaks at off-resonance positions. This transition from a peak to a dip may potentially be used to distinguish the quantum state of the cavity.</p>

Our results demonstrate that the corrections exhibit significant sensitivity to both the distance between the two parallel plates and the order parameter of the weak field.

            <p>We study the complex Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (cSYK) numerically and investigate thermodynamic behavior of cSYK model across varying chemical potentials. We discover that the cSYK model remarkably mirrors the first-order phase transition seen in the van der Waals-Maxwell system, culminating at a non-mean-field critical point with distinctively different critical exponents. We analyze in detail the similarity between the van der Waals phase transition and the cSYK model, and further explore the mechanism by which the chemical potential drives the phase transition in the system. Exact diagonalization for the cSYK model reveals the significant impact of chemical potential on energy distribution, with observable energy gaps in the gapped phase. Quantum chaos indicators, including spectral form factors, suggest more stable energy states in the neutral case. Real-time dynamics, analyzed via analytical continuation of Schwinger-Dyson equations, show rapid decay in the gapless phase and prolonged oscillation lifetimes in the gapped regime. Spectral functions imply a shift from a continuous to a discrete energy level distribution, emphasizing the critical role of chemical potential in shaping spectral properties.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Krzysztof Sienicki</p>
            <p>This paper explores the intersection of identity, individuality, and reality through competing frameworks, including classical metaphysics, quantum mechanics, and computational theories. Traditional metaphysical notions of fixed identity are challenged by advancements in cloning, teletransportation, and digital replication, which reveal the fluid and relational nature of individuality. Quantum mechanics further complicates these notions, emphasizing the indistinguishability and contextuality of fundamental particles. Computational approaches, such as the Ruliad and Constructor Theory, offer expansive views of emergent realities but often lack practical constraints for observer relevance. Algorithmic idealism is introduced as a unifying framework, proposing that reality is an emergent construct governed by computational rules prioritizing coherence, sufficiency, and observer-dependent experiences. By redefining identity as an informational construct and reality as a process shaped by algorithmic transitions, algorithmic idealism resolves foundational paradoxes and offers a superior lens for understanding existence in an increasingly digital and interconnected world. The framework bridges gaps between competing theories, providing a coherent and pragmatic model for addressing ethical, metaphysical, and technological challenges.</p>

            <p>A comprehensive study integrating the microscopic structure of spacetime and the principle of quantum superposition is capable of offering a fundamental bottom-up approach for understanding the quantum aspect of gravity. In this paper, we present a framework for the superposition causal diamond spacetime and analyze the behavior of quantum entanglement influenced by the spacetime superposition from the perspective of relativistic quantum information. For the first time, we combine the concept of spacetime superposition with causal diamonds and derive the analytical expression of the Unruh-diamond vacuum state for Dirac fields in the superposed causal diamond spacetime. Based on this, we analyze both initially correlated and uncorrelated modes in superposed and classical causal diamond spacetimes, and quantify how quantum thermal effects arising from spacetime structure alter entanglement. Our findings reveal that quantum entanglement degrades in classical diamond spacetime, while the superposing structure of spacetime generates additional entanglement resources between modes in superposed diamond spacetimes. From a quantum information perspective, our results suggest that the characteristics of spacetime superposition can serve as valuable resources for performing quantum information processing tasks.</p>

We outline and discuss several outstanding challenges, including the need to explore and identify the organisational principles that can guide the development of theories, key experimental phenomenologies that continue to confound, and the formulation of methods that enable progress.

To assess the potential of ST2, we map out its basic optical characteristics, reveal its electronic level structure, and quantify the intrinsic transition rates. Furthermore, we investigate its response to microwaves, static magnetic fields, and the polarization of excitation laser light, revealing twelve inequivalent orientations of the ST2 center. Simultaneous exposure to microwaves and static magnetic fields also reveals an exceptionally wide acceptance angle for sensing strong magnetic fields, unlike the well-established NV center, which is sensitive only within a narrow cone aligned with its symmetry axis. This finding establishes the ST2 center as a highly promising candidate for nanoscale quantum sensing.</p>

            <p>The learner's ability to generate a hypothesis that closely approximates the target function is crucial in machine learning. Achieving this requires sufficient data; however, unauthorized access by an eavesdropping learner can lead to security risks. Thus, it is important to ensure the performance of the "authorized" learner by limiting the quality of the training data accessible to eavesdroppers. Unlike previous studies focusing on encryption or access controls, we provide a theorem to ensure superior learning outcomes exclusively for the authorized learner with quantum label encoding. In this context, we use the probably-approximately-correct (PAC) learning framework and introduce the concept of learning probability to quantitatively assess learner performance. Our theorem allows the condition that, given a training dataset, an authorized learner is guaranteed to achieve a certain quality of learning outcome, while eavesdroppers are not. Notably, this condition can be constructed based only on the authorized-learning-only measurable quantities of the training data, i.e., its size and noise degree. We validate our theoretical proofs and predictions through convolutional neural networks (CNNs) image classification learning.</p>

We extend this formula to describe particle and energy currents with gain or loss in the intermediate region by using the Lindblad-Keldysh formalism. Based on the derived formula, several novel effects induced by gain or loss in the current are discussed: the breaking of inversion symmetry in the gain and loss terms or in the system can lead to current generation; the anomalous phenomenon that disorder can induce current generation; the presence of gain and loss makes the thermal and electrical conductances continuous and ensures they follow the Wiedemann-Franz law even outside the energy band; the effect of bond loss-induced skin effect on current.

            <h2>Black Hole Waterfall: a unitary phenomenological model for black hole evaporation with Page curve</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paul M. Alsing</p>
            <p>We present a unitary phenomenological model for black hole evaporation based on the analogy of the laboratory process of spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) \cite{Alsing:2015,Alsing:2016} when the black hole (pump) is allowed to deplete to zero mass. The model incorporates an additional new feature that allows for the interior Hawking partner-particles (idlers) behind the horizon to further generate new Hawking particle pairs of lower energy, one of which remains behind the horizon, and the other that adds to the externally emitted Hawking radiation (signals) outside the horizon. This model produces a Page curve for the evolution of the reduced density matrices for the evaporating black hole internal degrees of freedom entangled with the generated Hawking radiation pairs entangled across the horizon. The Page curve yields an entropy that rises at early times during the evaporation process as Hawking pairs are generated, reaches a peak midway through the evolution, and then decays to zero upon complete evaporation of the black hole. The entire system remains in a pure state at all times undergoing unitary (squeezed state) evolution, with the initial state of the black hole modeled as a bosonic Fock state of large, but finite number $n_{p0}$ of particles. For the final state of the system, the black hole reaches the vacuum state of zero mass, while the external Hawking radiation carries away the total energy of the initial black hole. Inside the horizon there remains $n_{p0}$ Hawking partner-particles of vanishingly small total energy, reminiscent of the "soft-hair" (zero energy) qubit model of Hotta, Nambu and Yamaguchi \cite{Hotta_Nambu_Yamaguchi:2018}, but now from a Hamiltonian for squeezed state generation perspective. The model presented here can be readily extended to encompass arbitrary initial pure states for the black hole, and in falling matter.</p>

We perform infinite density matrix renormalization group to contract the two-dimensional tensor network. We present the numerical result of magnetization and entanglement entropy for the Ising ferromagnet and antiferromagnet side by side. In order to determine the critical line in the parameter space of temperature and magnetic field, we use the half-chain entanglement entropy of the one-dimensional quantum state.

            <p>Finding an exact ground state of a 3D Ising spin glass is proven to be an NP-hard problem. There is a widespread belief that this statement implies an exponential scaling, $\sim 2^{N/\beta}$, of necessary computational efforts (classical or quantum), with the number of spins, $N$. Yet, what is a factor $\beta$ here and are there any fundamental limits on how large it can be? Here we report results of extensive experimentation with D-Wave 3D annealer with $N\leq 5627$. We found exact ground states (in a probabilistic sense) for typical realizations of 3D spin glasses with the efficiency, characterized by $\beta\approx 10^{3}$. We argue that with a further improvement of annealing protocols, post-processing algorithms and device noise reduction, $\beta$ can be increased even further.

            <p>The quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) is a quantum phenomenon in which a two-dimensional system exhibits a quantized Hall resistance $h/e^2$ in the absence of magnetic field, where $h$ is the Planck constant and $e$ is the electron charge. In this work, we extend this novel phase to three dimensions and thus propose a three-dimensional QAHE exhibiting richer and more versatile transport behaviors. We first confirm this three-dimensional QAHE through the quantized Chern number, then establish its bulk-boundary correspondence, and finally reaffirm it via the distinctive transport properties. Remarkably, we find that the three-dimensional QAHE hosts two chiral surface states along one spatial direction while a pair of chiral hinge states along another direction, and the location of the hinge states depends sensitively on the Fermi energy. These two types of boundary states are further connected through a perpendicular chiral surface states, whose chirality is also Fermi energy dependent. Consequently, depending on the transport direction, its Hall resistance can quantize to $0$, $h/e^2$, or $\pm h/e^2$ when the Fermi energy is tuned across the charge neutral point. This three-dimensional QAHE not only fill the gap in the Hall effect family but also holds significant potentials in device applications such as in-memory computing.</p>

However, for products of more than two codes, product expansion is a strictly stronger property. In this paper, we prove that the collection of random codes over a sufficiently large field has good product expansion. We believe that in the case of four codes, these ideas can be used to construct good quantum locally testable codes in a way similar to the current constructions using only products of two codes.</p>

We examine how the information for various quantum states evolves with changes in the width of the potential well. For both potentials, the Shannon entropy decreases in position space and increases in momentum space as the width increases, maintaining a constant sum of entropies, consistent with Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. The Fisher information measure shows different behaviors for the two potentials: it remains nearly constant for the quartic potential. For the symmetric well potential, the Fisher information decreases in position space and increases in momentum space as localization in position space increases, also consistent with the analogue of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. Additionally, the Bialynicki-Birula-Mycielski inequality is evaluated across various cases and is confirmed to hold in each instance.</p>

Treating the initial error parameter and the dimension as constants, we show that our procedure has sample complexity asymptotically optimal in the final error parameter.

            <h2>Learning interacting fermionic Hamiltonians at the Heisenberg limit</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arjun Mirani, Patrick Hayden</p>
            <p>Efficiently learning an unknown Hamiltonian given access to its dynamics is a problem of interest for quantum metrology, many-body physics and machine learning. A fundamental question is whether learning can be performed at the Heisenberg limit, where the Hamiltonian evolution time scales inversely with the error, $\varepsilon$, in the reconstructed parameters. The Heisenberg limit has previously been shown to be achievable for certain classes of qubit and bosonic Hamiltonians. Most recently, a Heisenberg-limited learning algorithm was proposed for a simplified class of fermionic Hubbard Hamiltonians restricted to real hopping amplitudes and zero chemical potential at all sites, along with on-site interactions. In this work, we provide an algorithm to learn a more general class of fermionic Hubbard Hamiltonians at the Heisenberg limit, allowing complex hopping amplitudes and nonzero chemical potentials in addition to the on-site interactions, thereby including several models of physical interest. The required evolution time across all experiments in our protocol is $\mathcal{O}(1/\varepsilon)$ and the number of experiments required to learn all the Hamiltonian parameters is $\mathcal{O}(\text{polylog}(1/\varepsilon))$, independent of system size as long as each fermionic mode interacts with $\mathcal{O}(1)$ other modes. Unlike prior algorithms for bosonic and fermionic Hamiltonians, to obey fermionic parity superselection constraints in our more general setting, our protocol utilizes $\mathcal{O}(N)$ ancillary fermionic modes, where $N$ is the system size. Each experiment involves preparing fermionic Gaussian states, interleaving time evolution with fermionic linear optics unitaries, and performing local occupation number measurements on the fermionic modes. The protocol is robust to a constant amount of state preparation and measurement error.</p>

            <p>The quantum speed limit and the Wigner function of open system models are studied. To this end, we use the phase covariant and a two-qubit model interacting with a squeezed thermal bath via position-dependent coupling. The dependence of the coupling on the position of the qubits allows for the study of the dynamics in the collective regime, which is conducive to speeding up the evolution. An interesting interplay is observed between non-Markovian behavior, quantumness, and the quantum speed limit. The presence of quantum correlations is seen to speed up the evolution.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Li-Li Ye, Christian Arenz, Joseph M. Lukens, Ying-Cheng Lai</p>
            <p>Entanglement is fundamental to quantum information science and technology, yet controlling and manipulating entanglement -- so-called entanglement engineering -- for arbitrary quantum systems remains a formidable challenge. There are two difficulties: the fragility of quantum entanglement and its experimental characterization. We develop a model-free deep reinforcement-learning (RL) approach to entanglement engineering, in which feedback control together with weak continuous measurement and partial state observation is exploited to generate and maintain desired entanglement. We employ quantum optomechanical systems with linear or nonlinear photon-phonon interactions to demonstrate the workings of our machine-learning-based entanglement engineering protocol. In particular, the RL agent sequentially interacts with one or multiple parallel quantum optomechanical environments, collects trajectories, and updates the policy to maximize the accumulated reward to create and stabilize quantum entanglement over an arbitrary amount of time. The machine-learning-based model-free control principle is applicable to the entanglement engineering of experimental quantum systems in general.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mihyang Yu, Jeonghan Lee, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Jieun Lee</p>
            <p>Atomic defects in solids offer a versatile basis to study and realize quantum phenomena and information science in various integrated systems. All-electrical pumping of single defects to create quantum light emission has been realized in several platforms including color centers in diamond and silicon carbide, which could lead to the circuit network of electrically triggered single-photon sources. However, a wide conduction channel which reduces the carrier injection per defect site has been a major obstacle. Here, we realize a device concept to construct electrically pumped single-photon emission using a van der Waals stacked structure with atomic plane precision. Defect-induced tunneling currents across graphene and NbSe2 electrodes sandwiching an atomically thin h-BN layer allow robust and persistent generation of non-classical light from h-BN. The collected emission photon energies range between 1.4 and 2.9 eV, revealing the electrical excitation of a variety of atomic defects. By analyzing the dipole axis of observed emitters, we further confirm that emitters are crystallographic defect structures of h-BN crystal. Our work facilitates implementing efficient and miniaturized single-photon devices in van der Waals platforms toward applications in quantum optoelectronics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> H. E. Camblong, A. Chakraborty, P. Lopez-Duque, C. Ord√≥√±ez</p>
            <p>Causal diamonds are known to have thermal behavior that can be probed by finite-lifetime observers equipped with energy-scaled detectors. This thermality can be attributed to the time evolution of observers within the causal diamond, governed by one of the conformal quantum mechanics (CQM) symmetry generators: the noncompact hyperbolic operator $S$. In this paper, we show that the unbounded nature of $S$ endows it with a quantum instability, which is a generalization of a similar property exhibited by the inverted harmonic oscillator potential. Our analysis is semiclassical, including a detailed phase-space study of the classical dynamics of $S$ and its dual operator $R$, and a general semiclassical framework yielding basic instability and thermality properties that play a crucial role in the quantum behavior of the theory. For an observer with a finite lifetime $\mathcal{T}$, the detected temperature $T_D = 2 \hbar/(\pi \mathcal{T})$ is associated with a Lyapunov exponent $\lambda_L = \pi T_D/\hbar$, which is half the upper saturation bound of the information scrambling rate.</p>

            <p>This study presents the design, simulation, and experimental characterization of a superconducting transmon qubit circuit prototype for potential applications in dark matter detection experiments. We describe a planar circuit design featuring two non-interacting transmon qubits, one with fixed frequency and the other flux tunable. Finite-element simulations were employed to extract key Hamiltonian parameters and optimize component geometries. The qubit was fabricated and then characterized at $20$ mK, allowing for a comparison between simulated and measured qubit parameters. Good agreement was found for transition frequencies and anharmonicities (within 1\% and 10\% respectively) while coupling strengths exhibited larger discrepancies (30\%). We discuss potential causes for measured coherence times falling below expectations ($T_1\sim\,$1-2 \textmu s) and propose strategies for future design improvements. Notably, we demonstrate the application of a hybrid 3D-2D simulation approach for energy participation ratio evaluation, yielding a more accurate estimation of dielectric losses. This work represents an important first step in developing planar Quantum Non-Demolition (QND) single-photon counters for dark matter searches, particularly for axion and dark photon detection schemes.</p>

            <p>The Purcell effect, a common issue in qubit-resonator systems leading to both fidelity and nonclassicality losses is studied while its suppression is achieved using a novel qubit readout circuit design. Our approach utilizes a unique coupling architecture in which, the qubit first interacts with a filter resonator before coupling to the readout resonator. This configuration enables precise control over the Purcell decay rate and ac Stark factor without impacting on measuring time. The mentioned factor is highly sensitive to the coupling strength between the readout resonator and the filter, meaning that the factor adjustment directly impacts the qubit state detection. A major advantage of this design is that tuning the resonator-filter coupling strength is relatively straightforward, offering flexibility in fine-tuning ac Stark factor. This work extensively analyzes the system using full quantum mechanical theory, deriving the total Hamiltonian and investigates mode dynamics via quantum Langevin equations. Key parameters influencing the nonclassicality of output signals are also explored through quantum correlation metrics, including symplectic eigenvalues, quantum discord, and classical discord. The main goal is to find any compromises exsting between the ac Stark factor increasing and the quantum correlation created in the readout circuit. By optimizing the critical factors, by which the ac Stark factor mainly affected, the proposed design not only improves the distinguishability of the qubit states but also ensures robust nonclassicality in the output signals. Results demonstrate the potential of the proposed system to bridge the gap between a high fidelity readout and quantum correlation preservation in scalable quantum architectures.</p>

            <h2>Universal coarse geometry of spin systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ali Elokl, Corey Jones</p>
            <p>The prospect of realizing highly entangled states on quantum processors with fundamentally different hardware geometries raises the question: to what extent does a state of a quantum spin system have an intrinsic geometry? In this paper, we propose that both states and dynamics of a spin system have a canonically associated coarse geometry, in the sense of Roe, on the set of sites in the thermodynamic limit. For a state $\phi$ on an (abstract) spin system with an infinite collection of sites $X$, we define a universal coarse structure $\mathcal{E}_{\phi}$ on the set $X$ with the property that a state has decay of correlations with respect to a coarse structure $\mathcal{E}$ on $X$ if and only if $\mathcal{E}_{\phi}\subseteq \mathcal{E}$. We show that under mild assumptions, the coarsely connected completion $(\mathcal{E}_{\phi})_{con}$ is stable under quasi-local perturbations of the state $\phi$. We also develop in parallel a dynamical coarse structure for arbitrary quantum channels, and prove a similar stability result. We show that several order parameters of a state only depend on the coarse structure of an underlying spatial metric, and we establish a basic compatibility between the dynamical coarse structure associated to a quantum circuit $\alpha$ and the coarse structure of the state $\psi\circ \alpha$ where $\psi$ is any product state.</p>

            <h2>Thermodynamic limitations on fault-tolerant quantum computing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mykhailo Bilokur, Sarang Gopalakrishnan, Shayan Majidy</p>
            <p>We investigate the thermodynamic limits on scaling fault-tolerant quantum computers due to heating from quantum error correction (QEC). Quantum computers require error correction, which accounts for 99.9% of the qubit demand and generates heat through information-erasing processes. This heating increases the error rate, necessitating more rounds of error correction. We introduce a dynamical model that characterizes heat generation and dissipation for arrays of qubits weakly coupled to a refrigerator and identify a dynamical phase transition between two operational regimes: a bounded-error phase, where temperature stabilizes and error rates remain below fault-tolerance thresholds, and an unbounded-error phase, where rising temperatures drive error rates beyond sustainable levels, making fault tolerance infeasible. Applying our model to a superconducting qubit system performing Shor's algorithm to factor 2048-bit RSA integers, we find that current experimental parameters place the system in the bounded-error phase. Our results indicate that, while inherent heating can become significant, this thermodynamic constraint should not limit scalable fault tolerance if current hardware capabilities are maintained as systems scale.</p>

            <p>L-systems can be made to model and create simulations of many biological processes, such as plant development. Finding an L-system for a given process is typically solved by hand, by experts, in a massively time-consuming process.

In this paper, we are interested in inferring a particular type of L-system, deterministic context-free L-system (D0L-system) from a sequence of strings. We introduce the characteristic graph of a sequence of strings, which we then utilize to translate our problem (inferring D0L-system) in polynomial time into the maximum independent set problem (MIS) and the SAT problem. After that, we offer a classical exact algorithm and an approximate quantum algorithm for the problem.</p>

            <h2>Wave function evolution from source to detection and the measurement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> LiHua Yu</p>
            <p>We analyze the evolution of a particle wave function when it propagates through free space in the longitudinal z-direction from a thin entrance slit to a detector behind a thin exit slit parallel to the horizontal y-axis. We consider an extra aperture slit between the two slits to probe the evolution of the wave function and close the aperture slit starting from wide open until the detection counting rate in a repeated experiment drops to half. When all the slits are long and thin, the 1D Schroedinger equation gives the wave function evolution until the final detection. The width of the aperture slit in the vertical x-direction depends on the z-position of the slit providing an approximate description of the wave function evolution. The width of the function characterizing this dependence starts from the entrance slit. It grows wider until it reaches a maximum and then shrinks narrower and finally collapses into the exit slit where the particle is detected. Thus the envelope of this function has a spindle shape with its pointed ends at the two slits. Hence it is very different from the well-known wave function of the Schroedinger equation with the initial condition at the entrance slit, which is narrow only at the beginning, then grows wider until it reaches the exit slit, where it is much larger than the slit width. However, the phase information is lost because the aperture slit distorts the wave function. To keep the phase information, we replace the aperture slit with a thin pin (parallel to the y-axis) that blocks the wave function. We then study its perturbative effect on the counting rate of the detector. This analysis provides a function to probe the process of the wave function collapse right before the detection. We show this function is real-valued, with amplitude and phase information, and is closely related to the wave function.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we investigate the constraints of the transmon qubit, an improved version of the charge qubit, on bosonic light dark matters. Phonon excitations induced by the scattering or absorption of dark matter on a superconductor may destroy the Cooper pair, leading to the production of quasiparticles made by the electron. By measuring the production rate of the quasiparticle density, one may read out the coupling between dark matter and ordinary matter, assuming that these quasiparticles are solely induced by dark matter interactions. For the first time, we show constraints on the parameter space of the dark photon, light scalar dark matter, and axion-like particles from the measurement of quasiparticles in transmon qubit experiments. This study offers insights for the development of quantum qubit experiments aimed at the direct detection of dark matter in underground laboratories.</p>

            <p>Vacancy-cluster color centers in lithium fluoride have been studied in detail both theoretically and experimentally for over a century, giving rise to various applications in solid-state lasers, broadband photonic devices, and radiation dosimeters. These color centers are also attractive candidate platforms for applications in quantum information science, due to their spin properties and strong coupling to the crystal lattice, which allows their properties to be easily tuned. Here we present hybrid functional calculations of common vacancy defects in lithium fluoride, including their energetic, spin, and optical properties. We show that for a wide range of hybrid functional parameters tuned to match the experimental band gap, certain defects have little variation in their predicted optical properties. We further demonstrate that the parameters needed to satisfy the generalized Koopman's theorem and correctly position defect levels within the gap, can vary dramatically, even for different charge states of the same defect. Our work establishes the accuracy of the computationally lightweight hybrid-functional approach for predicting the optical and energetic properties of color centers in polar materials.</p>

            <p>Microwave-optical entanglement is essential for efficient quantum communication, secure information transfer, and integrating microwave and optical quantum systems to advance hybrid quantum technologies. In this work, we demonstrate how the magnon Kerr effect can be harnessed to generate and control nonreciprocal entanglement in cavity optomagnomechanics (COMM). This effect induces magnon frequency shifts and introduces pair-magnon interactions, both of which are tunable through the magnetic field direction, enabling nonreciprocal behavior. By adjusting system parameters such as magnon frequency detuning, we show that magnon-phonon, microwave-optical photon-photon, and optical photon-magnon entanglement can be nonreciprocally enhanced and rendered more robust against thermal noise. Additionally, the nonreciprocity of entanglement can be selectively controlled, and ideal nonreciprocal entanglement is achievable. This work paves the way for designing nonreciprocal quantum devices across the microwave and optical regimes, leveraging the unique properties of the magnon Kerr effect in COMM.</p>

            <p>Silicon carbide (SiC) has attracted significant attention as a promising quantum material due to its ability to host long-lived, optically addressable color centers with solid-state photonic interfaces. The CMOS compatibility of 4H-SiCOI (silicon-carbide-on-insulator) makes it an ideal platform for integrated quantum photonic devices and circuits. While micro-ring cavities have been extensively studied in SiC and other materials, the integration of 4H-SiC spin defects into these critical structures, along with continuous mode tunability, remains unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate the integration of PL4 divacancy spin defects into tunable micro-ring cavities in scalable thin-film 4H-SiC nanophotonics. Comparing on- and off-resonance conditions, we observed an enhancement of the Purcell factor by approximately 5.0. This enhancement effectively confined coherent photons within the coupled waveguide, leading to a twofold increase in the ODMR (optically detected magnetic resonance) contrast and coherent control of PL4 spins. These advancements lay the foundation for developing SiC-based quantum photonic circuits.</p>

            <p>In quantum parameter estimation, the quantum Cram√©r-Rao bound (QCRB) sets a fundamental limit on the precision achievable with unbiased estimators. It relates the uncertainty in estimating a parameter to the inverse of the quantum Fisher information (QFI). Both QCRB and QFI are valuable tools for analyzing interferometric phase sensitivity. This paper compares the single-parameter and two-parameter QFI for a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) with three detection schemes: single-mode and difference intensity detection, neither has access to an external phase reference and balanced homodyne detection with access to an external phase reference. We use a spin-coherent state associated with the su(2) algebra as the input state in all scenarios and show that all three schemes can achieve the QCRB for the spin-coherent input state. Furthermore, we explore the utilization of SU(2) coherent states in diverse scenarios. Significantly, we find that the best pressure is obtained when the total angular momentum quantum number $j$ is high, and we demonstrate that given optimal conditions, all detection schemes can achieve the QCRB by utilizing SU(2) coherent states as input states.</p>

            <p>The finite time operation of a quantum Otto heat engine leads to a trade-off between efficiency and output power, which is due to the deviation of the system from the adiabatic path. This trade-off caveat can be bypassed by using the shortcut-to-adiabaticity protocol.

We investigated its performance using the shortcut-to-adiabaticity technique via counter-adiabatic driving with the inclusion of the cost to perform the shortcut. We use two different metrics that incorporate the cost of shortcut-to-adiabaticity to define engine efficiency and experimentally analyze which one is more appropriate for the NMR platform. We found a significant improvement in the performance of the quantum Otto heat engine driven by shortcut-to-adiabaticity, as compared to the non-adiabatic heat engine.</p>

            <p>We investigate the transition rates of a centripetally accelerated atom interacting with electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations inside a high-quality cavity. Our findings reveal that the emission and excitation rates can be extensively manipulated by adjusting the cavity's normal mode frequency and the rotational angular velocity. Using experimentally feasible parameters, we demonstrate that, in one scenario, the excitation rate can reach magnitudes as high as $10^7~{\rm s}^{-1}$, while the emission rate remains negligible, trailing by 9 orders of magnitude. This suggests the potential for substantial population inversion in an ensemble of atoms. In another scenario, both the emission and excitation rates can simultaneously reach magnitudes as high as $10^7~{\rm s}^{-1}$, indicating that millions of transitions per second are expected even for a single atom. These remarkable results not only offer a new method for controlling the radiative properties of atoms but also open avenues for the experimental verification of the circular Unruh effect using cutting-edge quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>The anisotropic two-photon quantum Rabi model is studied using the Bogoliubov operator approach. The doubly degenerate exceptional states are identified through analytical methods. By adjusting the position of the last exceptional point belonging to two adjacent energy levels, we derive a condition for the absence of the discrete spectrum at the critical coupling where ``spectral collapse" occurs. In this special case, the spectrum becomes fully continuous above a threshold energy, with no bound states existing, whereas the ground state remains gapped in the general case. This also signals a quantum phase transition. More interestingly, we rigorously find that a finite number of bound states exist between two anisotropy dependent critical atomic frequencies, with infinitely many bound states beyond this frequency regime. In this manner, all issues in the two-photon quantum Rabi model are resolved.</p>

            <p>The quantum internet is one of the frontiers of quantum information science. It will revolutionize the way we communicate and do other tasks, and it will allow for tasks that are not possible using the current, classical internet. The backbone of a quantum internet is entanglement distributed globally in order to allow for such novel applications to be performed over long distances. Experimental progress is currently being made to realize quantum networks on a small scale, but much theoretical work is still needed in order to understand how best to distribute entanglement and to guide the realization of large-scale quantum networks, and eventually the quantum internet, especially with the limitations of near-term quantum technologies. This work provides an initial step towards this goal. The main contribution of this thesis is a mathematical framework for entanglement distribution protocols in a quantum network, which allows for discovering optimal protocols using reinforcement learning. We start with a general development of quantum decision processes, which is the theoretical backdrop of reinforcement learning. Then, we define the general task of entanglement distribution in a quantum network, and we present ground- and satellite-based quantum network architectures that incorporate practical aspects of entanglement distribution. We combine the theory of decision processes and the practical quantum network architectures into an overall entanglement distribution protocol. We also define practical figures of merit to evaluate entanglement distribution protocols, which help to guide experimental implementations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinpeng Shu, Yining Jiang, Hao Wu, Mark Oxborrow</p>
            <p>We here introduce a method for simulating, quantum mechanically, the dynamics of a maser where the strength of the magnetic field of the microwave mode being amplified by stimulated emission varies over the volume of the maser's spatially extended gain medium. This is very often the case in real systems. Our method generalizes the well-known Tavis-Cummings (T-C) model of cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) to encompass quantum emitters whose coupling strengths to the maser's amplified mode vary over a distribution that can be accurately determined using an electromagnetic-field solver applied to the maser cavity's geometry and composition. We then solve our generalized T-C model to second order in cumulant expansion using publicly available Python-based software. We apply our methodology to a specific, experimentally measured maser based on an optically pumped crystal of pentacene-doped para-terphenyl. We demonstrate that certain distinct quantum-mechanical features exhibited by this maser's dynamics, most notably the observation of Rabi-like flopping associated with the generation of spin-photon Dicke states, can be accurately reproduced using our numerically solved model. The equivalent simpler model, that invokes the mean-field approximation, fails to do so. By constructing then solving for artificial (perfectly Gaussian) distributions, we go on to explore how the performance of this type of maser is affected by the spread in spin-photon coupling strengths. Our methodology thereby enables the maser's anatomy to be more rationally engineered.</p>

            <h2>Nonreciprocal Multipartite Entanglement in a two-cavity magnomechanical system</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rizwan Ahmed, Hazrat Ali, Aamir Shehzad, S K Singh, Amjad Sohail, Marcos Cesar de Oliveira</p>
            <p>We propose a theoretical scheme for the generation of nonreciprocal multipartite entanglement in a two-mode cavity magnomechanical system, consisting of two cross-microwave (MW) cavities having a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere, which is coupled through magnetic dipole interaction. Our results show that the self-Kerr effect of magnon can significantly enhance multipartite entanglement, which turns out to be nonreciprocal when the magnetic field is tuned along the crystallographic axis [110]. This is due to the frequency shift on the magnons (YIG sphere), which depends on the direction of the magnetic field. Interestingly, the degree of nonreciprocity of bipartite entanglements depends upon a careful optimal choice of system parameters like normalized cavity detunings, bipartite nonlinear index, self-Kerr coefficient, and effective magnomechanical coupling rate G. In addition to bipartite entanglement, we also present the idea of a bidirectional contrast ratio, which quantifies the nonreciprocity in tripartite entanglements.

            <h2>Multi-field quantum conferencing overcomes the network capacity limit</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuan-Mei Xie, Yu-Shuo Lu, Yao Fu, Hua-Lei Yin, Zeng-Bing Chen</p>
            <p>Quantum conferencing enables multiple nodes within a quantum network to share a secure group key for private message broadcasting. The key rate, however, is limited by the repeaterless capacity to distribute multiparticle entangled states across the network. Currently, in the finite-size regime, no feasible schemes utilizing existing experimental techniques can overcome the fundamental rate-distance limit of quantum conferencing in quantum networks without repeaters. Here, we propose a practical, multi-field scheme that breaks this limit, involving virtually establishing Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states through post-measurement coincidence matching. This proposal features a measurement-device-independent characteristic and can directly scale to support any number of users. Simulations show that the fundamental limitation on the group key rate can be overcome in a reasonable running time of sending $10^{14}$ pulses. We predict that it offers an efficient design for long-distance broadcast communication in future quantum networks.</p>

            <h2>Emerging Quadrature Lattices of Kerr Combs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eran Lustig, Melissa A. Guidry, Daniil M. Lukin, Shanhui Fan, Jelena Vuckovic</p>
            <p>A quadrature lattice is a coupled array of squeezed vacuum field quadratures that offers new avenues in shaping the quantum properties of multimode light [1-3]. Such lattices are described within the framework of non-Hermitian, non-dissipative physics and exhibit intriguing lattice phenomena such as lattice exceptional points, edge-states, entanglement and non-Hermitian skin effect, offering fundamentally new methods for controlling quantum fluctuations [1, 4]. Nonlinear resonators are suitable for studying multimode pair-generation processes and squeezing which are non-dissipative in \chi(2) and \chi(3) materials [5-12], but observing non-Hermitian lattice phenomena in photonic quadrature lattices was not achieved. Remarkably, in dissipative Kerr microcombs [13], which have revolutionized photonic technology, such lattices emerge and govern the quantum noise that leads to comb formation. Thus, they offer a unique opportunity to realize quadrature lattices, and to study and manipulate multimode quantum noise which is essential for any quantum technology. Here, we experimentally study non-Hermitian lattice effects in photonic quadrature lattices for the first time. Our photonic quadrature lattices emerge at Kerr microcomb transitions, allowing us to observe fundamental connections between dispersion symmetry, frequency-dependent squeezed supermodes, and non-Hermitian lattice physics in an integrated setup. Our work unifies two major fields, quantum non-Hermitian physics and Kerr combs, and opens the door to utilizing dissipative Kerr combs to experimentally explore rich non-Hermitian physics in the quantum regime, engineer quantum light, and develop new tools to study the quantum noise and formation of Kerr combs.</p>

            <h2>Effective field theory of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vinay Patil, Rafael Flores-Calder√≥n, Ashley M. Cook</p>
            <p>Motivated by phenomenology of myriad recently-identified topologically non-trivial phases of matter, we introduce effective field theories (EFTs) for the quantum skyrmion Hall effect (QSkHE). We employ a single, unifying generalisation for this purpose: in essence, a lowest Landau level projection defining a non-commutative, fuzzy sphere with position coordinates proportional to SU(2) generators of matrix representation size $N\times N$, may host an intrinsically 2+1 dimensional, topologically non-trivial many-body state for small $N$ as well as large $N$. That is, isospin degrees of freedom associated with a matrix Lie algebra with $N \times N$ generators potentially encode some finite number of spatial dimensions for $N\ge 2$, a regime in which isospin has previously been treated as a label. This statement extends to more general $p$-branes subjected to severe fuzzification as well as membranes. As a consequence of this generalisation, systems with $d$ Cartesian spatial coordinates and isospin degrees of freedom encoding an additional $\delta$ fuzzy coset space coordinates can realise topologically non-trivial states of intrinsic dimensionality up to $d$+$\delta$+1. We therefore identify gauge theories with extra fuzzy dimensions generalised to retain dependence upon gauge fields over fuzzy coset spaces even for severe fuzzification (small $N$), as EFTs for the QSkHE. We furthermore generalise these EFTs to space manifolds with local product structure exploiting the dimensional hierarchy of (fuzzy) spheres. For this purpose, we introduce methods of anisotropic fuzzification and propose formulating topological invariants on fuzzy coset spaces as artifacts of projecting matrix Lie algebras to occupied subspaces. Importantly, we focus on phenomenology indicating the 2+1 D SU(2) gauge theory should be generalised using this machinery, and serves as a minimal EFT of the QSkHE.</p>

Bulk-boundary correspondence of these states includes real-space boundary orbital angular momentum textures and gapless boundary modes that are robust against magnetic disorder, consistent with compactified three dimensional boundary Weyl nodes (WN$_F$s) of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect. These theoretical findings are furthermore consistent with past experimental work reporting unexpected edge conduction in HgTe quantum wells under applied Zeeman and orbital magnetic fields.

            <h2>Nonreciprocal Microwave-Optical Entanglement in Kerr-Modified Cavity Optomagnomechanics</h2>

            <p>Microwave-optical entanglement is essential for efficient quantum communication, secure information transfer, and integrating microwave and optical quantum systems to advance hybrid quantum technologies. In this work, we demonstrate how the magnon Kerr effect can be harnessed to generate and control nonreciprocal entanglement in cavity optomagnomechanics (COMM). This effect induces magnon frequency shifts and introduces pair-magnon interactions, both of which are tunable through the magnetic field direction, enabling nonreciprocal behavior. By adjusting system parameters such as magnon frequency detuning, we show that magnon-phonon, microwave-optical photon-photon, and optical photon-magnon entanglement can be nonreciprocally enhanced and rendered more robust against thermal noise. Additionally, the nonreciprocity of entanglement can be selectively controlled, and ideal nonreciprocal entanglement is achievable. This work paves the way for designing nonreciprocal quantum devices across the microwave and optical regimes, leveraging the unique properties of the magnon Kerr effect in COMM.</p>

            <p>Silicon carbide (SiC) has attracted significant attention as a promising quantum material due to its ability to host long-lived, optically addressable color centers with solid-state photonic interfaces. The CMOS compatibility of 4H-SiCOI (silicon-carbide-on-insulator) makes it an ideal platform for integrated quantum photonic devices and circuits. While micro-ring cavities have been extensively studied in SiC and other materials, the integration of 4H-SiC spin defects into these critical structures, along with continuous mode tunability, remains unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate the integration of PL4 divacancy spin defects into tunable micro-ring cavities in scalable thin-film 4H-SiC nanophotonics. Comparing on- and off-resonance conditions, we observed an enhancement of the Purcell factor by approximately 5.0. This enhancement effectively confined coherent photons within the coupled waveguide, leading to a twofold increase in the ODMR (optically detected magnetic resonance) contrast and coherent control of PL4 spins. These advancements lay the foundation for developing SiC-based quantum photonic circuits.</p>

            <p>We propose a quantum optimal control framework based on the Pontryagin Maximum Principle to design energy- and time-efficient pulses for open quantum systems. By formulating the Langevin equation of a dissipative LC circuit as a linear control problem, we derive optimized pulses with exponential scaling in energy cost, outperforming conventional shortcut-to-adiabaticity methods such as counter-diabatic driving. When applied to a resonator dispersively coupled to a qubit, these optimized pulses achieve an excellent signal-to-noise ratio comparable to longitudinal coupling schemes across varying critical photon numbers. Our results provide a significant step toward efficient control in dissipative open systems and improved qubit readout in circuit quantum electrodynamics.</p>

            <h2>Quantum phase estimation and realistic detection schemes in Mach-Zehnder interferometer using SU(2) coherent states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammed Abdellaoui, Nour-Eddine Abouelkhir, Abdallah Slaoui, Rachid Ahl Laamara</p>
            <p>In quantum parameter estimation, the quantum Cram√©r-Rao bound (QCRB) sets a fundamental limit on the precision achievable with unbiased estimators. It relates the uncertainty in estimating a parameter to the inverse of the quantum Fisher information (QFI). Both QCRB and QFI are valuable tools for analyzing interferometric phase sensitivity. This paper compares the single-parameter and two-parameter QFI for a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) with three detection schemes: single-mode and difference intensity detection, neither has access to an external phase reference and balanced homodyne detection with access to an external phase reference. We use a spin-coherent state associated with the su(2) algebra as the input state in all scenarios and show that all three schemes can achieve the QCRB for the spin-coherent input state. Furthermore, we explore the utilization of SU(2) coherent states in diverse scenarios. Significantly, we find that the best pressure is obtained when the total angular momentum quantum number $j$ is high, and we demonstrate that given optimal conditions, all detection schemes can achieve the QCRB by utilizing SU(2) coherent states as input states.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Krishna Shende, Matreyee Kandpal, Arvind, Kavita Dorai</p>
            <p>The finite time operation of a quantum Otto heat engine leads to a trade-off between efficiency and output power, which is due to the deviation of the system from the adiabatic path. This trade-off caveat can be bypassed by using the shortcut-to-adiabaticity protocol. We experimentally implemented a quantum Otto heat engine using spin-1/2 nuclei on a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) quantum processor. We investigated its performance using the shortcut-to-adiabaticity technique via counter-adiabatic driving with the inclusion of the cost to perform the shortcut. We use two different metrics that incorporate the cost of shortcut-to-adiabaticity to define engine efficiency and experimentally analyze which one is more appropriate for the NMR platform. We found a significant improvement in the performance of the quantum Otto heat engine driven by shortcut-to-adiabaticity, as compared to the non-adiabatic heat engine.</p>

            <h2>Extensive manipulation of transition rates and substantial population inversion of rotating atoms inside a cavity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yan Peng, Yuebing Zhou, Jiawei Hu, Hongwei Yu</p>
            <p>We investigate the transition rates of a centripetally accelerated atom interacting with electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations inside a high-quality cavity. Our findings reveal that the emission and excitation rates can be extensively manipulated by adjusting the cavity's normal mode frequency and the rotational angular velocity. Using experimentally feasible parameters, we demonstrate that, in one scenario, the excitation rate can reach magnitudes as high as $10^7~{\rm s}^{-1}$, while the emission rate remains negligible, trailing by 9 orders of magnitude. This suggests the potential for substantial population inversion in an ensemble of atoms. In another scenario, both the emission and excitation rates can simultaneously reach magnitudes as high as $10^7~{\rm s}^{-1}$, indicating that millions of transitions per second are expected even for a single atom. These remarkable results not only offer a new method for controlling the radiative properties of atoms but also open avenues for the experimental verification of the circular Unruh effect using cutting-edge quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Critical spectrum of the anisotropic two-photon quantum Rabi model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiong Li, Daniel Braak, Qing-Hu Chen</p>
            <p>The anisotropic two-photon quantum Rabi model is studied using the Bogoliubov operator approach. The doubly degenerate exceptional states are identified through analytical methods. By adjusting the position of the last exceptional point belonging to two adjacent energy levels, we derive a condition for the absence of the discrete spectrum at the critical coupling where ``spectral collapse" occurs. In this special case, the spectrum becomes fully continuous above a threshold energy, with no bound states existing, whereas the ground state remains gapped in the general case. This also signals a quantum phase transition. More interestingly, we rigorously find that a finite number of bound states exist between two anisotropy dependent critical atomic frequencies, with infinitely many bound states beyond this frequency regime. In this manner, all issues in the two-photon quantum Rabi model are resolved.</p>

            <h2>Towards a General Framework for Practical Quantum Network Protocols</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sumeet Khatri</p>
            <p>The quantum internet is one of the frontiers of quantum information science. It will revolutionize the way we communicate and do other tasks, and it will allow for tasks that are not possible using the current, classical internet. The backbone of a quantum internet is entanglement distributed globally in order to allow for such novel applications to be performed over long distances. Experimental progress is currently being made to realize quantum networks on a small scale, but much theoretical work is still needed in order to understand how best to distribute entanglement and to guide the realization of large-scale quantum networks, and eventually the quantum internet, especially with the limitations of near-term quantum technologies. This work provides an initial step towards this goal. The main contribution of this thesis is a mathematical framework for entanglement distribution protocols in a quantum network, which allows for discovering optimal protocols using reinforcement learning. We start with a general development of quantum decision processes, which is the theoretical backdrop of reinforcement learning. Then, we define the general task of entanglement distribution in a quantum network, and we present ground- and satellite-based quantum network architectures that incorporate practical aspects of entanglement distribution. We combine the theory of decision processes and the practical quantum network architectures into an overall entanglement distribution protocol. We also define practical figures of merit to evaluate entanglement distribution protocols, which help to guide experimental implementations.</p>

            <h2>Cavity-QED Simulation of a Maser beyond the Mean-Field Approximation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinpeng Shu, Yining Jiang, Hao Wu, Mark Oxborrow</p>
            <p>We here introduce a method for simulating, quantum mechanically, the dynamics of a maser where the strength of the magnetic field of the microwave mode being amplified by stimulated emission varies over the volume of the maser's spatially extended gain medium. This is very often the case in real systems. Our method generalizes the well-known Tavis-Cummings (T-C) model of cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) to encompass quantum emitters whose coupling strengths to the maser's amplified mode vary over a distribution that can be accurately determined using an electromagnetic-field solver applied to the maser cavity's geometry and composition. We then solve our generalized T-C model to second order in cumulant expansion using publicly available Python-based software. We apply our methodology to a specific, experimentally measured maser based on an optically pumped crystal of pentacene-doped para-terphenyl. We demonstrate that certain distinct quantum-mechanical features exhibited by this maser's dynamics, most notably the observation of Rabi-like flopping associated with the generation of spin-photon Dicke states, can be accurately reproduced using our numerically solved model. The equivalent simpler model, that invokes the mean-field approximation, fails to do so. By constructing then solving for artificial (perfectly Gaussian) distributions, we go on to explore how the performance of this type of maser is affected by the spread in spin-photon coupling strengths. Our methodology thereby enables the maser's anatomy to be more rationally engineered.</p>

            <h2>Nonreciprocal Multipartite Entanglement in a two-cavity magnomechanical system</h2>

            <p>We propose a theoretical scheme for the generation of nonreciprocal multipartite entanglement in a two-mode cavity magnomechanical system, consisting of two cross-microwave (MW) cavities having a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere, which is coupled through magnetic dipole interaction. Our results show that the self-Kerr effect of magnon can significantly enhance multipartite entanglement, which turns out to be nonreciprocal when the magnetic field is tuned along the crystallographic axis [110]. This is due to the frequency shift on the magnons (YIG sphere), which depends on the direction of the magnetic field. Interestingly, the degree of nonreciprocity of bipartite entanglements depends upon a careful optimal choice of system parameters like normalized cavity detunings, bipartite nonlinear index, self-Kerr coefficient, and effective magnomechanical coupling rate G. In addition to bipartite entanglement, we also present the idea of a bidirectional contrast ratio, which quantifies the nonreciprocity in tripartite entanglements.

            <p>This work (1) proposes a novel numerical algorithm to accelerate the search process for good Bivariate Bicycle (BB) codes and (2) defines a new subclass of BB codes suitable for quantum error correction. The proposed acceleration search algorithm reduces the search space by excluding some equivalent codes from the search space, as well as setting thresholds to drop bad codes at an early stage. A number of new BB codes found by this algorithm are reported. The proposed subclass of BB codes employs coprimes to construct groups via polynomials as the basis for the BB code, rather than using the standard BB codes with unconstrained constructors. In contrast to vanilla BB codes, where parameters remain unknown prior to code discovery, the rate of the proposed code can be determined beforehand by specifying a factor polynomial as an input to the numerical search algorithm. Using this coprime BB construction, we found a number of surprisingly short to medium-length codes that were previously unknown.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Filippo Ferrari, Fabrizio Minganti, Camille Aron, Vincenzo Savona</p>
            <p>Thermalization in quantum many-body systems, the process by which they naturally evolve toward thermal equilibrium, typically unfolds over timescales set by the underlying relaxation mechanisms. Yet, the spatial aspect of thermalization in these systems is less understood. We investigate this phenomenon within the nonequilibrium steady state (NESS) of a Bose-Hubbard chain subject at its boundaries to coherent driving and dissipation, a setup inspired by current designs in circuit quantum electrodynamics. We uncover a two-stage thermalization process along the spatial dimension. Close to the coherent drive, the U(1) symmetry of the phase of the photonic field is restored over a short length scale, while its amplitude relaxes over a much larger scale. This opens up an extensive region of the chain where the photon density remains high, and the chaotic dynamics give rise to a hydrodynamic regime, characterized by local equilibria with a large and slowly-varying effective chemical potential. Dynamical fingerprints of chaos in this NESS are probed using semiclassical out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) within the truncated Wigner approximation (TWA). We explore the conditions underlying this protracted thermalization in space and argue that similar prethermal chaotic phases are likely to occur in a broad range of extended driven-dissipative systems.</p>

            <p>We propose a quantum optimal control framework based on the Pontryagin Maximum Principle to design energy- and time-efficient pulses for open quantum systems. By formulating the Langevin equation of a dissipative LC circuit as a linear control problem, we derive optimized pulses with exponential scaling in energy cost, outperforming conventional shortcut-to-adiabaticity methods such as counter-diabatic driving. When applied to a resonator dispersively coupled to a qubit, these optimized pulses achieve an excellent signal-to-noise ratio comparable to longitudinal coupling schemes across varying critical photon numbers. Our results provide a significant step toward efficient control in dissipative open systems and improved qubit readout in circuit quantum electrodynamics.</p>

            <h2>Quantum phase estimation and realistic detection schemes in Mach-Zehnder interferometer using SU(2) coherent states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammed Abdellaoui, Nour-Eddine Abouelkhir, Abdallah Slaoui, Rachid Ahl Laamara</p>
            <p>In quantum parameter estimation, the quantum Cram√©r-Rao bound (QCRB) sets a fundamental limit on the precision achievable with unbiased estimators. It relates the uncertainty in estimating a parameter to the inverse of the quantum Fisher information (QFI). Both QCRB and QFI are valuable tools for analyzing interferometric phase sensitivity. This paper compares the single-parameter and two-parameter QFI for a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) with three detection schemes: single-mode and difference intensity detection, neither has access to an external phase reference and balanced homodyne detection with access to an external phase reference. We use a spin-coherent state associated with the su(2) algebra as the input state in all scenarios and show that all three schemes can achieve the QCRB for the spin-coherent input state. Furthermore, we explore the utilization of SU(2) coherent states in diverse scenarios. Significantly, we find that the best pressure is obtained when the total angular momentum quantum number $j$ is high, and we demonstrate that given optimal conditions, all detection schemes can achieve the QCRB by utilizing SU(2) coherent states as input states.</p>

            <p>The finite time operation of a quantum Otto heat engine leads to a trade-off between efficiency and output power, which is due to the deviation of the system from the adiabatic path. This trade-off caveat can be bypassed by using the shortcut-to-adiabaticity protocol. We experimentally implemented a quantum Otto heat engine using spin-1/2 nuclei on a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) quantum processor. We investigated its performance using the shortcut-to-adiabaticity technique via counter-adiabatic driving with the inclusion of the cost to perform the shortcut. We use two different metrics that incorporate the cost of shortcut-to-adiabaticity to define engine efficiency and experimentally analyze which one is more appropriate for the NMR platform. We found a significant improvement in the performance of the quantum Otto heat engine driven by shortcut-to-adiabaticity, as compared to the non-adiabatic heat engine.</p>

            <p>We investigate the transition rates of a centripetally accelerated atom interacting with electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations inside a high-quality cavity. Our findings reveal that the emission and excitation rates can be extensively manipulated by adjusting the cavity's normal mode frequency and the rotational angular velocity. Using experimentally feasible parameters, we demonstrate that, in one scenario, the excitation rate can reach magnitudes as high as $10^7~{\rm s}^{-1}$, while the emission rate remains negligible, trailing by 9 orders of magnitude. This suggests the potential for substantial population inversion in an ensemble of atoms. In another scenario, both the emission and excitation rates can simultaneously reach magnitudes as high as $10^7~{\rm s}^{-1}$, indicating that millions of transitions per second are expected even for a single atom. These remarkable results not only offer a new method for controlling the radiative properties of atoms but also open avenues for the experimental verification of the circular Unruh effect using cutting-edge quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>The anisotropic two-photon quantum Rabi model is studied using the Bogoliubov operator approach. The doubly degenerate exceptional states are identified through analytical methods. By adjusting the position of the last exceptional point belonging to two adjacent energy levels, we derive a condition for the absence of the discrete spectrum at the critical coupling where ``spectral collapse" occurs.

This also signals a quantum phase transition. More interestingly, we rigorously find that a finite number of bound states exist between two anisotropy dependent critical atomic frequencies, with infinitely many bound states beyond this frequency regime.

            <p>The quantum internet is one of the frontiers of quantum information science. It will revolutionize the way we communicate and do other tasks, and it will allow for tasks that are not possible using the current, classical internet. The backbone of a quantum internet is entanglement distributed globally in order to allow for such novel applications to be performed over long distances. Experimental progress is currently being made to realize quantum networks on a small scale, but much theoretical work is still needed in order to understand how best to distribute entanglement and to guide the realization of large-scale quantum networks, and eventually the quantum internet, especially with the limitations of near-term quantum technologies. This work provides an initial step towards this goal. The main contribution of this thesis is a mathematical framework for entanglement distribution protocols in a quantum network, which allows for discovering optimal protocols using reinforcement learning. We start with a general development of quantum decision processes, which is the theoretical backdrop of reinforcement learning. Then, we define the general task of entanglement distribution in a quantum network, and we present ground- and satellite-based quantum network architectures that incorporate practical aspects of entanglement distribution.

            <p>We here introduce a method for simulating, quantum mechanically, the dynamics of a maser where the strength of the magnetic field of the microwave mode being amplified by stimulated emission varies over the volume of the maser's spatially extended gain medium. This is very often the case in real systems. Our method generalizes the well-known Tavis-Cummings (T-C) model of cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) to encompass quantum emitters whose coupling strengths to the maser's amplified mode vary over a distribution that can be accurately determined using an electromagnetic-field solver applied to the maser cavity's geometry and composition. We then solve our generalized T-C model to second order in cumulant expansion using publicly available Python-based software. We apply our methodology to a specific, experimentally measured maser based on an optically pumped crystal of pentacene-doped para-terphenyl. We demonstrate that certain distinct quantum-mechanical features exhibited by this maser's dynamics, most notably the observation of Rabi-like flopping associated with the generation of spin-photon Dicke states, can be accurately reproduced using our numerically solved model. The equivalent simpler model, that invokes the mean-field approximation, fails to do so. By constructing then solving for artificial (perfectly Gaussian) distributions, we go on to explore how the performance of this type of maser is affected by the spread in spin-photon coupling strengths. Our methodology thereby enables the maser's anatomy to be more rationally engineered.</p>

            <h2>Nonreciprocal Multipartite Entanglement in a two-cavity magnomechanical system</h2>

            <p>We propose a theoretical scheme for the generation of nonreciprocal multipartite entanglement in a two-mode cavity magnomechanical system, consisting of two cross-microwave (MW) cavities having a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere, which is coupled through magnetic dipole interaction. Our results show that the self-Kerr effect of magnon can significantly enhance multipartite entanglement, which turns out to be nonreciprocal when the magnetic field is tuned along the crystallographic axis [110]. This is due to the frequency shift on the magnons (YIG sphere), which depends on the direction of the magnetic field. Interestingly, the degree of nonreciprocity of bipartite entanglements depends upon a careful optimal choice of system parameters like normalized cavity detunings, bipartite nonlinear index, self-Kerr coefficient, and effective magnomechanical coupling rate G. In addition to bipartite entanglement, we also present the idea of a bidirectional contrast ratio, which quantifies the nonreciprocity in tripartite entanglements. Our present theoretical proposal for nonreciprocity in multipartite entanglement may find applications in diverse engineering nonreciprocal devices</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuan-Mei Xie, Yu-Shuo Lu, Yao Fu, Hua-Lei Yin, Zeng-Bing Chen</p>
            <p>Quantum conferencing enables multiple nodes within a quantum network to share a secure group key for private message broadcasting. The key rate, however, is limited by the repeaterless capacity to distribute multiparticle entangled states across the network. Currently, in the finite-size regime, no feasible schemes utilizing existing experimental techniques can overcome the fundamental rate-distance limit of quantum conferencing in quantum networks without repeaters. Here, we propose a practical, multi-field scheme that breaks this limit, involving virtually establishing Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states through post-measurement coincidence matching. This proposal features a measurement-device-independent characteristic and can directly scale to support any number of users. Simulations show that the fundamental limitation on the group key rate can be overcome in a reasonable running time of sending $10^{14}$ pulses. We predict that it offers an efficient design for long-distance broadcast communication in future quantum networks.</p>

            <p>This work (1) proposes a novel numerical algorithm to accelerate the search process for good Bivariate Bicycle (BB) codes and (2) defines a new subclass of BB codes suitable for quantum error correction. The proposed acceleration search algorithm reduces the search space by excluding some equivalent codes from the search space, as well as setting thresholds to drop bad codes at an early stage. A number of new BB codes found by this algorithm are reported. The proposed subclass of BB codes employs coprimes to construct groups via polynomials as the basis for the BB code, rather than using the standard BB codes with unconstrained constructors. In contrast to vanilla BB codes, where parameters remain unknown prior to code discovery, the rate of the proposed code can be determined beforehand by specifying a factor polynomial as an input to the numerical search algorithm. Using this coprime BB construction, we found a number of surprisingly short to medium-length codes that were previously unknown.</p>

            <h2>Chaos and spatial prethermalization in driven-dissipative bosonic chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Filippo Ferrari, Fabrizio Minganti, Camille Aron, Vincenzo Savona</p>
            <p>Thermalization in quantum many-body systems, the process by which they naturally evolve toward thermal equilibrium, typically unfolds over timescales set by the underlying relaxation mechanisms. Yet, the spatial aspect of thermalization in these systems is less understood. We investigate this phenomenon within the nonequilibrium steady state (NESS) of a Bose-Hubbard chain subject at its boundaries to coherent driving and dissipation, a setup inspired by current designs in circuit quantum electrodynamics. We uncover a two-stage thermalization process along the spatial dimension. Close to the coherent drive, the U(1) symmetry of the phase of the photonic field is restored over a short length scale, while its amplitude relaxes over a much larger scale. This opens up an extensive region of the chain where the photon density remains high, and the chaotic dynamics give rise to a hydrodynamic regime, characterized by local equilibria with a large and slowly-varying effective chemical potential. Dynamical fingerprints of chaos in this NESS are probed using semiclassical out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) within the truncated Wigner approximation (TWA). We explore the conditions underlying this protracted thermalization in space and argue that similar prethermal chaotic phases are likely to occur in a broad range of extended driven-dissipative systems.</p>

            <h2>Effective field theory of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vinay Patil, Rafael Flores-Calder√≥n, Ashley M. Cook</p>
            <p>Motivated by phenomenology of myriad recently-identified topologically non-trivial phases of matter, we introduce effective field theories (EFTs) for the quantum skyrmion Hall effect (QSkHE). We employ a single, unifying generalisation for this purpose: in essence, a lowest Landau level projection defining a non-commutative, fuzzy sphere with position coordinates proportional to SU(2) generators of matrix representation size $N\times N$, may host an intrinsically 2+1 dimensional, topologically non-trivial many-body state for small $N$ as well as large $N$. That is, isospin degrees of freedom associated with a matrix Lie algebra with $N \times N$ generators potentially encode some finite number of spatial dimensions for $N\ge 2$, a regime in which isospin has previously been treated as a label. This statement extends to more general $p$-branes subjected to severe fuzzification as well as membranes. As a consequence of this generalisation, systems with $d$ Cartesian spatial coordinates and isospin degrees of freedom encoding an additional $\delta$ fuzzy coset space coordinates can realise topologically non-trivial states of intrinsic dimensionality up to $d$+$\delta$+1. We therefore identify gauge theories with extra fuzzy dimensions generalised to retain dependence upon gauge fields over fuzzy coset spaces even for severe fuzzification (small $N$), as EFTs for the QSkHE. We furthermore generalise these EFTs to space manifolds with local product structure exploiting the dimensional hierarchy of (fuzzy) spheres. For this purpose, we introduce methods of anisotropic fuzzification and propose formulating topological invariants on fuzzy coset spaces as artifacts of projecting matrix Lie algebras to occupied subspaces. Importantly, we focus on phenomenology indicating the 2+1 D SU(2) gauge theory should be generalised using this machinery, and serves as a minimal EFT of the QSkHE.</p>

            <p>Given recent discovery of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect, we re-examine the related canonical Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ) model for the quantum spin Hall insulator. Within the framework of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect, isospin degree(s) of freedom of the BHZ model encode additional spatial dimensions. Consistent with this framework, we observe phenomena similar to those of the four dimensional Chern insulator, revealed by weakly breaking time-reversal symmetry. Bulk-boundary correspondence of these states includes real-space boundary orbital angular momentum textures and gapless boundary modes that are robust against magnetic disorder, consistent with compactified three dimensional boundary Weyl nodes (WN$_F$s) of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect. These theoretical findings are furthermore consistent with past experimental work reporting unexpected edge conduction in HgTe quantum wells under applied Zeeman and orbital magnetic fields. This past work is therefore potentially the first known experimental observation of signatures of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect beyond the quantum Hall effect.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ming-Yue Liu, Yuan Gong, Jiaojiao Chen, Yan-Wei Wang, Wei Xiong</p>
            <p>Microwave-optical entanglement is essential for efficient quantum communication, secure information transfer, and integrating microwave and optical quantum systems to advance hybrid quantum technologies. In this work, we demonstrate how the magnon Kerr effect can be harnessed to generate and control nonreciprocal entanglement in cavity optomagnomechanics (COMM). This effect induces magnon frequency shifts and introduces pair-magnon interactions, both of which are tunable through the magnetic field direction, enabling nonreciprocal behavior. By adjusting system parameters such as magnon frequency detuning, we show that magnon-phonon, microwave-optical photon-photon, and optical photon-magnon entanglement can be nonreciprocally enhanced and rendered more robust against thermal noise. Additionally, the nonreciprocity of entanglement can be selectively controlled, and ideal nonreciprocal entanglement is achievable. This work paves the way for designing nonreciprocal quantum devices across the microwave and optical regimes, leveraging the unique properties of the magnon Kerr effect in COMM.</p>

            <p>Silicon carbide (SiC) has attracted significant attention as a promising quantum material due to its ability to host long-lived, optically addressable color centers with solid-state photonic interfaces. The CMOS compatibility of 4H-SiCOI (silicon-carbide-on-insulator) makes it an ideal platform for integrated quantum photonic devices and circuits. While micro-ring cavities have been extensively studied in SiC and other materials, the integration of 4H-SiC spin defects into these critical structures, along with continuous mode tunability, remains unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate the integration of PL4 divacancy spin defects into tunable micro-ring cavities in scalable thin-film 4H-SiC nanophotonics. Comparing on- and off-resonance conditions, we observed an enhancement of the Purcell factor by approximately 5.0. This enhancement effectively confined coherent photons within the coupled waveguide, leading to a twofold increase in the ODMR (optically detected magnetic resonance) contrast and coherent control of PL4 spins. These advancements lay the foundation for developing SiC-based quantum photonic circuits.</p>

In addition to bipartite entanglement, we also present the idea of a bidirectional contrast ratio, which quantifies the nonreciprocity in tripartite entanglements. Our present theoretical proposal for nonreciprocity in multipartite entanglement may find applications in diverse engineering nonreciprocal devices</p>

            <h2>Multi-field quantum conferencing overcomes the network capacity limit</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuan-Mei Xie, Yu-Shuo Lu, Yao Fu, Hua-Lei Yin, Zeng-Bing Chen</p>
            <p>Quantum conferencing enables multiple nodes within a quantum network to share a secure group key for private message broadcasting. The key rate, however, is limited by the repeaterless capacity to distribute multiparticle entangled states across the network. Currently, in the finite-size regime, no feasible schemes utilizing existing experimental techniques can overcome the fundamental rate-distance limit of quantum conferencing in quantum networks without repeaters. Here, we propose a practical, multi-field scheme that breaks this limit, involving virtually establishing Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states through post-measurement coincidence matching. This proposal features a measurement-device-independent characteristic and can directly scale to support any number of users. Simulations show that the fundamental limitation on the group key rate can be overcome in a reasonable running time of sending $10^{14}$ pulses. We predict that it offers an efficient design for long-distance broadcast communication in future quantum networks.</p>

            <p>This work (1) proposes a novel numerical algorithm to accelerate the search process for good Bivariate Bicycle (BB) codes and (2) defines a new subclass of BB codes suitable for quantum error correction. The proposed acceleration search algorithm reduces the search space by excluding some equivalent codes from the search space, as well as setting thresholds to drop bad codes at an early stage. A number of new BB codes found by this algorithm are reported. The proposed subclass of BB codes employs coprimes to construct groups via polynomials as the basis for the BB code, rather than using the standard BB codes with unconstrained constructors. In contrast to vanilla BB codes, where parameters remain unknown prior to code discovery, the rate of the proposed code can be determined beforehand by specifying a factor polynomial as an input to the numerical search algorithm. Using this coprime BB construction, we found a number of surprisingly short to medium-length codes that were previously unknown.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Filippo Ferrari, Fabrizio Minganti, Camille Aron, Vincenzo Savona</p>
            <p>Thermalization in quantum many-body systems, the process by which they naturally evolve toward thermal equilibrium, typically unfolds over timescales set by the underlying relaxation mechanisms. Yet, the spatial aspect of thermalization in these systems is less understood. We investigate this phenomenon within the nonequilibrium steady state (NESS) of a Bose-Hubbard chain subject at its boundaries to coherent driving and dissipation, a setup inspired by current designs in circuit quantum electrodynamics. We uncover a two-stage thermalization process along the spatial dimension. Close to the coherent drive, the U(1) symmetry of the phase of the photonic field is restored over a short length scale, while its amplitude relaxes over a much larger scale. This opens up an extensive region of the chain where the photon density remains high, and the chaotic dynamics give rise to a hydrodynamic regime, characterized by local equilibria with a large and slowly-varying effective chemical potential. Dynamical fingerprints of chaos in this NESS are probed using semiclassical out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) within the truncated Wigner approximation (TWA). We explore the conditions underlying this protracted thermalization in space and argue that similar prethermal chaotic phases are likely to occur in a broad range of extended driven-dissipative systems.</p>

            <p>Motivated by phenomenology of myriad recently-identified topologically non-trivial phases of matter, we introduce effective field theories (EFTs) for the quantum skyrmion Hall effect (QSkHE). We employ a single, unifying generalisation for this purpose: in essence, a lowest Landau level projection defining a non-commutative, fuzzy sphere with position coordinates proportional to SU(2) generators of matrix representation size $N\times N$, may host an intrinsically 2+1 dimensional, topologically non-trivial many-body state for small $N$ as well as large $N$. That is, isospin degrees of freedom associated with a matrix Lie algebra with $N \times N$ generators potentially encode some finite number of spatial dimensions for $N\ge 2$, a regime in which isospin has previously been treated as a label. This statement extends to more general $p$-branes subjected to severe fuzzification as well as membranes. As a consequence of this generalisation, systems with $d$ Cartesian spatial coordinates and isospin degrees of freedom encoding an additional $\delta$ fuzzy coset space coordinates can realise topologically non-trivial states of intrinsic dimensionality up to $d$+$\delta$+1. We therefore identify gauge theories with extra fuzzy dimensions generalised to retain dependence upon gauge fields over fuzzy coset spaces even for severe fuzzification (small $N$), as EFTs for the QSkHE. We furthermore generalise these EFTs to space manifolds with local product structure exploiting the dimensional hierarchy of (fuzzy) spheres. For this purpose, we introduce methods of anisotropic fuzzification and propose formulating topological invariants on fuzzy coset spaces as artifacts of projecting matrix Lie algebras to occupied subspaces. Importantly, we focus on phenomenology indicating the 2+1 D SU(2) gauge theory should be generalised using this machinery, and serves as a minimal EFT of the QSkHE.</p>

These theoretical findings are furthermore consistent with past experimental work reporting unexpected edge conduction in HgTe quantum wells under applied Zeeman and orbital magnetic fields. This past work is therefore potentially the first known experimental observation of signatures of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect beyond the quantum Hall effect.</p>

            <p>Microwave-optical entanglement is essential for efficient quantum communication, secure information transfer, and integrating microwave and optical quantum systems to advance hybrid quantum technologies. In this work, we demonstrate how the magnon Kerr effect can be harnessed to generate and control nonreciprocal entanglement in cavity optomagnomechanics (COMM). This effect induces magnon frequency shifts and introduces pair-magnon interactions, both of which are tunable through the magnetic field direction, enabling nonreciprocal behavior. By adjusting system parameters such as magnon frequency detuning, we show that magnon-phonon, microwave-optical photon-photon, and optical photon-magnon entanglement can be nonreciprocally enhanced and rendered more robust against thermal noise. Additionally, the nonreciprocity of entanglement can be selectively controlled, and ideal nonreciprocal entanglement is achievable. This work paves the way for designing nonreciprocal quantum devices across the microwave and optical regimes, leveraging the unique properties of the magnon Kerr effect in COMM.</p>

            <p>Silicon carbide (SiC) has attracted significant attention as a promising quantum material due to its ability to host long-lived, optically addressable color centers with solid-state photonic interfaces. The CMOS compatibility of 4H-SiCOI (silicon-carbide-on-insulator) makes it an ideal platform for integrated quantum photonic devices and circuits. While micro-ring cavities have been extensively studied in SiC and other materials, the integration of 4H-SiC spin defects into these critical structures, along with continuous mode tunability, remains unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate the integration of PL4 divacancy spin defects into tunable micro-ring cavities in scalable thin-film 4H-SiC nanophotonics. Comparing on- and off-resonance conditions, we observed an enhancement of the Purcell factor by approximately 5.0. This enhancement effectively confined coherent photons within the coupled waveguide, leading to a twofold increase in the ODMR (optically detected magnetic resonance) contrast and coherent control of PL4 spins. These advancements lay the foundation for developing SiC-based quantum photonic circuits.</p>

            <p>We propose a quantum optimal control framework based on the Pontryagin Maximum Principle to design energy- and time-efficient pulses for open quantum systems. By formulating the Langevin equation of a dissipative LC circuit as a linear control problem, we derive optimized pulses with exponential scaling in energy cost, outperforming conventional shortcut-to-adiabaticity methods such as counter-diabatic driving. When applied to a resonator dispersively coupled to a qubit, these optimized pulses achieve an excellent signal-to-noise ratio comparable to longitudinal coupling schemes across varying critical photon numbers. Our results provide a significant step toward efficient control in dissipative open systems and improved qubit readout in circuit quantum electrodynamics.</p>

            <h2>Quantum phase estimation and realistic detection schemes in Mach-Zehnder interferometer using SU(2) coherent states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammed Abdellaoui, Nour-Eddine Abouelkhir, Abdallah Slaoui, Rachid Ahl Laamara</p>
            <p>In quantum parameter estimation, the quantum Cram√©r-Rao bound (QCRB) sets a fundamental limit on the precision achievable with unbiased estimators. It relates the uncertainty in estimating a parameter to the inverse of the quantum Fisher information (QFI). Both QCRB and QFI are valuable tools for analyzing interferometric phase sensitivity. This paper compares the single-parameter and two-parameter QFI for a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) with three detection schemes: single-mode and difference intensity detection, neither has access to an external phase reference and balanced homodyne detection with access to an external phase reference. We use a spin-coherent state associated with the su(2) algebra as the input state in all scenarios and show that all three schemes can achieve the QCRB for the spin-coherent input state. Furthermore, we explore the utilization of SU(2) coherent states in diverse scenarios. Significantly, we find that the best pressure is obtained when the total angular momentum quantum number $j$ is high, and we demonstrate that given optimal conditions, all detection schemes can achieve the QCRB by utilizing SU(2) coherent states as input states.</p>

            <p>The finite time operation of a quantum Otto heat engine leads to a trade-off between efficiency and output power, which is due to the deviation of the system from the adiabatic path. This trade-off caveat can be bypassed by using the shortcut-to-adiabaticity protocol. We experimentally implemented a quantum Otto heat engine using spin-1/2 nuclei on a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) quantum processor. We investigated its performance using the shortcut-to-adiabaticity technique via counter-adiabatic driving with the inclusion of the cost to perform the shortcut. We use two different metrics that incorporate the cost of shortcut-to-adiabaticity to define engine efficiency and experimentally analyze which one is more appropriate for the NMR platform. We found a significant improvement in the performance of the quantum Otto heat engine driven by shortcut-to-adiabaticity, as compared to the non-adiabatic heat engine.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yan Peng, Yuebing Zhou, Jiawei Hu, Hongwei Yu</p>
            <p>We investigate the transition rates of a centripetally accelerated atom interacting with electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations inside a high-quality cavity. Our findings reveal that the emission and excitation rates can be extensively manipulated by adjusting the cavity's normal mode frequency and the rotational angular velocity. Using experimentally feasible parameters, we demonstrate that, in one scenario, the excitation rate can reach magnitudes as high as $10^7~{\rm s}^{-1}$, while the emission rate remains negligible, trailing by 9 orders of magnitude. This suggests the potential for substantial population inversion in an ensemble of atoms. In another scenario, both the emission and excitation rates can simultaneously reach magnitudes as high as $10^7~{\rm s}^{-1}$, indicating that millions of transitions per second are expected even for a single atom. These remarkable results not only offer a new method for controlling the radiative properties of atoms but also open avenues for the experimental verification of the circular Unruh effect using cutting-edge quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Critical spectrum of the anisotropic two-photon quantum Rabi model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiong Li, Daniel Braak, Qing-Hu Chen</p>
            <p>The anisotropic two-photon quantum Rabi model is studied using the Bogoliubov operator approach. The doubly degenerate exceptional states are identified through analytical methods. By adjusting the position of the last exceptional point belonging to two adjacent energy levels, we derive a condition for the absence of the discrete spectrum at the critical coupling where ``spectral collapse" occurs. In this special case, the spectrum becomes fully continuous above a threshold energy, with no bound states existing, whereas the ground state remains gapped in the general case. This also signals a quantum phase transition. More interestingly, we rigorously find that a finite number of bound states exist between two anisotropy dependent critical atomic frequencies, with infinitely many bound states beyond this frequency regime. In this manner, all issues in the two-photon quantum Rabi model are resolved.</p>

            <h2>Towards a General Framework for Practical Quantum Network Protocols</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sumeet Khatri</p>
            <p>The quantum internet is one of the frontiers of quantum information science. It will revolutionize the way we communicate and do other tasks, and it will allow for tasks that are not possible using the current, classical internet. The backbone of a quantum internet is entanglement distributed globally in order to allow for such novel applications to be performed over long distances. Experimental progress is currently being made to realize quantum networks on a small scale, but much theoretical work is still needed in order to understand how best to distribute entanglement and to guide the realization of large-scale quantum networks, and eventually the quantum internet, especially with the limitations of near-term quantum technologies. This work provides an initial step towards this goal. The main contribution of this thesis is a mathematical framework for entanglement distribution protocols in a quantum network, which allows for discovering optimal protocols using reinforcement learning. We start with a general development of quantum decision processes, which is the theoretical backdrop of reinforcement learning. Then, we define the general task of entanglement distribution in a quantum network, and we present ground- and satellite-based quantum network architectures that incorporate practical aspects of entanglement distribution. We combine the theory of decision processes and the practical quantum network architectures into an overall entanglement distribution protocol. We also define practical figures of merit to evaluate entanglement distribution protocols, which help to guide experimental implementations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinpeng Shu, Yining Jiang, Hao Wu, Mark Oxborrow</p>
            <p>We here introduce a method for simulating, quantum mechanically, the dynamics of a maser where the strength of the magnetic field of the microwave mode being amplified by stimulated emission varies over the volume of the maser's spatially extended gain medium. This is very often the case in real systems. Our method generalizes the well-known Tavis-Cummings (T-C) model of cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) to encompass quantum emitters whose coupling strengths to the maser's amplified mode vary over a distribution that can be accurately determined using an electromagnetic-field solver applied to the maser cavity's geometry and composition. We then solve our generalized T-C model to second order in cumulant expansion using publicly available Python-based software. We apply our methodology to a specific, experimentally measured maser based on an optically pumped crystal of pentacene-doped para-terphenyl. We demonstrate that certain distinct quantum-mechanical features exhibited by this maser's dynamics, most notably the observation of Rabi-like flopping associated with the generation of spin-photon Dicke states, can be accurately reproduced using our numerically solved model. The equivalent simpler model, that invokes the mean-field approximation, fails to do so. By constructing then solving for artificial (perfectly Gaussian) distributions, we go on to explore how the performance of this type of maser is affected by the spread in spin-photon coupling strengths. Our methodology thereby enables the maser's anatomy to be more rationally engineered.</p>

            <p>We propose a theoretical scheme for the generation of nonreciprocal multipartite entanglement in a two-mode cavity magnomechanical system, consisting of two cross-microwave (MW) cavities having a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere, which is coupled through magnetic dipole interaction. Our results show that the self-Kerr effect of magnon can significantly enhance multipartite entanglement, which turns out to be nonreciprocal when the magnetic field is tuned along the crystallographic axis [110]. This is due to the frequency shift on the magnons (YIG sphere), which depends on the direction of the magnetic field. Interestingly, the degree of nonreciprocity of bipartite entanglements depends upon a careful optimal choice of system parameters like normalized cavity detunings, bipartite nonlinear index, self-Kerr coefficient, and effective magnomechanical coupling rate G. In addition to bipartite entanglement, we also present the idea of a bidirectional contrast ratio, which quantifies the nonreciprocity in tripartite entanglements.

In this work, we demonstrate the integration of PL4 divacancy spin defects into tunable micro-ring cavities in scalable thin-film 4H-SiC nanophotonics. Comparing on- and off-resonance conditions, we observed an enhancement of the Purcell factor by approximately 5.0. This enhancement effectively confined coherent photons within the coupled waveguide, leading to a twofold increase in the ODMR (optically detected magnetic resonance) contrast and coherent control of PL4 spins. These advancements lay the foundation for developing SiC-based quantum photonic circuits.</p>

            <p>We propose a quantum optimal control framework based on the Pontryagin Maximum Principle to design energy- and time-efficient pulses for open quantum systems. By formulating the Langevin equation of a dissipative LC circuit as a linear control problem, we derive optimized pulses with exponential scaling in energy cost, outperforming conventional shortcut-to-adiabaticity methods such as counter-diabatic driving. When applied to a resonator dispersively coupled to a qubit, these optimized pulses achieve an excellent signal-to-noise ratio comparable to longitudinal coupling schemes across varying critical photon numbers. Our results provide a significant step toward efficient control in dissipative open systems and improved qubit readout in circuit quantum electrodynamics.</p>

            <p>The finite time operation of a quantum Otto heat engine leads to a trade-off between efficiency and output power, which is due to the deviation of the system from the adiabatic path. This trade-off caveat can be bypassed by using the shortcut-to-adiabaticity protocol. We experimentally implemented a quantum Otto heat engine using spin-1/2 nuclei on a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) quantum processor. We investigated its performance using the shortcut-to-adiabaticity technique via counter-adiabatic driving with the inclusion of the cost to perform the shortcut. We use two different metrics that incorporate the cost of shortcut-to-adiabaticity to define engine efficiency and experimentally analyze which one is more appropriate for the NMR platform. We found a significant improvement in the performance of the quantum Otto heat engine driven by shortcut-to-adiabaticity, as compared to the non-adiabatic heat engine.</p>

            <p>We investigate the transition rates of a centripetally accelerated atom interacting with electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations inside a high-quality cavity. Our findings reveal that the emission and excitation rates can be extensively manipulated by adjusting the cavity's normal mode frequency and the rotational angular velocity. Using experimentally feasible parameters, we demonstrate that, in one scenario, the excitation rate can reach magnitudes as high as $10^7~{\rm s}^{-1}$, while the emission rate remains negligible, trailing by 9 orders of magnitude. This suggests the potential for substantial population inversion in an ensemble of atoms. In another scenario, both the emission and excitation rates can simultaneously reach magnitudes as high as $10^7~{\rm s}^{-1}$, indicating that millions of transitions per second are expected even for a single atom. These remarkable results not only offer a new method for controlling the radiative properties of atoms but also open avenues for the experimental verification of the circular Unruh effect using cutting-edge quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>The anisotropic two-photon quantum Rabi model is studied using the Bogoliubov operator approach. The doubly degenerate exceptional states are identified through analytical methods. By adjusting the position of the last exceptional point belonging to two adjacent energy levels, we derive a condition for the absence of the discrete spectrum at the critical coupling where ``spectral collapse" occurs. In this special case, the spectrum becomes fully continuous above a threshold energy, with no bound states existing, whereas the ground state remains gapped in the general case. This also signals a quantum phase transition. More interestingly, we rigorously find that a finite number of bound states exist between two anisotropy dependent critical atomic frequencies, with infinitely many bound states beyond this frequency regime. In this manner, all issues in the two-photon quantum Rabi model are resolved.</p>

            <p>The quantum internet is one of the frontiers of quantum information science. It will revolutionize the way we communicate and do other tasks, and it will allow for tasks that are not possible using the current, classical internet. The backbone of a quantum internet is entanglement distributed globally in order to allow for such novel applications to be performed over long distances. Experimental progress is currently being made to realize quantum networks on a small scale, but much theoretical work is still needed in order to understand how best to distribute entanglement and to guide the realization of large-scale quantum networks, and eventually the quantum internet, especially with the limitations of near-term quantum technologies. This work provides an initial step towards this goal. The main contribution of this thesis is a mathematical framework for entanglement distribution protocols in a quantum network, which allows for discovering optimal protocols using reinforcement learning. We start with a general development of quantum decision processes, which is the theoretical backdrop of reinforcement learning. Then, we define the general task of entanglement distribution in a quantum network, and we present ground- and satellite-based quantum network architectures that incorporate practical aspects of entanglement distribution. We combine the theory of decision processes and the practical quantum network architectures into an overall entanglement distribution protocol. We also define practical figures of merit to evaluate entanglement distribution protocols, which help to guide experimental implementations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinpeng Shu, Yining Jiang, Hao Wu, Mark Oxborrow</p>
            <p>We here introduce a method for simulating, quantum mechanically, the dynamics of a maser where the strength of the magnetic field of the microwave mode being amplified by stimulated emission varies over the volume of the maser's spatially extended gain medium. This is very often the case in real systems. Our method generalizes the well-known Tavis-Cummings (T-C) model of cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) to encompass quantum emitters whose coupling strengths to the maser's amplified mode vary over a distribution that can be accurately determined using an electromagnetic-field solver applied to the maser cavity's geometry and composition. We then solve our generalized T-C model to second order in cumulant expansion using publicly available Python-based software. We apply our methodology to a specific, experimentally measured maser based on an optically pumped crystal of pentacene-doped para-terphenyl. We demonstrate that certain distinct quantum-mechanical features exhibited by this maser's dynamics, most notably the observation of Rabi-like flopping associated with the generation of spin-photon Dicke states, can be accurately reproduced using our numerically solved model. The equivalent simpler model, that invokes the mean-field approximation, fails to do so. By constructing then solving for artificial (perfectly Gaussian) distributions, we go on to explore how the performance of this type of maser is affected by the spread in spin-photon coupling strengths. Our methodology thereby enables the maser's anatomy to be more rationally engineered.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuan-Mei Xie, Yu-Shuo Lu, Yao Fu, Hua-Lei Yin, Zeng-Bing Chen</p>
            <p>Quantum conferencing enables multiple nodes within a quantum network to share a secure group key for private message broadcasting. The key rate, however, is limited by the repeaterless capacity to distribute multiparticle entangled states across the network. Currently, in the finite-size regime, no feasible schemes utilizing existing experimental techniques can overcome the fundamental rate-distance limit of quantum conferencing in quantum networks without repeaters. Here, we propose a practical, multi-field scheme that breaks this limit, involving virtually establishing Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states through post-measurement coincidence matching. This proposal features a measurement-device-independent characteristic and can directly scale to support any number of users. Simulations show that the fundamental limitation on the group key rate can be overcome in a reasonable running time of sending $10^{14}$ pulses. We predict that it offers an efficient design for long-distance broadcast communication in future quantum networks.</p>

            <p>This work (1) proposes a novel numerical algorithm to accelerate the search process for good Bivariate Bicycle (BB) codes and (2) defines a new subclass of BB codes suitable for quantum error correction. The proposed acceleration search algorithm reduces the search space by excluding some equivalent codes from the search space, as well as setting thresholds to drop bad codes at an early stage. A number of new BB codes found by this algorithm are reported. The proposed subclass of BB codes employs coprimes to construct groups via polynomials as the basis for the BB code, rather than using the standard BB codes with unconstrained constructors. In contrast to vanilla BB codes, where parameters remain unknown prior to code discovery, the rate of the proposed code can be determined beforehand by specifying a factor polynomial as an input to the numerical search algorithm. Using this coprime BB construction, we found a number of surprisingly short to medium-length codes that were previously unknown.</p>

            <p>Given recent discovery of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect, we re-examine the related canonical Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ) model for the quantum spin Hall insulator. Within the framework of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect, isospin degree(s) of freedom of the BHZ model encode additional spatial dimensions. Consistent with this framework, we observe phenomena similar to those of the four dimensional Chern insulator, revealed by weakly breaking time-reversal symmetry. Bulk-boundary correspondence of these states includes real-space boundary orbital angular momentum textures and gapless boundary modes that are robust against magnetic disorder, consistent with compactified three dimensional boundary Weyl nodes (WN$_F$s) of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect. These theoretical findings are furthermore consistent with past experimental work reporting unexpected edge conduction in HgTe quantum wells under applied Zeeman and orbital magnetic fields. This past work is therefore potentially the first known experimental observation of signatures of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect beyond the quantum Hall effect.</p>

            <p>Microwave-optical entanglement is essential for efficient quantum communication, secure information transfer, and integrating microwave and optical quantum systems to advance hybrid quantum technologies. In this work, we demonstrate how the magnon Kerr effect can be harnessed to generate and control nonreciprocal entanglement in cavity optomagnomechanics (COMM). This effect induces magnon frequency shifts and introduces pair-magnon interactions, both of which are tunable through the magnetic field direction, enabling nonreciprocal behavior. By adjusting system parameters such as magnon frequency detuning, we show that magnon-phonon, microwave-optical photon-photon, and optical photon-magnon entanglement can be nonreciprocally enhanced and rendered more robust against thermal noise. Additionally, the nonreciprocity of entanglement can be selectively controlled, and ideal nonreciprocal entanglement is achievable. This work paves the way for designing nonreciprocal quantum devices across the microwave and optical regimes, leveraging the unique properties of the magnon Kerr effect in COMM.</p>

We investigated its performance using the shortcut-to-adiabaticity technique via counter-adiabatic driving with the inclusion of the cost to perform the shortcut. We use two different metrics that incorporate the cost of shortcut-to-adiabaticity to define engine efficiency and experimentally analyze which one is more appropriate for the NMR platform. We found a significant improvement in the performance of the quantum Otto heat engine driven by shortcut-to-adiabaticity, as compared to the non-adiabatic heat engine.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yan Peng, Yuebing Zhou, Jiawei Hu, Hongwei Yu</p>
            <p>We investigate the transition rates of a centripetally accelerated atom interacting with electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations inside a high-quality cavity. Our findings reveal that the emission and excitation rates can be extensively manipulated by adjusting the cavity's normal mode frequency and the rotational angular velocity. Using experimentally feasible parameters, we demonstrate that, in one scenario, the excitation rate can reach magnitudes as high as $10^7~{\rm s}^{-1}$, while the emission rate remains negligible, trailing by 9 orders of magnitude. This suggests the potential for substantial population inversion in an ensemble of atoms. In another scenario, both the emission and excitation rates can simultaneously reach magnitudes as high as $10^7~{\rm s}^{-1}$, indicating that millions of transitions per second are expected even for a single atom. These remarkable results not only offer a new method for controlling the radiative properties of atoms but also open avenues for the experimental verification of the circular Unruh effect using cutting-edge quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>The anisotropic two-photon quantum Rabi model is studied using the Bogoliubov operator approach. The doubly degenerate exceptional states are identified through analytical methods. By adjusting the position of the last exceptional point belonging to two adjacent energy levels, we derive a condition for the absence of the discrete spectrum at the critical coupling where ``spectral collapse" occurs. In this special case, the spectrum becomes fully continuous above a threshold energy, with no bound states existing, whereas the ground state remains gapped in the general case. This also signals a quantum phase transition. More interestingly, we rigorously find that a finite number of bound states exist between two anisotropy dependent critical atomic frequencies, with infinitely many bound states beyond this frequency regime. In this manner, all issues in the two-photon quantum Rabi model are resolved.</p>

            <p>The quantum internet is one of the frontiers of quantum information science. It will revolutionize the way we communicate and do other tasks, and it will allow for tasks that are not possible using the current, classical internet. The backbone of a quantum internet is entanglement distributed globally in order to allow for such novel applications to be performed over long distances. Experimental progress is currently being made to realize quantum networks on a small scale, but much theoretical work is still needed in order to understand how best to distribute entanglement and to guide the realization of large-scale quantum networks, and eventually the quantum internet, especially with the limitations of near-term quantum technologies. This work provides an initial step towards this goal. The main contribution of this thesis is a mathematical framework for entanglement distribution protocols in a quantum network, which allows for discovering optimal protocols using reinforcement learning. We start with a general development of quantum decision processes, which is the theoretical backdrop of reinforcement learning. Then, we define the general task of entanglement distribution in a quantum network, and we present ground- and satellite-based quantum network architectures that incorporate practical aspects of entanglement distribution. We combine the theory of decision processes and the practical quantum network architectures into an overall entanglement distribution protocol. We also define practical figures of merit to evaluate entanglement distribution protocols, which help to guide experimental implementations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinpeng Shu, Yining Jiang, Hao Wu, Mark Oxborrow</p>
            <p>We here introduce a method for simulating, quantum mechanically, the dynamics of a maser where the strength of the magnetic field of the microwave mode being amplified by stimulated emission varies over the volume of the maser's spatially extended gain medium. This is very often the case in real systems. Our method generalizes the well-known Tavis-Cummings (T-C) model of cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) to encompass quantum emitters whose coupling strengths to the maser's amplified mode vary over a distribution that can be accurately determined using an electromagnetic-field solver applied to the maser cavity's geometry and composition. We then solve our generalized T-C model to second order in cumulant expansion using publicly available Python-based software. We apply our methodology to a specific, experimentally measured maser based on an optically pumped crystal of pentacene-doped para-terphenyl. We demonstrate that certain distinct quantum-mechanical features exhibited by this maser's dynamics, most notably the observation of Rabi-like flopping associated with the generation of spin-photon Dicke states, can be accurately reproduced using our numerically solved model. The equivalent simpler model, that invokes the mean-field approximation, fails to do so. By constructing then solving for artificial (perfectly Gaussian) distributions, we go on to explore how the performance of this type of maser is affected by the spread in spin-photon coupling strengths. Our methodology thereby enables the maser's anatomy to be more rationally engineered.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuan-Mei Xie, Yu-Shuo Lu, Yao Fu, Hua-Lei Yin, Zeng-Bing Chen</p>
            <p>Quantum conferencing enables multiple nodes within a quantum network to share a secure group key for private message broadcasting. The key rate, however, is limited by the repeaterless capacity to distribute multiparticle entangled states across the network. Currently, in the finite-size regime, no feasible schemes utilizing existing experimental techniques can overcome the fundamental rate-distance limit of quantum conferencing in quantum networks without repeaters. Here, we propose a practical, multi-field scheme that breaks this limit, involving virtually establishing Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states through post-measurement coincidence matching. This proposal features a measurement-device-independent characteristic and can directly scale to support any number of users. Simulations show that the fundamental limitation on the group key rate can be overcome in a reasonable running time of sending $10^{14}$ pulses. We predict that it offers an efficient design for long-distance broadcast communication in future quantum networks.</p>

The proposed acceleration search algorithm reduces the search space by excluding some equivalent codes from the search space, as well as setting thresholds to drop bad codes at an early stage.

The proposed subclass of BB codes employs coprimes to construct groups via polynomials as the basis for the BB code, rather than using the standard BB codes with unconstrained constructors. In contrast to vanilla BB codes, where parameters remain unknown prior to code discovery, the rate of the proposed code can be determined beforehand by specifying a factor polynomial as an input to the numerical search algorithm. Using this coprime BB construction, we found a number of surprisingly short to medium-length codes that were previously unknown.</p>

            <p>Given recent discovery of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect, we re-examine the related canonical Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ) model for the quantum spin Hall insulator. Within the framework of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect, isospin degree(s) of freedom of the BHZ model encode additional spatial dimensions. Consistent with this framework, we observe phenomena similar to those of the four dimensional Chern insulator, revealed by weakly breaking time-reversal symmetry. Bulk-boundary correspondence of these states includes real-space boundary orbital angular momentum textures and gapless boundary modes that are robust against magnetic disorder, consistent with compactified three dimensional boundary Weyl nodes (WN$_F$s) of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect. These theoretical findings are furthermore consistent with past experimental work reporting unexpected edge conduction in HgTe quantum wells under applied Zeeman and orbital magnetic fields. This past work is therefore potentially the first known experimental observation of signatures of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect beyond the quantum Hall effect.</p>

            <p>Microwave-optical entanglement is essential for efficient quantum communication, secure information transfer, and integrating microwave and optical quantum systems to advance hybrid quantum technologies. In this work, we demonstrate how the magnon Kerr effect can be harnessed to generate and control nonreciprocal entanglement in cavity optomagnomechanics (COMM). This effect induces magnon frequency shifts and introduces pair-magnon interactions, both of which are tunable through the magnetic field direction, enabling nonreciprocal behavior. By adjusting system parameters such as magnon frequency detuning, we show that magnon-phonon, microwave-optical photon-photon, and optical photon-magnon entanglement can be nonreciprocally enhanced and rendered more robust against thermal noise. Additionally, the nonreciprocity of entanglement can be selectively controlled, and ideal nonreciprocal entanglement is achievable.

            <p>Silicon carbide (SiC) has attracted significant attention as a promising quantum material due to its ability to host long-lived, optically addressable color centers with solid-state photonic interfaces. The CMOS compatibility of 4H-SiCOI (silicon-carbide-on-insulator) makes it an ideal platform for integrated quantum photonic devices and circuits. While micro-ring cavities have been extensively studied in SiC and other materials, the integration of 4H-SiC spin defects into these critical structures, along with continuous mode tunability, remains unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate the integration of PL4 divacancy spin defects into tunable micro-ring cavities in scalable thin-film 4H-SiC nanophotonics. Comparing on- and off-resonance conditions, we observed an enhancement of the Purcell factor by approximately 5.0. This enhancement effectively confined coherent photons within the coupled waveguide, leading to a twofold increase in the ODMR (optically detected magnetic resonance) contrast and coherent control of PL4 spins. These advancements lay the foundation for developing SiC-based quantum photonic circuits.</p>

By formulating the Langevin equation of a dissipative LC circuit as a linear control problem, we derive optimized pulses with exponential scaling in energy cost, outperforming conventional shortcut-to-adiabaticity methods such as counter-diabatic driving. When applied to a resonator dispersively coupled to a qubit, these optimized pulses achieve an excellent signal-to-noise ratio comparable to longitudinal coupling schemes across varying critical photon numbers. Our results provide a significant step toward efficient control in dissipative open systems and improved qubit readout in circuit quantum electrodynamics.</p>

Their unique electronic structure and highly oscillatory potential energy curves support a rich variety of dynamical effects yet to be explored. We analyze the vibrational motion of these molecules using a framework of adiabatic wavepacket propagation dynamics and observe that for appropriate initial states, the trilobite potential acts as molecular diffraction grating. The quantum dynamic effects observed are explained using a Fourier analysis of the scattering potential and the associated scattered wavepacket. Furthermore, vibrational ground-states of the low angular momentum ultralong-range Rydberg molecules are found to be particularly suitable to prepare the relevant wavepackets. Hence, we propose a time resolved pump-probe scheme designed for the realization of the effect in question, and advertise the utilization of a single diatomic Rydberg molecule as a testbed for the study of exaggerated quantum dynamical phenomena.</p>

            <h2>Effective field theory of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vinay Patil, Rafael Flores-Calder√≥n, Ashley M. Cook</p>
            <p>Motivated by phenomenology of myriad recently-identified topologically non-trivial phases of matter, we introduce effective field theories (EFTs) for the quantum skyrmion Hall effect (QSkHE). We employ a single, unifying generalisation for this purpose: in essence, a lowest Landau level projection defining a non-commutative, fuzzy sphere with position coordinates proportional to SU(2) generators of matrix representation size $N\times N$, may host an intrinsically 2+1 dimensional, topologically non-trivial many-body state for small $N$ as well as large $N$. That is, isospin degrees of freedom associated with a matrix Lie algebra with $N \times N$ generators potentially encode some finite number of spatial dimensions for $N\ge 2$, a regime in which isospin has previously been treated as a label. This statement extends to more general $p$-branes subjected to severe fuzzification as well as membranes. As a consequence of this generalisation, systems with $d$ Cartesian spatial coordinates and isospin degrees of freedom encoding an additional $\delta$ fuzzy coset space coordinates can realise topologically non-trivial states of intrinsic dimensionality up to $d$+$\delta$+1. We therefore identify gauge theories with extra fuzzy dimensions generalised to retain dependence upon gauge fields over fuzzy coset spaces even for severe fuzzification (small $N$), as EFTs for the QSkHE. We furthermore generalise these EFTs to space manifolds with local product structure exploiting the dimensional hierarchy of (fuzzy) spheres. For this purpose, we introduce methods of anisotropic fuzzification and propose formulating topological invariants on fuzzy coset spaces as artifacts of projecting matrix Lie algebras to occupied subspaces. Importantly, we focus on phenomenology indicating the 2+1 D SU(2) gauge theory should be generalised using this machinery, and serves as a minimal EFT of the QSkHE.</p>

            <p>Silicon carbide (SiC) has attracted significant attention as a promising quantum material due to its ability to host long-lived, optically addressable color centers with solid-state photonic interfaces. The CMOS compatibility of 4H-SiCOI (silicon-carbide-on-insulator) makes it an ideal platform for integrated quantum photonic devices and circuits. While micro-ring cavities have been extensively studied in SiC and other materials, the integration of 4H-SiC spin defects into these critical structures, along with continuous mode tunability, remains unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate the integration of PL4 divacancy spin defects into tunable micro-ring cavities in scalable thin-film 4H-SiC nanophotonics. Comparing on- and off-resonance conditions, we observed an enhancement of the Purcell factor by approximately 5.0. This enhancement effectively confined coherent photons within the coupled waveguide, leading to a twofold increase in the ODMR (optically detected magnetic resonance) contrast and coherent control of PL4 spins. These advancements lay the foundation for developing SiC-based quantum photonic circuits.</p>

            <h2>Optimal Control for Open Quantum System in Circuit Quantum Electrodynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mo Zhou, F. A. C√°rdenas-L√≥pez, Sugny Dominique, Xi Chen</p>
            <p>We propose a quantum optimal control framework based on the Pontryagin Maximum Principle to design energy- and time-efficient pulses for open quantum systems. By formulating the Langevin equation of a dissipative LC circuit as a linear control problem, we derive optimized pulses with exponential scaling in energy cost, outperforming conventional shortcut-to-adiabaticity methods such as counter-diabatic driving. When applied to a resonator dispersively coupled to a qubit, these optimized pulses achieve an excellent signal-to-noise ratio comparable to longitudinal coupling schemes across varying critical photon numbers. Our results provide a significant step toward efficient control in dissipative open systems and improved qubit readout in circuit quantum electrodynamics.</p>

            <h2>Experimental investigation of a quantum Otto heat engine with shortcuts to adiabaticity implemented using counter-adiabatic driving</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Krishna Shende, Matreyee Kandpal, Arvind, Kavita Dorai</p>
            <p>The finite time operation of a quantum Otto heat engine leads to a trade-off between efficiency and output power, which is due to the deviation of the system from the adiabatic path. This trade-off caveat can be bypassed by using the shortcut-to-adiabaticity protocol. We experimentally implemented a quantum Otto heat engine using spin-1/2 nuclei on a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) quantum processor. We investigated its performance using the shortcut-to-adiabaticity technique via counter-adiabatic driving with the inclusion of the cost to perform the shortcut. We use two different metrics that incorporate the cost of shortcut-to-adiabaticity to define engine efficiency and experimentally analyze which one is more appropriate for the NMR platform. We found a significant improvement in the performance of the quantum Otto heat engine driven by shortcut-to-adiabaticity, as compared to the non-adiabatic heat engine.</p>

            <h2>Extensive manipulation of transition rates and substantial population inversion of rotating atoms inside a cavity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yan Peng, Yuebing Zhou, Jiawei Hu, Hongwei Yu</p>
            <p>We investigate the transition rates of a centripetally accelerated atom interacting with electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations inside a high-quality cavity. Our findings reveal that the emission and excitation rates can be extensively manipulated by adjusting the cavity's normal mode frequency and the rotational angular velocity. Using experimentally feasible parameters, we demonstrate that, in one scenario, the excitation rate can reach magnitudes as high as $10^7~{\rm s}^{-1}$, while the emission rate remains negligible, trailing by 9 orders of magnitude. This suggests the potential for substantial population inversion in an ensemble of atoms. In another scenario, both the emission and excitation rates can simultaneously reach magnitudes as high as $10^7~{\rm s}^{-1}$, indicating that millions of transitions per second are expected even for a single atom. These remarkable results not only offer a new method for controlling the radiative properties of atoms but also open avenues for the experimental verification of the circular Unruh effect using cutting-edge quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Critical spectrum of the anisotropic two-photon quantum Rabi model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiong Li, Daniel Braak, Qing-Hu Chen</p>
            <p>The anisotropic two-photon quantum Rabi model is studied using the Bogoliubov operator approach. The doubly degenerate exceptional states are identified through analytical methods. By adjusting the position of the last exceptional point belonging to two adjacent energy levels, we derive a condition for the absence of the discrete spectrum at the critical coupling where ``spectral collapse" occurs. In this special case, the spectrum becomes fully continuous above a threshold energy, with no bound states existing, whereas the ground state remains gapped in the general case. This also signals a quantum phase transition. More interestingly, we rigorously find that a finite number of bound states exist between two anisotropy dependent critical atomic frequencies, with infinitely many bound states beyond this frequency regime. In this manner, all issues in the two-photon quantum Rabi model are resolved.</p>

            <h2>Towards a General Framework for Practical Quantum Network Protocols</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sumeet Khatri</p>
            <p>The quantum internet is one of the frontiers of quantum information science. It will revolutionize the way we communicate and do other tasks, and it will allow for tasks that are not possible using the current, classical internet. The backbone of a quantum internet is entanglement distributed globally in order to allow for such novel applications to be performed over long distances. Experimental progress is currently being made to realize quantum networks on a small scale, but much theoretical work is still needed in order to understand how best to distribute entanglement and to guide the realization of large-scale quantum networks, and eventually the quantum internet, especially with the limitations of near-term quantum technologies. This work provides an initial step towards this goal. The main contribution of this thesis is a mathematical framework for entanglement distribution protocols in a quantum network, which allows for discovering optimal protocols using reinforcement learning. We start with a general development of quantum decision processes, which is the theoretical backdrop of reinforcement learning. Then, we define the general task of entanglement distribution in a quantum network, and we present ground- and satellite-based quantum network architectures that incorporate practical aspects of entanglement distribution. We combine the theory of decision processes and the practical quantum network architectures into an overall entanglement distribution protocol. We also define practical figures of merit to evaluate entanglement distribution protocols, which help to guide experimental implementations.</p>

            <h2>Cavity-QED Simulation of a Maser beyond the Mean-Field Approximation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinpeng Shu, Yining Jiang, Hao Wu, Mark Oxborrow</p>
            <p>We here introduce a method for simulating, quantum mechanically, the dynamics of a maser where the strength of the magnetic field of the microwave mode being amplified by stimulated emission varies over the volume of the maser's spatially extended gain medium. This is very often the case in real systems. Our method generalizes the well-known Tavis-Cummings (T-C) model of cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) to encompass quantum emitters whose coupling strengths to the maser's amplified mode vary over a distribution that can be accurately determined using an electromagnetic-field solver applied to the maser cavity's geometry and composition. We then solve our generalized T-C model to second order in cumulant expansion using publicly available Python-based software. We apply our methodology to a specific, experimentally measured maser based on an optically pumped crystal of pentacene-doped para-terphenyl. We demonstrate that certain distinct quantum-mechanical features exhibited by this maser's dynamics, most notably the observation of Rabi-like flopping associated with the generation of spin-photon Dicke states, can be accurately reproduced using our numerically solved model. The equivalent simpler model, that invokes the mean-field approximation, fails to do so. By constructing then solving for artificial (perfectly Gaussian) distributions, we go on to explore how the performance of this type of maser is affected by the spread in spin-photon coupling strengths. Our methodology thereby enables the maser's anatomy to be more rationally engineered.</p>

            <h2>Multi-field quantum conferencing overcomes the network capacity limit</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuan-Mei Xie, Yu-Shuo Lu, Yao Fu, Hua-Lei Yin, Zeng-Bing Chen</p>
            <p>Quantum conferencing enables multiple nodes within a quantum network to share a secure group key for private message broadcasting. The key rate, however, is limited by the repeaterless capacity to distribute multiparticle entangled states across the network. Currently, in the finite-size regime, no feasible schemes utilizing existing experimental techniques can overcome the fundamental rate-distance limit of quantum conferencing in quantum networks without repeaters. Here, we propose a practical, multi-field scheme that breaks this limit, involving virtually establishing Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states through post-measurement coincidence matching. This proposal features a measurement-device-independent characteristic and can directly scale to support any number of users. Simulations show that the fundamental limitation on the group key rate can be overcome in a reasonable running time of sending $10^{14}$ pulses. We predict that it offers an efficient design for long-distance broadcast communication in future quantum networks.</p>

            <h2>Signatures of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect in the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Reyhan Ay, Adipta Pal, Ashley M. Cook</p>
            <p>Given recent discovery of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect, we re-examine the related canonical Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ) model for the quantum spin Hall insulator. Within the framework of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect, isospin degree(s) of freedom of the BHZ model encode additional spatial dimensions. Consistent with this framework, we observe phenomena similar to those of the four dimensional Chern insulator, revealed by weakly breaking time-reversal symmetry. Bulk-boundary correspondence of these states includes real-space boundary orbital angular momentum textures and gapless boundary modes that are robust against magnetic disorder, consistent with compactified three dimensional boundary Weyl nodes (WN$_F$s) of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect. These theoretical findings are furthermore consistent with past experimental work reporting unexpected edge conduction in HgTe quantum wells under applied Zeeman and orbital magnetic fields. This past work is therefore potentially the first known experimental observation of signatures of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect beyond the quantum Hall effect.</p>

            <p>Quantum Reservoir Computing (QRC) leverages quantum systems to perform complex computational tasks with exceptional efficiency and reduced energy consumption. We introduce a minimalistic QRC framework utilizing only a few two-level atoms in a single-mode optical cavity, combined with continuous quantum measurements. To achieve high computational expressivity with minimal hardware, we include two critical elements: reservoir feedback and polynomial regression. Reservoir feedback modifies the reservoir's dynamics without altering its hardware, while polynomial regression enhances output resolution by nonlinearly extending expressions. We evaluate QRC's memory retention and nonlinear data processing through two tasks: predicting chaotic time-series data via the Mackey-Glass task and classifying sine-square waveforms. Our results demonstrate significant QRC performance with minimal reservoirs containing as few as five atoms, further enhanced by feedback mechanisms and polynomial regression. This framework fulfills QRC's objectives to minimize hardware size and energy consumption, marking a significant advancement in integrating quantum physics with machine learning technology.</p>

            <p>We investigate how the quantum friction experienced by a polarizable atom moving with constant velocity parallel to a planar interface is modified when the latter consists of chiral or nonreciprocal media, with special focus on topological insulators. We use macroscopic quantum electrodynamics to obtain the velocity-dependent Casimir-Polder frequency shift and decay rate.

We illustrate our findings by examining the nonretarded and retarded limits for five examples: a perfectly conducting mirror, a perfectly reflecting nonreciprocal mirror, a three-dimensional topological insulator, a perfectly reflecting chiral mirror and an isotropic chiral medium. We find different asymptotic power laws for all these materials. Interestingly, we find two bridges between chirality and nonreciprocity through the frequency shift that arise as a consequence of the magnetoelectric coupling. Namely, the position-dependent Casimir-Polder frequency shift for the nonreciprocal case depend on a geometric magnetic field associated with photoionization of chiral molecules, the Casimir-Polder depending on the velocities for the chiral case have the optical rotatory strength as the atomic response while those for the nonreciprocal case depend on an analog of the optical rotatory strength.</p>

            <p>We introduce a theoretical framework that allows for the systematic and efficient description of the ultrafast nonlinear response of molecular polaritons, i.e., hybrid light-matter states, in the collective regime of large numbers of molecules $\mathcal N$ coupled to the cavity photon mode. Our approach is based on a semiclassical, mean-field evolution of the molecular Hamiltonian and the cavity field, which is complemented by a perturbative expansion of both light and matter counterparts in the input fields entering the cavity. In addition, expansion in terms of the pulse phases enables us to disentangle different excitation pathways in Liouville space, thereby distinguishing contributions to the nonlinear response. The formalism extends traditional free-space nonlinear spectroscopy by incorporating the feedback of matter onto the light field via the induced polarization. We demonstrate the utility of the framework by applying it to the calculation of pump-probe polariton spectra and show how, by storing the pulses, the cavity facilitates additional excitation pathways which are not possible in free space. Our method, which does not scale with $\mathcal N$, is broadly applicable and can be extended to a wide range of current experiments investigating the dynamical nonlinear response of hybrid light-matter states.</p>

            <p>Memristive systems exhibit dynamics that depend on their past states, making them useful as memory units. Recently, quantum memristor models have been proposed and notably, a photonic quantum memristor (PQM) has been experimentally proven.

Firstly, we find that a single PQM displays memristive dynamics on its quantum coherence. Secondly, we analytically show that a network made of two independent PQMs can manifest memory effects on the dynamics of both entanglement and coherence of correlated photons traveling through the network, regardless of their distance, in the hypothesis of negligible external disturbances. Additionally, we build and run a circuit-model of the PQM on a real qubit-based quantum computer (IBM-Q), showing that: (i) this system can effectively be used for non-linear quantum computing under specific conditions, and (ii) digital quantum simulations can reproduce the dynamics of a memristive quantum system in a non-Markovian regime.</p>

            <p>Recently, it was shown by Danielson-Satishchandran-Wald (DSW) that for the massive or charged body in a quantum spatial separated superposition state, the presence of a black hole can decohere the superposition inevitably towards capturing the radiation of soft photons or gravitons. In this work, we study the DSW decoherence effect for the static charged body in the Reissner-Nordstr√∂m black holes. By calculating the decohering rate for this case, it is shown that the superposition is decohered by the low frequency photons that propagate through the black hole horizon. For the extremal Reissner-Nordstr√∂m black hole, the decoherence of quantum superposition is completely suppressed due to the black hole Meissner this http URL is also found that the decoherence effect caused by the Reissner-Nordstr√∂m black hole is equivalent to that of an ordinary matter system with the same size and charge.</p>

Additionally, we build and run a circuit-model of the PQM on a real qubit-based quantum computer (IBM-Q), showing that: (i) this system can effectively be used for non-linear quantum computing under specific conditions, and (ii) digital quantum simulations can reproduce the dynamics of a memristive quantum system in a non-Markovian regime.</p>

            <p>We study force-gradient sensing with a coherently driven mechanical resonator and phase-sensitive detection of motion through the two-tone backaction evading measurement of cavity optomechanics. The response of the optomechanical system, solved by numerical integration of the classical equations of motion, shows an extended region which is monotonic to changes in force gradient. We use Floquet theory to model the fluctuations, which rise only slightly above that of the usual backaction evading measurement in the presence of the mechanical drive. The monotonic response and minimal backaction are advantageous for applications such as atomic force microscopy.</p>

            <h2>Absolute zeta functions for zeta functions of quantum walks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jir√¥ Akahori, Norio Konno, Rikuki Okamoto, Iwao Sato</p>
            <p>This paper presents a connection between the quantum walk and the absolute mathematics. The quantum walk is a quantum counterpart of the classical random walk. We especially deal with the Grover walk on a graph. The Grover walk is a typical model of quantum walks. The time evolution of the Grover walk is obtained by a unitary matrix that is called the Grover matrix. We define the zeta function determined by the Grover matrix. First we prove that the zeta function of the Grover walk is the absolute automorphic form that constructs the absolute zeta function. Next we calculate the absolute zeta function defined by Grover walks on some graphs. The absolute zeta functions of the Grover walks are expressed by the multiple gamma function. Other types of absolute zeta functions are obtained as an analogue of the multiple gamma function.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eirini C. Telali, T. Rick Perche, Eduardo Mart√≠n-Mart√≠nez</p>
            <p>We analyse the interaction between two quantum systems in spacetime and we compare two possible models to describe it: 1) a fully quantum field theoretical (QFT) description of the coupling of two quantum systems mediated by a quantum field and 2) a quantum-controlled model (qc-model), which is an effectively relativistic direct-coupling in which the interaction of two quantum systems is not mediated by a field with local quantum degrees of freedom. We show that while there are regimes where the qc-model can approximate QFT arbitrarily well, it can suffer from retrocausal effects. We discuss in what regimes those retrocausal predictions of the qc-model are non-negligible and whether they can be used to argue that gravity induced entanglement experiments can reveal genuinely quantum aspects of the gravitational interaction or not.</p>

            <p>Quantum process tomography (QPT), used to estimate the linear map that best describes a quantum operation, is usually performed using a priori assumptions about state preparation and measurement (SPAM), which yield a biased and inconsistent estimator. This estimate can be made more accurate and less biased by incorporating SPAM-calibration data. Unobservable properties of the SPAM operations introduce a small gauge freedom that can be regularized using the a priori SPAM. We give an explicit correction procedure for standard linear-inversion QPT and overcomplete linear-inversion QPT, and describe how to extend it to statistically principled estimators like maximum likelihood estimation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luca Maggio, Danilo Triggiani, Paolo Facchi, Vincenzo Tamma</p>
            <p>We present a sensing scheme for estimating the frequency difference of two non-entangled photons. The technique consists of time-resolving sampling measurements at the output of a beam splitter. With this protocol, the frequency shift between two photons can be estimated with the ultimate precision achievable in nature, overcoming the limits in precision and the range of detection of frequency-resolving detectors employed in standard direct measurements of the frequencies. The sensitivity can be increased by increasing the coherence time of the photons. We show that, already with $\sim 1000$ sampling measurements, the Cram√©r-Rao bound is saturated independently of the value of the difference in frequency.</p>

            <p>Integrated photonic microresonators have become an essential resource for generating photonic qubits for quantum information processing, entanglement distribution and networking, and quantum communications. The pair generation rate is enhanced by reducing the microresonator radius, but this comes at the cost of increasing the frequency mode spacing and reducing the quantum information spectral density. Here, we circumvent this rate-density trade-off in an AlGaAs-on-insulator photonic device by multiplexing an array of 20 small-radius microresonators each producing a 650-GHz-spaced comb of time-energy entangled-photon pairs. The resonators can be independently tuned via integrated thermo-optic heaters, enabling control of the mode spacing from degeneracy up to a full free spectral range. We demonstrate simultaneous pumping of five resonators with up to $50$ GHz relative comb offsets, where each resonator produces pairs exhibiting time-energy entanglement visibilities up to 95$\%$, coincidence-to-accidental ratios exceeding 5,000, and an on-chip pair rate up to 2.6 GHz/mW$^2$ per comb line -- more than 40 times improvement over prior work. As a demonstration, we generate frequency-bin qubits in a maximally entangled two-qubit Bell state with fidelity exceeding 87$\%$ (90$\%$ with background correction) and detected frequency-bin entanglement rates up to 7 kHz ($\sim 70$ MHz on-chip pair rate) using $\sim 250$ $\mu$W pump power. Multiplexing small-radius microresonators combines the key capabilities required for programmable and dense photonic qubit encoding while retaining high pair-generation rates, heralded single-photon purity, and entanglement fidelity.</p>

            <h2>Hybrid of Gradient Descent And Semidefinite Programming for Certifying Multipartite Entanglement Structure</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kai Wu, Zhihua Chen, Zhen-Peng Xu, Zhihao Ma, Shao-Ming Fei</p>
            <p>Multipartite entanglement is a crucial resource for a wide range of quantum information processing tasks, including quantum metrology, quantum computing, and quantum communication. The verification of multipartite entanglement, along with an understanding of its intrinsic structure, is of fundamental importance, both for the foundations of quantum mechanics and for the practical applications of quantum information technologies. Nonetheless, detecting entanglement structures remains a significant challenge, particularly for general states and large-scale quantum systems. To address this issue, we develop an efficient algorithm that combines semidefinite programming with a gradient descent method. This algorithm is designed to explore the entanglement structure by examining the inner polytope of the convex set that encompasses all states sharing the same entanglement properties. Through detailed examples, we demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to many of the best-known methods available today. Our method not only improves entanglement detection but also provides deeper insights into the complex structures of many-body quantum systems, which is essential for advancing quantum technologies</p>

            <h2>Vacuum Rabi Splitting and Quantum Fisher Information of a Non-Hermitian Qubit in a Single-Mode Cavity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi-Cheng Wang, Jiong Li, Li-Wei Duan, Qing-Hu Chen</p>
            <p>A natural extension of the non-Hermitian qubit is to place it in a single-mode cavity. This setup corresponds to the quantum Rabi model (QRM) with a purely imaginary bias on the qubit, exhibiting the parity-time ($\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$) symmetry. In this work, we first solve the $\mathcal{P} \mathcal{T}$ symmetric QRM using the Bogoliubov operator approach. We derive the transcendental function responsible for the exact solution, which can also be used to precisely identify exceptional points. The adiabatic approximation previously used can be easily formulated within this approach by considering transitions between the same manifolds in the space of Bogoliubov operators. By further considering transitions between the nearest-neighboring manifolds, we can analytically obtain more accurate eigen-solutions. Moreover, these simple corrections can capture the main features of the dynamics, where the adiabatic approximation fails. Furthermore, the rich characteristics of the vacuum Rabi splitting in the emission spectrum is predicted. The width of the peaks increases with the coupling strength and the imaginary biases, reflecting the nature of open quantum systems. Additionally, we identify a quantum criticality-enhanced effect by calculating the quantum Fisher information. Near the exceptional points, the quantum Fisher information in the $\mathcal{P} \mathcal{T}$ symmetric QRM is significantly higher than that of the non-Hermitian qubit component. This may open a new avenue for enhancing quantum sensitivity in non-Hermitian systems by incorporating coupling with an additional degree of freedom, enabling more precise parameter estimation.</p>

We employ the temporal Talbot effect to detect QKD symbols in the control basis, and show experimentally-obtained values for the two-dimensional and four-dimensional case. We present a comparison of the secret key rates obtained from two different security proofs to display security issues stemming from asymmetric detection efficiencies in the two bases. Our results contribute to the discussion of the benefits of high-dimensional encoding and highlight the impact of security analysis on the achievable QKD performance.</p>

Our protocol even enables randomness to be certified from Bell-local states, broadening the range of quantum states useful for this task.

            <h2>Relaxation of A Thermally Bathed Harmonic Oscillator: A Study Based on the Group-theoretical Formalism</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yan Gu, Jiao Wang</p>
            <p>Quantum dynamics of a damped harmonic oscillator has been extensively studied since the sixties of the last century. Here, with a distinct tool termed the ``group-theoretical characteristic function" (GCF), we investigate analytically how a harmonic oscillator immersed in a thermal environment would relax to its equilibrium state. We assume that the oscillator is at a pure state initially and its evolution is governed by a well-known quantum-optical master equation. By taking advantage of the GCF, the master equation can be transformed into a first-order linear partial differential equation that allows us to write down its solution explicitly. Based on the solution, it is found that, in clear contrast with the monotonic relaxation process of its classical counterpart, the quantum oscillator may demonstrate some intriguing nonmonotonic relaxation characteristics. In particular, when the initial state is a Gaussian state (i.e., a squeezed coherent state), it is found that there is a critical value of the environmental temperature, below which the entropy will first increase to reach its maximum value, then turn down and converge to its equilibrium value from above. For the temperature higher than the critical value, the entropy will converge to its equilibrium value from below monotonically. However, when the initial state is a Fock state, it is found that there is a new phase additional to the previous case, where the time curve of entropy features two extreme points. Namely, the entropy will increase to reach its maximum first, then turn down to reach its minimum, from where it begins to increase and converges to the equilibrium value eventually. Other related issues are discussed as well.</p>

            <h2>Generalized Teleportation Fidelity and Singlet Fraction and their Relation for (In)-distinguishable Particles and Its Applications</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Soumya Das, Goutam Paul, Anindya Banerji</p>
            <p>Quantum teleportation efficiently transfers quantum information between distant locations by utilizing a pre-established composite system. Assessing the effectiveness of teleportation hinges on its fidelity, representing the similarity between input and output states. This fidelity, in turn, relies on a singlet fraction, quantifying the resemblance of the composite system to maximally entangled states. The relation between teleportation fidelity and singlet fraction given by [Horodecki \textit{et al}., Phy. Rev. A \textbf{60}, 1888 (1999)] does not hold for distinguishable particles with multiple degrees of freedom or indistinguishable particles with single or multiple degrees of freedom. In this paper, we propose generalized expressions for teleportation fidelity and singlet fraction and derive their relations, applicable for both distinguishable and indistinguishable particles with single or multiple degrees of freedom. We derive an upper bound for the generalized singlet fraction for distinguishable particles using the monogamy of singlet fraction by [Kay \textit{et al.} Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{103}, 050501 (2009)]. We also show how our relation helps to characterize different types of composite states in terms of their distinguishability, separability, presence of maximally entangled structure, and the number of degrees of freedom. We complement our theory with two practical illustrations. First, we demonstrate two counter-intuitive values of generalized singlet fraction using our optical circuit and the circuit of [Li \textit{et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{120}, 050404 (2018)]. Finally, we show that using an additional degree of freedom as an ancilla instead of a particle can be advantageous in quantum cryptographic protocols.</p>

            <h2>Reduction-induced the Variation of Partial Von Neumann Entropy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jing-Min Zhu</p>
            <p>Whether from theoretical research or from practical research and applications, bipartite mixed-state quantum entanglement (QE) and its measures hold significant theoretical and practical importance. Widely recognized measures such as Entanglement of Formation and Relative Entropy of Entanglement, involve quantifying the minimum QE and reflect the inherently complex nature of their computation. In contrast, Concurrence is applicable only to 2*2 quantum systems, while Negativity is limited to 2*2 and 2*3 quantum systems. In this context, we propose a novel method termed Reduction-induced the Variation of Partial Von Neumann Entropy (RIVPVNE) to quantify QE in bipartite mixed states. The computational complexity associated with this method is minimal. Moreover, it has a wide range of applicability. The intuitive and clear physical representation, combined with straightforward computation, facilitates the exploration of its specific potential applications. Subsequently, we employ this method to investigate the organization and structure of some well-known QEs, analyzing its characteristics through both its physical implication and mathematical structure in comparison to the existing measures for bipartite QE measures, such as Partial Von Neumann Entropy, Concurrence, Negativity, Entanglement of Formation and Relative Entropy of Entanglement.</p>

            <p>Expectation Value Samplers (EVSs) are quantum-computer-based generative models that can learn high-dimensional continuous distributions by measuring the expectation values of parameterized quantum circuits regarding selected observables. However, such models may require unaffordable quantum resources for good performance. This work explores the impact of observable choices on the EVS. We introduce an Observable-Tunable Expectation Value Sampler (OT-EVS). The resulting model provides enhanced expressivity as compared to standard EVS. By restricting our selectable observables, it is possible to use the classical shadow measurement scheme to reduce the sample complexity of our algorithm. We further propose an adversarial training method adapted to the needs of OT-EVS. This training prioritizes classical updates of observables, minimizing the more costly updates of quantum circuit parameters. Numerical experiments confirm our model's expressivity and sample efficiency advantages compared to previous designs, using an original simulation technique for correlated shot noise. We envision our proposal to encourage the exploration of continuous generative models running with few quantum resources.</p>

            <p>We explore an unconventional bridge between quantum mechanical density matrices and sound by mapping elements of the density matrix and their phases to auditory signals, thus introducing a framework for Open Quantum Sonification. Employing the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian operator as a basis, each quantum state contributes a frequency proportional to its energy level. The off-diagonal terms, which encode coherence and phase relationships between energy levels, are rendered as binaural signals presented separately to the left and right ears. We illustrate this method within the context of open quantum system dynamics governed by Lindblad equations, presenting first an example of quantum Brownian motion of a particle in a thermal bath, and second, a recoherence process induced by boundary driving that results in spin-helix states. This document serves as a companion to the corresponding audio visual simulations of these models available on the YouTube channel Open Quantum Sonification with the Python Codes on GitHub. The auditory analogy presented here provides an intuitive and experiential means of describing quantum phenomena such as tunnelling, thermalisation, decoherence, and recoherence.</p>

            <p>We consider the problem of maximizing the stored energy for a given charging duration in a quantum battery composed of a pair of spins-$1/2$ with Ising coupling starting from the spin-down state, using bounded transverse field control. We map this problem to an optimal control problem on a single qubit and using optimal control theory we show that, although a single bang pulse can quickly achieve considerable charging levels for relatively large upper control bounds, higher levels of stored energy including complete charging are accomplished by a bang-singular-bang pulse-sequence, where the intermediate singular pulse is an Off pulse. If the control is restricted between zero and a maximum value, the initial and final bang pulses attain the maximum bound but have different durations, while if it is restricted between symmetric negative and positive boundaries, the bang pulses have the same duration but opposite boundary values. For both cases we provide transcendental equations from which the durations of the individual pulses in the optimal pulse-sequence can be calculated. For the case of full charging we surprisingly find that the three ``switching" functions for the equivalent qubit problem become zero while the adjoint ket does not, in consistency with optimal control theory.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Logic Locking (QLL): Safeguarding Intellectual Property for Quantum Circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuntao Liu, Jayden John, Qian Wang</p>
            <p>In recent years, quantum computing has demonstrated superior efficiency to classical computing. In quantum computing, quantum circuits that implement specific quantum functions are crucial for generating correct solutions. Therefore, quantum circuit compilers, which decompose high-level gates into the hardware's native gates and optimize the circuit serve as the bridge from the quantum software stack to the hardware machines. However, untrusted quantum compilers risk stealing original quantum designs (quantum circuits), leading to the theft of sensitive intellectual property (IP). In classical computing, logic locking is a pivotal technique for securing integrated circuits (ICs) against reverse engineering and IP piracy. This technique involves inserting a keyed value into the circuit, ensuring the correct output is achieved only with the correct key. To address similar issues in quantum circuit protection, we propose a method called quantum logic locking, which involves inserting controlled gates to control the function of the quantum circuit. We have expanded on previous work by extending the 1-bit logic key method to a multi-bit key approach, allowing for the use of diverse quantum gates. We have demonstrated the practicality of our method through experiments on a set of benchmark quantum circuits. The effectiveness of quantum logic locking was measured by assessing the divergence distance from the original circuit. Our results demonstrate that quantum logic locking effectively conceals the function of the original quantum circuit, with an average fidelity degradation of less than 1%.</p>

            <h2>Empirical Coordination of Separable Quantum Correlations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hosen Nator, Uzi Pereg</p>
            <p>We introduce the notion of empirical coordination for quantum correlations. Quantum mechanics enables the calculation of probabilities for experimental outcomes, emphasizing statistical averages rather than detailed descriptions of individual events. Empirical coordination is thus a natural framework for quantum systems. Focusing on the cascade network, the optimal coordination rates are established, indicating the minimal resources required to simulate on average a quantum state. As we consider a network with classical communication links, superposition cannot be maintained, hence the quantum correlations are separable (i.e., a convex combination of product states). This precludes entanglement. Providing the users with shared randomness, before communication begins, does not affect the optimal rates for empirical coordination. We begin with a rate characterization for a basic two-node network, and then generalize to a cascade network. The special case of a network with an isolated node is considered as well. The results can be further generalized to other networks as our analysis includes a generic achievability scheme. The optimal rate formula involves optimization over a collection of state extensions. This is a unique feature of the quantum setting, as the classical parallel does not include optimization. As demonstrated through examples, the performance depends heavily on the choice of decomposition. We further discuss the consequences of our results for quantum cooperative games.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wira Azmoon Ahmad, Matthew Sutcliffe</p>
            <p>It is known that a quantum circuit may be simulated with classical hardware via stabilizer state (T-)decomposition in $O(2^{\alpha t})$ time, given $t$ non-Clifford gates and a decomposition efficiency $\alpha$. The past years have seen a number of papers presenting new decompositions of lower $\alpha$ to reduce this runtime and enable simulation of ever larger circuits. More recently, it has been demonstrated that well placed applications of apparently weaker (higher $\alpha$) decompositions can in fact result in better overall efficiency when paired with the circuit simplification strategies of ZX-calculus. In this work, we take the most generalized T-decomposition (namely vertex cutting), which achieves a poor efficiency of $\alpha=1$, and identify common structures to which applying this can, after simplification via ZX-calculus rewriting, yield very strong effective efficiencies $\alpha_{\text{eff}}\ll1$. By taking into account this broader scope of the ZX-diagram and incorporating the simplification facilitated by the well-motivated cuts, we derive a handful of efficient T-decompositions whose applicabilities are relatively frequent. In benchmarking these new 'dynamic' decompositions against the existing alternatives, we observe a significant reduction in overall $\alpha$ and hence overall runtime for classical simulation, particularly for certain common circuit classes.</p>

We also propose an efficient way to extract stochastic properties of $u$, namely the multi-point functions of $u$, from the quantum state of $\vert\psi\rangle$. Our algorithm offers an exponential advantage over the classical finite difference method in terms of the number of spatial grids when a perturbativity condition in the information-extracting step is met.</p>

            <h2>Classical simulability of Clifford+T circuits with Clifford-augmented matrix product states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zejun Liu, Bryan K. Clark</p>
            <p>Generic quantum circuits typically require exponential resources for classical simulation, yet understanding the limits of classical simulability remains a fundamental question. In this work, we investigate the classical simulability of $N$-qubit Clifford circuits doped with $t$ number of $T$-gates by converting the circuits into Clifford-augmented matrix product states (CAMPS). We develop a simple disentangling algorithm to reduce the entanglement of the MPS component in CAMPS using control-Pauli gates, which replaces the standard algorithm relying on heuristic optimization when $t\lesssim N$, ensuring that the entanglement of the MPS component of CAMPS does not increase for $N$ specific $T$-gates. Using a simplified model, we explore in what cases these $N$ $T$-gates happen sufficiently early in the circuit to make classical simulatability of $t$-doped circuits out to $t=N$ possible. We give evidence that in one-dimension where the $T$-gates are uniformly distributed over the qubits and in higher spatial dimensions where the $T$-gates are deep enough we generically expect polynomial or quasi-polynomial simulations when $t \leq N$. We further explore the representability of CAMPS in the regime of $t>N$, uncovering a non-trivial dependence of the MPS entanglement on the distribution of $T$-gates. While it is polynomially efficient to evaluate the expectation of Pauli observable or the quantum magic in CAMPS, we propose algorithms for sampling, probability and amplitude estimation of bitstrings, and evaluation of entanglement R√©nyi entropy from CAMPS, which, though still having exponential complexity, improve efficiency over the standard MPS simulations. This work establishes a versatile framework based on CAMPS for understanding classical simulatability of $t$-doped circuits and exploring the interplay between quantum entanglement and quantum magic on quantum systems.</p>

            <p>Estimating transition rates in open quantum systems is a significant challenge in physics and chemistry due to the exponential increase in computational resources required with the system sizes. Addressing this issue, we introduce a novel and efficient quantum simulation method to compute dynamical transition rates in Markovian open quantum systems. This method reformulates the transition rate expression, represented as the time derivatives of correlation functions, into directly measurable quantities in parametrised mixed-state quantum circuits. This approach allows us to estimate the transition rate more accurately without requiring the computation of the correlation function in a dynamical open quantum system. To validate our approach, we perform quantum simulations experimentally on IBMQ quantum processors for a decohering spin-1/2 model, compared with analytic solutions and quantum numerical simulation. Motivated by quantum chemistry-related applications, we examine our method in one-dimensional Caldeira-Leggett quantum Brownian motion model. Through theoretical and numerical analyses, we address the scalability of our scheme and the promise of significant computational advantages over its classical counterpart. Thus, our new approach holds the potential to surpass the bottlenecks of current quantum chemical research, particularly in accurately predicting molecular reaction rates and designing novel materials on the current and the near-term realisable quantum hardware.</p>

            <h2>Local unitarty equivalence and entanglement by Bargmann invariants</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lin Zhang, Bing Xie, Yuanhong Tao</p>
            <p>The study of quantum states frequently examines the connection between non-local effects in quantum mechanics and quantities that remain unchanged under local unitary transformations. Among these concepts, local unitary equivalence, defined through local unitary transformations, holds significant importance in quantum state classification and resource theory. This paper focuses on the fundamental issue of local unitary equivalence for multipartite quantum states within quantum information theory, with the aim of identifying the comprehensive set of invariants that define their local unitary orbits. These invariants are crucial for deriving polynomial invariants and describing physical properties that remain invariant under local unitary transformations. Specifically, the research delves into the characterization of local unitary equivalence and the detection of entanglement using local unitary Bargmann invariants, utilizing the generalized Schur-Weyl duality to analyze tensor product symmetries. Taking the two-qubit system as an example, our study demonstrates the measurability of the invariants that determine local unitary equivalence and establishes a relationship between Makhlin's fundamental invariants (a complete set of 18 local unitary invariants for two-qubit states) and local unitary Bargmann invariants. These Bargmann invariants are related to the trace of density operator products with marginal states and can be measured through a cycle test, an extension of the SWAP this http URL findings offer a practical criterion for entanglement detection based on local unitary Bargmann invariants, contributing to the advancement of quantum information theory and its applications.</p>

            <p>Recently, Cai showed that Shor's quantum factoring algorithm fails to factor large integers when the algorithm's quantum Fourier transform (QFT) is corrupted by a vanishing level of random noise on the QFT's precise controlled rotation gates. We show that under the same error model, Shor's quantum discrete log algorithm, and its various modifications, fail to compute discrete logs modulo P for a positive density of primes P and a similarly vanishing level of noise. We also show that the same noise level causes Shor's algorithm to fail with probability 1-o(1) to compute discrete logs modulo P for randomly selected primes P.</p>

            <h2>A Quantum Super-Krylov Method for Ground State Energy Estimation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adam Byrne, William Kirby, Kirk M. Soodhalter, Sergiy Zhuk</p>
            <p>Krylov quantum diagonalization methods for ground state energy estimation have emerged as a compelling use case for quantum computers. However, many existing methods rely on subroutines, in particular the Hadamard test, that are challenging on near-term quantum hardware. Motivated by this problem, we present a quantum Krylov method that uses only time evolutions and recovery probabilities, making it well adapted for current quantum computers. This is supplemented with a classical post-processing derivative estimation algorithm. The method ultimately estimates the eigenvalues of the commutator super-operator $X\to[H,X]$, so we declare it a super-Krylov method. We propose applying this method to estimate the ground-state energy of two classes of Hamiltonians: where either the highest energy is easily computable, or where the lowest and highest energies have the same absolute value. We prove that the resulting ground energy estimate converges in the noise-free regime and provide a classical numerical demonstration of the method in the presence of noise.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Approximate Optimisation Applied to Graph Similarity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicholas J. Pritchard</p>
            <p>Quantum computing promises solutions to classically difficult and new-found problems through controlling the subtleties of quantum computing. The Quantum Approximate Optimisation Algorithm (QAOA) is a recently proposed quantum algorithm designed to tackle difficult combinatorial optimisation problems utilising both quantum and classical computation. The hybrid nature, generality and typically low gate-depth make it a strong candidate for near-term implementation in quantum computing. Finding the practical limits of the algorithm is currently an open problem. Until now, no tools to facilitate the design and validation of probabilistic quantum optimisation algorithms such as the QAOA on a non-trivial scale exist. Graph similarity is a long standing classically difficult problem withstanding decades of research from academia and industry. Determining the maximal edge overlap between all possible node label permutations is an NP-Complete task and provides an apt measure of graph similarity. We introduce a novel quantum optimisation simulation package facilitating investigation of all constituent components of the QAOA from desktop to cluster scale using graph similarity as an example. Our simulation provides flexibility and performance. We investigate eight classical optimisation methods each at six levels of decomposition. Moreover an encoding for permutation based problems such as graph similarity through edge overlap to the QAOA allows for significant quantum memory savings at the cost of additional operations. This compromise extends into the classical portion of the algorithm as the inclusion of infeasible solutions creates a challenging cost-function landscape. We present performance analysis of our simulation and of the QAOA setting a precedent for investigating and validating numerous other difficult problems to the QAOA as we move towards realising practical quantum computation.</p>

            <h2>Postmeasurement information and nonlocality of quantum state discrimination</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jinhyeok Heo, Donghoon Ha, Jeong San Kim</p>
            <p>In quantum state discrimination, nonlocality arises when the optimal state discrimination cannot be realized by local operations and classical communication. Recently, it has been found that the postmeasurement information about the subensemble containing the prepared state can annihilate or create nonlocality in quantum state discrimination. Here, we show that annihilation or creation of nonlocality in quantum state discrimination can depend on the choice of subensembles provided by postmeasurement information. We establish sufficient conditions that annihilating or creating nonlocality depends on the choice of subensembles provided by postmeasurement information. We further provide bipartite quantum state ensembles satisfying these conditions to illustrate our results.</p>

            <p>Achieving fast and high-fidelity qubit operations is crucial for unlocking the potential of quantum computers. In particular, reaching low gate errors in two-qubit gates has been a long-standing challenge in the field of superconducting qubits due to their typically long duration relative to coherence times. To realize fast gates, we utilize the hybridization between fixed-frequency superconducting qubits with a strongly interacting coupler mode that is tunable in frequency. To reduce population leakage during required adiabatic passages through avoided level crossings, we employ a sensitivity-adaptive closed-loop optimization method to design complex pulse shapes. We compare the performance of Gaussian-square, Fourier-series, and piecewise-constant-slope (PiCoS) pulse parametrizations and are able to reach 99.9 % controlled-Z gate fidelity using a 64 ns long Fourier-series pulse defined by only seven parameters. These high-fidelity values are achieved by analyzing the optimized pulse shapes to identify and systematically mitigate signal-line distortions in the experiment. To improve the convergence speed of the optimization we implement an adaptive cost function, which continuously maximizes the sensitivity. The demonstrated method can be used for tune-up and recalibration of superconducting quantum processors.</p>

            <p>Proposed experiments for obtaining empirical evidence for a quantum description of gravity in a table-top setting focus on detecting quantum information signatures, such as entanglement or non-Gaussianity production, in gravitationally interacting quantum systems. Here, we explore an alternative approach where the quantization of gravity could be inferred through measurements of macroscopic, thermodynamical quantities, without the need for addressability of individual quantum systems. To demonstrate the idea, we take as a case study a gravitationally self-interacting Bose gas, and consider its heat capacity. We find a clear-cut distinction between the predictions of a classical gravitational interaction and a quantum gravitational interaction in the heat capacity of the Bose gas.</p>

            <p>Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have attracted remarkable interest over the past few years because of their potential computational advantages on near-term quantum devices. They leverage a hybrid approach that integrates classical and quantum computing resources to solve high-dimensional problems that are challenging for classical approaches alone. In the training process of variational circuits, constructing an accurate probability distribution for each epoch is not always necessary, creating opportunities to reduce computational costs through shot reduction. However, existing shot-allocation methods that capitalize on this potential often lack adaptive feedback or are tied to specific classical optimizers, which limits their applicability to common VQAs and broader optimization techniques. Our observations indicate that the information entropy of a quantum circuit's output distribution exhibits an approximately exponential relationship with the number of shots needed to achieve a target Hellinger distance. In this work, we propose a distribution-adaptive dynamic shot (DDS) framework that efficiently adjusts the number of shots per iteration in VQAs using the entropy distribution from the prior training epoch. Our results demonstrate that the DDS framework sustains inference accuracy while achieving a ~50% reduction in average shot count compared to fixed-shot training, and ~60% higher accuracy than recently proposed tiered shot allocation methods. Furthermore, in noisy simulations that reflect the error rates of actual IBM quantum systems, DDS achieves approximately a ~30% reduction in the total number of shots compared to the fixed-shot method with minimal degradation in accuracy, and offers about ~70% higher computational accuracy than tiered shot allocation methods.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dimitris Koutromanos, Dionisis Stefanatos, Emmanuel Paspalakis</p>
            <p>Coupled spins form composite quantum systems which play an important role in many quantum technology applications, with an essential task often being the efficient generation of entanglement between two constituent qubits. The simplest such system is a pair of spins-$1/2$ coupled with Ising interaction, and in previous works various quantum control methods such as adiabatic processes, shortcuts to adiabaticity and optimal control have been employed to quickly generate there one of the maximally entangled Bell states. In this study, we use machine learning and optimization methods to produce maximally entangled states in minimum time, with the Rabi frequency and the detuning used as bounded control functions. We do not target a specific maximally entangled state, like the preceding studies, but rather find the controls which maximize the concurrence, leading thus automatically the system to the closest such state in shorter time. By increasing the bounds of the control functions we observe that the corresponding optimally selected maximally entangled state also changes and the necessary time to reach it is reduced. The present work demonstrates also that machine learning and optimization offer efficient and flexible techniques for the fast generation of entanglement in coupled spin systems, and we plan to extent it to systems involving more spins, for example spin chains.</p>

            <h2>Measurement of the work statistics of an open quantum system using a quantum computer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lindsay Bassman Oftelie, Michele Campisi</p>
            <p>We report on the experimental measurement of the work statistics of a genuinely open quantum system using a quantum computer. Such measurement has remained elusive thus far due to the inherent difficulty in measuring the total energy change of a system-bath compound (which is the work) in the open quantum system scenario. We overcome this difficulty by extending the interferometric scheme, originally conceived for closed systems, to the open system case and implement it on a superconducting quantum computer, taking advantage of the relatively high levels of noise on current quantum hardware to realize an open quantum system. We demonstrate that the method can be used as a diagnostic tool to probe physical properties of the system-bath compound, such as its temperature and specific transitions frequencies in its spectrum. Our experiments corroborate that the interferometric scheme is a promising tool to achieve the long-sought experimental validation of the Jarzynski equality for arbitrary open quantum systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sergi Masot-Llima, Artur Garcia-Saez</p>
            <p>Tensor networks are a very powerful data structure tool originating from quantum system simulations. In recent years, they have seen increased use in machine learning, mostly in trainings with gradient-based techniques, due to their flexibility and performance exploiting hardware acceleration. As ans√§tze, tensor networks can be used with flexible geometries, and it is known that for highly regular ones their dimensionality has a large impact in performance and representation power. For heterogeneous structures, however, these effects are not completely characterized. In this article, we train tensor networks with different geometries to encode a random quantum state, and see that densely connected structures achieve better infidelities than more sparse structures, with higher success rates and less time. Additionally, we give some general insight on how to improve memory requirements on these sparse structures and its impact on the trainings. Finally, as we use HPC resources for the calculations, we discuss the requirements for this approach and showcase performance improvements with GPU acceleration on a last-generation supercomputer.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gopal Chandra Santra, Philipp Hauke</p>
            <p>Understanding how physical systems are influenced by disorder is a fundamental challenge in quantum science. Addressing its effects often involves numerical averaging over a large number of samples, and it is not always easy to gain an analytical handle on exploring the effect of disorder. In this work, we derive exact solutions for disorder-averaged dynamics generated by any Hamiltonian that is a periodic matrix (potentially with non-trivial base, a property also called ($p,q$)-potency). Notably, this approach is independent of the initial state, exact for arbitrary evolution times, and it holds for Hermitian as well as non-Hermitian systems. The ensemble behavior resembles that of an open quantum system, whose decoherence function or rates are determined by the disorder distribution and the periodicity of the Hamiltonian. Depending on the underlying distribution, the dynamics can display non-Markovian characteristics detectable through non-Markovian witnesses. We illustrate the scheme for qubit and qudit systems described by (products of) spin $1/2$, spin $1$, and clock operators. Our methodology offers a framework to leverage disorder-averaged exact dynamics for a range of applications in quantum-information processing and beyond.</p>

            <p>Single-atom quantum sensors offer high spatial resolution and high sensitivity to electric and magnetic fields. Among them, trapped ions offer exceptional performance in sensing electric fields, which has been used in particular to probe these in the proximity of metallic surfaces. However, the flexibility of previous work was limited by the use of radio-frequency trapping fields, which has restricted spatial scanning to linear translations, and calls into question whether observed phenomena are connected to the presence of the radio-frequency fields. Here, using a Penning trap instead, we demonstrate a single ion probe which offers three-dimensional position scanning at distances between $50$ $\mu\mathrm{m}$ and $450$ $\mu\mathrm{m}$ from a metallic surface and above a $200\times200$ $\mu\mathrm{m}^{2}$ area, allowing us to reconstruct static and time-varying electric as well as magnetic fields. We use this to map charge distributions on the metallic surface and noise stemming from it. The methods demonstrated here allow similar probing to be carried out on samples with a variety of materials, surface constitutions and geometries, providing a new tool for surface science.</p>

            <p>Scalable quantum networks rely on optical connections between long-lived qubits to distribute entanglement. Tin vacancies in diamond have emerged as promising long-lived qubits, offering extended spin coherence times at liquid helium temperatures and spin-dependent, highly coherent optical transitions for effective photon-based communication. Connecting remote nodes requires quantum interference of indistinguishable photons, which is challenging in an inhomogeneous solid-state environment. Here, we demonstrate a two-node experiment with tin vacancies in diamond, which exhibit a resonant frequency distribution spanning approximately 8 GHz. To overcome the frequency mismatch, we tune the resonant frequencies of one node using the Stark effect. We achieve tunability up to 4 GHz while maintaining optical coherence. As a demonstration, we achieve detuning-dependent remote two-photon interference between separate nodes, obtaining 80(6)% interference visibility without postprocessing when the defects' optical transitions are tuned into resonance, and 63(8)% with detuning up to 20 times their natural linewidths. These results highlight the potential of tin-vacancy centres in diamond for establishing robust optical links between remote quantum registers.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Veronika Baumann, √Ñmin Baumeler, Eleftherios-Ermis Tselentis</p>
            <p>In standard quantum theory, the causal relations between operations are fixed and determined by the spacetime structure. Relaxing this notion of fixed causal order has been studied extensively over the past years. A first departure allows for dynamical arrangements, where operations can influence the causal relations of future operations, as certified by violation of fixed-order inequalities. A second non-causal departure relaxes even these limitations, and is certified by violations of causal inequalities. The quantum switch, which allows a party to coherently control the order in which operations are applied, is known to be incapable of violating causal inequalities. It was therefore believed that a device-independent certification of the causal indefiniteness in the quantum switch requires extended setups incorporating spacelike separation. Here, we show that the quantum switch violates fixed-order inequalities without exploiting its indefinite nature. Concretely, we study the $k$-cycle inequalities and introduce multi-party generalizations of the quantum switch tailored to these fixed-order inequalities. We further show that, when removing the dynamical aspect, $k$-cycle inequalities become novel, facet-defining, causal inequalities. On the one hand, this means that violating $k$-cycle inequalities under this restriction requires non-causal setups. On the other hand, since $k$-cycle inequalities are just one example of fixed-order inequalities, this reopens the possibility for a device-independent certification of the quantum switch in isolation.</p>

In this work, we experimentally study the modal multiplexing of both quantum and classical signals at telecom wavelengths, by using a few-mode fiber of 8 km and modal multiplexers/demultiplexers. We observe the existence of random-mode coupling at the quantum level, leading to cross-talk among both degenerate and non-degenerate channels. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using few-mode fibers for simultaneously transmitting classical and quantum information, leading to an efficient implementation of physical information encryption protocols in spatial-division multiplexed systems.</p>

A crucial step of it is parameter optimization, which is typically tackled through gradient-descent techniques. We advantageously explore instead the use of evolutionary algorithms for such optimization, specifically for time-series forecasting. We perform a comparison, for diverse instances of real-world data, between gradient-descent parameter optimization and covariant-matrix adaptation evolutionary strategy. We observe that gradient descent becomes permanently trapped in local minima that have been avoided by evolutionary algorithms in all tested datasets, reaching up to a six-fold decrease in prediction error. Finally, the combined use of evolutionary and gradient-based techniques is explored, aiming at retaining advantages of both. The results are particularly applicable in scenarios sensitive to gains in accuracy.</p>

            <p>The Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) center in diamond is an intriguing electronic spin system with applications in quantum radiometry, sensing and computation. In those experiments, a bias magnetic field is commonly applied along the NV symmetry axis to eliminate the triplet ground state manifold's degeneracy (S=1). In this configuration, the eigenvectors of the NV spin's projection along its axis are called strong-axial field states. Conversely, in some experiments a weak magnetic field is applied orthogonal to the NV symmetry axis, leading to eigenstates that are balanced linear superpositions of strong-axial field states, referred to as dressed states. The latter are sensitive to environmental magnetic noise at the second order, allowing to perform magnetic field protected measurements while providing increased coherence times. However, if a small axial magnetic field is added in this regime, the linear superposition of strong-axial field states becomes unbalanced. This paper presents a comprehensive study of Free Induction Decay (FID) measurements performed on a NV center ensemble in the presence of strain and weak orthogonal magnetic field, as a function of a small magnetic field applied along the NV symmetry axis. The simultaneous detection of dressed states and unbalanced superpositions of strong-axial field states in a single FID measurement is shown, gaining insight about coherence time, nuclear spin and the interplay between temperature and magnetic field sensitivity. The discussion concludes by describing how the simultaneous presence of magnetically-sensitive and -insensitive states opens up appealing possibilities for both sensing and quantum computation applications.</p>

            <p>The recent \emph{quantum circuit cutting} technique enables simulating large quantum circuits on distributed smaller devices, significantly extending the capabilities of current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. However, this method incurs substantial classical postprocessing and additional quantum resource demands, as both postprocessing complexity and sampling overhead scale exponentially with the number of cuts introduced. In this work, we propose an enhanced circuit cutting framework \emph{ShotQC} with effective sampling overhead reduction. It effectively reduces sampling overhead through two key optimizations: \emph{shot distribution} and \emph{cut parameterization}. The former employs an adaptive Monte Carlo method to dynamically allocate more quantum resources to subcircuit configurations that contribute more to variance in the final outcome. The latter leverages additional degrees of freedom in postprocessing to further suppress variance. By integrating these optimization methods, ShotQC achieves significant reductions in sampling overhead without increasing classical postprocessing complexity, as demonstrated on a range of benchmark circuits.</p>

Moreover, we show that the realized Lindblad dynamics exhibits resilience against depolarizing noise, opening up the path to a first demonstration on quantum computers. We complement our claims with numerical studies of the algorithm's convergence in various regimes of the mixed-field Ising model. In line with our predictions, we observe a mixing time scaling polynomially with system size when the ETH is satisfied. In addition, we assess the impact of algorithmic and hardware-induced errors on the algorithm's performance by carrying out quantum circuit simulations of our Lindblad simulation protocol with realistic noise models.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jacob F.F. Bulmer, Javier Mart√≠nez-Cifuentes, Bryn A. Bell, Nicol√°s Quesada</p>
            <p>To understand quantum optics experiments, we must perform calculations that consider the principal sources of noise, such as losses, spectral impurity and partial distinguishability. In both discrete and continuous variable systems, these can be modeled as mixed Gaussian states over multiple modes. The modes are not all resolved by photon-number measurements and so require calculations on coarse-grained photon-number distribution. Existing methods can lead to a combinatorial explosion in the time complexity, making this task unfeasible for even moderate sized experiments of interest. In this work, we prove that the computation of this type of distributions can be done in exponential time, providing a combinatorial speedup. We develop numerical techniques that allow us to determine coarse-grained photon number distributions of Gaussian states, as well as density matrix elements of heralded non-Gaussian states prepared in the presence of spectral impurity and partial distinguishability. These results offer significant speed-up and accuracy improvements to validation tests of both Fock and Gaussian boson samplers that rely on binned probability distributions. Moreover, they pave the way to a more efficient simulation of realistic photonic circuits, unlocking the ability to perform exact calculations at scales which were previously out of reach. In addition to this, our results, including loop Hafnian master theorems, may be of interest to the fields of combinatorics and graph theory.</p>

            <h2>Towards structure-preserving quantum encodings</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arthur J. Parzygnat, Tai-Danae Bradley, Andrew Vlasic, Anh Pham</p>
            <p>Harnessing the potential computational advantage of quantum computers for machine learning tasks relies on the uploading of classical data onto quantum computers through what are commonly referred to as quantum encodings. The choice of such encodings may vary substantially from one task to another, and there exist only a few cases where structure has provided insight into their design and implementation, such as symmetry in geometric quantum learning. Here, we propose the perspective that category theory offers a natural mathematical framework for analyzing encodings that respect structure inherent in datasets and learning tasks. We illustrate this with pedagogical examples, which include geometric quantum machine learning, quantum metric learning, topological data analysis, and more. Moreover, our perspective provides a language in which to ask meaningful and mathematically precise questions for the design of quantum encodings and circuits for quantum machine learning tasks.</p>

            <h2>Variational Quantum Simulation of Anyonic Chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ananda Roy</p>
            <p>Anyonic chains provide lattice realizations of a rich set of quantum field theories in two space-time dimensions. The latter play a central role in the investigation of generalized symmetries, renormalization group flows and numerous exotic phases of strongly-correlated systems. Here, a variational quantum simulation scheme is presented for the analysis of those anyonic chains which can be mapped to the restricted solid-on-solid~(RSOS) models of Andrews, Baxter and Forrester. An~$L_R$ site RSOS model associated with a Dynkin diagram containing~$p$ nodes is realized with~$L_R\lceil\ln_2 p\rceil$ qubits, where~$\lceil x\rceil$ is the smallest integer~$\geq x$. The scheme is benchmarked by realizing the ground states of RSOS Hamiltonians in the~$A_p$ family for~$4\leq p\leq8$ using a variational quantum-classical algorithm. The latter is based on the Euler-Cartan circuit ansatz. Topological symmetry operators are analyzed for the RSOS models at the quantum-critical points. Measurement of observables acting on~$\lceil\ln_2 p\rceil$ qubits is shown to capture the anyonic nature of the Hilbert space. The described quantum simulation scheme provides a systematic approach to give rise to a large family of quantum field theories which have largely eluded physical realizations.</p>

            <h2>Hiding, Shuffling, and Triangle Finding: Quantum Algorithms on Edge Lists</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amin Shiraz Gilani, Daochen Wang, Pei Wu, Xingyu Zhou</p>
            <p>The edge list model is arguably the simplest input model for graphs, where the graph is specified by a list of its edges. In this model, we study the quantum query complexity of three variants of the triangle finding problem. The first asks whether there exists a triangle containing a target edge and raises general questions about the hiding of a problem's input among irrelevant data. The second asks whether there exists a triangle containing a target vertex and raises general questions about the shuffling of a problem's input. The third asks for finding a triangle in the input edge list; this problem bridges the $3$-distinctness and $3$-sum problems, which have been extensively studied by both cryptographers and complexity theorists. We provide tight or nearly tight results for all of our problems as well as some first answers to the general questions they raise. In particular, given a graph with low maximum degree, such as a random sparse graph, we prove that the quantum query complexity of triangle finding in its length-$m$ edge list is $m^{5/7 \pm o(1)}$. We prove the lower bound in Zhandry's recording query framework [CRYPTO '19] and the upper bound by adapting Belovs's learning graph algorithm for $3$-distinctness [FOCS '12].</p>

            <h2>Power-optimized amplitude modulation for robust trapped-ion entangling gates: a study of gate-timing errors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luke Ellert-Beck, Wenchao Ge</p>
            <p>Trapped-ion systems are a promising route toward the realization of both near-term and universal quantum computers. However, one of the pressing challenges is improving the fidelity of two-qubit entangling gates. These operations are often implemented by addressing individual ions with laser pulses using the Molmer-Sorensen (MS) protocol. Amplitude modulation (AM) is a well-studied extension of this protocol, where the amplitude of the laser pulses is controlled as a function of time. We present an analytical study of AM, using a Fourier series expansion to maintain the generality of the laser amplitude's functional form. We then apply this general AM method to gate-timing errors by imposing conditions on these Fourier coefficients, producing trade-offs between the laser power and fidelity at a fixed gate time. The conditions derived here are linear and can be used, in principle, to achieve arbitrarily high orders of insensitivity to gate-timing errors. Numerical optimization is then employed to identify the minimum-power pulse satisfying these constraints. Our central result is that the leading order dependence on gate timing errors is improved from $\mathcal{O}(\Delta t^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(\Delta t^6)$ with the addition of one linear constraint on the Fourier coefficients and to $\mathcal{O}(\Delta t^{10})$ with two linear constraints without a significant increase in the average laser power. The increase approaches zero as more Fourier coefficients are included. In further studies, this protocol can be applied to other error sources and used in conjunction with other error-mitigation techniques to improve two-qubit gates.</p>

            <h2>Discovery of a non-Hermitian phase transition in a bulk condensed-matter system</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jingwen Li, Michael Turaev, Masakazu Matsubara, Kristin Kliemt, Cornelius Krellner, Shovon Pal, Manfred Fiebig, Johann Kroha</p>
            <p>Phase transitions are fundamental in nature. A small parameter change near a critical point leads to a qualitative change in system properties. Across a regular phase transition, the system remains in thermal equilibrium and, therefore, experiences a change of static properties, like the emergence of a magnetisation upon cooling a ferromagnet below the Curie temperature. When driving a system far from equilibrium, novel, otherwise inaccessible quantum states of matter may arise. Such states are typically non-Hermitian, that is, their dynamics break time-reversal symmetry, a basic law of equilibrium physics. Phase transitions in non-Hermitian systems are of fundamentally new nature in that the dynamical behaviour rather than static properties may undergo a qualitative change at a critical, here called exceptional point. Here we experimentally realize a non-Hermitian phase transition in a bulk condensed-matter system. Optical excitation creates charge carriers in the ferromagnetic semiconductor EuO. In a temperature-dependent interplay with the Hermitian transition to ferromagnetic order, a non-Hermitian change of the relaxation dynamics occurs, manifesting in our time-resolved reflection data as a transition from bi-exponential real to single-exponential complex decay. Our theory models this behavior and predicts non-Hermitian phase transitions for a large class of condensed-matter systems, where they may be exploited to sensitively control bulk-dynamic properties.</p>

            <p>InAs on Insulator (InAsOI) has recently been demonstrated as a promising platform to develop hybrid semiconducting-superconducting electronics, which features an InAs epilayer grown onto a cryogenic insulating InAlAs metamorphic buffer. The miniaturization of Si microchips has progressed significantly due to the integration of high permittivity (high-k) gate insulators, compared to the conventional thermally-growth SiO2. Here, we investigate the gate-tunable electrical properties of InAsOI-based Josephson Field Effect Transistors (JoFETs) featuring different high-k gate insulators, namely, HfO2 and Al2O3. With both dielectrics, the JoFETs can entirely suppress the switching current and increase the normal state resistance by 10-20 times using negative gate voltages. The HfO2-JoFETs exhibit improved gate-tunable electrical performance compared to those achieved with Al2O3-JoFETs, which is related to the higher permittivity of the insulator. Gate-dependent electrical properties of InAsOI-based JoFETs were evaluated in the temperature range from 50 mK to 1 K. Moreover, under the influence of an out-of-plane magnetic field, JoFETs exhibited an unconventional Fraunhofer diffraction pattern.</p>

We introduce the experimental configuration and report new world-leading constraints on the interactions of sub-MeV dark matter particles with masses as low as 30 keV. The thin-layer geometry of the system provides anisotropy in the interaction rate, enabling directional sensitivity. In addition, we leverage the coupling between phonons and quasiparticles in the detector to simultaneously constrain interactions with both electrons and nucleons.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nima Ghafari Cherati, Anton Pershin, √Åd√°m Gali</p>
            <p>The negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center is one of the most significant and widely studied defects in diamond that plays a prominent role in quantum technologies. The precise engineering of the location and concentration of NV centers is of great importance in quantum technology applications. To this end, irradiation techniques such as nitrogen-molecule ion implantation are applied. Recent studies have reported enhanced NV center creation and activation efficiencies introduced by nitrogen molecule ion implantation in doped diamond layers, where the maximum creation efficiency at $\sim75$\% has been achieved in sulfur-doped layers. However, the microscopic mechanisms behind these observations and the limits of the efficiencies are far from understood. In this study, we employ hybrid density functional theory calculations to compute the formation energies, charge transition levels, and the magneto-optical properties of various sulfur defects in diamond where we also consider the interaction of sulfur and hydrogen in chemical vapor-deposited diamond layers. Our results imply that the competition between the donor substitutional sulfur and the hyper-deep acceptor sulfur-vacancy complex is an important limiting factor on the creation efficiency of the NV center in diamond. However, both species are able to trap interstitial hydrogen from diamond, which favorably mediates the creation of NV centers in chemical vapor-deposited diamond layers.</p>

            <h2>Non-Linearities In Atomic Quantum Receivers: Harmonic And Intermodulation Distortion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lu√≠s Felipe Gon√ßalves, Teng Zhang, Georg Raithel, David A. Anderson</p>
            <p>Rydberg sensors offer a unique approach to radio frequency (RF) detection, leveraging the high sensitivity and quantum properties of highly-excited atomic states to achieve performance levels beyond classical technologies. Non-linear responses and distortion behavior in Rydberg atom receivers are critical to evaluating and establishing performance metrics and capabilities such as spur-free dynamic range and tolerance to unwanted interfering signals. We report here on the measurement and characterization of non-linear behavior and spurious response of a Rydberg atomic heterodyne receiver. Single-tone and two-tone testing procedures are developed and implemented for measurement of harmonic and inter-modulation distortion in Rydberg atomic receivers based on multi-photon Rydberg spectroscopy and radio-frequency heterodyne signal detection and demodulation in an atomic vapor. For a predetermined set of atomic receiver parameters and RF carrier wave in the SHF band near-resonant to a cesium Rydberg transition, we measure and characterize atomic receiver selectivity, bandwidth, roll-off, compression point (P1dB), second-order (IP2) and third-order (IP3) intercepts, and spur-free dynamic range. Receiver intermodulation distortion is characterized for the case of an interfering signal wave applied at two frequency offsets relative to the near-resonant reference local oscillator, $\Delta F/F= 10^{-4}$ at 6dB and $10^{-6}$ at 22dB single-tone bandwidths, respectively. We observe that under suitable operating conditions the atomic receiver can exhibit a suppression of harmonic and inter-modulation distortion relative to that of classical receiver mixer amplifiers. Finally, we describe how the non-linear behaviors of atomic receivers can provide unique, controllable RF signatures inaccessible by classical counterparts and propose their use to realize secure communication modalities and applications.</p>

            <h2>Systematic discrepancies between reference methods for non-covalent interactions within the S66 dataset</h2>

            <p>The accurate treatment of non-covalent interactions is necessary to model a wide range of applications, from molecular crystals to surface catalysts to aqueous solutions and many more. Quantum diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) and coupled cluster theory with single, double and perturbative triple excitations [CCSD(T)] are considered two widely-trusted methods for treating non-covalent interactions. However, while they have been well-validated for small molecules, recent work has indicated that these two methods can disagree by more than $7.5\,$kcal/mol for larger systems. The origin of this discrepancy remains unknown. Moreover, the lack of systematic comparisons, particularly for medium-sized complexes, has made it difficult to identify which systems may be prone to such disagreements and the potential scale of these differences. In this work, we leverage the latest developments in DMC to compute interaction energies for the entire S66 dataset, containing 66 medium-sized complexes with a balanced representation of dispersion and electrostatic interactions. Comparison to previous CCSD(T) references reveals systematic trends, with DMC predicting stronger binding than CCSD(T) for electrostatic-dominated systems, while the binding becomes weaker for dispersion-dominated systems. We show that the relative strength of this discrepancy is correlated to the ratio of electrostatic and dispersion interactions, as obtained from energy decomposition analysis methods. Finally, we pinpoint systems in the S66 dataset where these discrepancies are particularly prominent, offering cost-effective benchmarks to guide future developments in DMC, CCSD(T) as well as the wider electronic structure theory community.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hugo A. Camargo, Yichao Fu, Viktor Jahnke, Keun-Young Kim, Kuntal Pal</p>
            <p>In quantum many-body systems, time-evolved states typically remain confined to a smaller region of the Hilbert space known as the $\textit{Krylov subspace}$. The time evolution can be mapped onto a one-dimensional problem of a particle moving on a chain, where the average position $\langle n \rangle$ defines Krylov state complexity or spread complexity. Generalized spread complexities, associated with higher-order moments $\langle n^p \rangle$ for $p>1$, provide finer insights into the dynamics. We investigate the time evolution of generalized spread complexities following a quantum quench in random matrix theory. The quench is implemented by transitioning from an initial random Hamiltonian to a post-quench Hamiltonian obtained by dividing it into four blocks and flipping the sign of the off-diagonal blocks. This setup captures universal features of chaotic quantum quenches. When the initial state is the thermofield double state of the post-quench Hamiltonian, a peak in spread complexity preceding equilibration signals level repulsion, a hallmark of quantum chaos. We examine the robustness of this peak for other initial states, such as the ground state or the thermofield double state of the pre-quench Hamiltonian. To quantify this behavior, we introduce a measure based on the peak height relative to the late-time saturation value. In the continuous limit, higher-order complexities show increased sensitivity to the peak, supported by numerical simulations for finite-size random matrices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martin Houde, Fereshteh Rajabi</p>
            <p>In this paper we consider the effect of quantum entanglement and coherence on the radiated intensity from a gas and its absorption capacity at thermal equilibrium or, more generally, under conditions where no population inversion exists. As was shown by Dicke (1954), although entangled states and coherence can lead to superradiance for specific modes of radiation, they can also bring subradiance through significant energy trapping in slow and dark states. While a finite separation between the atoms composing the gas will cause leaking of the trapped energy, we show how the combination of thermal equilibrium and quantum coherence mitigates this effect and leads to significantly reduced radiation intensity from the gas, rendering it dark and collision-less. Furthermore, we show how under the same conditions absorption of a radiation field incident on the gas can lead to higher attenuation levels than those predicted with Beer's law. Beer's law is recovered in the limit of complete decoherence. We apply our analysis to the atomic hydrogen 21 cm line and, considering the gas densities expected in Dark Matter halos, we find that quantum entanglement and coherence can potentially account for some of the Dark Matter known exist in these environments.</p>

            <h2>Long-Time Behavior of Typical Pure States from Thermal Equilibrium Ensembles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cornelia Vogel</p>
            <p>We consider an isolated macroscopic quantum system in a pure state $\psi_t\in\mathcal{H}$ evolving unitarily in a separable Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$. Following von Neumann [46], we assume that different macro states $\nu$ correspond to mutually orthogonal subspaces $\mathcal{H}_\nu\subset\mathcal{H}$. Let $P_\nu$ be the projection to $\mathcal{H}_\nu$. ''Normal typicality'' is the statement (true for some Hamiltonians) that for all initial states $\psi_0\in\mathcal{H}$ and most $t\geq 0$, $\|P_\nu\psi_t\|^2$ is close to $d_\nu/D$, where $d_\nu=\dim\mathcal{H}_\nu$ and $D=\dim\mathcal{H}<\infty$. It can be shown [42] that the statement becomes valid for all Hamiltonians if ''all $\psi_0\in\mathcal{H}$'' is replaced by ''most $\psi_0\in\mathcal{H}_\mu$'' (most w.r.t. the uniform distribution on the sphere of $\mathcal{H}_\mu$) with an arbitrary macro state $\mu$ and $d_\nu/D$ by a $t$- and $\psi_0$-independent quantity $M_{\mu\nu}$. In the present work, we generalize this result from the uniform distribution to a much more general class of measures, so-called GAP measures. Let $\rho$ be a density matrix on $\mathcal{H}$. Then GAP$(\rho)$ is the most spread out distribution on the sphere of $\mathcal{H}$ with density matrix $\rho$. If $\rho$ is a canonical density matrix, GAP$(\rho)$ arises as the thermal equilibrium distribution of wave functions and can be viewed as a quantum analog of the canonical ensemble. We show that also for GAP$(\rho)$-most $\psi_0\in\mathcal{H}$, the superposition weight $\|P_\nu\psi_t\|^2$ is close to a fixed value $M_{\rho P_\nu}$ for most $t\geq0$. Moreover, we prove a similar result for arbitrary bounded operators $B$ instead of $P_\nu$ and for finite times. The main ingredient of the proof is an improvement of bounds on the variance of $\langle\psi|B|\psi\rangle$ w.r.t. GAP$(\rho)$ which were first obtained by Reimann [29] and slightly generalized in [44].</p>

            <h2>Quantum-Like Contextuality in Large Language Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kin Ian Lo, Mehrnoosh Sadrzadeh, Shane Mansfield</p>
            <p>Contextuality is a distinguishing feature of quantum mechanics and there is growing evidence that it is a necessary condition for quantum advantage. In order to make use of it, researchers have been asking whether similar phenomena arise in other domains. The answer has been yes, e.g. in behavioural sciences. However, one has to move to frameworks that take some degree of signalling into account. Two such frameworks exist: (1) a signalling-corrected sheaf theoretic model, and (2) the Contextuality-by-Default (CbD) framework. This paper provides the first large scale experimental evidence for a yes answer in natural language. We construct a linguistic schema modelled over a contextual quantum scenario, instantiate it in the Simple English Wikipedia and extract probability distributions for the instances using the large language model BERT. This led to the discovery of 77,118 sheaf-contextual and 36,938,948 CbD contextual instances. We proved that the contextual instances came from semantically similar words, by deriving an equation between degrees of contextuality and Euclidean distances of BERT's embedding vectors. A regression model further reveals that Euclidean distance is indeed the best statistical predictor of contextuality. Our linguistic schema is a variant of the co-reference resolution challenge. These results are an indication that quantum methods may be advantageous in language tasks.</p>

Using an azimuthal polarizer, we obtain improvements in the Fisher information of point-source separation by over an order of magnitude relative to direct imaging. Unlike established super-resolution fluorescence techniques, the method does not require sequential photoswitching/blinking of the fluorophores, and thus could facilitate significant speed-ups for certain biological imaging/tracking tasks.</p>

            <p>Supersymmetry (SUSY) proposed as an elementary symmetry for physics beyond the Standard Model has found important applications in various areas outside high-energy physics. Here, we systematically implement supersymmetric quantum mechanics -- exhibiting fundamental SUSY properties in the simple setting of quantum mechanics -- into a wide range of topological semimetals, where the broken translational symmetry, e.g., by a magnetic field, is effectively captured by a SUSY potential. We show that the dynamical SUSY breaking via the instanton effect over the SUSY potential valleys works as the underlying mechanism for the gap opening of the topological semimetallic phases, and the magnitude of the instanton effect is proportional to the energy gap. This instanton mechanism provides a simple criterion for determining whether the energy gap has been opened, without resorting to detailed calculations, i.e., a finite energy gap is opened if and only if the SUSY potential has an even number of zeros. Our theory leads to previously unexpected results: even an infinitesimal magnetic field can open a gap in topologically robust Dirac, Weyl, and nodal-line semimetallic phases due to the dynamical SUSY breaking. Overall, the revealed connection between SUSY quantum mechanics and non-uniform topological semimetals can elucidate previously ambiguous phenomena, provide guidance for future investigations, and open a new avenue for exploring topological semimetals.</p>

            <p>Lattice gauge theory is an important framework for studying gauge theories that arise in the Standard Model and condensed matter physics. Yet many systems (or regimes of those systems) are difficult to study using conventional techniques, such as action-based Monte Carlo sampling. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of gauged Gaussian projected entangled pair states as an ansatz for a lattice gauge theory involving dynamical physical matter. We study a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory on a two dimensional lattice with a single flavor of fermionic matter on each lattice site. Our results show agreement with results computed by exactly diagonalizing the Hamiltonian, and demonstrate that the approach is computationally feasible for larger system sizes where exact results are unavailable. This is a further step on the road to studying higher dimensions and other gauge groups with manageable computational costs while avoiding the sign problem.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Manu Canals, Natalia Chepiga, Luca Tagliacozzo</p>
            <p>The Lattice Gauge Theory Hilbert space is divided into gauge-invariant sectors selected by the background charges. Such a projector can be directly embedded in a tensor network ansatz for gauge-invariant states as originally discussed in [Phys. Rev. B 83, 115127 (2011)] and in [Phys. Rev. X 4, 041024 (2014)] in the context of PEPS. The original ansatz is based on sparse tensors, though parts of them are not explicitly symmetric, and thus their actual implementation in numerical simulations has been hindered by the complexity of developing ad hoc libraries. Here we provide a new PEPS tensor network formulation of gauge-invariant theories purely based on symmetric elementary tensors. The new formulation can be implemented in numerical simulation using available state-of-the-art tensor network libraries but also holds interest from a purely theoretical perspective since it requires embedding the original gauge theory with gauge symmetry G into an enlarged globally symmetric theory with symmetry GxG. By revisiting the original ansatz in the modern landscape of i) duality transformations between gauge and spin systems, ii) finite depth quantum circuits followed by measurements that allow generating topologically ordered states, and iii) Clifford enhanced tensor networks, we show that such a new formulation provides a novel duality transformation between lattice gauge theories and specific sectors of globally invariant systems.</p>

In contrast, here we demonstrate that its time-reversed configuration produces an ideal, deterministic second-order 'ghost' interference pattern devoid of diffraction and first-order effect, with the size dependent on the dimensions of the `effectively extended light source.' Furthermore, the new system enables a range of effects and phenomena not available in traditional double-slit interference studies, including the formation of programmed and digitized interference fringes and the coincidence of the pattern plane and the source plane. Despite the absence of first-order interference, our proposed experiment does not rely on nonclassical correlations or quantum entanglement. The elimination of diffraction through time-reversal symmetry holds promise for advancing superresolution optical imaging and sensing techniques beyond existing capabilities.</p>

            <h2>Analytic 3D vector non-uniform Fourier crystal optics in arbitrary $\bar{\bar{\varepsilon}}$ dielectric</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chenzhu Xie, Yong Zhang</p>
            <p>To find a suitable incubator for nonlinear crystal optics(NCO), we have revisited linear crystal optics(LCO). At the methodological level, three widely used plane wave bases are compared in terms of eigenanalysis in reciprocal space and light field propagation in real space. Inspired by complex ray tracing, we expand M.V. Berry's 2003 uniform plane wave model to non-uniform Fourier crystal optics(FCO) and ultimately derive the explicit form of its 3$\times$2 transition matrix, bridging the two major branches of crystal optics(CO) in reciprocal space, where either ray direction $\hat{k}$ or spatial frequency $\bar{k}_{\mathrm{\rho}}$ serves as the input variable. Using this model, we create the material-matrix tetrahedral compass(M-M TC) to conduct a detailed analysis of how the four fundamental characteristics of materials (linear/circular birefringence/dichroism) influence the eigensystems of the vector electric field in two-dimensional(2D) spatial frequency $\bar{k}_{\mathrm{\rho}}$ domain and its distribution in three-dimensional(3D) $\bar{r}$ space with a crystal-2f system. Along this journey, we have uncovered new territories in LCO in both real and reciprocal space, such as infinite singularities arranged in disk-, ring-, and heart-like shapes, generalized haunting theorem, double conical refraction, and optical knots it induces. We also present our model's early applications in focal engineering and NCO.</p>

            <p>We investigate the scattering halos resulting from collisions between discrete momentum components in the time-of-flight expansion of interaction-tunable $^6\rm Li_2$ molecular Bose-Einstein condensates. A key highlight of this study is the observation of the influence of interactions on the collisional scattering process. We measure the production of scattering halos at different interaction levels by varying the number of particles and the scattering length, and quantitatively assess the applicability of perturbation theory. To delve into a general theory of scattering halos, we introduce a scattering factor and obtain a universal relation between it and the halo ratio. Furthermore, we simulate the formation of scattering halos under non-perturbative conditions and analyze the discrepancies between simulation results and experiments through a return pulse experiment. This study enhances our understanding of the physical mechanisms underlying scattering processes in many-body systems and provides new perspectives for further theoretical research.</p>

Additionally, we show that the Landau levels (appropriately rotated and now embedded in the complex plane) persists, unless the magnetic field is purely imaginary in which case they disappear and the spectrum becomes purely continuous.</p>

            <p>We investigate the topological properties of multiple exceptional points in non-Hermitian two-level systems, emphasizing vorticity as a topological invariant arising from complex energy structures. We categorize EP pairs as fundamental building blocks of larger EP assemblies, distinguishing two types: type-I pairs with opposite vorticities and type-II pairs with identical vorticities. By analyzing the branch cut formation in a two-dimensional parameter space, we reveal the distinct topological features of each EP pair type. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to configurations with multiple EPs, demonstrating the cumulative vorticity and topological implications. To illustrate these theoretical structures, we model complex energy bands within a two-dimensional photonic crystal composed of lossy materials, identifying various EP pairs and their branch cuts. These findings contribute to the understanding of topological characteristics in non-Hermitian systems.</p>

            <p>Substitutional carbon defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have garnered significant interest as single photon emitters (SPEs) due to their remarkable optical and quantum properties. An intriguing property of these defects is that they can be spin-active ($S\geq 1$), even if weakly interacting. Employing density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate that two monomers of C-based defects of the same species can exhibit a stable triplet spin state at room temperature, even when they are separated $\lesssim 1$ nm, if they reside in different layers. The zero-phonon line (ZPL) energy of C defects in different layers lies within $1.6-2.2$ eV range. Also, we found defects that deviate from the typical phonon replica patterns, potentially explaining the observed phonon replicas in yellow emitters in hBN.</p>

We find that beyond various magnetically ordered phases, including ferromagnetic, zigzag, antiferromagnetic (AFM) and stripy states, two extended quantum spin liquid phases arise in the proximity of the Kitaev limit. While these ordered phases also appear in the monolayer Kitaev-Heisenberg model, our results further show that a valence bond solid state emerges in a relatively narrow range of parameter space between the AFM and stripy phases, which can be adiabatically connected to isolated Heisenberg dimers. Our results highlight the importance of considering interlayer interactions on the emergence of novel quantum phases in the bilayer Kitaev materials.</p>

Conventional techniques like STM, TEM, and AFM enable atomic-scale observations but face limitations under ambient conditions and surface topographies.

In this study, a nanoscale layer dissection method was developed utilizing NV center technology to analyze water layers with diverse physicochemical properties. It unveiled the presence of a non-evaporating sub-nanometer water layer on a diamond surface under ambient conditions. This layer demonstrated impervious to atmospheric water vapor and exhibited unique electronic transport mediated via hydrogen bonding.

            <p>Exceptional points (EPs) has seen substantial advances in both experiment and theory. However, in quantum systems, higher-order exceptional points remain of great interest and possess numerous intriguing properties yet to be fully explored. Here, we describe a \emph{PT} symmetry-protected three-level non-Hermitian system with the dissipative spin-orbit-coupled (SOC) fermions in which a third-order exceptional point (EP3) emerges when both the eigenvalues and eigenstates of the system collapse into one. The band structure and its spin dynamics are explored for $^{173}$Yb fermions. We highlight the enhanced sensitivity to the external perturbation of EP3 with cubic-root energy dispersion. Additionally, we investigate the second-order exceptional point (EP2) with square-root energy dispersion in a three-level quantum system with the absence of parity symmetry, which proves that the enhanced sensitivity closely relates to the symmetries of the NH system. Furthermore, we analyze the encircling behavior of EP3 in terms of the adiabatic limit and the nonadiabatic dynamics and discover some different results from that of EP2.</p>

            <p>One of the important open problems in quantum black hole physics is a dual interpretation of holographic complexity proposals. To date the only quantitative match is the equality between the Krylov spread complexity in triple-scaled SYK at infinite temperature and the complexity = volume proposal in classical JT gravity. Our work utilizes the recent connection between double-scaled SYK and sine-dilaton gravity to show that the quantitative relation between Krylov spread complexity and complexity = volume extends to finite temperatures and to full quantum regime on the gravity side at disk level. From the latter we isolate the first quantum correction to the complexity = volume proposal and propose to view it as a complexity of quantum fields in the bulk. Finally, we comment on the switchback effect, whose presence would make the Krylov spread complexity a fully fledged holographic complexity at least in sine-dilaton gravity.</p>

            <p>In strongly correlated materials, interacting electrons are entangled and form collective quantum states, resulting in rich low-temperature phase diagrams. Notable examples include cuprate superconductors, in which superconductivity emerges at low doping out of an unusual ``pseudogap'' metallic state above the critical temperature. The Fermi-Hubbard model, describing a wide range of phenomena associated with strong electron correlations, still offers major computational challenges despite its simple formulation. In this context, ultracold atoms quantum simulators have provided invaluable insights into the microscopic nature of correlated quantum states. Here, we use a quantum gas microscope Fermi-Hubbard simulator to explore a wide range of doping levels and temperatures in a regime where a pseudogap is known to develop. By measuring multi-point correlation functions up to fifth order, we uncover a novel universal behaviour in magnetic and higher-order spin-charge correlations. This behaviour is characterized by a doping-dependent energy scale that governs the exponential growth of the magnetic correlation length upon cooling. Accurate comparisons with determinant Quantum Monte Carlo and Minimally Entangled Typical Thermal States simulations confirm that this energy scale agrees well with the pseudogap temperature $T^{*}$. Our findings establish a qualitative and quantitative understanding of the magnetic origin and physical nature of the pseudogap and pave the way towards the exploration of pairing and collective phenomena among charge carriers expected to emerge at lower temperatures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sanjiang Li, Xiangzhen Zhou, Yuan Feng</p>
            <p>Current superconducting quantum devices impose strict connectivity constraints on quantum circuit execution, necessitating circuit transformation before executing quantum circuits on physical hardware. Numerous quantum circuit transformation (QCT) algorithms have been proposed. To enable faithful evaluation of state-of-the-art QCT algorithms, this paper introduces QKNOB (Qubit mapping Benchmark with Known Near-Optimality), a novel benchmark construction method for QCT. QKNOB circuits have built-in transformations with near-optimal (close to the theoretical optimum) SWAP count and depth overhead. QKNOB provides general and unbiased evaluation of QCT algorithms. Using QKNOB, we demonstrate that SABRE, the default Qiskit compiler, consistently achieves the best performance on the 53-qubit IBM Q Rochester and Google Sycamore devices for both SWAP count and depth objectives. Our results also reveal significant performance gaps relative to the near-optimal transformation costs of QKNOB. Our construction algorithm and benchmarks are open-source.</p>

            <h2>Theory of Quantum Circuits with Abelian Symmetries</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Iman Marvian</p>
            <p>Quantum circuits with gates (local unitaries) respecting a global symmetry have broad applications in quantum information science and related fields, such as condensed matter theory and quantum thermodynamics. However, despite their widespread use, fundamental properties of such circuits are not well-understood. Recently, it was found that generic unitaries respecting a global symmetry cannot be realized, even approximately, using gates that respect the same symmetry. This observation raises important open questions: What unitary transformations can be realized with k-local gates that respect a global symmetry? In other words, in the presence of a global symmetry, how does the locality of interactions constrain the possible time evolution of a composite system? In this work, we address these questions for the case of Abelian (commutative) symmetries and develop constructive methods for synthesizing circuits with such symmetries. Remarkably, as a corollary, we find that, while the locality of interactions still imposes additional constraints on realizable unitaries, certain restrictions observed in the case of non-Abelian symmetries do not apply to circuits with Abelian symmetries. For instance, in circuits with a general non-Abelian symmetry such as SU($d$), the unitary realized in a subspace with one irreducible representation (charge) of the symmetry dictates the realized unitaries in multiple other sectors with inequivalent representations of the symmetry. Furthermore, in certain sectors, rather than all unitaries respecting the symmetry, the realizable unitaries are the symplectic or orthogonal subgroups of this group. We prove that none of these restrictions appears in the case of Abelian symmetries. This result suggests that global non-Abelian symmetries may affect the thermalization of quantum systems in ways not possible under Abelian symmetries.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ray Ganardi, Tulja Varun Kondra, Alexander Streltsov</p>
            <p>Entanglement is a fundamental resource in quantum information processing, yet understanding its manipulation and transformation remains a challenge. Many tasks rely on highly entangled pure states, but obtaining such states is often challenging due to the presence of noise. Typically, entanglement manipulation procedures involving asymptotically many copies of a state are considered to overcome this problem. These procedures allow for distilling highly entangled pure states from noisy states, which enables a wide range of applications, such as quantum teleportation and quantum cryptography. When it comes to manipulating entangled quantum systems on a single copy level, using entangled states as catalysts can significantly broaden the range of achievable transformations. Similar to the concept of catalysis in chemistry, the entangled catalyst is returned unchanged at the end of the state manipulation procedure. Our results demonstrate that despite the apparent conceptual differences between the asymptotic and catalytic settings, they are actually strongly connected and fully equivalent for all distillable states. Our methods rely on the analysis of many-copy entanglement manipulation procedures which may establish correlations between different copies. As an important consequence, we demonstrate that using an entangled catalyst cannot enhance the asymptotic singlet distillation rate of a distillable quantum state. Our findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the capabilities and limitations of both catalytic and asymptotic state transformations of entangled states, and highlight the importance of correlations in these processes.</p>

            <p>As a signal recovery algorithm, compressed sensing is particularly useful when the data has low-complexity and samples are rare, which matches perfectly with the task of quantum phase estimation (QPE). In this work we present a new Heisenberg-limited QPE algorithm for early quantum computers based on compressed sensing. More specifically, given many copies of a proper initial state and queries to some unitary operators, our algorithm is able to recover the frequency with a total runtime $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-1}\text{poly}\log(\epsilon^{-1}))$, where $\epsilon$ is the accuracy. Moreover, the maximal runtime satisfies $T_{\max}\epsilon \ll \pi$, which is comparable to the state of art algorithms, and our algorithm is also robust against certain amount of noise from sampling. We also consider the more general quantum eigenvalue estimation problem (QEEP) and show numerically that the off-grid compressed sensing can be a strong candidate for solving the QEEP.</p>

            <p>We argue that Hilbert spaces are not suitable to represent quantum states mathematically, in the sense that they require properties that are untenable by physical entities. We first demonstrate that the requirements posited by complex inner product spaces are physically justified. We then show that completeness in the infinite-dimensional case requires the inclusion of states with infinite expectations, coordinate transformations that take finite expectations to infinite ones and vice versa, and time evolutions that transform finite expectations to infinite ones in finite time. This means we should be wary of using Hilbert spaces to represent quantum states as they turn a potential infinity into an actual infinity. The main point of the paper, then, is to raise awareness that results that rely on the completeness of Hilbert spaces may not be physically significant. While we do not claim to know what a physically more appropriate closure should be, we note that Schwartz spaces, among other things, guarantee that the expectations of all polynomials of position and momentum are finite, their elements are uniquely identified by these expectations, and they are closed under Fourier transform.</p>

As a matter of fact, superposition of orders can be exploited within the quantum computing domain as well, by relaxing the (traditional) assumption underlying quantum computation about applying gates in a well-defined causal order. In this context, we address a fundamental question arising with quantum computing: whether superposed orders of single-qubit gates can enable universal quantum computation. As shown in this paper, the answer to this key question is a definitive "yes". Indeed, we prove that any two-qubit controlled quantum gate can be deterministically realized, including the so-called Barenco gate that alone enables universal quantum computation.</p>

We demonstrate this fascinating property first on the configuration comprising all 315 contexts of the space and then on doilies, both types of quadrics as well as on complements of skew-embedded hexagons. In connection with the last-mentioned case and elliptic quadrics we also conducted some experimental tests on a Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) computer to substantiate our theoretical findings.</p>

Additionally, we present the sequential procedure of our suggested approach and demonstrate empirical proof to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in finding the optimal asset allocations across various constraints and asset choices. Moreover, we discuss the effectiveness of the QAOA components in relation to our proposed method. Consequently, our study successfully achieves the approximate ratio of the portfolio optimization technique using a circuit layer of p>=3, compared to the classical best-known solution of the knapsack problem. Our proposed methods potentially contribute to the growing field of quantum finance by offering insights into the potential benefits of employing quantum algorithms for complex optimization tasks in financial portfolio management.</p>

We here circumvent these negative results by constructing a hierarchy of efficiently trainable QNNs that exhibit unconditionally provable, polynomial memory separations of arbitrary constant degree over classical neural networks -- including state-of-the-art models, such as Transformers -- in performing a classical sequence modeling task. This construction is also computationally efficient, as each unit cell of the introduced class of QNNs only has constant gate complexity. We show that contextuality -- informally, a quantitative notion of semantic ambiguity -- is the source of the expressivity separation, suggesting that other learning tasks with this property may be a natural setting for the use of quantum learning algorithms.</p>

            <p>Quantum sensors have notably advanced high-sensitivity magnetic field detection. Here, we report quantum sensors constructed from polarized spin-triplet electrons in photoexcited organic chromophores, specifically focusing on pentacene-doped para-terphenyl (${\approx}$0.1%). We demonstrate essential quantum sensing properties at room temperature: electronic optical polarization and state-dependent fluorescence contrast, by leveraging differential pumping and relaxation rates between triplet and ground states. We measure high optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) contrast ${\approx}16.8\%$ of the triplet states at room temperature, along with long coherence times under spin echo and CPMG sequences, $T_2{=}2.7\mu$s and $T_2^{DD}{=}18.4\mu$s respectively, limited only by the triplet lifetimes. The material offers several advantages for quantum sensing, including the ability to grow large ($cm$-scale) crystals at low cost, the absence of paramagnetic impurities, and the diamagnetism of electronic states used for sensing when not optically illuminated. Utilizing pentacene as a representative of a broader class of spin triplet-polarizable organic molecules, this study highlights new potential for quantum sensing in chemical systems.</p>

            <h2>On the exact solution for the Schr\"odinger equation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yair Mulian</p>
            <p>For almost 75 years, the general solution for the Schr√∂dinger equation was assumed to be generated by an exponential or a time-ordered exponential known as the Dyson series. We study the unitarity of a solution in the case of a singular Hamiltonian and provide a new methodology that is not based on the assumption that the underlying space is $L^{2}(\mathbb{R})$. Then, an alternative operator for generating the time evolution that is manifestly unitary is suggested, regardless of the choice of Hamiltonian. The new construction involves an additional positive operator that normalizes the wave function locally and allows us to preserve unitarity, even when dealing with infinite dimensional or non-normed spaces. Our considerations show that Schr√∂dinger and Liouville equations are, in fact, two sides of the same coin and together they provide a unified description for unbounded quantum systems.</p>

            <p>In [Entropy 25, 564 (2023)] I considered the problem of wavefunction ensembles for spin models. To observe magnetization at finite temperature, I had to add macroscopic nonlinear terms blocking macroscopic superpositions by energy conservation. The nonlinear terms were of the kind introduced in [W.D. Wick, arXiv:1710.03278 (2017)] to block spatial cats by energy conservation as solution to the Measurement Problem. Reviewing the theory from [W.D. Wick, arXiv:1710.03278 (2017), arXiv:1908.02352 (2019)], I derive a commutation relation that these nonlinear terms have to satisfy to be admitted and show that the terms of [W.D. Wick, arXiv:1710.03278 (2017), arXiv:2008.08663 (2020)] restricting the wavefunctions in space satisfies such relations. I generalize the terms of [Entropy 25, 564 (2023)] for non-pure spin models and check if they also satisfy the constraints, concluding with a negative answer. An experimental estimate to test the proposal of [W.D. Wick, arXiv:1710.03278 (2017)] is described at the end.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jos√© A. Almanza-Marrero, Gonzalo Manzano</p>
            <p>Quantum coherence has been shown to impact the operational capabilities of quantum systems performing thermodynamic tasks in a significant way, and yet the possibility and conditions for genuine coherence-enhanced thermodynamic operation remain unclear. We show that for steady-state quantum thermal machines -- both autonomous and externally driven -- that interact weakly with thermal reservoirs and work sources, the presence of coherence induced by perturbations in the machine Hamiltonian guarantees a genuine thermodynamic advantage. Such advantage applies both for the cases in which the induced coherence is between levels with different energies or between degenerate levels. On the other hand, we show that engines subjected to noise-induced coherence, can be outperformed by classical stochastic engines using exactly the same set of (incoherent) resources. We illustrate our results with three prototypical models of heat engines and refrigerators and employ multi-objective optimization techniques to characterize quantum-enhanced regimes in connection with the thermodynamic uncertainty relation and beyond it.</p>

            <p>We explore the potential for hybrid development of quantum hardware where currently available quantum computers simulate open Cavity Quantum Electrodynamical (CQED) systems for applications in optical quantum communication, simulation and computing. Our simulations make use of a recent quantum algorithm that maps the dynamics of a singly excited open Tavis-Cummings model containing N atoms coupled to a lossy cavity. We report the results of executing this algorithm on two noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers: a superconducting processor and a trapped ion processor, to simulate the population dynamics of an open CQED system featuring N = 3 atoms. By applying technology-specific transpilation and error mitigation techniques, we minimize the impact of gate errors, noise, and decoherence in each hardware platform, obtaining results which agree closely with the exact solution of the system. These results can be used as a recipe for efficient and platform-specific quantum simulation of cavity-emitter systems on contemporary and future quantum computers.</p>

            <h2>Overcoming the fundamental limit of quantum transduction via intraband entanglement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haowei Shi, Quntao Zhuang</p>
            <p>A quantum transducer converts an input signal to an output probe at a distant frequency band while maintaining the quantum information with high fidelity, which is crucial for quantum networking and distributed quantum sensing and computing. In terms of microwave-optical quantum transduction, the state-of-the-art quantum transducers suffer low transduction efficiency from weak nonlinear coupling, wherein increasing pump power to enhance efficiency inevitably leads to thermal noise from heating. Moreover, we reveal that the efficiency-bandwidth product of a cavity electro-optical or electro-optomechanical transducer is fundamentally limited by pump power and nonlinear coupling coefficient, irrespective of cavity engineering efforts. To overcome this fundamental limit, we propose to noiselessly boost the transduction efficiency by consuming intraband entanglement (e.g., microwave-microwave or optical-optical entanglement in the case of microwave-optical transduction). Via a squeezer-coupler-antisqueezer sandwich structure, the protocol enhances the transduction efficiency to unity in the ideal lossless case, given an arbitrarily weak pump and nonlinear coupling. In practical cavity systems, our entanglement-assisted protocol surpasses the non-assisted fundamental limit of the efficiency-bandwidth product and reduces the threshold cooperativity for positive quantum capacity by a factor proportional to two-mode squeezing gain. Given a fixed cooperativity, our approach increases the broadband quantum capacity by orders of magnitude. The entanglement-assisted advantage is robust to ancilla loss and cavity detuning.</p>

            <p>We present a hierarchical test, average randomness, that verifies the compatibility of a set of quantum states $S$ with the $t$-moments of the Haar-random distribution. To check such compatibility, we consider the expectation values of states in $S$ with respect to a chosen observable, with focus on their statistical moments. Our first result is a connection between Haar-randomness and the Dirichlet distribution, providing a closed-form expression for the expectation values, as well as and their statistical moments, including simple bounds for the latter. The average randomness metric compares the measured statistical properties of $S$ with those arising from Dirichlet distribution. When it vanishes, $S$ is compatible with being a $t$-design, as seen through the observable $\Obs$, defined as $\Obs$-shadowed $t$-designs. By permutation- and unitary-equivalent randomization of observable, we are able to extend the analysis of average randomness to statistically verify the compatibility of $S$ with $t$-designs. We envision the use of average randomness verification as a practical test for the randomness sets of states with no prior information available.</p>

            <h2>Saturation of the Multiparameter Quantum Cram\'er-Rao Bound at the Single-Copy Level with Projective Measurements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hendra I. Nurdin</p>
            <p>Quantum parameter estimation theory is an important component of quantum information theory and provides the statistical foundation that underpins important topics such as quantum system identification and quantum waveform estimation. When there is more than one parameter the ultimate precision in the mean square error given by the quantum Cram√©r-Rao bound is not necessarily achievable. For non-full rank quantum states, it was not known when this bound can be saturated (achieved) when only a single copy of the quantum state encoding the unknown parameters is available. This single-copy scenario is important because of its experimental/practical tractability. Recently, necessary and sufficient conditions for saturability of the quantum Cram√©r-Rao bound in the multiparameter single-copy scenario have been established in terms of i) the commutativity of a set of projected symmetric logarithmic derivatives and ii) the existence of a unitary solution to a system of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations. New sufficient conditions were also obtained that only depend on properties of the symmetric logarithmic derivatives. In this paper, key structural properties of optimal measurements that saturate the quantum Cram√©r-Rao bound are illuminated. These properties are exploited to i) show that the sufficient conditions are in fact necessary and sufficient for an optimal measurement to be projective, ii) give an alternative proof of previously established necessary conditions, and iii) describe general POVMs, not necessarily projective, that saturate the multiparameter QCRB. Examples are given where a unitary solution to the system of nonlinear partial differential equations can be explicitly calculated when the required conditions are fulfilled.</p>

            <h2>On computing quantum waves and spin from classical action</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Winfried Lohmiller, Jean-Jacques Slotine</p>
            <p>We show that the Schr√∂dinger equation of quantum physics can be solved analytically using a generalized form of the classical Hamilton-Jacobi least action equation, extending a key result of Feynman. This suggests a smooth transition between physics across scales, and builds on two developments. The first is incorporating geometric constraints directly in the classical local least action problem. This leads to multi-valued least action solutions, where each local action is its own set element. For instance, in the double slit experiment or for a particle in a box, spatial inequality constraints create impulsive constraint forces, which lead to multiple paths and create multiple least action branches. Multi-valued least actions may also stem from singularities in the Hamiltonian, as for a particle in a Coulomb potential, or from a closed configuration manifold, as for a spinning particle. Second, approximate mappings from action $\Phi$ to wave function $\Psi$ have been suggested since Dirac and even Schr√∂dinger. We show that an exact mapping can be constructed by combining the multi-valued least actions with the fluid density $\rho$ of the classical position dynamics, computed from $\Phi$ along each least action branch. Quantum wave collapse corresponds to transitions between multi-valued least action branches at the branch point (position measurement), or to a measurement of the branch index (momentum measurement). These coordinate-invariant results provide a simpler computing alternative to Feynman path integrals, as they use only a discrete set of classical paths and avoid zig-zag paths and time-slicing altogether. They extend to the relativistic Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations.</p>

Specifically we map the HUBO problem to quantum Z2 lattice gauge theory defined on the dual graph, and propose the so-called gauged local quantum annealing (gLQA), which is the local quantum annealing (LQA) protected by the gauge symmetry. By running the quantum-inspired classical algorithm, we demonstrate that gLQA reduces the computational time by one order of magnitude from that of LQA.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Linjian Ma, Matthew Fishman, Miles Stoudenmire, Edgar Solomonik</p>
            <p>Tensor network contractions are widely used in statistical physics, quantum computing, and computer science. We introduce a method to efficiently approximate tensor network contractions using low-rank approximations, where each intermediate tensor generated during the contractions is approximated as a low-rank binary tree tensor network. The proposed algorithm has the flexibility to incorporate a large portion of the environment when performing low-rank approximations, which can lead to high accuracy for a given rank. Here, the environment refers to the remaining set of tensors in the network, and low-rank approximations with larger environments can generally provide higher accuracy. For contracting tensor networks defined on lattices, the proposed algorithm can be viewed as a generalization of the standard boundary-based algorithms. In addition, the algorithm includes a cost-efficient density matrix algorithm for approximating a tensor network with a general graph structure into a tree structure, whose computational cost is asymptotically upper-bounded by that of the standard algorithm that uses canonicalization. Experimental results indicate that the proposed technique outperforms previously proposed approximate tensor network contraction algorithms for multiple problems in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Detection of Recurrent Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michael H. Freedman</p>
            <p>Quantum dynamics that explore an unexpectedly small fraction of Hilbert space is inherently interesting. Integrable systems, quantum scars, MBL, hidden tensor structures, and systems with gauge symmetries are examples. Beyond dimension and volume, spectral features such as an $O(1)$-density of periodic eigenvalues, or other spectral features, can also imply observable recurrence. Low volume dynamics will recur near its initial state $| \psi_0\rangle$ more rapidly, i.e. $\lVert\mathrm{U}^k | \psi_0\rangle - | \psi_0\rangle \rVert < \epsilon$, is more likely to occur for modest values of $k$, when the (forward) orbit $\operatorname{closure}(\{\mathrm{U}^k\}_{k=1,2,\dots})$ is of relatively low dimension $d$ and relatively small $d$-volume. We describe simple quantum algorithms to detect such approximate recurrence. Applications include detection of certain cases of hidden tensor factorizations $\mathrm{U} \cong V^\dagger(\mathrm{U}_1\otimes \cdots \otimes \mathrm{U}_n)V$. "Hidden" refers to an unknown conjugation, e.g. $\mathrm{U}_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathrm{U}_v \rightarrow V^\dagger(\mathrm{U}_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathrm{U}_n)V$, which will obscure the low-volume nature of the dynamics. Hidden tensor structures have been observed to emerge both in a high energy context of operator-level spontaneous symmetry breaking [FSZ21a, FSZ21b, FSZ21c, SZBF23], and at the opposite end of the intellectual world in linguistics [Smo09, MLDS19]. We collect some observations on the computational difficulty of locating these structures and detecting related spectral information. A technical result, Appendix A, is that the language describing unitary circuits with no spectral gap (NUSG) around 1 is QMA-complete. Appendix B connects the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem to hidden tensor structures.</p>

            <h2>Optimizing entanglement in two-qubit systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Salvio Luna-Hernandez, Claudia Quintana, Oscar Rosas-Ortiz</p>
            <p>We investigate entanglement in two-qubit systems using a geometric representation based on the minimum of essential parameters. The latter is achieved by requiring subsystems with the same entropy, regardless of whether the state of the entire system is pure or mixed. The geometric framework is provided by a convex set S that forms a right-triangle, whose points are linked to just two of the coherences of the system under study. As a result, we find that optimized states of two qubits are X-shaped and host pairs of identical populations while reducing the number of coherences involved. A geometric L-measure of entanglement is introduced as the distance between the points in S that represent entangled states and the closest point that defines separable states. It is shown that L reproduces the results of the Hill-Wootters concurrence C, so that C can be interpreted as a distance-like entanglement measure. However, unlike C, the measure L also distinguishes the rank of states. The universality of the two-qubit X-states ensures the utility of our geometric model for studying entanglement of two-qubit states in any configuration. To show the applicability of our approach far beyond time-independent cases, we construct a time-dependent two-qubit state, traced out over the complementary components of a pure tetra-partite system, and find that its one-qubit states share the same entropy. The entanglement measure results bounded from above by the envelope of the minima of such entropy.</p>

            <p>Quantum interconnects facilitate entanglement distribution between non-local computational nodes. For superconducting processors, microwave photons are a natural means to mediate this distribution. However, many existing architectures limit node connectivity and directionality. In this work, we construct a chiral quantum interconnect between two nominally identical modules in separate microwave packages. We leverage quantum interference to emit and absorb microwave photons on demand and in a chosen direction between these modules. We optimize the protocol using model-free reinforcement learning to maximize absorption efficiency. By halting the emission process halfway through its duration, we generate remote entanglement between modules in the form of a four-qubit W state with 62.4 +/- 1.6% (leftward photon propagation) and 62.1 +/- 1.2% (rightward) fidelity, limited mainly by propagation loss. A chiral quantum network comprising many modules provides a platform for the exploration of novel many-body physics and quantum simulation. This quantum network architecture enables all-to-all connectivity between non-local processors for modular and extensible quantum computation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> N. Ghorbani, Ali Motazedifard, M. H. Naderi</p>
            <p>We theoretically investigate the steady-state bipartite entanglements, mechanical ground-state cooling, and mechanical quadrature squeezing in a hybrid electro-optomechanical system where a moving membrane is linearly coupled to the microwave field mode of an LC circuit, while it simultaneously interacts both linearly and quadratically with the radiation pressure of a single-mode optical cavity. We show that by choosing a suitable sign and amplitude for the quadratic optomechanical coupling (QOC), one can achieve enhanced and thermally robust stationary bipartite entanglement between the subsystems, improved mechanical ground-state cooling, and Q-quadrature squeezing of the mechanical mode beyond the 3-dB limit of squeezing. In particular, we find that in the presence of QOC with negative sign and in the resolved sideband regime the bipartite optical-mechanical entanglement can be increased by about 2 order of magnitude around the temperature of 1mK, and it can be preserved against thermal noise up to the ambient temperature of 0.1K. Furthermore, the QOC with positive sign can give rise to the enhancement of the mechanical ground-state cooling by about 1 order of magnitude in the optical and microwave red-detuned regime. We also find that for the positive sign of QOC and near the microwave resonance frequency the squeezing degree of the Q-quadrature of the mechanical mode can be amplified up to 15 dB. Such a hybrid electro-optomechanical system can serve as a promising platform to engineer an improved entangled source for quantum sensing as well as quantum information processing.</p>

The system exhibits two distinct dynamic behaviors separated by an exceptional point: one in the $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetrical region associated with two real Wannier-Stark ladders, and another in the $\mathcal{PT}$\ symmetry-breaking region associated with complex conjugate ladders. As the boundary between the two regions, two ladders coalesce into a single ladder. In the case of a non-linear field, these two distinct regions appear alternately along the chain, exhibiting dynamic Moir√©-like patterns.</p>

            <p>The dimension of a quantum state is traditionally seen as the number of superposed distinguishable states in a given basis. We propose an absolute, i.e.~basis-independent, notion of dimensionality for ensembles of quantum states. It is based on whether a quantum ensemble can be simulated with states confined to arbitrary lower-dimensional subspaces and classical postprocessing. In order to determine the absolute dimension of quantum ensembles, we develop both analytical witness criteria and a semidefinite programming criterion based on the ensemble's information capacity. Furthermore, we construct explicit simulation models for arbitrary ensembles of pure quantum states subject to white noise, and in natural cases we prove their optimality. Also, efficient numerical methods are provided for simulating generic ensembles. Finally, we discuss the role of absolute dimensionality in high-dimensional quantum information processing.</p>

            <p>Transporting and connecting quantum states are key capabilities for larger-scale quantum information processing. Concrete challenges are the coherent shuttling and the manipulation of distant quantum states in an optical lattice. Here, we create spin singlet pairs of two magnetic states of fermionic potassium-40 atoms in an optical lattice and use a bi-directional topological Thouless pump to transport, coherently split, and separate the pairs, as well as to demonstrate interaction between them via tuneable $($swap$)^\alpha$-gate operations. We achieve pair pumping with a single-shift fidelity of 99.78(3)% over 50 lattice sites and split the pairs within a decoherence-free subspace. Gates are implemented by superexchange interaction, allowing us to produce interwoven spin singlets. For read-out, we apply a magnetic field gradient, resulting in single- and multi-frequency singlet-triplet oscillations. Our work shows avenues to create complex patterns of entanglement and new approaches to quantum processing, sensing, and atom interferometry.</p>

            <h2>Enaction for QBists</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amanda Gefter</p>
            <p>This paper began as a set of notes introducing quantum physicists of the QBist persuasion to enactive theory. Unlike mainstream cognitive science, which views cognition as computations on internal representations of the external world (and thus the mind as in the head), the enactive approach sees cognition as adaptive, embodied action. Enaction can ground concepts of experience, agency, knowledge, and normativity - which play key roles in QBist quantum mechanics - in terms consistent with QBism's participatory approach. That's because QBism and enaction both reject an absolute, pregiven subject-object split: for QBism, quantum measurement is the enactment of the subject-object divide; for enaction, cognition is the enactment of that divide. Indeed, each appears to be half of the same story. QBism is a theory of how the world is created and recreated through interactions with an agent, while enaction is a theory of how agents are created and recreated through interactions with the world. Through conversations with QBists and enactivists, these notes evolved into a larger project aimed at unifying QBist physics with enactive cognitive science. Taken together, they offer the possibility of a unified metaphysics - one that brings subject and object, mind and world, back together again.</p>

            <h2>Processing and Decoding Rydberg Leakage Error with MBQC</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cheng-Cheng Yu, Zi-Han Chen, Yu-Hao Deng, Ming-Cheng Chen, Chao-Yang Lu, Jian-Wei Pan</p>
            <p>Neutral atom array has emerged as a promising platform for quantum computation due to its high-fidelity two-qubit gate, arbitrary connectivity and remarkable scalability. However, achieving fault-tolerant quantum computing with neutral atom necessitates careful consideration of the errors inherent to these systems. One typical error is the leakage from Rydberg states during the implementation of multi-qubit gates, which induces two-qubit error chain and degrades the error distance. To address this, researchers have proposed an erasure conversion protocol that employs fast leakage detection and continuous atomic replacement to convert leakage errors into benign erasure errors. While this method achieves a favorable error distance de = d, its applicability is restricted to certain atom species. In this work, we present a novel approach to manage Rydberg leakage errors in measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC). From a hardware perspective, we utilize practical experimental techniques along with an adaptation of the Pauli twirling approximation (PTA) to mitigate the impacts of leakage errors, which propagate similarly to Pauli errors without degrading the error distance. From a decoding perspective, we leverage the inherent structure of topological cluster states and final leakage detection information to locate propagated errors from Rydberg leakage. This approach eliminates the need for mid-circuit leakage detection, while maintaining an error distance de = d and achieving a high threshold of 3.4% per CZ gate for pure leakage errors under perfect final leakage detection. Furthermore, in the presence of additional Pauli errors, our protocol demonstrates comparable logical error rates to the erasure conversion method within a reasonable range of physical errors.</p>

            <p>In two prior papers of this series, it was proposed that a wavefunction model of a heavy particle and a collection of light particles might generate ``Brownian-Motion-Like" trajectories as well as diffusive motion (displacement proportional to the square-root of time) of the heavy particle, but did not exhibit a concrete instance. Here we introduce a one-space-dimensional model which, granted a finite perturbation series, fulfills the criteria for BML trajectories and diffusion. We note that Planck's constant makes an appearance in the diffusion coefficient, which further differentiates the present theory from the work of Poincare and Einstein in the previous century.</p>

            <p>Designs, structures connected to averaging with respect to a given measure using finite sets of points, have proven themselves as invaluable tools across the field of quantum information, finding their uses in state and process tomography, key distribution and others. In this work, we introduce a new concept of pushforward designs, which allows us to obtain new structures from already existing ones by mapping them between the spaces, with specific examples including simplex designs and mixed state designs from complex projective designs. Based on the general concept, we put forward a structure called channel $[t,k]$-design, allowing for averaging over space of quantum channels for systems in contact with an environment of dimension $k$. Based on this notion, we introduce the concept of effective environment dimensionality $k^*$, which we estimate for the IBM Kyoto quantum computer to be below $2.2$ for times up to $350\mu\text{s}$.</p>

            <p>Competition among repetitive measurements of noncommuting observables and unitary dynamics can give rise to a rich variety of entanglement phases. We here characterize topological phases in monitored quantum systems by their spectrum and many-body topological invariants. We analyze (1+1)-dimensional monitored circuits for Majorana fermions, which have topological and trivial area-law entangled phases and a critical phase with sub-volume-law entanglement, through the Lyapunov spectrum. We uncover the presence (absence) of edge-localized zero modes inside the bulk gap in the topological (trivial) area-law phase and a bulk gapless spectrum in the critical phase. Furthermore, by suitably exploiting the fermion parity with twisted measurement outcomes at the boundary, we construct a topological invariant that sharply distinguishes the two area-law phases and dynamically characterizes the critical phase. Our work thus paves the way to extend the bulk-edge correspondence for topological phases from equilibrium to monitored quantum dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Assessing fault-tolerant quantum advantage for $k$-SAT with structure</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martijn Brehm, Jordi Weggemans</p>
            <p>For many problems, quantum algorithms promise speedups over their classical counterparts. However, these results predominantly rely on asymptotic worst-case analysis, which overlooks significant overheads due to error correction and the fact that real-world instances often contain exploitable structure. In this work, we employ the hybrid benchmarking method to evaluate the potential of quantum Backtracking and Grover's algorithm against the 2023 SAT competition main track winner in solving random $k$-SAT instances with tunable structure, designed to represent industry-like scenarios, using both $T$-depth and $T$-count as cost metrics to estimate quantum run times. Our findings reproduce the results of Campbell, Khurana, and Montanaro (Quantum '19) in the unstructured case using hybrid benchmarking. However, we offer a more sobering perspective in practically relevant regimes: almost all quantum speedups vanish, even asymptotically, when minimal structure is introduced or when $T$-count is considered instead of $T$-depth. Moreover, when the requirement is for the algorithm to find a solution within a single day, we find that only Grover's algorithm has the potential to outperform classical algorithms, but only in a very limited regime and only when using $T$-depth. We also discuss how more sophisticated heuristics could restore the asymptotic scaling advantage for quantum backtracking, but our findings suggest that the potential for practical quantum speedups in more structured $k$-SAT solving will remain limited.</p>

            <h2>Topological phases of unitary dynamics: Classification in Clifford category</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jeongwan Haah</p>
            <p>A quantum cellular automaton (QCA) or a causal unitary is by definition an automorphism of local operator algebra, by which local operators are mapped to local operators. Quantum circuits of small depth, local Hamiltonian evolutions for short time, and translations (shifts) are examples. A Clifford QCA is one that maps any Pauli operator to a finite tensor product of Pauli operators. Here, we obtain a complete table of groups $\mathfrak C(\mathsf d,p)$ of translation invariant Clifford QCA in any spatial dimension $\mathsf d \ge 0$ modulo Clifford quantum circuits and shifts over prime $p$-dimensional qudits, where the circuits and shifts are allowed to obey only coarser translation invariance. The group $\mathfrak C(\mathsf d,p)$ is nonzero only for $\mathsf d = 2k+3$ if $p=2$ and $\mathsf d = 4k+3$ if $p$ is odd where~$k \ge 0$ is any integer, in which case $\mathfrak C(\mathsf d,p) \cong \widetilde{\mathfrak W}(\mathbb F_p)$, the classical Witt group of nonsingular quadratic forms over the finite field $\mathbb F_p$. It is well known that $\widetilde{\mathfrak W}(\mathbb F_2) \cong \mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z$, $\widetilde{\mathfrak W}(\mathbb F_p) \cong \mathbb Z/4\mathbb Z$ if $p = 3 \bmod 4$, and $\widetilde{\mathfrak W}(\mathbb F_p)\cong \mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z \oplus \mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z$ if $p = 1 \bmod 4$. The classification is achieved by a dimensional descent, which is a reduction of Laurent extension theorems for algebraic $L$-groups of surgery theory in topology.</p>

            <h2>Many-body effects in a composite bosonic Josephson junction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sudip Kumar Haldar, Anal Bhowmik</p>
            <p>In standard bosonic Josephson junctions (BJJs), particles tunnel between two single-well potentials linked by a finite barrier. The dynamics of standard BJJs have been extensively studied, both at the many-body and mean-field levels of theory. In the present work, we introduce the concept of a composite BJJ. In a composite BJJ, particles tunnel between two double-well potentials linked by a finite potential barrier between them. We focus on many-body facets of quantum dynamics and investigate how the complex structure of the junction influences tunneling. Employing the multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree for bosons method, highly-accurate many-boson wave-functions are obtained from which properties are computed. We analyze the dynamics using the survival probability, the degree of fragmentation of the junction, and the fluctuations of observables, and discuss how many-boson tunneling behaves, and how it may be controlled, using the composite nature of the junction. A central result of this work relates to the degree of fragmentation of composite BJJs with different numbers of bosons. We provide strong evidence that a universal degree of fragmentation into multiple time-dependent modes takes place. Further applications are briefly discussed.</p>

Three-photon excitation of the $^{1}S_{0}$$\leftrightarrow$$^{3}P_{1}$ transition enables high-contrast Ramsey spectroscopy with interrogation times comparable to the 21$\mu$s natural lifetime using a single near-resonant laser source. Three-photon spectroscopy on the $^{1}S_{0}$$\leftrightarrow$$^{3}P_{0}$ clock transition, using only laser frequencies nearly resonant with the $^{1}S_{0}$$\leftrightarrow$$^{3}P_{0}$ and $^{1}S_{0}$$\leftrightarrow$$^{3}P_{1}$ transitions, enables a reduction in Doppler broadening by two orders of magnitude and a corresponding $\sim470$Hz linewidth without a confining potential.</p>

            <p>Quantum machine learning is a new research field combining quantum information science and machine learning. Quantum computing technologies appear to be particularly well-suited for addressing problems in the health sector efficiently. They have the potential to handle large datasets more effectively than classical models and offer greater transparency and interpretability for clinicians. Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative brain disorder that mostly affects elderly people, causing important cognitive impairments. It is the most common cause of dementia and it has an effect on memory, thought, learning abilities and movement control. This type of disease has no cure, consequently an early diagnosis is fundamental for reducing its impact. The analysis of handwriting can be effective for diagnosing, as many researches have conjectured. The DARWIN (Diagnosis AlzheimeR WIth haNdwriting) dataset contains handwriting samples from people affected by Alzheimer's disease and a group of healthy people. Here we apply quantum AI to this use-case. In particular, we use this dataset to test classical methods for classification and compare their performances with the ones obtained via quantum machine learning methods. We find that quantum methods generally perform better than classical methods. Our results pave the way for future new quantum machine learning applications in early-screening diagnostics in the healthcare domain.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate that rotation symmetry is not a necessary requirement for the existence of fractional corner charges in Cn-symmetric higher-order topological crystalline insulators. Instead, it is sufficient to have a latent rotation symmetry, which may be revealed upon performing an isospectral reduction on the system. We introduce the concept of a filling anomaly for latent crystalline symmetric systems, and propose modified topological invariants. The notion of higher-order topology in two dimensions protected by Cn symmetry is thus generalized to a protection by latent symmetry. Our claims are corroborated by concrete examples of models that show non-trivial corner charge in the absence of Cn-symmetry. This work extends the classification of topological crystalline insulators to include latent symmetries.</p>

            <p>In the zoo of emergent symmetries in quantum many-body physics, the previously unrealized emergent spacetime supersymmetry (SUSY) is particularly intriguing. Although it was known that spacetime SUSY could emerge at the (1+1)d tricritical Ising transition, an experimental realization is still absent. In this work, we propose to realize emergent spacetime SUSY using reconfigurable Rydberg atom arrays featuring two distinct sets of Rydberg excitations, tailored for implementation on dual-species platforms. In such systems, the spacetime SUSY manifests itself in the respective correlation functions of a bosonic mode and its fermionic partner. However, the correlation function of the fermionic mode inevitably involves a string operator, making direct measurement challenging in the conventional setting. Here, we leverage the hybrid analog-digital nature of the Rydberg atom arrays, which allows for the simulation of a physical Hamiltonian and the execution of a digital quantum circuit on the same platform. This hybrid protocol offers a new perspective for uncovering the hidden structure of emergent spacetime SUSY.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ken Funo, Hiroyasu Tajima</p>
            <p>Symmetry imposes constraints on open quantum systems, affecting the dissipative properties in nonequilibrium processes. Superradiance is a typical example in which the decay rate of the system is enhanced via a collective system-bath coupling that respects permutation symmetry. Such model has also been applied to heat engines. However, a generic framework that addresses the impact of symmetry in finite-time thermodynamics is not well established. Here, we show a symmetry-based framework that describes the fundamental limit of collective enhancement in finite-time thermodynamics. Specifically, we derive a general upper bound on the average jump rate, which quantifies the fundamental speed set by thermodynamic speed limits and trade-off relations. We identify the symmetry condition which achieves the obtained bound, and explicitly construct an open quantum system model that goes beyond the enhancement realized by the conventional superradiance model.</p>

Through systematic experimental characterization, we find that the periodically poled TFLN waveguide retains its high conversion efficiency at both cryogenic and room temperatures for both classical second-harmonic generation and quantum photon-pair generation processes. Particularly, the photon-pair source at cryogenic condition shows high brightness and broad bandwidth. These results demonstrate the significant potential of TFLN wavelength conversion devices for cryogenic applications and foster future scalable quantum photonic systems.</p>

            <p>Active wave-particle entities (WPEs) emerge as self-propelled oil droplets on the free surface of a vibrating oil bath. The particle (droplet) periodically imprints decaying waves on the liquid surface which in turn guide the particle motion, resulting in a two-way coupling between the particle and its self-generated waves. Such WPEs have been shown to exhibit hydrodynamic analogs of various quantum features. In this work, we theoretically and numerically explore a dynamical analog of tunneling by considering a simple setup of a one-dimensional WPE incident on an isolated Gaussian potential barrier. Our idealized model takes the form of a perturbed Lorenz system which we use to explore the dynamics and statistics of barrier crossing as a function of initial conditions and system parameters. Our work highlights that velocity fluctuations of the WPE at high memories that are rooted in non-equilibrium features of the Lorenz system, such as spiraling motion towards equilibrium points and transient chaos, give rise to - (i) sensitivity and unpredictability in barrier crossing, (ii) smooth variations in transmission probability as a function of system parameters, and (iii) wave-like features in the transmitted and reflected probability density profiles.</p>

            <p>We highlight the structure and properties of an abstract approach to quantum cosmology and gravity, dubbed $SU(\infty)$-QGR. Beginning from the concept of the Universe as an isolated quantum system, the main axiom of is the existence of an infinite number of mutually commuting observables. Consequently, the Hilbert space of the Universe represents $SU(\infty)$ symmetry. This Universe as a whole is static and topological. Nonetheless, quantum fluctuations induce local clustering in its quantum state and divide it into approximately isolated subsystems representing $G \times SU(\infty)$, where $G$ is a generic finite-rank internal symmetry. Due to the global $SU(\infty)$ subsystems are entangled to the rest of the Universe. In addition to parameters characterizing the representation of $G$, their quantum states depend on four continuous parameters: two of them characterize the representation of $SU(\infty)$, a dimensionful parameter arises from the possibility of comparing representations of $SU(\infty)$ by different subsystems; the fourth parameter is a measurable used as time registered by an arbitrary subsystem chosen as a clock. It introduces a relative dynamics for subsystems, formulated by a symmetry-invariant effective Lagrangian defined on the (3+1)D space of the continuous parameters. At lowest quantum order, the Lagrangian is a Yang--Mills field theory for both $SU(\infty)$ and internal symmetries. We identify the common $SU(\infty)$ symmetry and its interaction with gravity. Consequently, $SU(\infty)$-QGR predicts a spin-1 mediator for quantum gravity (QGR). Apparently, this is in contradiction with classical gravity. Nonetheless, we show that an observer who is unable to detect the quantumness of gravity perceives its effect as curvature of the space of average values of the continuous parameters. We demonstrate Lorentzian geometry of this emergent classical spacetime.</p>

            <p>In the past couple of decades, there have been significant advances in measuring quantum properties of light, such as quadratures of squeezed light and single-photon counting. Here, we explore whether such tools can be leveraged to probe electronic correlations in the many-body quantum regime. Specifically, we show that it is possible to probe certain spin, charge, and topological orders in an electronic system by measuring the correlation functions of scattered photons. We construct a mapping from the correlators of the scattered photons to those of a correlated insulator, particularly for Mott insulators described by a single-band Fermi-Hubbard model at half-filling. We show that frequency filtering before photodetection plays a crucial role in determining this mapping. We find that if the ground state of the insulator is a gapped spin liquid, a photon-pair correlation function, i.e., $G^{(2)}$, can detect the presence of anyonic excitations with fractional mutual statistics. Moreover, we show that correlations between electromagnetic quadratures can be used to detect expectation values of static spin chirality operators on both the kagome and triangular lattices, thus being useful in detecting chiral spin liquids. More generally, we show that a series of hitherto unmeasured spin-spin and spin-charge correlation functions of the material can be extracted from photonic correlations.

            <p>We holographically study quantum chaos in hyperscaling-violating Lifshitz (HVL) theories (with charge). Specifically, we present a detailed computation of the out-of-time ordered correlator (OTOC) via shockwave analysis in the bulk HVL geometry with a planar horizon topology. We also compute the butterfly velocity ($v_{B}$) using the entanglement wedge reconstruction and find that it matches the result obtained from the shockwave analysis. Using a recently developed thermodynamic dictionary for HVL theories, we express $v_B$ purely in terms of boundary thermodynamic variables. Furthermore, we analyze in detail the behavior of $v_{B}$ with respect to the dynamical critical exponent ($z$), hyperscaling-violating parameter ($\theta$), entropy (more precisely, the ratio of entropy to the central charge, $\tilde{S}$), and charge (more precisely, the ratio of charge to the central charge, $\tilde{Q}$). Interestingly, $v_B$ varies non-monotonically with $z$ for $\tilde{S} < 1$, whereas it increases monotonically with $z$ for $\tilde{S} \geq 1$. Additionally, $v_B$ varies non-monotonically with $\theta$ for non-zero charge. Moreover, $v_B$ monotonically increases with $\tilde{S}$ and decreases with $\tilde{Q}$ for all allowed values of $z$ and $\theta$. All these features are reported for combinations /{$z$, $\theta$, $\tilde{S}$, $\tilde{Q}$/} for which the temperature is positive, the null energy condition is satisfied, and $v_B$ is not superluminal. Unpacking the non-monotonicities in $v_B$ can offer interesting insights into these theories.</p>

            <h2>Cryptographic tests of the python's lunch conjecture</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alex May, Sabrina Pasterski, Chris Waddell, Michelle Xu</p>
            <p>In the AdS/CFT correspondence, a subregion of the CFT allows for the recovery of a corresponding subregion of the bulk known as its entanglement wedge. In some cases, an entanglement wedge contains a locally but not globally minimal surface homologous to the CFT subregion, in which case it is said to contain a python's lunch. It has been proposed that python's lunch geometries should be modelled by tensor networks that feature projective operations where the wedge narrows. This model leads to the python's lunch (PL) conjecture, which asserts that reconstructing information from past the locally minimal surface is computationally difficult. In this work, we invoke cryptographic tools pertaining to a primitive known as the Conditional Disclosure of Secrets (CDS) to develop consequences of the projective tensor network model that can be checked directly in AdS/CFT. We argue from the tensor network picture that the mutual information between appropriate CFT subregions is lower bounded linearly by an area difference associated with the geometry of the lunch. Recalling that the mutual information is also computed by bulk extremal surfaces, this gives a checkable geometrical consequence of the tensor network model. We prove weakened versions of this geometrical statement in asymptotically AdS$_{2+1}$ spacetimes satisfying the null energy condition, and confirm it in some example geometries, supporting the tensor network model and by proxy the PL conjecture. On the other hand, we point out a tension between the PL conjecture and a plausible cryptographically inspired lower bound on the mutual information involving the complexity of reconstructing operators inside the lunch; this suggests the existence of protocols for computationally secure CDS requiring unexpectedly small entanglement.</p>

            <h2>Generalised second law beyond the semiclassical regime</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Josh Kirklin</p>
            <p>We prove that the generalised second law (GSL), with an appropriate modification, holds in perturbative gravity to all orders beyond the semiclassical limit and without a UV cutoff imposed on the fields. Our proof uses algebraic techniques and builds on the recent work of Faulkner and Speranza, which combined Wall's proof of the GSL with the identification of generalised entropy as the von Neumann entropy of a boost-invariant crossed product algebra. The key additional step in our approach is to further impose invariance under null translations. Doing so requires one to describe horizon exterior regions in a relational manner, so we introduce `dynamical cuts': quantum reference frames which give the location of a cut of the horizon. We use idealised dynamical cuts, but expect that our methods can be generalised to more realistic models. The modified GSL that we prove says that the difference in generalised entropies of the regions outside two dynamical cuts is bounded below by the free energy of the degrees of freedom giving the location of the later cut. If one takes a semiclassical limit, imposes a UV cutoff, and requires the cuts to obey certain energy conditions, then our result reduces to the standard GSL.</p>

            <h2>Random Circuits in the Black Hole Interior</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Javier M. Magan, Martin Sasieta, Brian Swingle</p>
            <p>In this paper, we present a quantitative holographic relation between a microscopic measure of randomness and the geometric length of the wormhole in the black hole interior. To this end, we perturb an AdS black hole with Brownian semiclassical sources, implementing the continuous version of a random quantum circuit for the black hole. We use the random circuit to prepare ensembles of states of the black hole whose semiclassical duals contain Einstein-Rosen (ER) caterpillars: long cylindrical wormholes with large numbers of matter inhomogeneities, of linearly growing length with the circuit time. In this setup, we show semiclassically that the ensemble of ER caterpillars of average length $k\ell_{\Delta}$ and matter correlation scale $\ell_{\Delta}$ forms an approximate quantum state $k$-design of the black hole. At exponentially long circuit times, the ensemble of ER caterpillars becomes polynomial-copy indistinguishable from a collection of random states of the black hole. We comment on the implications of these results for holographic circuit complexity and for the holographic description of the black hole interior.</p>

            <h2>The Wehrl-type entropy conjecture for symmetric $SU(N)$ coherent states: cases of equality and stability</h2>

            <p>Lieb and Solovej proved that, for the symmetric $SU(N)$ representations, the corresponding Wehrl-type entropy is minimized by symmetric coherent states. However, the uniqueness of the minimizers remained an open problem when $N\geq 3$. In this note we complete the proof of the Wehrl entropy conjecture for such representations, by showing that symmetric coherent states are, in fact, the only minimizers. We also provide an application to the maximum concentration of holomorphic polynomials and deduce a corresponding Faber-Krahn inequality. A sharp quantitative form of the bound by Lieb and Solovej is also proved.</p>

            <h2>Automatically Refining Assertions for Efficient Debugging of Quantum Programs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Damian Rovara, Lukas Burgholzer, Robert Wille</p>
            <p>As new advancements in the field of quantum computing lead to the development of increasingly complex programs, approaches to validate and debug these programs are becoming more important. To this end, methods employed in classical debugging, such as assertions for testing specific properties of a program's state, have been adapted for quantum programs. However, to efficiently debug quantum programs, it is key to properly place these assertions. This usually requires a deep understanding of the program's underlying mathematical properties, constituting a time-consuming manual task for developers. To address this problem, this work proposes methods for automatically refining assertions in quantum programs by moving them to more favorable positions in the program or by placing new assertions that help to further narrow down potential error locations. This allows developers to take advantage of rich and expressive assertions that greatly improve the debugging experience without requiring them to place these assertions manually in an otherwise tedious manner. An open-source implementation of the proposed methods is available at this https URL.</p>

            <p>Quantum error correction is essential for bridging the gap between the error rates of physical devices and the extremely low logical error rates required for quantum algorithms. Recent error-correction demonstrations on superconducting processors have focused primarily on the surface code, which offers a high error threshold but poses limitations for logical operations. In contrast, the color code enables much more efficient logic, although it requires more complex stabilizer measurements and decoding techniques. Measuring these stabilizers in planar architectures such as superconducting qubits is challenging, and so far, realizations of color codes have not addressed performance scaling with code size on any platform. Here, we present a comprehensive demonstration of the color code on a superconducting processor, achieving logical error suppression and performing logical operations. Scaling the code distance from three to five suppresses logical errors by a factor of $\Lambda_{3/5}$ = 1.56(4). Simulations indicate this performance is below the threshold of the color code, and furthermore that the color code may be more efficient than the surface code with modest device improvements. Using logical randomized benchmarking, we find that transversal Clifford gates add an error of only 0.0027(3), which is substantially less than the error of an idling error correction cycle. We inject magic states, a key resource for universal computation, achieving fidelities exceeding 99% with post-selection (retaining about 75% of the data). Finally, we successfully teleport logical states between distance-three color codes using lattice surgery, with teleported state fidelities between 86.5(1)% and 90.7(1)%. This work establishes the color code as a compelling research direction to realize fault-tolerant quantum computation on superconducting processors in the near future.</p>

            <p>We explore the dissipative phase transition of the two-photon Dicke model, a topic that has garnered significant attention recently. Our analysis reveals that while single-photon loss does not stabilize the intrinsic instability in the model, the inclusion of two-photon loss restores stability, leading to the emergence of superradiant states which coexist with the normal vacuum states. Using a second-order cumulant expansion for the photons, we derive an analytical description of the system in the thermodynamic limit which agrees well with the exact calculation results. Additionally, we present the Wigner function for the system, shedding light on the breaking of the Z4-symmetry inherent in the model. These findings offer valuable insights into stabilization mechanisms in open quantum systems and pave the way for exploring complex nonlinear dynamics in two-photon Dicke models.</p>

            <p>Optical vector modes (VMs), characterized by spatially varying polarization distributions, have become essential tools across microscopy, metrology, optical trapping, nanophotonics, and optical communications. The Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) effect, a fundamental two-photon interference phenomenon in quantum optics, offers significant potential to extend the applications of VMs beyond the classical regime. Here, we demonstrate the simultaneous generation of all four Bell states by exploiting the HOM interference of VMs. The resulting Bell states exhibit spatially tailored distributions that are determined by the input modes. These results represent a significant step in manipulating HOM interference within structured photons, offering promising avenues for high-dimensional quantum information processing and in particular high-dimensional quantum communication, quantum sensing, and advanced photonic technologies reliant on tailored quantum states of light.</p>

            <p>The Dicke-Ising model, one of the few paradigmatic models of matter-light interaction, exhibits a superradiant quantum phase transition above a critical coupling strength. However, in natural optical systems, its experimental validation is hindered by a "no-go theorem''. Here, we propose a digital-analog quantum simulator for this model based on an ensemble of interacting qubits coupled to a single-mode photonic resonator. We analyze the system's free energy landscape using field-theoretical methods and develop a digital-analog quantum algorithm that disentangles qubit and photon degrees of freedom through a parity-measurement protocol. This disentangling enables the emulation of a photonic Schr√∂dinger cat state, which is a hallmark of the superradiant ground state in finite-size systems and can be unambiguously probed through the Wigner tomography of the resonator's field.</p>

            <h2>Multi-user QKD using quotient graph states derived from continuous-variable dual-rail cluster states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akash nag Oruganti</p>
            <p>Multipartite entangled states are fundamental resources for multi-user quantum cryptographic tasks. Despite significant advancements in generating large-scale continuous-variable (CV) cluster states, particularly the dual-rail cluster state because of its utility in measurement-based quantum computation, its application in quantum cryptography has remained largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce a novel protocol for generating three user conference keys using a CV dual-rail cluster state. We develop the concept of a quotient graph state by applying a node coloring scheme to the infinite dual-rail graph, resulting in a six-mode pure graph state suitable for cryptographic applications. Our results demonstrate that the proposed protocol achieves performance close to that of GHZ-based protocols for quantum conference key agreement (QCKA), with GHZ states performing slightly better. However, a key advantage of our protocol lies in its ability to generate bipartite keys post-QCKA, a feature not achievable with GHZ states. Additionally, compared to a downstream access network using two-mode squeezed vacuum states, our protocol achieves superior performance in generating bipartite keys. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to the finite-size regime and consider the impact of using impure squeezed states for generating the multipartite entangled states, reflecting experimental imperfections. Our findings indicate that even with finite resources and non-ideal state preparation, the proposed protocol maintains its advantages. We also introduce a more accurate method to estimate the capacity of a protocol to generate bipartite keys in a quantum network.</p>

            <p>Discrete-step walks describe the dynamics of particles in a lattice subject to hopping or splitting events at discrete times. Despite being of primordial interest to the physics of quantum walks, the topological properties arising from their discrete-step nature have been hardly explored. Here we report the observation of topological phases unique to discrete-step walks. We use light pulses in a double-fibre ring setup whose dynamics maps into a two-dimensional lattice subject to discrete splitting events. We show that the number of edge states is not simply described by the bulk invariants of the lattice (i.e., the Chern number and the Floquet winding number) as would be the case in static lattices and in lattices subject to smooth modulations. The number of edge states is also determined by a topological invariant associated to the discrete-step unitary operators acting at the edges of the lattice. This situation goes beyond the usual bulk-edge correspondence and allows manipulating the number of edge states without the need to go through a gap closing transition. Our work opens new perspectives for the engineering of topological modes for particles subject to quantum walks.</p>

            <p>Nanolasers operating at low power levels are strongly affected by intrinsic quantum noise, affecting both intensity fluctuations and laser coherence. Starting from semi-classical rate equations and making a simple hypothesis for the phase of the laser field, a simple stochastic model for the laser quantum noise is suggested. The model is shown to agree quantitatively with quantum master equations for microscopic lasers with a small number of emitters and with classical Langevin equations for macroscopic systems. In contrast, neither quantum master equations nor classical Langevin equations adequately address the mesoscopic regime. The stochastic approach is used to calculate the linewidth throughout the transition to lasing, where the linewidth changes from being dominated by the particle-like nature of photons below threshold to the wave-like nature above threshold, where it is strongly influenced by index fluctuations enhancing the linewidth.</p>

            <p>A remarkable characteristic of quantum computing is the potential for reliable computation despite faulty qubits. This can be achieved through quantum error correction, which is typically implemented by repeatedly applying static syndrome checks, permitting correction of logical information. Recently, the development of time-dynamic approaches to error correction has uncovered new codes and new code implementations. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate three time-dynamic implementations of the surface code, each offering a unique solution to hardware design challenges and introducing flexibility in surface code realization. First, we embed the surface code on a hexagonal lattice, reducing the necessary couplings per qubit from four to three. Second, we walk a surface code, swapping the role of data and measure qubits each round, achieving error correction with built-in removal of accumulated non-computational errors. Finally, we realize the surface code using iSWAP gates instead of the traditional CNOT, extending the set of viable gates for error correction without additional overhead. We measure the error suppression factor when scaling from distance-3 to distance-5 codes of $\Lambda_{35,\text{hex}} = 2.15(2)$, $\Lambda_{35,\text{walk}} = 1.69(6)$, and $\Lambda_{35,\text{iSWAP}} = 1.56(2)$, achieving state-of-the-art error suppression for each. With detailed error budgeting, we explore their performance trade-offs and implications for hardware design. This work demonstrates that dynamic circuit approaches satisfy the demands for fault-tolerance and opens new alternative avenues for scalable hardware design.</p>

            <p>Machine learning has been revolutionizing our world over the last few years and is also increasingly exploited in several areas of physics, including quantum dynamics and this http URL need for a framework that brings together machine learning models and quantum simulation methods has been quite high within the quantum control field, with the ultimate goal of exploiting these powerful computational methods for the efficient implementation of modern quantum technologies. The existing frameworks for quantum system simulations, such as QuTip and this http URL, even though they are very successful in simulating quantum dynamics, cannot be easily incorporated into the platforms used for the development of machine learning models, like for example PyTorch. The TorchQC framework introduced in the present work comes exactly to fill this gap. It is a new library written entirely in Python and based on the PyTorch deep learning library. PyTorch and other deep learning frameworks are based on tensors, a structure that is also used in quantum mechanics. This is the common ground that TorchQC utilizes to combine quantum physics simulations and deep learning this http URL exploits PyTorch and its tensor mechanism to represent quantum states and operators as tensors, while it also incorporates all the tools needed to simulate quantum system dynamics. All necessary operations are internal in the PyTorch library, thus TorchQC programs can be executed in GPUs, substantially reducing the simulation time. We believe that the proposed TorchQC library has the potential to accelerate the development of deep learning models directly incorporating quantum simulations, enabling the easier integration of these powerful techniques in modern quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>Optical Schr√∂dinger cat states are non-Gaussian states with applications in quantum technologies, such as for building error-correcting states in quantum computing. Yet the efficient generation of high-fidelity optical Schr√∂dinger cat states is an outstanding problem in quantum optics. Here, we propose using squeezed superpositions of zero and two photons, $|\theta\rangle = \cos{(\theta/2)}|0\rangle + \sin{(\theta/2)}|2\rangle$, as ingredients for protocols to efficiently generate high-fidelity cat states. We present a protocol using linear optics with success probability $P\gtrsim 50\%$ that can generate cat states of size $|\alpha|^2=5$ with fidelity $F>0.99$. The protocol relies only on detecting single photons and is remarkably tolerant of loss, with $2\%$ detection loss still achieving $F>0.98$ for cats with $|\alpha|^2=5$. We also show that squeezed $\theta$ states are ideal candidates for nonlinear photon subtraction using a two-level system with near deterministic success probability and fidelity $F>0.98$ for cat states of size $|\alpha|^2=5$. Schemes for generating $\theta$ states using quantum emitters are also presented. Our protocols can be implemented with current state-of-the-art quantum optics experiments.</p>

Our method is capable of unveiling the effect of relative bandwidth as well as squeezing required to observe the anticipated anti-crossing spectrum and enhanced cooperativity without the ideal squeezed bath assumption. Furthermore, we analyze the practicality of said models when including intrinsic photon loss due to resonators imperfection.

            <p>Realizing universal fault-tolerant quantum computation is a key goal in quantum information science. By encoding quantum information into logical qubits utilizing quantum error correcting codes, physical errors can be detected and corrected, enabling substantial reduction in logical error rates. However, the set of logical operations that can be easily implemented on such encoded qubits is often constrained, necessitating the use of special resource states known as 'magic states' to implement universal, classically hard circuits. A key method to prepare high-fidelity magic states is to perform 'distillation', creating them from multiple lower fidelity inputs. Here we present the experimental realization of magic state distillation with logical qubits on a neutral-atom quantum computer. Our approach makes use of a dynamically reconfigurable architecture to encode and perform quantum operations on many logical qubits in parallel. We demonstrate the distillation of magic states encoded in d=3 and d=5 color codes, observing improvements of the logical fidelity of the output magic states compared to the input logical magic states. These experiments demonstrate a key building block of universal fault-tolerant quantum computation, and represent an important step towards large-scale logical quantum processors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stefano Veroni, Alexandru Paler, Giacomo Giudice</p>
            <p>We show that universal quantum computation can be made fault-tolerant in a scenario where the error-correction is implemented without mid-circuit measurements. To this end, we introduce a measurement-free deformation protocol of the Bacon-Shor code to realize a logical $\mathit{CCZ}$ gate, enabling a universal set of fault-tolerant operations. Independently, we demonstrate that certain stabilizer codes can be concatenated in a measurement-free way without having to rely on a universal logical gate set. This is achieved by means of the disposable Toffoli gadget, which realizes the feedback operation in a resource-efficient way. For the purpose of benchmarking the proposed protocols with circuit-level noise, we implement an efficient method to simulate non-Clifford circuits consisting of few Hadamard gates. In particular, our findings support that below-breakeven logical performance is achievable with a circuit-level error rate below $10^{-3}$. Altogether, the deformation protocol and the Toffoli gadget provide a blueprint for a fully fault-tolerant architecture without any feed-forward operation, which is particularly suited for state-of-the-art neutral-atom platforms.</p>

            <h2>Quantum entropy and QCD factorization for low-$Q^2$ $\nu$DIS</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Henry Bloss, Brandon Kriesten, T. J. Hobbs</p>
            <p>Deeply inelastic scattering (DIS) is an essential process for exploring the structure of visible matter and testing the standard model. At the same time, the theoretical interpretation of DIS measurements depends on QCD factorization theorems whose validity deteriorates at the lower values of $Q^2$ and $W^2$ typical of neutrino DIS in accelerator-based oscillation searches. For this reason, progress in understanding the origin and limits of QCD factorization is invaluable to the accuracy and precision of predictions for these upcoming neutrino experiments. In these short proceedings, we introduce a novel approach based on the quantum entropy associated with continuous distributions in QCD, using it to characterize the limits of factorization theorems relevant for the description of neutrino DIS. This work suggests an additional avenue for dissecting factorization-breaking dynamics through the quantum entropy, which could also play a role in quantum simulations of related systems.</p>

            <h2>Many-body spectral transitions through the lens of variable-range SYK2 model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrea Legramandi, Soumik Bandyopadhyay, Philipp Hauke</p>
            <p>The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model is a cornerstone in the study of quantum chaos and holographic quantum matter. Real-world implementations, however, deviate from the idealized all-to-all connectivity, raising questions about the robustness of its chaotic properties. In this work, we investigate a quadratic SYK model with distance-dependent interactions governed by a power-law decay. By analytically and numerically studying the spectral form factor (SFF), we uncover how the single particle transitions manifest in the many-body system. While the SFF demonstrates robustness under slightly reduced interaction ranges, further suppression leads to a breakdown of perturbation theory and new spectral regimes, marked by a higher dip and the emergence of a secondary plateau. Our results highlight the interplay between single-particle criticality and many-body dynamics, offering new insights into the quantum chaos-to-localization transition and its reflection in spectral statistics.</p>

            <h2>Massive graviton dark matter searches with long-baseline atom interferometers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Diego Blas, John Carlton, Christopher McCabe</p>
            <p>Atom interferometers offer exceptional sensitivity to ultra-light dark matter (ULDM) through their precise measurement of phenomena acting on atoms. While previous work has established their capability to detect scalar and vector ULDM, their potential for detecting spin-2 ULDM remains unexplored. This work investigates the sensitivity of atom interferometers to spin-2 ULDM by considering several frameworks for massive gravity: a Lorentz-invariant Fierz-Pauli case and two Lorentz-violating scenarios. We find that coherent oscillations of the spin-2 ULDM field induce a measurable phase shift through three distinct channels: coupling of the scalar mode to atomic energy levels, and vector and tensor effects that modify the propagation of atoms and light. Atom interferometers uniquely probe all of these effects, while providing sensitivity to a different mass range from laser interferometers. Our results demonstrate the potential of atom interferometers to advance the search for spin-2 dark matter through accessing unexplored parameter space and uncovering new interactions between ULDM and atoms.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Fisher Information Reveals UV-IR Mixing in the Strange Metal</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Ba≈Çut, Xuefei Guo, Niels de Vries, Dipanjan Chaudhuri, Barry Bradlyn, Peter Abbamonte, Philip W. Phillips</p>
            <p>The density-density response in optimally doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ has recently been shown to exhibit conformal symmetry. Using, the experimentally inferred conformal dynamic susceptibility, we compute the resultant quantum Fisher information (QFI), a witness to multi-partite entanglement. In contrast to a Fermi liquid in which the QFI is approximately temperature independent much below the Fermi energy scale, we find that the QFI increases as a power law at low temperatures but ultimately extrapolates to a constant at $T=0$. The constant is of the form, $\omega_g^{2\Delta}$, where $\Delta$ is the conformal dimension and $\omega_g$ is the UV cutoff which is on the order of the pseudogap. As this constant {depends on both UV and IR properties}, it illustrates that multipartite entanglement in a strange metal exhibits UV-IR mixing, a benchmark feature of doped Mott insulators as exemplified by dynamical spectral weight transfer. We conclude with a discussion of the implication of our results for low-energy reductions of the Hubbard model.</p>

            <h2>Enhanced second-order sideband generation and slow-fast light via coupled opto- and magnomechanical microspheres</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abdul Wahab, Muqaddar Abbas, Xiaosen Yang, Yuee Xie, Yuanping Chen</p>
            <p>In this research, we investigate second-order sideband generation (SSG) and slow-fast light using a hybrid system comprised of two coupled opto- and magnomechanical microspheres, namely a YIG sphere and a silica sphere. The YIG sphere hosts a magnon mode and a vibration mode induced by magnetostriction, whereas the silica sphere has an optical whispering gallery mode and a mechanical mode coupled via optomechanical interaction. The mechanical modes of both spheres are close in frequency and are coherently coupled by the straightway physical contact between the two microspheres. We use a perturbation approach to solve the Heisenberg-Langevin equations, offering an analytical framework for transmission rate and SSG. Using experimentally feasible settings, we demonstrate that the transmission rate and SSG are strongly dependent on the magnomechanical, optomechanical, and mechanics mechanics coupling strengths (MMCS) between the two microspheres. The numerical results show that increasing the MMCS can enhance both the transmission rate and SSG efficiency, resulting in gain within our system. Our findings, in particular, reveal that the efficiency of the SSG can be effectively controlled by cavity detuning, decay rate, and pump power. Notably, our findings suggest that modifying the system parameters can alter the group delay, thereby regulating the transition between fast and slow light propagation, and vice versa. Our protocol provides guidelines for manipulating nonlinear optical properties and controlling light propagation, with applications including optical switching, information storage, and precise measurement of weak signals.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sudin Ganguly, S. K. Maiti</p>
            <p>Non-reciprocal hopping induces a synthetic magnetic flux which leads to the non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm effect. Since non-Hermitian Hamiltonians possess both real and imaginary eigenvalues, this effect allows the observation of real and imaginary persistent currents in a ring threaded by the synthetic flux~\cite{nrh8}. Motivated by this, we investigate the behavior of persistent currents in a disordered Hatano-Nelson ring with anti-Hermitian intradimer hopping. The disorder is diagonal and we explore three distinct models, namely the Aubry-Andr√©-Harper model, the Fibonacci model, both representing correlated disorder, and an uncorrelated (random) model. We conduct a detailed analysis of the energy spectrum and examine the real and imaginary parts of the persistent current under various conditions such as different ring sizes and filling factors. Interestingly, we find that real and imaginary persistent currents exhibit amplification in the presence of correlated disorder. This amplification is also observed in certain individual random configurations but vanishes after configuration averaging. Additionally, we observe both diamagnetic and paramagnetic responses in the current behavior and investigate aspects of persistent currents in the absence of disorder that have not been previously explored. Interestingly, we find that the intradimer bonds host only imaginary currents, while the interdimer bonds carry only real currents.</p>

            <h2>Quantum chaos, localization and phase transitions in random graphs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ioannis Kleftogiannis, Ilias Amanatidis</p>
            <p>The energy level statistics of uniform random graphs are studied, by treating the graphs as random tight-binding lattices. The inherent random geometry of the graphs and their dynamical spatial dimensionality, leads to various quantum chaotic and localized phases and transitions between them. Essentially the random geometry acts as disorder, whose strength is characterized by the ratio of edges over vertices R in the graphs. For dense graphs, with large ratio R, the spacing between successive energy levels follows the Wigner-Dyson distribution, leading to a quantum chaotic behavior and a metallic phase, characterized by level repulsion. For ratios near R=0.5, where a large dominating component in the graph appears, the level spacing follows the Poisson distribution with level crossings and a localized phase for the respective wavefunctions lying on the graph. For intermediate ratios R we observe a phase transition between the quantum chaotic and localized phases characterized by a semi-Poisson distribution. The values R of the critical regime where the phase transition occurs depend on the energy of the system. Our analysis shows that physical systems with random geometry, for example ones with a fluctuating/dynamical spatial dimension, contain novel universal phase transition properties, similar to those occuring in more traditional phase transitions based on symmetry breaking mechanisms, whose universal properties are strongly determined by the dimensionality of the system.</p>

            <p>Neutral resonant states of molecules play a very important role in the dissociation dynamics and other electronic processes that occur via intermediate capture into these states. With the goal of identifying resonant states, and their corresponding widths, of the imidogen molecule NH as a function of internuclear distance, we have performed detailed R-matrix calculations on the e + NH+ system. In a previous work, we had identified bound states of NH and Feshbach resonances in the e + NH+ system at a single geometry, namely the NH+ equilibrium Re = 2.0205 a0 . Here we present a much more detailed work by repeating the calculation on over 60 internuclear distances to obtain the corresponding potential energy curves. The bound states for nine symmetries have been detailed many of which, particularly the singlet states, were never studied before. Several resonant states of different symmetries, which were unknown until now, have been systematically identified and their widths calculated in the present work, which proved much more challenging due to presence of many avoided crossings. It is hoped that the bound and the new resonant states obtained here will open up other molecular dynamics studies, since for several dissociative processes, although experimental data existed for more than a decade, these are still uncorroborated due to absence of molecular data, and hence subsequent theoretical calculations.</p>

            <p>We present a new approach to investigating Rydberg molecules by demonstrating the formation and characterization of individual Rb$^{*}$Cs Rydberg molecules using optical tweezers. By employing single-atom detection of Rb and Cs, we observe molecule formation via correlated loss of both species and study the formation dynamics with single-particle resolution. We control the interatomic distances by manipulating the relative wavefunction of atom pairs using the tweezer intensity, optimizing the coupling to molecular states and exploring the effect of the tweezer on these states. Additionally, we demonstrate molecule association with atoms trapped in separate tweezers, paving the way for state-selective assembly of polyatomic molecules. The observed binding energies, molecular alignment, and bond lengths are in good agreement with theory. Our approach is broadly applicable to Rydberg tweezer platforms, expanding the range of available molecular systems and enabling the integration of Rydberg molecules into existing quantum science platforms.</p>

This influence can shed light at the state of electron as it appears in the continuum, in particular, to its initial velocity.</p>

Starting from a double-holographic model of eternal two-sided asymptotically AdS$_d$ ($d>2$) black hole each coupled to a flat $d$-dimensional bath, we show that the entanglement dynamics in the late-time, large-subregion limit is described by entanglement membrane, thereby establishing a quantitative equivalence between a semi-classical gravity and a chaotic quantum many-body system calculation of the Page curve.</p>

            <p>A core challenge for superconducting quantum computers is to scale up the number of qubits in each processor without increasing noise or cross-talk. Distributed quantum computing across small qubit arrays, known as chiplets, can address these challenges in a scalable manner. We propose a chiplet architecture over microwave links with potential to exceed monolithic performance on near-term hardware. Our methods of modeling and evaluating the chiplet architecture bridge the physical and network layers in these processors. We find evidence that distributing computation across chiplets may reduce the overall error rates associated with moving data across the device, despite higher error figures for transfers across links. Preliminary analyses suggest that latency is not substantially impacted, and that at least some applications and architectures may avoid bottlenecks around chiplet boundaries. In the long-term, short-range networks may underlie quantum computers just as local area networks underlie classical datacenters and supercomputers today.</p>

            <p>Understanding the influence of measurements on the properties of many-body systems is a fundamental problem in quantum mechanics and for quantum technologies. This paper explores how a finite density of stochastic local measurement modifies a given state's entanglement structure. Considering various measurement protocols, we explore the typical quantum correlations of their associated projected ensembles arising from the ground state of the quantum Ising model. Using large-scale numerical simulations, we demonstrate substantial differences among inequivalent measurement protocols. Surprisingly, we observe that forced on-site measurements can enhance both bipartite and multipartite entanglement. We present a phenomenological toy model and perturbative calculations to analytically support these results. Furthermore, we extend these considerations to the non-Hermitian Ising model, naturally arising in optically monitored systems, and we show that its qualitative entanglement features are not altered by a finite density of projective measurements. Overall, these results reveal a complex phenomenology where local quantum measurements do not simply disentangle degrees of freedom, but may actually strengthen the entanglement in the system.</p>

            <p>Quantum networks (QNs) exhibit stronger connectivity than predicted by classical percolation, yet the origin of this phenomenon remains unexplored. Here, we apply a statistical physics model -- concurrence percolation -- to uncover the origin of stronger connectivity on hierarchical scale-free networks, the ($U,V$) flowers. These networks allow full analytical control over path connectivity through two adjustable path-length parameters, $U \leq V$. This precise control enables us to determine critical exponents well beyond current simulation limits, revealing that classical and concurrence percolations, while both satisfying the hyperscaling relation, fall into distinct universality classes. This distinction arises from how they "superpose" parallel, non-shortest path contributions into overall connectivity. Concurrence percolation, unlike its classical counterpart, is sensitive to non-shortest paths and shows higher resilience to detours as these paths lengthen. This enhanced resilience is also observed in real-world hierarchical, scale-free Internet networks. Our findings highlight a crucial principle for QN design: when non-shortest paths are abundant, they notably enhance QN connectivity beyond what is achievable with classical percolation.</p>

In this work, we extend this concept to the complex regime for a periodic non-Hermitian system under a linear potential.

The system can also support standard two-particle Bloch oscillations under certain conditions. We propose two types of dimerized non-Hermitian systems to demonstrate our results. In addition, we also propose a scheme to demonstrate the results of electron-pair dynamics in a single-particle 2D $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric square lattice.</p>

Encoding key information in continuous variables (CV), such as the values of quadrature components of coherent states of light, brings implementations much closer to standard optical communication systems, but this comes at the price of significant complexity in the digital signal processing techniques required for operation at low signal-to-noise ratios. In this work, we wish to lower the barriers to entry for CV-QKD experiments associated to this difficulty by providing a highly modular, open source software that is in principle hardware agnostic and can be used in multiple configurations. We benchmarked this software, called QOSST, using an experimental setup with a locally generated local oscillator, frequency multiplexed pilots and RF-heterodyne detection, and obtained state-of-the-art secret key rates of the order of Mbit/s over metropolitan distances at the asymptotic limit.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maik Reddiger</p>
            <p>It is a common view that von Neumann laid the foundations of a "quantum probability theory" with his axiomatization of quantum mechanics (QM). As such, it is regarded a generalization of the "classical probability theory" due to Kolmogorov. Outside of quantum physics, however, Kolmogorov's axioms enjoy universal applicability. This raises the question of whether quantum physics indeed requires such a generalization of our conception of probability or if von Neumann's axiomatization of QM was contingent on the absence of a general theory of probability in the 1920s. In this work I argue in favor of the latter position. In particular, I show that for non-relativistic $N$-body quantum systems subject to a time-independent scalar potential, it is possible to construct a mathematically rigorous theory based on Kolmogorov's axioms and physically natural random variables, which reproduces central predictions of QM. The respective theories are distinct, so that an empirical comparison may be possible. Moreover, the approach can in principle be adapted to other classes of quantum-mechanical models. Part II of this series discusses the empirical violation of Bell inequalities in the context of this approach. Part III addresses the projection postulate and the question of measurement.</p>

            <p>Continuous variables (CV) offer a promising platform for the development of various applications, such as quantum communication, computing, and sensing, and CV graph states represent a family of powerful entangled resource states for all these areas. In many of these protocols, a crucial aspect is the certification of the quantum state subsequently used. While numerous protocols exist, most rely on assumptions unrealistic for physical continuous variable states, such as infinite precision in quadrature measurement or the use of states requiring infinite squeezing. In this work, we adapt existing protocols to deal with these unavoidable considerations, and use them to certify their application for different quantum information tasks. More specifically, we show how CV graph states can be efficiently verified and certified even in a noisy and imperfect setting. We then discuss how our findings impact the usability of states obtained after the protocol for different applications, including quantum teleportation, computing, and sensing.</p>

            <p>Multipartite entanglement, linking multiple nodes simultaneously, is a higher-order correlation that offers advantages over pairwise connections in quantum networks (QNs). Creating reliable, large-scale multipartite entanglement requires entanglement routing, a process that combines local, short-distance connections into a long-distance connection, which can be considered as a transformation of network topology. Here, we address the question of whether a QN can be topologically transformed into another via entanglement routing. Our key result is an exact mapping from multipartite entanglement routing to Nash-Williams's graph immersion problem, extended to hypergraphs. This generalized hypergraph immersion problem introduces a partial order between QN topologies, permitting certain topological transformations while precluding others, offering discerning insights into the design and manipulation of higher-order network topologies in QNs.</p>

            <p>Quantum machine learning (QML) requires significant quantum resources to address practical real-world problems. When the underlying quantum information exhibits hierarchical structures in the data, limitations persist in training complexity and generalization. Research should prioritize both the efficient design of quantum architectures and the development of learning strategies to optimize resource usage. We propose a framework called quantum curriculum learning (Q-CurL) for quantum data, where the curriculum introduces simpler tasks or data to the learning model before progressing to more challenging ones. Q-CurL exhibits robustness to noise and data limitations, which is particularly relevant for current and near-term noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. We achieve this through a curriculum design based on quantum data density ratios and a dynamic learning schedule that prioritizes the most informative quantum data. Empirical evidence shows that Q-CurL significantly enhances training convergence and generalization for unitary learning and improves the robustness of quantum phase recognition tasks. Q-CurL is effective with broad physical learning applications in condensed matter physics and quantum chemistry.</p>

            <p>The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a prominent quantum algorithm designed to find approximate solutions to combinatorial optimization problems, which are challenging for classical computers. In the current era, where quantum hardware is constrained by noise and limited qubit availability, simulating the QAOA remains essential for research. However, existing state-of-the-art simulation frameworks suffer from long execution times or lack comprehensive functionality, usability, and versatility, often requiring users to implement essential features themselves. Additionally, these frameworks are primarily restricted to Python, limiting their use in safer and faster languages like Rust, which offer, e.g., advanced parallelization capabilities. In this paper, we develop a GPU accelerated QAOA simulation framework utilizing the NVIDIA CUDA toolkit. This framework offers a complete interface for QAOA simulations, enabling the calculation of (exact) expectation values, direct access to the statevector, fast sampling, and high-performance optimization methods using an advanced state-of-the-art gradient calculation technique. The framework is designed for use in Python and Rust, providing flexibility for integration into a wide range of applications, including those requiring fast algorithm implementations leveraging QAOA at its core. The new framework's performance is rigorously benchmarked on the MaxCut problem and compared against the current state-of-the-art general-purpose quantum circuit simulation frameworks Qiskit and Pennylane as well as the specialized QAOA simulation tool QOKit. Our evaluation shows that our approach outperforms the existing state-of-the-art solutions in terms of runtime up to multiple orders of magnitude.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oktay K. Pashaev</p>
            <p>The quantum calculus with two bases, as powers of the Golden and the Silver ratio, relates Fibonacci divisor derivative with Binet formula of Fibonacci divisor number operator, acting in Fock space of quantum this http URL provides a tool to study the hierarchy of Golden oscillators with energy spectrum in form of Fibonacci divisor numbers. We generalize this model to supersymmetric number operator and corresponding Binet formula for supersymmetric Fibonacci divisor number operator. The operator determines the Hamiltonian of hierarchy of supersymmetric Golden oscillators, acting in fermion-boson Hilbert space and belonging to N=2 supersymmetric algebra. The eigenstates of the super Fibonacci divisor number operator are double degenerate and can be characterized by a point on the super-Bloch sphere. By the supersymmetric Fibonacci divisor annihilation operator, we construct the hierarchy of supersymmetric coherent states as eigenstates of this operator. Entanglement of fermions with bosons in these states is calculated by the concurrence, represented by the Gram determinant and hierarchy of Golden exponential functions. We show that the reference states and corresponding von Neumann entropy, measuring fermion-boson entanglement, are characterized completely by the powers of the Golden ratio. The simple geometrical classification of entangled states by the Frobenius ball and meaning of the concurrence as double area of parallelogram in Hilbert space are given.</p>

            <h2>Thermalization and hydrodynamic long-time tails in a Floquet system</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anne Matthies, Nicolas Dannenfeld, Silvia Pappalardi, Achim Rosch</p>
            <p>We systematically investigate whether classical hydrodynamic field theories can predict the long-time dynamics of many-particle quantum systems. As an example, we investigate numerically and analytically the time evolution of a chain of spins (or qubits) subject to a stroboscopic dynamics. The time evolution is implemented by a sequence of local and nearest-neighbor gates which conserve the total magnetization. The long-time dynamics of such a system is believed to be describable by a hydrodynamics field theory, which, importantly, includes the effect of noise. Based on a field theoretical analysis and symmetry arguments, we map each operator in the spin model to corresponding fields in hydrodynamics. This allows us to predict which expectation values decay exponentially, and which of them decay with a hydrodynamics long-time tail. We illustrate these findings by studying the time evolution of all 255 Hermitian operators which can be defined on four neighboring sites. We show that all operators not protected by hydrodynamics decay exponentially and investigate a selected set of slowly decaying operators.</p>

            <h2>Quantum machine learning for multiclass classification beyond kernel methods</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chao Ding, Shi Wang, Yaonan Wang, Weibo Gao</p>
            <p>Quantum machine learning is considered one of the current research fields with immense potential. In recent years, Havl√≠ƒçek et al. [Nature 567, 209-212 (2019)] have proposed a quantum machine learning algorithm with quantum-enhanced feature spaces, which effectively addressed a binary classification problem on a superconducting processor and offered a potential pathway to achieving quantum advantage. However, a straightforward binary classification algorithm falls short in solving multiclass classification problems. In this paper, we propose a quantum algorithm that rigorously demonstrates that quantum kernel methods enhance the efficiency of multiclass classification in real-world applications, providing quantum advantage. To demonstrate quantum advantage, we design six distinct quantum kernels within the quantum algorithm to map input data into quantum state spaces and estimate the corresponding quantum kernel matrices. The results from quantum simulations reveal that the quantum algorithm outperforms its classical counterpart in handling six real-world multiclass classification problems. Furthermore, we leverage a variety of performance metrics to comprehensively evaluate the classification and generalization performance of the quantum algorithm. The results demonstrate that the quantum algorithm achieves superior classification and better generalization performance relative to classical counterparts.</p>

            <h2>Universal graph representation of stabilizer codes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrey Boris Khesin, Jonathan Z. Lu, Peter W. Shor</p>
            <p>We introduce a representation of $[[n, k]]$ stabilizer codes as semi-bipartite graphs wherein $k$ ``input'' nodes map to $n$ ``output'' nodes, such that output nodes may connect to each other but input nodes may not. We prove that this graph representation is in bijection with tableaus and give an efficient compilation algorithm that transforms tableaus into graphs. We then show that this map is efficiently invertible, which gives a new universal recipe for code construction by way of finding graphs with sufficiently nice properties. The graph representation gives insight into both code construction and algorithms. To the former, we argue that graphs provide a flexible platform for building codes particularly at smaller (non-asymptotic) scales. We construct as examples constant-size codes, e.g. a $[[54, 6, 5]]$ code and a family of roughly $[[n, \frac{n}{\log n}, \log n]]$ codes. We also leverage graphs in a probabilistic analysis to extend the quantum Gilbert-Varshamov bound into a three-way distance-rate-weight tradeoff. To the latter, we show that key coding algorithms -- distance approximation, weight reduction, and decoding -- are unified as instances of a single optimization game on a graph. Moreover, key code properties such as distance, weight, and encoding circuit depth, are all controlled by the graph degree. We give efficient algorithms for producing simple encoding circuits whose depths scale as twice the degree and for implementing logical diagonal and certain Clifford gates with non-constant but reduced depth. Finally, we construct a simple efficient decoding algorithm and prove a performance guarantee for a certain class of graphs, including the roughly $[[n, \frac{n}{\log n}, \log n]]$ code. These results give evidence that graphs are generically useful for the study of stabilizer codes and their practical implementations.</p>

            <h2>Ultimate precision limit of quantum thermal machines</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yoshihiko Hasegawa</p>
            <p>Enhancing the precision of a thermodynamic process inevitably necessitates a thermodynamic cost, a principle formulated as the thermodynamic uncertainty relation. The thermodynamic uncertainty relation states that the relative variance of thermodynamic currents, calculated as the variance divided by the squared mean, decreases as entropy production increases. This means that if entropy production were allowed to become infinitely large, the relative variance could approach zero. However, it is evident that realizing infinitely large entropy production is infeasible in reality. In this Letter, we establish the ultimate limits of precision for open quantum thermal machines operating within a finite-dimensional system and environment. We derive bounds on the relative variance and the expectation of observables, applicable to any unitary evolution of the composite system. These bounds are governed by the \textit{minimum eigenvalue factor}, which serves as a maximal entropy production attainable by the quantum dynamics and parallels the concept of dynamical activity in classical stochastic thermodynamic. Additionally, we investigate how quantum coherence in the initial environmental state affects these fundamental bounds, showing that the presence of coherence can actually improve the ultimate precision limits. Our findings provide insights into fundamental limits on the precision of quantum thermal machines and the role of quantum effects in thermodynamic processes.</p>

            <h2>Parastatistics and a secret communication challenge</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiyuan Wang</p>
            <p>One of the most unconventional features of topological phases of matter is the emergence of quasiparticles with exotic statistics, such as non-Abelian anyons in two dimensional systems. Recently, a different type of exotic particle statistics that is consistently defined in any dimension, called parastatistics, is also shown to be possible in a special family of topological phases. However, the physical significance of emergent parastatistics still remains elusive. Here we demonstrate a distinctive physical consequence of parastatistics by proposing a challenge game that can only be won using physical systems hosting paraparticles, as passing the challenge requires the two participating players to secretly communicate in an indirect way by exploiting the nontrivial exchange statistics of the quasiparticles. The winning strategy using emergent paraparticles is robust against noise, as well as the most relevant class of eavesdropping via local measurements. This provides both an operational definition and an experimental identity test for paraparticles, alongside a potential application in secret communication.</p>

            <p>Yttrium iron garnet (YIG) magnonics has garnered significant research interest because of the unique properties of magnons (quasiparticles of collective spin excitation) for signal processing. In particular, hybrid systems based on YIG magnonics show great promise for quantum information science due to their broad frequency tunability and strong compatibility with other platforms. However, their broad applications have been severely constrained by substantial microwave loss in the gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) substrate at cryogenic temperatures. In this study, we demonstrate that YIG thin films can be spalled from YIG/GGG samples. Our approach is validated by measuring hybrid devices comprising superconducting resonators and spalled YIG films, which exhibits anti-crossing features that indicate strong coupling between magnons and microwave photons. Such new capability of separating YIG thin films from GGG substrates via spalling, and the integrated superconductor-YIG devices represent a significant advancement for integrated magnonic devices, paving the way for advanced magnon-based coherent information processing.</p>

It is a new field that is providing important results about the possibility of detecting entanglement and testing Bell inequality at colliders for final states as diverse as top-quark, $\tau$-lepton pairs and $\Lambda$-baryons, massive gauge bosons and vector mesons. In this review, after presenting definitions, tools and basic results that are necessary for understanding these developments, we summarize the main findings -- as published by the beginning of year 2024 -- including analyses of experimental data in $B$ meson decays and top-quark pair production. We include a detailed discussion of the results for both qubit and qutrits systems, that is, final states containing spin one-half and spin one particles. Entanglement has also been proposed as a new tool to constrain new particles and fields beyond the Standard Model and we introduce the reader to this promising feature as well.</p>

            <p>Levitated ferromagnets act as ultraprecise magnetometers, which can exhibit high quality factors due to their excellent isolation from the environment. These instruments can be utilized in searches for ultralight dark matter candidates, such as axionlike dark matter or dark-photon dark matter. In addition to being sensitive to an axion-photon coupling or kinetic mixing, which produce physical magnetic fields, ferromagnets are also sensitive to the effective magnetic field (or "axion wind") produced by an axion-electron coupling. While the dynamics of a levitated ferromagnet in response to a DC magnetic field have been well studied, all of these couplings would produce AC fields. In this work, we study the response of a ferromagnet to an applied AC magnetic field and use these results to project their sensitivity to axion and dark-photon dark matter. We pay special attention to the direction of motion induced by an applied AC field, in particular, whether it precesses around the applied field (similar to an electron spin) or librates in the plane of the field (similar to a compass needle). We show that existing levitated ferromagnet setups can already have comparable sensitivity to an axion-electron coupling as comagnetometer or torsion balance experiments. In addition, future setups can become sensitive probes of axion-electron coupling, dark-photon kinetic mixing, and axion-photon coupling, for ultralight dark matter masses $m_\mathrm{DM}\lesssim\mathrm{feV}$.</p>

            <p>Quantum scars correspond to enhanced probability densities along unstable classical periodic orbits. In recent years, research on quantum scars has extended to various systems including the many-body regime. In this work we focus on the formation, prevalence, and stability of linear "bouncing-ball" (BB) scars in two-dimensional (2D) quantum wells. These scars have relevance as effective and controllable channels in quantum transport. We utilize imaginary time propagation to solve the 2D Schr√∂dinger equation within an arbitrary external confining potential, specifically the quantum well model with external perturbations. We show how BB scars begin to emerge with a single perturbative peak, such as a repulsive bump or attractive dip that simulates the effect of a charged nanotip in the system. We then identify the optimal size of the perturbative peak to maximize the prevalence of these scars. Finally, we investigate the stability of BB scars against external noise and find that some of them are remarkably robust. This suggests promising opportunities for further applications of BB scars in quantum transport.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yalun Zhang, Longwen Zhou</p>
            <p>Non-Hermitian phenomena, such as exceptional points, non-Hermitian skin effects, and topologically nontrivial phases, have attracted continued attention. In this work, we reveal how interactions and nonreciprocal hopping could collectively influence the behavior of two interacting bosons on quasiperiodic lattices. Focusing on the Bose-Hubbard model with Aubry-Andr√©-Harper quasiperiodic modulations and hopping asymmetry, we discover that the interaction could enlarge the localization transition point of the noninteracting system into a critical phase, in which localized doublons formed by bosonic pairs can coexist with delocalized states. Under the open boundary condition, the bosonic doublons could further show non-Hermitian skin effects, realizing doublon condensation at the edges, and their direction of skin-localization can be flexibly tuned by the hopping parameters. A framework is developed to characterize the spectral, localization, and topological transitions accompanying these phenomena. Our work advances the understanding of localization and topological phases in non-Hermitian systems, particularly in relation to multiparticle interactions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Damian Rovara, Lukas Burgholzer, Robert Wille</p>
            <p>As new advancements in the field of quantum computing lead to the development of increasingly complex programs, approaches to validate and debug these programs are becoming more important. To this end, methods employed in classical debugging, such as assertions for testing specific properties of a program's state, have been adapted for quantum programs. However, to efficiently debug quantum programs, it is key to properly place these assertions. This usually requires a deep understanding of the program's underlying mathematical properties, constituting a time-consuming manual task for developers. To address this problem, this work proposes methods for automatically refining assertions in quantum programs by moving them to more favorable positions in the program or by placing new assertions that help to further narrow down potential error locations. This allows developers to take advantage of rich and expressive assertions that greatly improve the debugging experience without requiring them to place these assertions manually in an otherwise tedious manner. An open-source implementation of the proposed methods is available at this https URL.</p>

            <p>Quantum error correction is essential for bridging the gap between the error rates of physical devices and the extremely low logical error rates required for quantum algorithms. Recent error-correction demonstrations on superconducting processors have focused primarily on the surface code, which offers a high error threshold but poses limitations for logical operations. In contrast, the color code enables much more efficient logic, although it requires more complex stabilizer measurements and decoding techniques. Measuring these stabilizers in planar architectures such as superconducting qubits is challenging, and so far, realizations of color codes have not addressed performance scaling with code size on any platform. Here, we present a comprehensive demonstration of the color code on a superconducting processor, achieving logical error suppression and performing logical operations. Scaling the code distance from three to five suppresses logical errors by a factor of $\Lambda_{3/5}$ = 1.56(4). Simulations indicate this performance is below the threshold of the color code, and furthermore that the color code may be more efficient than the surface code with modest device improvements. Using logical randomized benchmarking, we find that transversal Clifford gates add an error of only 0.0027(3), which is substantially less than the error of an idling error correction cycle. We inject magic states, a key resource for universal computation, achieving fidelities exceeding 99% with post-selection (retaining about 75% of the data). Finally, we successfully teleport logical states between distance-three color codes using lattice surgery, with teleported state fidelities between 86.5(1)% and 90.7(1)%. This work establishes the color code as a compelling research direction to realize fault-tolerant quantum computation on superconducting processors in the near future.</p>

Our analysis reveals that while single-photon loss does not stabilize the intrinsic instability in the model, the inclusion of two-photon loss restores stability, leading to the emergence of superradiant states which coexist with the normal vacuum states. Using a second-order cumulant expansion for the photons, we derive an analytical description of the system in the thermodynamic limit which agrees well with the exact calculation results. Additionally, we present the Wigner function for the system, shedding light on the breaking of the Z4-symmetry inherent in the model. These findings offer valuable insights into stabilization mechanisms in open quantum systems and pave the way for exploring complex nonlinear dynamics in two-photon Dicke models.</p>

We analyze the system's free energy landscape using field-theoretical methods and develop a digital-analog quantum algorithm that disentangles qubit and photon degrees of freedom through a parity-measurement protocol. This disentangling enables the emulation of a photonic Schr√∂dinger cat state, which is a hallmark of the superradiant ground state in finite-size systems and can be unambiguously probed through the Wigner tomography of the resonator's field.</p>

            <p>Multipartite entangled states are fundamental resources for multi-user quantum cryptographic tasks. Despite significant advancements in generating large-scale continuous-variable (CV) cluster states, particularly the dual-rail cluster state because of its utility in measurement-based quantum computation, its application in quantum cryptography has remained largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce a novel protocol for generating three user conference keys using a CV dual-rail cluster state. We develop the concept of a quotient graph state by applying a node coloring scheme to the infinite dual-rail graph, resulting in a six-mode pure graph state suitable for cryptographic applications. Our results demonstrate that the proposed protocol achieves performance close to that of GHZ-based protocols for quantum conference key agreement (QCKA), with GHZ states performing slightly better. However, a key advantage of our protocol lies in its ability to generate bipartite keys post-QCKA, a feature not achievable with GHZ states. Additionally, compared to a downstream access network using two-mode squeezed vacuum states, our protocol achieves superior performance in generating bipartite keys. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to the finite-size regime and consider the impact of using impure squeezed states for generating the multipartite entangled states, reflecting experimental imperfections. Our findings indicate that even with finite resources and non-ideal state preparation, the proposed protocol maintains its advantages. We also introduce a more accurate method to estimate the capacity of a protocol to generate bipartite keys in a quantum network.</p>

            <p>Discrete-step walks describe the dynamics of particles in a lattice subject to hopping or splitting events at discrete times. Despite being of primordial interest to the physics of quantum walks, the topological properties arising from their discrete-step nature have been hardly explored. Here we report the observation of topological phases unique to discrete-step walks. We use light pulses in a double-fibre ring setup whose dynamics maps into a two-dimensional lattice subject to discrete splitting events. We show that the number of edge states is not simply described by the bulk invariants of the lattice (i.e., the Chern number and the Floquet winding number) as would be the case in static lattices and in lattices subject to smooth modulations. The number of edge states is also determined by a topological invariant associated to the discrete-step unitary operators acting at the edges of the lattice. This situation goes beyond the usual bulk-edge correspondence and allows manipulating the number of edge states without the need to go through a gap closing transition. Our work opens new perspectives for the engineering of topological modes for particles subject to quantum walks.</p>

Starting from semi-classical rate equations and making a simple hypothesis for the phase of the laser field, a simple stochastic model for the laser quantum noise is suggested. The model is shown to agree quantitatively with quantum master equations for microscopic lasers with a small number of emitters and with classical Langevin equations for macroscopic systems. In contrast, neither quantum master equations nor classical Langevin equations adequately address the mesoscopic regime. The stochastic approach is used to calculate the linewidth throughout the transition to lasing, where the linewidth changes from being dominated by the particle-like nature of photons below threshold to the wave-like nature above threshold, where it is strongly influenced by index fluctuations enhancing the linewidth.</p>

            <p>The stellar hierarchy of quantum states of light classifies the states according to the Fock-state resources that are required for their generation together with unitary Gaussian operations. States with stellar rank n can be also equivalently referred to as genuinely n-photon quantum non-Gaussian states. Here we present an efficient method for construction of general witnesses of the stellar rank. The number of parameters that need to be optimized in order to determine the witness does not depend on the stellar rank and it scales quadratically with the number of modes. We illustrate the procedure by constructing stellar rank witnesses based on pairs of Fock state probabilities and also based on pairs of fidelities with superpositions of coherent states.</p>

            <p>A remarkable characteristic of quantum computing is the potential for reliable computation despite faulty qubits. This can be achieved through quantum error correction, which is typically implemented by repeatedly applying static syndrome checks, permitting correction of logical information. Recently, the development of time-dynamic approaches to error correction has uncovered new codes and new code implementations. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate three time-dynamic implementations of the surface code, each offering a unique solution to hardware design challenges and introducing flexibility in surface code realization. First, we embed the surface code on a hexagonal lattice, reducing the necessary couplings per qubit from four to three. Second, we walk a surface code, swapping the role of data and measure qubits each round, achieving error correction with built-in removal of accumulated non-computational errors. Finally, we realize the surface code using iSWAP gates instead of the traditional CNOT, extending the set of viable gates for error correction without additional overhead. We measure the error suppression factor when scaling from distance-3 to distance-5 codes of $\Lambda_{35,\text{hex}} = 2.15(2)$, $\Lambda_{35,\text{walk}} = 1.69(6)$, and $\Lambda_{35,\text{iSWAP}} = 1.56(2)$, achieving state-of-the-art error suppression for each. With detailed error budgeting, we explore their performance trade-offs and implications for hardware design. This work demonstrates that dynamic circuit approaches satisfy the demands for fault-tolerance and opens new alternative avenues for scalable hardware design.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dimitris Koutromanos, Dionisis Stefanatos, Emmanuel Paspalakis</p>
            <p>Machine learning has been revolutionizing our world over the last few years and is also increasingly exploited in several areas of physics, including quantum dynamics and this http URL need for a framework that brings together machine learning models and quantum simulation methods has been quite high within the quantum control field, with the ultimate goal of exploiting these powerful computational methods for the efficient implementation of modern quantum technologies. The existing frameworks for quantum system simulations, such as QuTip and this http URL, even though they are very successful in simulating quantum dynamics, cannot be easily incorporated into the platforms used for the development of machine learning models, like for example PyTorch. The TorchQC framework introduced in the present work comes exactly to fill this gap. It is a new library written entirely in Python and based on the PyTorch deep learning library. PyTorch and other deep learning frameworks are based on tensors, a structure that is also used in quantum mechanics. This is the common ground that TorchQC utilizes to combine quantum physics simulations and deep learning this http URL exploits PyTorch and its tensor mechanism to represent quantum states and operators as tensors, while it also incorporates all the tools needed to simulate quantum system dynamics. All necessary operations are internal in the PyTorch library, thus TorchQC programs can be executed in GPUs, substantially reducing the simulation time. We believe that the proposed TorchQC library has the potential to accelerate the development of deep learning models directly incorporating quantum simulations, enabling the easier integration of these powerful techniques in modern quantum technologies.</p>

The AI model calculates the holograms for real-time atom rearrangement. With precise controls over both position and phase, a high-speed spatial light modulator moves all the atoms simultaneously. This protocol can be readily used to generate defect-free arrays of tens of thousands of atoms with current technologies, and become a useful toolbox for quantum error correction.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> He Zhang, Tong Liu, Zhongcheng Xiang, Kai Xu, Heng Fan, Dongning Zheng</p>
            <p>Non-Hermitian systems exhibit a variety of unique features rooted in the presence of exceptional points (EP). The distinct topological structure in the proximity of an EP gives rise to counterintuitive behaviors absent in Hermitian systems, which emerge after encircling the EP either quasistatically or dynamically. However, experimental exploration of EP encirclement in quantum systems, particularly those involving high-order EPs, remains challenging due to the difficulty of coherently controlling more degrees of freedom. In this work, we experimentally investigate the eigenvalues braiding and state transfer arising from the encirclement of EP in a three-dimensional non-Hermitian quantum system using superconducting circuits. We characterize the second- and third-order EPs through the coalescence of eigenvalues. Then we reveal the topological structure near the EP3 by quasistatically encircling it along various paths with three independent parameters, which yields the eigenvalues braiding described by the braid group $B_3$. Additionally, we observe chiral state transfer between three eigenstates under a fast driving scheme when no EPs are enclosed, while time-symmetric behavior occurs when at least one EP is encircled. Our findings offer insights into understanding non-Hermitian topological structures and the manipulation of quantum states through dynamic operations.</p>

            <h2>Efficient optical cat state generation using squeezed few-photon superposition states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haoyuan Luo, Sahand Mahmoodian</p>
            <p>Optical Schr√∂dinger cat states are non-Gaussian states with applications in quantum technologies, such as for building error-correcting states in quantum computing. Yet the efficient generation of high-fidelity optical Schr√∂dinger cat states is an outstanding problem in quantum optics. Here, we propose using squeezed superpositions of zero and two photons, $|\theta\rangle = \cos{(\theta/2)}|0\rangle + \sin{(\theta/2)}|2\rangle$, as ingredients for protocols to efficiently generate high-fidelity cat states. We present a protocol using linear optics with success probability $P\gtrsim 50\%$ that can generate cat states of size $|\alpha|^2=5$ with fidelity $F>0.99$. The protocol relies only on detecting single photons and is remarkably tolerant of loss, with $2\%$ detection loss still achieving $F>0.98$ for cats with $|\alpha|^2=5$. We also show that squeezed $\theta$ states are ideal candidates for nonlinear photon subtraction using a two-level system with near deterministic success probability and fidelity $F>0.98$ for cat states of size $|\alpha|^2=5$. Schemes for generating $\theta$ states using quantum emitters are also presented. Our protocols can be implemented with current state-of-the-art quantum optics experiments.</p>

            <p>Light-matter interaction with squeezed vacuum has received much interest for the ability to enhance the native interaction strength between an atom and a photon with a reservoir assumed to have an infinite bandwidth. Here, we study a model of parametrically driven cavity quantum electrodynamics (cavity QED) for enhancing light-matter interaction while subjected to a finite-bandwidth squeezed vacuum drive. Our method is capable of unveiling the effect of relative bandwidth as well as squeezing required to observe the anticipated anti-crossing spectrum and enhanced cooperativity without the ideal squeezed bath assumption. Furthermore, we analyze the practicality of said models when including intrinsic photon loss due to resonators imperfection. With these results, we outline the requirements for experimentally implementing an effectively squeezed bath in solid-state platforms such as InAs quantum dot cavity QED such that \textit{in situ} control and enhancement of light-matter interaction could be realized.</p>

            <p>Realizing universal fault-tolerant quantum computation is a key goal in quantum information science. By encoding quantum information into logical qubits utilizing quantum error correcting codes, physical errors can be detected and corrected, enabling substantial reduction in logical error rates. However, the set of logical operations that can be easily implemented on such encoded qubits is often constrained, necessitating the use of special resource states known as 'magic states' to implement universal, classically hard circuits. A key method to prepare high-fidelity magic states is to perform 'distillation', creating them from multiple lower fidelity inputs. Here we present the experimental realization of magic state distillation with logical qubits on a neutral-atom quantum computer. Our approach makes use of a dynamically reconfigurable architecture to encode and perform quantum operations on many logical qubits in parallel. We demonstrate the distillation of magic states encoded in d=3 and d=5 color codes, observing improvements of the logical fidelity of the output magic states compared to the input logical magic states. These experiments demonstrate a key building block of universal fault-tolerant quantum computation, and represent an important step towards large-scale logical quantum processors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stefano Veroni, Alexandru Paler, Giacomo Giudice</p>
            <p>We show that universal quantum computation can be made fault-tolerant in a scenario where the error-correction is implemented without mid-circuit measurements. To this end, we introduce a measurement-free deformation protocol of the Bacon-Shor code to realize a logical $\mathit{CCZ}$ gate, enabling a universal set of fault-tolerant operations. Independently, we demonstrate that certain stabilizer codes can be concatenated in a measurement-free way without having to rely on a universal logical gate set. This is achieved by means of the disposable Toffoli gadget, which realizes the feedback operation in a resource-efficient way. For the purpose of benchmarking the proposed protocols with circuit-level noise, we implement an efficient method to simulate non-Clifford circuits consisting of few Hadamard gates. In particular, our findings support that below-breakeven logical performance is achievable with a circuit-level error rate below $10^{-3}$. Altogether, the deformation protocol and the Toffoli gadget provide a blueprint for a fully fault-tolerant architecture without any feed-forward operation, which is particularly suited for state-of-the-art neutral-atom platforms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Soeren Wengerowsky, Stefano Duranti, Lukas Heller, Hugues de Riedmatten</p>
            <p>Quantum Frequency Conversion (QFC) is a widely used technique to interface atomic systems with the telecom band in order to facilitate propagation over longer distances in fiber. Here we demonstrate the difference-frequency conversion from 606 nm to 1552 nm of microsecond-long weak coherent pulses at the single photon level compatible with Pr$^{3+}$:Y$_2$SiO$_5\,$ quantum memories, with high-signal to noise ratio. We use a single step difference frequency generation process with a continuous-wave pump at 994 nm in a MgO:ppLN-waveguide and ultra-narrow spectral filtering down to a bandwidth of 12.5 MHz. With this setup, we achieve the conversion of weak coherent pulses of duration up to 13.6 $\mu s$ with a device efficiency of about 25% and a signal-to-noise ratio >460 for 10 $\mu s$-long pulses containing one photon on average. This signal-to-noise ratio is large enough to enable a high-fidelity conversion of qubits emitted from an emissive quantum memory based on Pr$^{3+}$:Y$_2$SiO$_5\,$ and to realize an interface with quantum processing nodes based on narrow-linewidth cavity-enhanced trapped ions.</p>

            <p>With the development of any quantum technology comes a need for precise control of quantum systems. Here, we evaluate the impact of control noise on a quantum Otto cycle. Whilst it is postulated that noiseless quantum engines can approach maximal Otto efficiency in finite times, the existence of white noise on the controls is shown to negatively affect average engine performance. Two methods of quantum enhancement, counterdiabatic driving and quantum lubrication, are implemented and found to improve the performance of the noisy cycle only in specified parameter regimes. To gain insight into performance fluctuations, projective energy measurements are used to construct a noise-averaged probability distribution without assuming full thermalisation or adiabaticity. From this, the variances in thermodynamic currents are observed to increase as average power and efficiency improve, and are also shown to be consistent with known bounds from thermodynamic uncertainty relations. Lastly, by comparing the average functioning of the unmonitored engine to a projectively-measured engine cycle, the role of coherence in work extraction for this quantum engine model is investigated.</p>

            <p>Deeply inelastic scattering (DIS) is an essential process for exploring the structure of visible matter and testing the standard model. At the same time, the theoretical interpretation of DIS measurements depends on QCD factorization theorems whose validity deteriorates at the lower values of $Q^2$ and $W^2$ typical of neutrino DIS in accelerator-based oscillation searches. For this reason, progress in understanding the origin and limits of QCD factorization is invaluable to the accuracy and precision of predictions for these upcoming neutrino experiments. In these short proceedings, we introduce a novel approach based on the quantum entropy associated with continuous distributions in QCD, using it to characterize the limits of factorization theorems relevant for the description of neutrino DIS. This work suggests an additional avenue for dissecting factorization-breaking dynamics through the quantum entropy, which could also play a role in quantum simulations of related systems.</p>

            <p>The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model is a cornerstone in the study of quantum chaos and holographic quantum matter. Real-world implementations, however, deviate from the idealized all-to-all connectivity, raising questions about the robustness of its chaotic properties. In this work, we investigate a quadratic SYK model with distance-dependent interactions governed by a power-law decay. By analytically and numerically studying the spectral form factor (SFF), we uncover how the single particle transitions manifest in the many-body system. While the SFF demonstrates robustness under slightly reduced interaction ranges, further suppression leads to a breakdown of perturbation theory and new spectral regimes, marked by a higher dip and the emergence of a secondary plateau. Our results highlight the interplay between single-particle criticality and many-body dynamics, offering new insights into the quantum chaos-to-localization transition and its reflection in spectral statistics.</p>

            <p>Atom interferometers offer exceptional sensitivity to ultra-light dark matter (ULDM) through their precise measurement of phenomena acting on atoms. While previous work has established their capability to detect scalar and vector ULDM, their potential for detecting spin-2 ULDM remains unexplored. This work investigates the sensitivity of atom interferometers to spin-2 ULDM by considering several frameworks for massive gravity: a Lorentz-invariant Fierz-Pauli case and two Lorentz-violating scenarios. We find that coherent oscillations of the spin-2 ULDM field induce a measurable phase shift through three distinct channels: coupling of the scalar mode to atomic energy levels, and vector and tensor effects that modify the propagation of atoms and light. Atom interferometers uniquely probe all of these effects, while providing sensitivity to a different mass range from laser interferometers. Our results demonstrate the potential of atom interferometers to advance the search for spin-2 dark matter through accessing unexplored parameter space and uncovering new interactions between ULDM and atoms.</p>

            <p>The density-density response in optimally doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ has recently been shown to exhibit conformal symmetry. Using, the experimentally inferred conformal dynamic susceptibility, we compute the resultant quantum Fisher information (QFI), a witness to multi-partite entanglement. In contrast to a Fermi liquid in which the QFI is approximately temperature independent much below the Fermi energy scale, we find that the QFI increases as a power law at low temperatures but ultimately extrapolates to a constant at $T=0$. The constant is of the form, $\omega_g^{2\Delta}$, where $\Delta$ is the conformal dimension and $\omega_g$ is the UV cutoff which is on the order of the pseudogap. As this constant {depends on both UV and IR properties}, it illustrates that multipartite entanglement in a strange metal exhibits UV-IR mixing, a benchmark feature of doped Mott insulators as exemplified by dynamical spectral weight transfer. We conclude with a discussion of the implication of our results for low-energy reductions of the Hubbard model.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abdul Wahab, Muqaddar Abbas, Xiaosen Yang, Yuee Xie, Yuanping Chen</p>
            <p>In this research, we investigate second-order sideband generation (SSG) and slow-fast light using a hybrid system comprised of two coupled opto- and magnomechanical microspheres, namely a YIG sphere and a silica sphere. The YIG sphere hosts a magnon mode and a vibration mode induced by magnetostriction, whereas the silica sphere has an optical whispering gallery mode and a mechanical mode coupled via optomechanical interaction. The mechanical modes of both spheres are close in frequency and are coherently coupled by the straightway physical contact between the two microspheres. We use a perturbation approach to solve the Heisenberg-Langevin equations, offering an analytical framework for transmission rate and SSG. Using experimentally feasible settings, we demonstrate that the transmission rate and SSG are strongly dependent on the magnomechanical, optomechanical, and mechanics mechanics coupling strengths (MMCS) between the two microspheres. The numerical results show that increasing the MMCS can enhance both the transmission rate and SSG efficiency, resulting in gain within our system. Our findings, in particular, reveal that the efficiency of the SSG can be effectively controlled by cavity detuning, decay rate, and pump power. Notably, our findings suggest that modifying the system parameters can alter the group delay, thereby regulating the transition between fast and slow light propagation, and vice versa. Our protocol provides guidelines for manipulating nonlinear optical properties and controlling light propagation, with applications including optical switching, information storage, and precise measurement of weak signals.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sudin Ganguly, S. K. Maiti</p>
            <p>Non-reciprocal hopping induces a synthetic magnetic flux which leads to the non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm effect. Since non-Hermitian Hamiltonians possess both real and imaginary eigenvalues, this effect allows the observation of real and imaginary persistent currents in a ring threaded by the synthetic flux~\cite{nrh8}. Motivated by this, we investigate the behavior of persistent currents in a disordered Hatano-Nelson ring with anti-Hermitian intradimer hopping. The disorder is diagonal and we explore three distinct models, namely the Aubry-Andr√©-Harper model, the Fibonacci model, both representing correlated disorder, and an uncorrelated (random) model. We conduct a detailed analysis of the energy spectrum and examine the real and imaginary parts of the persistent current under various conditions such as different ring sizes and filling factors. Interestingly, we find that real and imaginary persistent currents exhibit amplification in the presence of correlated disorder. This amplification is also observed in certain individual random configurations but vanishes after configuration averaging. Additionally, we observe both diamagnetic and paramagnetic responses in the current behavior and investigate aspects of persistent currents in the absence of disorder that have not been previously explored. Interestingly, we find that the intradimer bonds host only imaginary currents, while the interdimer bonds carry only real currents.</p>

            <h2>Quantum chaos, localization and phase transitions in random graphs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ioannis Kleftogiannis, Ilias Amanatidis</p>
            <p>The energy level statistics of uniform random graphs are studied, by treating the graphs as random tight-binding lattices. The inherent random geometry of the graphs and their dynamical spatial dimensionality, leads to various quantum chaotic and localized phases and transitions between them. Essentially the random geometry acts as disorder, whose strength is characterized by the ratio of edges over vertices R in the graphs. For dense graphs, with large ratio R, the spacing between successive energy levels follows the Wigner-Dyson distribution, leading to a quantum chaotic behavior and a metallic phase, characterized by level repulsion. For ratios near R=0.5, where a large dominating component in the graph appears, the level spacing follows the Poisson distribution with level crossings and a localized phase for the respective wavefunctions lying on the graph. For intermediate ratios R we observe a phase transition between the quantum chaotic and localized phases characterized by a semi-Poisson distribution. The values R of the critical regime where the phase transition occurs depend on the energy of the system. Our analysis shows that physical systems with random geometry, for example ones with a fluctuating/dynamical spatial dimension, contain novel universal phase transition properties, similar to those occuring in more traditional phase transitions based on symmetry breaking mechanisms, whose universal properties are strongly determined by the dimensionality of the system.</p>

In a previous work, we had identified bound states of NH and Feshbach resonances in the e + NH+ system at a single geometry, namely the NH+ equilibrium Re = 2.0205 a0 . Here we present a much more detailed work by repeating the calculation on over 60 internuclear distances to obtain the corresponding potential energy curves. The bound states for nine symmetries have been detailed many of which, particularly the singlet states, were never studied before. Several resonant states of different symmetries, which were unknown until now, have been systematically identified and their widths calculated in the present work, which proved much more challenging due to presence of many avoided crossings. It is hoped that the bound and the new resonant states obtained here will open up other molecular dynamics studies, since for several dissociative processes, although experimental data existed for more than a decade, these are still uncorroborated due to absence of molecular data, and hence subsequent theoretical calculations.</p>

            <p>We present a new approach to investigating Rydberg molecules by demonstrating the formation and characterization of individual Rb$^{*}$Cs Rydberg molecules using optical tweezers. By employing single-atom detection of Rb and Cs, we observe molecule formation via correlated loss of both species and study the formation dynamics with single-particle resolution. We control the interatomic distances by manipulating the relative wavefunction of atom pairs using the tweezer intensity, optimizing the coupling to molecular states and exploring the effect of the tweezer on these states. Additionally, we demonstrate molecule association with atoms trapped in separate tweezers, paving the way for state-selective assembly of polyatomic molecules. The observed binding energies, molecular alignment, and bond lengths are in good agreement with theory. Our approach is broadly applicable to Rydberg tweezer platforms, expanding the range of available molecular systems and enabling the integration of Rydberg molecules into existing quantum science platforms.</p>

            <p>Photocurrent-induced harmonics appear in gases and solids due to tunnel ionization of electrons in strong fields and subsequent acceleration. In contrast to three-step harmonic emission, no return to the parent ions is necessary. Here we show that the same mechanism produces harmonics in metallic nanostructures in strong fields. Furthermore, we demonstrate how strong local field gradient, appearing as a consequence of the field enhancement, affects photocurrent-induced harmonics. This influence can shed light at the state of electron as it appears in the continuum, in particular, to its initial velocity.</p>

In this work, we study the connection between these calculations and the thermalisation of chaotic quantum many-body systems, using a coarse-grained description of entanglement dynamics known as the entanglement membrane. Starting from a double-holographic model of eternal two-sided asymptotically AdS$_d$ ($d>2$) black hole each coupled to a flat $d$-dimensional bath, we show that the entanglement dynamics in the late-time, large-subregion limit is described by entanglement membrane, thereby establishing a quantitative equivalence between a semi-classical gravity and a chaotic quantum many-body system calculation of the Page curve.</p>

            <p>It has been conjectured that the size of the black hole interior captures the quantum gate complexity of the underlying boundary evolution.

Our arguments are based on establishing such relation rigorously at early times using the notion of operator Schmidt rank and then extrapolating it to later times by mapping bulk surfaces to cuts in the circuit representation.</p>

            <p>A core challenge for superconducting quantum computers is to scale up the number of qubits in each processor without increasing noise or cross-talk. Distributed quantum computing across small qubit arrays, known as chiplets, can address these challenges in a scalable manner. We propose a chiplet architecture over microwave links with potential to exceed monolithic performance on near-term hardware. Our methods of modeling and evaluating the chiplet architecture bridge the physical and network layers in these processors. We find evidence that distributing computation across chiplets may reduce the overall error rates associated with moving data across the device, despite higher error figures for transfers across links. Preliminary analyses suggest that latency is not substantially impacted, and that at least some applications and architectures may avoid bottlenecks around chiplet boundaries. In the long-term, short-range networks may underlie quantum computers just as local area networks underlie classical datacenters and supercomputers today.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sam Powers, Guangpeng Xu, Herbert Fotso, Tim Thomay, Dejan Stojkovic</p>
            <p>The most irreducible way to represent information is a sequence of two symbols. In this paper, we construct quantum states using this basic building block. Specifically, we show that the probabilities that arise in quantum theory can be reduced to counting more fundamental ontic states, which we interpret as event networks and model using sequences of 0's and 1's. A completely self contained formalism is developed for the purpose of organizing and counting these ontic states, which employs the finite cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}_2 = \{0, 1\}$, basic set theory, and combinatorics. This formalism is then used to calculate probability distributions associated with particles of arbitrary spin interacting with sequences of two rotated Stern-Gerlach detectors. These calculations are compared with the predictions of non-relativistic quantum mechanics and shown to deviate slightly. This deviation can be made arbitrarily small and does not lead to violations of relevant no-go theorems, such as Bell's inequalities, the Kochen-Specker theorem, or the PBR theorem. The proposed model is then extended to an optical system involving photon number states passing through a beam splitter. Leveraging recent advancements in high precision experiments on these systems, we then propose a means of testing the new model using a tabletop experiment.</p>

            <p>Understanding the influence of measurements on the properties of many-body systems is a fundamental problem in quantum mechanics and for quantum technologies. This paper explores how a finite density of stochastic local measurement modifies a given state's entanglement structure. Considering various measurement protocols, we explore the typical quantum correlations of their associated projected ensembles arising from the ground state of the quantum Ising model. Using large-scale numerical simulations, we demonstrate substantial differences among inequivalent measurement protocols. Surprisingly, we observe that forced on-site measurements can enhance both bipartite and multipartite entanglement. We present a phenomenological toy model and perturbative calculations to analytically support these results. Furthermore, we extend these considerations to the non-Hermitian Ising model, naturally arising in optically monitored systems, and we show that its qualitative entanglement features are not altered by a finite density of projective measurements. Overall, these results reveal a complex phenomenology where local quantum measurements do not simply disentangle degrees of freedom, but may actually strengthen the entanglement in the system.</p>

            <p>Quantum networks (QNs) exhibit stronger connectivity than predicted by classical percolation, yet the origin of this phenomenon remains unexplored. Here, we apply a statistical physics model -- concurrence percolation -- to uncover the origin of stronger connectivity on hierarchical scale-free networks, the ($U,V$) flowers. These networks allow full analytical control over path connectivity through two adjustable path-length parameters, $U \leq V$. This precise control enables us to determine critical exponents well beyond current simulation limits, revealing that classical and concurrence percolations, while both satisfying the hyperscaling relation, fall into distinct universality classes. This distinction arises from how they "superpose" parallel, non-shortest path contributions into overall connectivity. Concurrence percolation, unlike its classical counterpart, is sensitive to non-shortest paths and shows higher resilience to detours as these paths lengthen. This enhanced resilience is also observed in real-world hierarchical, scale-free Internet networks. Our findings highlight a crucial principle for QN design: when non-shortest paths are abundant, they notably enhance QN connectivity beyond what is achievable with classical percolation.</p>

One of the main problems of variational methods lies in the phenomenon of Barren Plateaus, present in the optimization of variational parameters. Adding geometric inductive bias to the quantum models has been proposed as a potential solution to mitigate this problem, leading to a new field called Geometric Quantum Machine Learning. In this work, an equivariant architecture for variational quantum classifiers is introduced to create a label-invariant model for image classification with $C_4$ rotational label symmetry. The equivariant circuit is benchmarked against two different architectures, and it is experimentally observed that the geometric approach boosts the model's performance. Finally, a classical equivariant convolution operation is proposed to extend the quantum model for the processing of larger images, employing the resources available in NISQ devices.</p>

            <p>In the Hermitian regime, the Wannier-Stark ladder characterizes the eigenstates of an electron in a periodic potential with an applied static electric field. In this work, we extend this concept to the complex regime for a periodic non-Hermitian system under a linear potential. We show that although the energy levels can be complex, they are still equally spaced by a real Bloch frequency. This ensures single-particle Bloch oscillations with a damping (or growing) rate. The system can also support standard two-particle Bloch oscillations under certain conditions. We propose two types of dimerized non-Hermitian systems to demonstrate our results. In addition, we also propose a scheme to demonstrate the results of electron-pair dynamics in a single-particle 2D $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric square lattice.</p>

            <p>A (target) quantum system is often measured through observations performed on a second (meter) system to which the target is coupled. In the presence of global conservation laws holding on the joint meter-target system, the Wigner-Araki-Yanase theorem and its generalizations predict a lower-bound on the measurement's error (Ozawa's bound). While practically negligible for macroscopic meters, it becomes relevant for microscopic ones. Here, we propose a simple interferometric setup, arguably within reach of present technology, in which a flying particle (a microscopic quantum meter) is used to measure a qubit by interacting with it in one arm of the interferometer. In this scenario, the globally conserved quantity is the total energy of particle and qubit. We show how the measurement error, $\varepsilon$, is linked to the non-stationary nature of the measured observable and the finite duration of the target-meter interaction while Ozawa's bound, $\varepsilon_{\mathrm B}$, only depends on the momentum uncertainty of the meter's wavepacket. When considering short wavepackets with respect to the evolution time of the qubit, we show that $\varepsilon/\varepsilon_{\mathrm B}$ is strictly tied to the position-momentum uncertainty of the meter's wavepacket and $\varepsilon/\varepsilon_{\mathrm B} \rightarrow 1$ only when employing Gaussian wavepackets. On the contrary, long wavepackets of any shape lead to $\varepsilon/\varepsilon_{\mathrm B} \rightarrow \sqrt{2}$. In addition to their fundamental relevance, our findings have important practical consequences for optimal resource management in quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) enables secret key exchange between two remote parties with information-theoretic security rooted in the laws of quantum physics. Encoding key information in continuous variables (CV), such as the values of quadrature components of coherent states of light, brings implementations much closer to standard optical communication systems, but this comes at the price of significant complexity in the digital signal processing techniques required for operation at low signal-to-noise ratios. In this work, we wish to lower the barriers to entry for CV-QKD experiments associated to this difficulty by providing a highly modular, open source software that is in principle hardware agnostic and can be used in multiple configurations. We benchmarked this software, called QOSST, using an experimental setup with a locally generated local oscillator, frequency multiplexed pilots and RF-heterodyne detection, and obtained state-of-the-art secret key rates of the order of Mbit/s over metropolitan distances at the asymptotic limit. We hope that QOSST can be used to stimulate further experimental advances in CV-QKD and be improved and extended by the community to achieve high performance in a wide variety of configurations.</p>

            <h2>Wave Function Collapse, Lorentz Invariance, and the Third Postulate of Relativity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Edward J. Gillis</p>
            <p>The changes that quantum states undergo during measurement are both probabilistic and nonlocal. These two characteristics complement one another to insure compatibility with relativity and maintain conservation laws. Nonlocal entanglement relations provide a means to enforce conservation laws in a probabilistic theory, while the probabilistic nature of nonlocal effects prevents the superluminal transmission of information. In order to explain these measurement-induced changes in terms of fundamental physical processes it is necessary to take these two key characteristics into account. One way to do this is to modify the Schroedinger equation by adding stochastic, nonlinear terms. A number of such proposals have been made over the past few decades. A recently proposed equation based on the assumption that wave function collapse is induced by a sequence of correlating interactions of the kind that constitute measurements has been shown to maintain strict adherence to conservation laws in individual instances, and has also eliminated the need to introduce any new, ad hoc physical constants. In this work it is shown that this modified Schroedinger equation is naturally Lorentz invariant. It is further argued that the additional spacetime structure that it requires provides a way to implement the assumption that spacelike-separated operators (and measurements) commute, and that this assumption of local commutativity should be regarded as a third postulate of relativity.</p>

            <h2>On the applicability of Kolmogorov's theory of probability to the description of quantum phenomena. Part I: Foundations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maik Reddiger</p>
            <p>It is a common view that von Neumann laid the foundations of a "quantum probability theory" with his axiomatization of quantum mechanics (QM). As such, it is regarded a generalization of the "classical probability theory" due to Kolmogorov. Outside of quantum physics, however, Kolmogorov's axioms enjoy universal applicability. This raises the question of whether quantum physics indeed requires such a generalization of our conception of probability or if von Neumann's axiomatization of QM was contingent on the absence of a general theory of probability in the 1920s. In this work I argue in favor of the latter position. In particular, I show that for non-relativistic $N$-body quantum systems subject to a time-independent scalar potential, it is possible to construct a mathematically rigorous theory based on Kolmogorov's axioms and physically natural random variables, which reproduces central predictions of QM. The respective theories are distinct, so that an empirical comparison may be possible. Moreover, the approach can in principle be adapted to other classes of quantum-mechanical models. Part II of this series discusses the empirical violation of Bell inequalities in the context of this approach. Part III addresses the projection postulate and the question of measurement.</p>

            <p>Potential wells are employed to constrain quantum particles into forming discrete energy levels, acting as artificial few-level systems. In contrast, an anti-parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetric system can have a single pair of real energy levels, while all the remaining levels are unstable due to the negative imaginary part of the energy. In this work, we investigate the formation of bound states in a tight-binding chain induced by a harmonic imaginary potential. Exact solutions show that the real parts of energy levels are equidistant, while the imaginary parts are semi-negative definite and equidistant. This allows for the formation of an effective two-level system. For a given initial state with a wide range of profiles, the evolved state always converges to a superposition of two stable eigenstates. In addition, these two states are orthogonal under the Dirac inner product and can be mutually switched by applying a $\pi$ pulse of a linear field. Our finding provides an alternative method for fabricating quantum devices through dissipation.</p>

            <p>Continuous variables (CV) offer a promising platform for the development of various applications, such as quantum communication, computing, and sensing, and CV graph states represent a family of powerful entangled resource states for all these areas. In many of these protocols, a crucial aspect is the certification of the quantum state subsequently used. While numerous protocols exist, most rely on assumptions unrealistic for physical continuous variable states, such as infinite precision in quadrature measurement or the use of states requiring infinite squeezing. In this work, we adapt existing protocols to deal with these unavoidable considerations, and use them to certify their application for different quantum information tasks. More specifically, we show how CV graph states can be efficiently verified and certified even in a noisy and imperfect setting. We then discuss how our findings impact the usability of states obtained after the protocol for different applications, including quantum teleportation, computing, and sensing.</p>

            <p>Multipartite entanglement, linking multiple nodes simultaneously, is a higher-order correlation that offers advantages over pairwise connections in quantum networks (QNs). Creating reliable, large-scale multipartite entanglement requires entanglement routing, a process that combines local, short-distance connections into a long-distance connection, which can be considered as a transformation of network topology. Here, we address the question of whether a QN can be topologically transformed into another via entanglement routing. Our key result is an exact mapping from multipartite entanglement routing to Nash-Williams's graph immersion problem, extended to hypergraphs. This generalized hypergraph immersion problem introduces a partial order between QN topologies, permitting certain topological transformations while precluding others, offering discerning insights into the design and manipulation of higher-order network topologies in QNs.</p>

            <p>Quantum machine learning (QML) requires significant quantum resources to address practical real-world problems. When the underlying quantum information exhibits hierarchical structures in the data, limitations persist in training complexity and generalization. Research should prioritize both the efficient design of quantum architectures and the development of learning strategies to optimize resource usage. We propose a framework called quantum curriculum learning (Q-CurL) for quantum data, where the curriculum introduces simpler tasks or data to the learning model before progressing to more challenging ones. Q-CurL exhibits robustness to noise and data limitations, which is particularly relevant for current and near-term noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. We achieve this through a curriculum design based on quantum data density ratios and a dynamic learning schedule that prioritizes the most informative quantum data. Empirical evidence shows that Q-CurL significantly enhances training convergence and generalization for unitary learning and improves the robustness of quantum phase recognition tasks. Q-CurL is effective with broad physical learning applications in condensed matter physics and quantum chemistry.</p>

            <p>Quantum data centres (QDCs) could overcome the scalability challenges of modern quantum computers. Single-processor monolithic quantum computers are affected by increased cross talk and difficulty of implementing gates when the number of qubits is increased. In a QDC, multiple quantum processing units (QPUs) are linked together over short distances, allowing the total number of computational qubits to be increased without increasing the number of qubits on any one processor. In doing so, the error incurred by operations at each QPU can be kept small, however additional noise will be added to the system due to the latency cost and errors incurred during inter-QPU entanglement distribution. We investigate the relative impact of these different types of noise using a classically simulated QDC with two QPUs and compare the robustness to noise of the two main ways of implementing remote gates, cat-comm and TP-comm. We find that considering the quantity of gates or inter-QPU entangled links is often inadequate to predict the output fidelity from a quantum circuit and infer that an improved understanding of error propagation during distributed quantum circuits may represent a significant optimisation opportunity for compilation.</p>

            <p>The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a prominent quantum algorithm designed to find approximate solutions to combinatorial optimization problems, which are challenging for classical computers. In the current era, where quantum hardware is constrained by noise and limited qubit availability, simulating the QAOA remains essential for research. However, existing state-of-the-art simulation frameworks suffer from long execution times or lack comprehensive functionality, usability, and versatility, often requiring users to implement essential features themselves. Additionally, these frameworks are primarily restricted to Python, limiting their use in safer and faster languages like Rust, which offer, e.g., advanced parallelization capabilities. In this paper, we develop a GPU accelerated QAOA simulation framework utilizing the NVIDIA CUDA toolkit. This framework offers a complete interface for QAOA simulations, enabling the calculation of (exact) expectation values, direct access to the statevector, fast sampling, and high-performance optimization methods using an advanced state-of-the-art gradient calculation technique. The framework is designed for use in Python and Rust, providing flexibility for integration into a wide range of applications, including those requiring fast algorithm implementations leveraging QAOA at its core. The new framework's performance is rigorously benchmarked on the MaxCut problem and compared against the current state-of-the-art general-purpose quantum circuit simulation frameworks Qiskit and Pennylane as well as the specialized QAOA simulation tool QOKit. Our evaluation shows that our approach outperforms the existing state-of-the-art solutions in terms of runtime up to multiple orders of magnitude.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on over $10^5$ randomly generated multimode-entangled quantum states, achieving a very high success rate in entanglement detection. Additionally, the robustness of our method can be considerably enhanced against losses by expanding the set of accessible operators.

We generalize this model to supersymmetric number operator and corresponding Binet formula for supersymmetric Fibonacci divisor number operator. The operator determines the Hamiltonian of hierarchy of supersymmetric Golden oscillators, acting in fermion-boson Hilbert space and belonging to N=2 supersymmetric algebra. The eigenstates of the super Fibonacci divisor number operator are double degenerate and can be characterized by a point on the super-Bloch sphere. By the supersymmetric Fibonacci divisor annihilation operator, we construct the hierarchy of supersymmetric coherent states as eigenstates of this operator. Entanglement of fermions with bosons in these states is calculated by the concurrence, represented by the Gram determinant and hierarchy of Golden exponential functions. We show that the reference states and corresponding von Neumann entropy, measuring fermion-boson entanglement, are characterized completely by the powers of the Golden ratio. The simple geometrical classification of entangled states by the Frobenius ball and meaning of the concurrence as double area of parallelogram in Hilbert space are given.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anne Matthies, Nicolas Dannenfeld, Silvia Pappalardi, Achim Rosch</p>
            <p>We systematically investigate whether classical hydrodynamic field theories can predict the long-time dynamics of many-particle quantum systems. As an example, we investigate numerically and analytically the time evolution of a chain of spins (or qubits) subject to a stroboscopic dynamics. The time evolution is implemented by a sequence of local and nearest-neighbor gates which conserve the total magnetization. The long-time dynamics of such a system is believed to be describable by a hydrodynamics field theory, which, importantly, includes the effect of noise. Based on a field theoretical analysis and symmetry arguments, we map each operator in the spin model to corresponding fields in hydrodynamics. This allows us to predict which expectation values decay exponentially, and which of them decay with a hydrodynamics long-time tail. We illustrate these findings by studying the time evolution of all 255 Hermitian operators which can be defined on four neighboring sites. We show that all operators not protected by hydrodynamics decay exponentially and investigate a selected set of slowly decaying operators.</p>

            <h2>Quantum machine learning for multiclass classification beyond kernel methods</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chao Ding, Shi Wang, Yaonan Wang, Weibo Gao</p>
            <p>Quantum machine learning is considered one of the current research fields with immense potential. In recent years, Havl√≠ƒçek et al. [Nature 567, 209-212 (2019)] have proposed a quantum machine learning algorithm with quantum-enhanced feature spaces, which effectively addressed a binary classification problem on a superconducting processor and offered a potential pathway to achieving quantum advantage. However, a straightforward binary classification algorithm falls short in solving multiclass classification problems. In this paper, we propose a quantum algorithm that rigorously demonstrates that quantum kernel methods enhance the efficiency of multiclass classification in real-world applications, providing quantum advantage. To demonstrate quantum advantage, we design six distinct quantum kernels within the quantum algorithm to map input data into quantum state spaces and estimate the corresponding quantum kernel matrices. The results from quantum simulations reveal that the quantum algorithm outperforms its classical counterpart in handling six real-world multiclass classification problems. Furthermore, we leverage a variety of performance metrics to comprehensively evaluate the classification and generalization performance of the quantum algorithm. The results demonstrate that the quantum algorithm achieves superior classification and better generalization performance relative to classical counterparts.</p>

            <h2>Efficient Classical Computation of Single-Qubit Marginal Measurement Probabilities to Simulate Certain Classes of Quantum Algorithms</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Santana Y. Pradata, M 'Anin N. 'Azhiim, Hendry M. Lim, Ahmad R. T. Nugraha</p>
            <p>Classical simulations of quantum circuits are essential for verifying and benchmarking quantum algorithms, particularly for large circuits, where computational demands increase exponentially with the number of qubits. Among available methods, the classical simulation of quantum circuits inspired by density functional theory -- the so-called QC-DFT method, shows promise for large circuit simulations as it approximates the quantum circuits using single-qubit reduced density matrices to model multi-qubit systems. However, the QC-DFT method performs very poorly when dealing with multi-qubit gates. In this work, we introduce a novel CNOT "functional" that leverages neural networks to generate unitary transformations, effectively mitigating the simulation errors observed in the original QC-DFT method. For random circuit simulations, our modified QC-DFT enables efficient computation of single-qubit marginal measurement probabilities, or single-qubit probability (SQPs), and achieves lower SQP errors and higher fidelities than the original QC-DFT method. Despite some limitations in capturing full entanglement and joint probability distributions, we find potential applications of SQPs in simulating Shor's and Grover's algorithms for specific solution classes. These findings advance the capabilities of classical simulations for some quantum problems and provide insights into managing entanglement and gate errors in practical quantum computing.</p>

            <h2>Universal graph representation of stabilizer codes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrey Boris Khesin, Jonathan Z. Lu, Peter W. Shor</p>
            <p>We introduce a representation of $[[n, k]]$ stabilizer codes as semi-bipartite graphs wherein $k$ ``input'' nodes map to $n$ ``output'' nodes, such that output nodes may connect to each other but input nodes may not. We prove that this graph representation is in bijection with tableaus and give an efficient compilation algorithm that transforms tableaus into graphs. We then show that this map is efficiently invertible, which gives a new universal recipe for code construction by way of finding graphs with sufficiently nice properties. The graph representation gives insight into both code construction and algorithms. To the former, we argue that graphs provide a flexible platform for building codes particularly at smaller (non-asymptotic) scales. We construct as examples constant-size codes, e.g. a $[[54, 6, 5]]$ code and a family of roughly $[[n, \frac{n}{\log n}, \log n]]$ codes. We also leverage graphs in a probabilistic analysis to extend the quantum Gilbert-Varshamov bound into a three-way distance-rate-weight tradeoff. To the latter, we show that key coding algorithms -- distance approximation, weight reduction, and decoding -- are unified as instances of a single optimization game on a graph. Moreover, key code properties such as distance, weight, and encoding circuit depth, are all controlled by the graph degree. We give efficient algorithms for producing simple encoding circuits whose depths scale as twice the degree and for implementing logical diagonal and certain Clifford gates with non-constant but reduced depth. Finally, we construct a simple efficient decoding algorithm and prove a performance guarantee for a certain class of graphs, including the roughly $[[n, \frac{n}{\log n}, \log n]]$ code. These results give evidence that graphs are generically useful for the study of stabilizer codes and their practical implementations.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement asymmetry in periodically driven quantum systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tista Banerjee, Suchetan Das, K. Sengupta</p>
            <p>We study the dynamics of entanglement asymmetry in periodically driven quantum systems. Using a periodically driven XY chain as a model for a driven integrable quantum system, we provide semi-analytic results for the behavior of the dynamics of the entanglement asymmetry, $\Delta S$, as a function of the drive frequency. Our analysis identifies special drive frequencies at which the driven XY chain exhibits dynamic symmetry restoration and displays quantum Mpemba effect over a long timescale; we identify an emergent approximate symmetry in its Floquet Hamiltonian which plays a crucial role for realization of both these phenomena. We follow these results by numerical computation of $\Delta S$ for the non-integrable driven Rydberg atom chain and obtain similar emergent-symmetry-induced symmetry restoration and quantum Mpemba effect in the prethermal regime for such a system. Finally, we provide an exact analytic computation of the entanglement asymmetry for a periodically driven conformal field theory (CFT) on a strip. Such a driven CFT, depending on the drive amplitude and frequency, exhibits two distinct phases, heating and non-heating, that are separated by a critical line. Our results show that for $m$ cycles of a periodic drive with time period $T$, $\Delta S \sim \ln mT$ [$\ln (\ln mT)$] in the heating phase [on the critical line] for a generic CFT; in contrast, in the non-heating phase, $\Delta S$ displays small amplitude oscillations around it's initial value as a function of $mT$. We provide a phase diagram for the behavior of $\Delta S$ for such driven CFTs as a function of the drive frequency and amplitude.</p>

            <h2>Ultimate precision limit of quantum thermal machines</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yoshihiko Hasegawa</p>
            <p>Enhancing the precision of a thermodynamic process inevitably necessitates a thermodynamic cost, a principle formulated as the thermodynamic uncertainty relation. The thermodynamic uncertainty relation states that the relative variance of thermodynamic currents, calculated as the variance divided by the squared mean, decreases as entropy production increases. This means that if entropy production were allowed to become infinitely large, the relative variance could approach zero. However, it is evident that realizing infinitely large entropy production is infeasible in reality. In this Letter, we establish the ultimate limits of precision for open quantum thermal machines operating within a finite-dimensional system and environment. We derive bounds on the relative variance and the expectation of observables, applicable to any unitary evolution of the composite system. These bounds are governed by the \textit{minimum eigenvalue factor}, which serves as a maximal entropy production attainable by the quantum dynamics and parallels the concept of dynamical activity in classical stochastic thermodynamic. Additionally, we investigate how quantum coherence in the initial environmental state affects these fundamental bounds, showing that the presence of coherence can actually improve the ultimate precision limits. Our findings provide insights into fundamental limits on the precision of quantum thermal machines and the role of quantum effects in thermodynamic processes.</p>

            <h2>Dissipation-induced Quantum Homogenization for Temporal Information Processing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander Yosifov, Aditya Iyer, Vlatko Vedral</p>
            <p>Quantum reservoirs have great potential as they utilize the complex real-time dissipative dynamics of quantum systems for information processing and target time-series generation without precise control or fine-tuning of the Hamiltonian parameters. Nonetheless, their realization is challenging as quantum hardware with appropriate dynamics, robustness to noise, and ability to produce target steady states is required. To that end, we propose the disordered quantum homogenizer as an alternative platform, and prove it satisfies the necessary and sufficient conditions - stability and contractivity - of the reservoir dynamics, necessary for solving machine learning tasks with time-series input data streams. The results indicate that the quantum homogenization protocol, physically implementable as either nuclear magnetic resonance ensemble or a photonic system, can potentially function as a reservoir computer.</p>

            <h2>Parastatistics and a secret communication challenge</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiyuan Wang</p>
            <p>One of the most unconventional features of topological phases of matter is the emergence of quasiparticles with exotic statistics, such as non-Abelian anyons in two dimensional systems. Recently, a different type of exotic particle statistics that is consistently defined in any dimension, called parastatistics, is also shown to be possible in a special family of topological phases. However, the physical significance of emergent parastatistics still remains elusive. Here we demonstrate a distinctive physical consequence of parastatistics by proposing a challenge game that can only be won using physical systems hosting paraparticles, as passing the challenge requires the two participating players to secretly communicate in an indirect way by exploiting the nontrivial exchange statistics of the quasiparticles. The winning strategy using emergent paraparticles is robust against noise, as well as the most relevant class of eavesdropping via local measurements. This provides both an operational definition and an experimental identity test for paraparticles, alongside a potential application in secret communication.</p>
