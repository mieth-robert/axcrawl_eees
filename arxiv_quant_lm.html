            <h2>High-Distance Error-Correcting Codes for Fermion-to-Qubit Mappings in 2D and 3D</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruby Wei, Aqua Chung, Luke Coffman, Su-Kuan Chu, Xun Gao</p>
            <p>Quantum simulation of fermionic systems is a leading application of quantum computers. One promising approach is to represent fermions with qubits via fermion-to-qubit mappings. In this work, we present high-distance fermion-to-qubit stabilizer codes for simulating 2D and 3D fermionic systems. These codes achieve arbitrarily large code distances while keeping stabilizer weights constant. They also preserve locality by mapping local fermionic operators to local qubit operators at any fixed distance. Notably, our 3D construction is the first to simultaneously achieve high distance, constant stabilizer weights, and locality preservation. Our construction is based on concatenating a small-distance 2D or 3D fermion-to-qubit code with a high-distance fermionic color code. Together, these features provide a robust and scalable pathway to quantum simulation of fermionic systems.</p>

            <h2>Strategies to search for two-dimensional materials with long spin qubit coherence time</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michael Y. Toriyama, Jiawei Zhan, Shun Kanai, Giulia Galli</p>
            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) materials that can host qubits with long spin coherence time (T2) have the distinct advantage of integrating easily with existing microelectronic and photonic platforms, making them attractive for designing novel quantum devices with enhanced performance. However, the relative lack of 2D materials as spin qubit hosts, as well as appropriate substrates that can help maintain long T2, necessitates a strategy to search for candidates with robust spin coherence. Here, we develop a high-throughput computational workflow to predict the nuclear spin bath-driven qubit decoherence and T2 in 2D materials and heterostructures. We initially screen 1173 2D materials and find 190 monolayers with T2 > 1 ms, higher than that of naturally-abundant diamond. We then construct 1554 lattice-commensurate heterostructures between high-T2 2D materials and select 3D substrates, and we find that T2 is generally lower in a heterostructure than in the bare 2D host material; however, low-noise substrates (such as CeO2 and CaO) can help maintain high T2. To further accelerate the material screening effort, we derive analytical models that enable rapid predictions of T2 for 2D materials and heterotructures. The models offer a simple, yet quantitative, way to determine the relative contributions to decoherence from the nuclear spin baths of the 2D host and substrate in a heterostructural system. By developing a high-throughput workflow and analytical models, we expand the genome of 2D materials and their spin coherence times for the development of spin qubit platforms.</p>

            <h2>Continuous-time quantum walk-based ans√§tze on neutral atom hardware</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Edric Matwiejew, Jonathan Wurtz, Jing Chen, Pascal Jahan Elahi, Tommaso Macri, Ugo Varetto</p>
            <p>A key use of near-term quantum computers is as analogue simulators, matching the action of some virtual or abstracted system onto a program executed on physical quantum hardware. This work explores continuous-time quantum walks (CTQW) on constrained graphs of independent set configurations and implements these abstract walks on analog-mode neutral-atom hardware. First, we explore variational state preparation protocols with limited controls through the lens of CTQW and optimal control to prepare nontrivial target states in non-separable Hilbert spaces. Next, we match these virtual walk dynamics to physical execution on analog-mode neutral atom hardware by leveraging the Rydberg blockade phenomenon. We analyze the convergence and scaling in the preparation of these known states as an indicator of the upper bounds on the quantum speedup mechanisms predicted by ideal CTQWs, showing that these signatures persist even when executed on noisy hardware. Finally, we introduce noise mitigation methods using Bayesian postprocessing. This paper demonstrates the ability to prepare nontrivial entangled states using quantum walks in constrained subspaces, and that nonequilibrium dynamics on constrained independent set supspaces is feasible on cloud-accessible analog-mode neutral-atom quantum computers.</p>

            <p>Group-IV vacancy (G4V, or XV, where X = Si, Ge, Sn, Pb) color centers constitute a novel and promising class of defects in diamonds. This chapter reviews and refines the theoretical models for the XV systems, encompassing the intrinsic interactions, including spin-orbit coupling and electron-phonon interactions, and the external interactions involving strain, electric, light, and magnetic fields. Based on the refined model, we predict their properties, explain the experimental data, and suggest follow-up experiments.

            <h2>Generation of Large Kitten states via thermally driven dissipative freezing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Caspar Groiseau</p>
            <p>We show that one can exploit the representation of the Dicke state with magnetic quantum number $0$ in orthogonal bases to increase the probability of producing a large Kitten state or even a Cat state via dissipative one-axis twisting, resulting in a net increase in metrological sensitivity and robustness against white noise with respect to the initial state. The resulting states are also useful for quantum secret sharing. The success of the scheme is heralded by the rate of photoemissions. Unlike previous iterations, we have an important population of the larger Kitten states, which makes post-selecting trajectories for them feasible.</p>

            <h2>Enhancement of quantum sensing in a dissipatively coupled two-mode system</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hao-Wen Zhang, Dong-Yang Wang, Cheng-Hua Bai, Tian-Xiang Lu, Shi-Lei Su</p>
            <p>Quantum sensing near exceptional points (EPs) in non-Hermitian systems has shown promising sensitivity enhancements. However, practical applications are often hindered by structural complexity and strict parameter constraints. In this work, we introduce a simplified anti-parity-time (anti-PT) symmetric platform consisting of two independently cavities, which are indirectly coupled to each other by a shared dissipative environment. We demonstrate a significantly enhanced sensing response at the EPs compared to non-EP configurations. This improvement is attributed to the dominant second-order term in the Laurent series expansion of the eigenvalue response to external perturbations-a characteristic feature of higher-order singularities at EPs. This mechanism not only reinforces the foundation for sensitivity enhancement but also offers a structurally compact and robust strategy for quantum sensing. Our results underscore the potential of anti-PT symmetric systems in enabling high-precision sensing technologies and bridging non-Hermitian physics with scalable photonic device platforms.</p>

            <h2>Nonclassical correlations and quadrature squeezing of photons in anisotropic quantum Rabi-Stark model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yong-Xin Zhang, Chen Wang, Qing-Hu Chen</p>
            <p>This study investigates nonclassical effects of photons in the anisotropic quantum Rabi-Stark model by using a quantum dressed master equation. We analyze second- and higher-order correlation functions, and demonstrate that the nonlinear Stark coupling significantly modulates photon statistics, inducing distinct and tunable photon antibunching and bunching effects. Successive transition signatures of correlation functions provide a potential experimental probe for predicting quantum phase transitions. We further reveal that Stark coupling provides direct control over photon squeezing, achieving significant enhancement and suppression. These findings not only uncover rich nonclassical phenomena in the anisotropic quantum Rabi-Stark model but also establish the nonlinear Stark coupling as a crucial new dimension for quantum detection. It may open a new avenue for precise manipulation of strongly coupled light-matter systems, with potential applications in quantum information processing and quantum-enhanced technologies.</p>

            <h2>One- and multiphoton resonances in the light-atom interaction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexandre P. Costa, Alexandre V. Dodonov</p>
            <p>The interaction between atomic systems and electromagnetic fields is central to modern physics and emerging quantum technologies. The Rabi models, in their semiclassical and quantum versions, provide the simplest and most fundamental description of this interaction. In this work, we present a concise derivation of both models and show how one- and multiphoton resonances arise in the semiclassical regime. We then analyze how these resonances manifest in the quantum Rabi model, discussing similarities and differences in relation to the classical description. Special attention is given to the three-photon resonance, a phenomenon usually neglected in textbooks due to its relative weakness, but which is intrinsic to the radiation-matter interaction. Our goal is to offer an accessible pedagogical reference for students and researchers interested in Quantum Optics and Quantum Information, with an emphasis on the fundamentals of the Rabi models.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Frequency Conversion of Single Photons from a Tin-Vacancy Center in Diamond</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julia M. Brevoord, Jan Fabian Geus, Tim Turan, Miguel Guerrero Romero, Daniel Bedialauneta Rodr√≠guez, Nina Codreanu, Alexander M. Stramma, Ronald Hanson, Florian Elsen, Bernd Jungbluth</p>
            <p>Diamond tin-vacancy (SnV) centers are promising candidates for building quantum network nodes. However, their native photon emission at 619 nm is incompatible with metropolitan-scale networks operating at low-loss telecom wavelengths. To address this, we demonstrate highly efficient, low-noise quantum frequency conversion (QFC) of 619 nm photons to the telecom S-band at 1480 nm. The conversion process combines 619 nm photons with 1064 nm pump light in an actively stabilized cavity containing a bulk monocrystalline potassium titanyl arsenate (KTA) crystal. We achieve an internal (external) conversion efficiency of (48 +/- 3)% ((28 +/- 2)%) and a noise photon rate per wavelength of 2.2 +/- 0.9 cts/s/pm, which is spectrally flat in the investigated frequency range of 40 GHz. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the efficiency remains above 80% of its maximum over a frequency range of 70 GHz. Finally, we generate a string of photons from a single waveguide-embedded SnV center using a train of excitation pulses and send these through the QFC. After the QFC, we observe a string of telecom photons displaying the SnV lifetime, confirming successful conversion. These results represent a critical step towards metropolitan-scale fiber-based quantum networks using SnV centers.</p>

            <h2>Indefinite causal order in cavity quantum electrodynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lorenzo M. Procopio, L.O. Casta√±os-Cervantes, Tim J. Bartley</p>
            <p>Indefinite causal order (ICO) has the potential to be a new resource for quantum information processing. In most of its experiments, ICO has been investigated in a photonic platform. Here we investigate ICO in a cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) system composed of two cavities. Our results show that ICO can create entanglement between two distant cavity fields that never interact directly, and for the case of two cavity fields in the vacuum state, ICO presents an advantage over the fixed-order scenario by always generating large entanglement between the two cavity fields. Furthermore, we show that ICO can interchange one photon between both cavities with a total probability equal to one, without changing the quantum state of the atom, something that is impossible to achieve when two cQED systems are in well-defined order. Our results show the potential that ICO can offer in the paradigm of light-matter interaction for coherently controlling atom-field observables.</p>

            <p>Imperfect photons' indistinguishability limits the performance of photonic quantum communication and computation . Distillation protocols, inspired by entanglement purification, enhance photons' indistinguishability by leveraging quantum interference in linear optical circuits. In this work, we present a three-photon distillation protocol optimized to achieve the maximum visibility gain, which requires consideration of multi-photon effects such as collective photonic phases. We employ interferometers with the minimum number of modes, optimizing also over the protocol's success probability. The developed protocol is experimentally validated with a platform featuring a demultiplexed quantum dot source interfaced with a programmable eight-mode laser-written integrated photonic processor. We achieve indistinguishability distillation with limited photonic resources and for several multi-photon distinguishability scenarios. This work helps to strengthen the role of distillation as a practical tool for photon-based quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Approaching transform-limited linewidths in telecom-wavelength transitions of ungated quantum dots</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrew N. Wakileh, Dan Dalacu, Philip J. Poole, Boris Lamontagne, Simona Moisa, Robin L. Williams, Nir Rotenberg</p>
            <p>Highly coherent quantum emitters operating in the telecommunication C-band (1530 - 1565nm), where ultra-low-loss fibers and photonic circuits are available, are crucial to the development of scalable quantum technologies. In this work, we report on a modified Stranski-Krastanov growth scheme using chemical beam epitaxy to enable the generation of high-quality InAs/InP quantum dots, characterized by near-transform-limited linewidths ($\Gamma_{\mathrm{TL}}$). We demonstrate the growth of highly-symmetric quantum dots with aspect ratios >0.8 and densities ranging from 2 to 22$\,\mu$m$^{-2}$. Optical characterization of these sources reveal fine-structure splittings down to $25\pm4\,\mu$eV and a single-photon purity of $g^{(2)}(0) = 0.012\pm\mathrm{0.007}$, confirming the quality of these dots. Further, using an etalon to measure the linewidth, in combination with rigorous modelling, we find an upper-bound to the mean, low-power linewidths of only $12.1\pm 6.7\,\Gamma_\mathrm{TL}$ and, in the best case, $2.8\pm 1.8\,\Gamma_\mathrm{TL}$. These results represent a significant step in the development of telecom-wavelength quantum light sources which are essential for complex quantum networks and devices.</p>

            <h2>Floquet-informed Learning of Periodically Driven Hamiltonians</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Keren Li</p>
            <p>Characterizing time-periodic Hamiltonians is pivotal for validating and controlling driven quantum platforms, yet prevailing and unadjusted reconstruction methods demand dense time-domain sampling and heavy post-processing. We introduce a scalable Floquet-informed learning algorithm that represents the Hamiltonian as a truncated Fourier series and recasts parameter estimation as a compact linear inverse problem in the Floquet band picture. The algorithm is well-suited to problems satisfying mild smoothness/band-limiting. In this regime, its sample and runtime complexities scale polynomially with the Fourier cutoff, time resolution, and the number of unknown coefficients. For local Hamiltonian models, the coefficients grows polynomially with system size, yielding at most polylogarithmic dependence on the Hilbert-space dimension. Furthermore, numerical experiments on one- and two-dimensional Ising and Heisenberg lattices show fast convergence to time resolution and robustness to higher-order perturbations. An adaptive rule learns the cutoff of Fourier series, removing the need to set known truncation \textit{a priori}. These features enable practical certification and benchmarking of periodically driven platforms with rapidly decaying higher-order content, and extend naturally to near-periodic drives.</p>

            <h2>Evidence of Compact Wavefunctions from Quantum-Selected Configuration Interaction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tim Weaving, Angus Mingare, Alexis Ralli, Peter V. Coveney</p>
            <p>A recent direction in quantum computing for molecular electronic structure sees the use of quantum devices as configuration sampling machines integrated within high-performance computing (HPC) platforms. This appeals to the strengths of both the quantum and classical hardware; where state-sampling is classically hard, the quantum computer can provide computational advantage in the selection of high quality configuration subspaces, while the final molecular energies are evaluated by solving an interaction matrix on HPC and is therefore not corrupted by hardware noise. In this work, we present an algorithm that leverages stochastic Hamiltonian time evolution in Quantum-Selected Configuration Interaction (QSCI), with multireference perturbation theory capturing missed correlations outside the configuration subspace. The approach is validated through a hardware demonstration utilising 42 qubits of an IQM superconducting device to calculate the potential energy curve of the inorganic silane molecule, SiH4 using a 6-31G atomic orbital basis set, under a stretching of the Si-H bond length. In the regime of strong correlation we obtain energies comparable to Heatbath Configuration Interaction, but with a configuration space more than 200 times smaller, providing the first evidence that QSCI can produce more compact representations of the ground state wavefunction compared with conventional heuristics. This result is achieved with a configuration sampling scheme that predicts likely single and double excitations to generate connected configurations based on the orbital occupancies of a time-evolved quantum state.</p>

            <h2>LLM-QUBO: An End-to-End Framework for Automated QUBO Transformation from Natural Language Problem Descriptions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Huixiang Zhang, Mahzabeen Emu, Salimur Choudhury</p>
            <p>Quantum annealing offers a promising paradigm for solving NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems, but its practical application is severely hindered by two challenges: the complex, manual process of translating problem descriptions into the requisite Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) format and the scalability limitations of current quantum hardware. To address these obstacles, we propose a novel end-to-end framework, LLM-QUBO, that automates this entire formulation-to-solution pipeline. Our system leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to parse natural language, automatically generating a structured mathematical representation. To overcome hardware limitations, we integrate a hybrid quantum-classical Benders' decomposition method. This approach partitions the problem, compiling the combinatorial complex master problem into a compact QUBO format, while delegating linearly structured sub-problems to classical solvers. The correctness of the generated QUBO and the scalability of the hybrid approach are validated using classical solvers, establishing a robust performance baseline and demonstrating the framework's readiness for quantum hardware. Our primary contribution is a synergistic computing paradigm that bridges classical AI and quantum computing, addressing key challenges in the practical application of optimization problem. This automated workflow significantly reduces the barrier to entry, providing a viable pathway to transform quantum devices into accessible accelerators for large-scale, real-world optimization challenges.</p>

            <h2>Solving Optimal Power Flow using a Variational Quantum Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thinh Viet Le, Mark M. Wilde, Vassilis Kekatos</p>
            <p>The optimal power flow (OPF) is a large-scale optimization problem that is central in the operation of electric power systems. Although it can be posed as a nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic program, the complexity of modern-day power grids raises scalability and optimality challenges. In this context, this work proposes a variational quantum paradigm for solving the OPF. We encode primal variables through the state of a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC), and dual variables through the probability mass function associated with a second PQC. The Lagrangian function can thus be expressed as scaled expectations of quantum observables. An OPF solution can be found by minimizing/maximizing the Lagrangian over the parameters of the first/second PQC. We pursue saddle points of the Lagrangian in a hybrid fashion. Gradients of the Lagrangian are estimated using the two PQCs, while PQC parameters are updated classically using a primal-dual method. We propose permuting primal variables so that OPF observables are expressed in a banded form, allowing them to be measured efficiently. Numerical tests on the IEEE 57-node power system using Pennylane's simulator corroborate that the proposed doubly variational quantum framework can find high-quality OPF solutions. Although showcased for the OPF, this framework features a broader scope, including conic programs with numerous variables and constraints, problems defined over sparse graphs, and training quantum machine learning models to satisfy constraints.</p>

            <h2>Genuine multi-entropy, dihedral invariants and Lifshitz theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cl√©ment Berthi√®re, Paul Gaudin</p>
            <p>Multi-invariants are local unitary invariants of state replicas introduced as potential new probes of multipartite entanglement and correlations in quantum many-body systems. In this paper, we investigate two multi-invariants for tripartite pure states, namely multi-entropy and dihedral invariant. We compute the (genuine) multi-entropy for groundstates of Lifshitz theories, and obtain its analytical continuation to noninteger values of R√©nyi index. We show that the genuine multi-entropy can be expressed in terms of mutual information and logarithmic negativity. For general tripartite pure states, we demonstrate that dihedral invariants are directly related to R√©nyi reflected entropies. In particular, we show that the dihedral permutations of replicas are equivalent to the reflected construction, or alternatively to the realignment of density matrices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Holger Frahm, Sascha Gehrmann, Rafael I. Nepomechie, Ana L. Retore</p>
            <p>We consider the quantum integrable spin chain models associated with the Jimbo R-matrix based on the quantum affine algebra $D^{(2)}_{n+1}$, subject to quantum-group-invariant boundary conditions parameterized by two discrete variables $p=0,\dots, n$ and $\varepsilon = 0, 1$. We develop the analytical Bethe ansatz for the previously unexplored case $\varepsilon = 1$ with any $n$, and use it to investigate the effects of different boundary conditions on the finite-size spectrum of the quantum spin chain based on the rank-$2$ algebra $D^{(2)}_3$. Previous work on this model with periodic boundary conditions has shown that it is critical for the range of anisotropy parameters $0<\gamma<\pi/4$, where its scaling limit is described by a non-compact CFT with continuous degrees of freedom related to two copies of the 2D black hole sigma model. The scaling limit of the model with quantum-group-invariant boundary conditions depends on the parameter $\varepsilon$: similarly as in the rank-$1$ $D^{(2)}_2$ chain, we find that the symmetry of the lattice model is spontaneously broken, and the spectrum of conformal weights has both discrete and continuous components, for $\varepsilon=1$. For $p=1$, the latter coincides with that of the $D^{(2)}_2$ chain, which should correspond to a non-compact brane related to one black hole CFT in the presence of boundaries. For $\varepsilon=0$, the spectrum of conformal weights is purely discrete.</p>

            <h2>Observation of moir√© trapped biexciton through sub-diffraction-limit probing using hetero-bilayer on nanopillar</h2>

            <p>The ability to tune the degree of interaction among particles at the nanoscale is highly intriguing. The spectroscopic signature of such interaction is often subtle and requires special probes to observe. To this end, inter-layer excitons trapped in the periodic potential wells of a moir√© superlattice offer rich interaction physics, specifically due to the presence of both attractive and repulsive components in the interaction. Here we show that the Coulomb force between two inter-layer excitons switches from repulsive to attractive when the length scale reduces from inter-moir√©-pocket to intra-moir√©-pocket in a WS$_2$/WSe$_2$ hetero-bilayer - thanks to the complex competition between direct and exchange interaction. The finding is a departure from the usual notion of repelling inter-layer excitons due to layer polarization. This manifests as the simultaneous observation of an anomalous superlinear power-law of moir√© exciton and a stabilization of moir√© trapped biexciton. The experimental observation is facilitated by placing the hetero-bilayer on a polymer-nanopillar/gold-film stack which significantly reduces the inhomogeneous spectral broadening by selectively probing a smaller ensemble of moir√© pockets compared with a flat sample. This creates an interesting platform to explore interaction among moir√© trapped excitons and higher order quasiparticles.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zoia A. Mandrykina, Moritz Thierfeld, Natalia S. Oreshkina</p>
            <p>The hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) corrections to energy levels in muonic atoms are studied systematically across the periodic table. Two nuclear charge distribution models have been considered, with partly analytical solution for an homogeneously charged sphere model and direct numerical integration for a Fermi nuclear charge distribution. Our comparison reveals a good agreement between both approaches with differences typically below a few percent. The magnitude of HVP corrections increases with nuclear charge, displaying irregularities that correlate directly with the non-monotonic behavior of nuclear radii. Despite strong relativistic effects at high $Z$, the ratio of hadronic to muonic vacuum polarization remains remarkably stable, deviating by less than $10\%$ from the established $67\%$ non-relativistic benchmark value</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gilles Parez, Vincenzo Alba</p>
            <p>We investigate the out-of-equilibrium dynamics after a quantum quench of the reduced fidelities between the states of a subregion $A$ at different times. Precisely, we consider the fidelity between the time-dependent state of $A$ and its initial value, as well as with the state at infinite time. We denote these fidelities as the reduced Loschmidt echo (RLE) and the final-state fidelity (FSF), respectively. If region $A$ is the full systems, the RLE coincide with the standard Loschmidt echo. We focus on quenches from Gaussian states in several instances of the XY spin chain. In the hydrodynamic limit of long times and large sizes of $A$, with their ratio fixed, the reduced fidelities admit a quasiparticle picture interpretation. Interestingly, for some quenches in the hydrodynamic regime the RLE features a complicated structure with an infinite sequence of nested lightcones, corresponding to quasiparticles with arbitrary large group velocities. This leads to a ''staircase'' of cusp-like singularities in the time-derivative of the fidelity. At the sub-hydrodynamic regime for some quenches the RLE exhibits cusp-like singularities, similar to the so-called dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPT). We conjecture a criterion for the occurrence of the DQPT and for the ''critical'' times at which the singularities occur. Finally, we discuss the hydrodynamic limit of the FSF. In particular, we show that it provides a valuable tool to detect the so-called quantum Mpemba effect.</p>

            <h2>Can We Conjugate the Orbital Angular Momentum of a Single Photon with Nonlinear Optics? A Theoretical Analysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tobey Luck, Aar√≥n Aguilar-Cardoso, Cheng Li, Manuel Ferrer-Garcia, Jeremy Upham, Jeff Lundeen, Robert Boyd</p>
            <p>Stimulated parametric down-conversion (StimPDC) produces an idler beam that exhibits a phase conjugate of the spatial structure of the classical seed beam. Extending this effect to the single-photon regime can, in principle, enable the control of the orbital angular momentum of single photons. However, its experimental implementation remains challenging due to the lower photon flux of realistic single-photon sources compared to a classical pump beam, which causes the StimPDC process to occur less frequently compared to its spontaneous counterpart. To overcome this, we propose a cascaded parametric down-conversion scheme, in which the signal photon from a spontaneously down-converted pair seeds the StimPDC process, while the idler photon heralds the seed's presence. This configuration uses coincidence detection to effectively post-select for stimulated events among the background of spontaneous contributions. We show that phase conjugation at the single-photon level manifests as a bias towards equal orbital angular momentum between the heralding idler and the stimulated idler. Our results offer a practical route to manipulate single-photon correlations in the orbital angular momentum degree of freedom and could have implications for applications such as free-space quantum communication and quantum-enhanced sensing.</p>

            <p>Rydberg-atom electrometry, as an emerging cutting-edge technology, features high sensitivity, broad bandwidth, calibration-free operation, and beyond. However, until now the key atomic vapor cells used for confining electric field-sensitive Rydberg atoms nearly made with traditional glass-blown techniques, hindering the miniaturization, integration, and batch manufacturing. Here, we present the wafer-level MEMS atomic vapor cells with glass-silicon-glass sandwiched structure that are batch-manufactured for both frequency stability and electric field measurement. We use specially customized ultra-thick silicon wafers with a resistivity exceeding 10,000 cm, three orders of magnitude higher than that of typical silicon, and a thickness of 6 mm, providing a 4-fold improvement in optical interrogation length. With the as-developed MEMS atomic vapor cell, we configured a high-sensitivity Rydberg-atom electrometry with the minimal detectable microwave field to be 2.8 mV/cm. This combination of miniaturization and sensitivity represents a significant advance in the state-of-the-art field of Rydberg-atom electrometry, paving the way for chip-scale Rydberg-atom electrometry and potentially opening up new applications in a wider variety of fields.</p>

            <h2>Thermality and athermality in the Unruh effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> D. Jaffino Stargen, Vivishek Sudhir</p>
            <p>In idealized treatments of the Unruh effect, a two-level atom is accelerated in a prescribed classical trajectory through the vacuum of a quantum field -- the Unruh bath -- which causes the atom's internal state to thermalize to a temperature proportional to the acceleration. This happens via emission and absorption of quanta by the atom, leading to a detailed balance between fluctuations in the Unruh bath and associated dissipation of the atom's internal energy. In any physical manifestation of the Unruh effect, the center-of-mass (CoM) degree of freedom of the atom is dynamical, and is therefore coupled to the Unruh bath via momentum recoil during the absorption/emission process. We study this scenario and show how the fluctuation-dissipation theorem fails for the CoM degree of freedom, while still being upheld for the internal energy. That is, the CoM of an accelerated atom is not in thermal equilibrium with the Unruh bath, while its internal level can be.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiyan Wang, Zhe Wang, Yi-Ming Ding, Zenan Liu, Zheng Yan, Long Zhang</p>
            <p>We investigate the second order R√©nyi entanglement entropy at the quantum critical point of spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on a columnar dimerized square lattice. The universal constant $\gamma$ in the area-law scaling $S_{2}(\ell) = \alpha\ell - \gamma$ is found to be sensitive to the entangling surface configurations, with $\gamma_{\text{sp}} > 0$ for strong-bond-cut (special) surfaces and $\gamma_{\text{ord}} < 0$ for weak-bond-cut (ordinary) surfaces, which is attributed to the distinct conformal boundary conditions. Introducing boundary dimerization drives a renormalization group (RG) flow from the special to the ordinary boundary criticality, and the constant $\gamma$ decreases monotonically with increasing dimerization strength, demonstrating irreversible evolution under the boundary RG flow. These results provide strong numerical evidence for a higher-dimensional analog of the $g$-theorem, and suggest $\gamma$ as a characteristic function for boundary RG flow in (2+1)-dimensional conformal field theory.</p>

            <p>We prove that the dynamics of the one-dimensional $ XY $ model with random magnetic field perturbed by a sparse set of $ ZZ $ terms with a large coupling constant $ \Delta $ gives rise to Lieb-Robinson (L-R) bounds with a logarithmic lightcone and amplitude proportional to $ \Delta^{-1} $. These spin systems are equivalent to a set of spinless lattice fermions subjected to a random on site potential and sparse density-density interactions. In the absence of the random magnetic field we also obtain a suppression of the L-R bounds as $ \Delta^{-1} $. These results follow from the application of a general theorem about the L-R bound of a generic local time-dependent one-dimensional spin system with local time-dependent perturbations. Adopting the interaction picture of the dynamics, the large and sparse $ ZZ $ perturbations of the $ XY $ model, with or without disorder, are mapped into high-frequency periodic perturbations.

            <p>Digital quantum simulation (DQS) is one of the most promising paths for achieving first useful real-world applications for quantum processors. Yet even assuming rapid progress in device engineering and development of fault-tolerant quantum processors, algorithmic resource optimisation will long remain crucial to exploit their full power. Currently, Trotterisation provides state-of-the-art resource scaling. And recent theoretical studies of Trotterised Ising models suggest that even better performance than expected may be possible up to a distinct breakdown threshold in empirical performance. Here, we study multiple paradigmatic DQS models with experimentally realisable Trotterisations, and evidence the universality of a range of Trotterisation performance behaviours, including not only the threshold, but also new features in the pre-threshold regime that is most important for practical applications. In each model, we observe a distinct Trotterisation threshold shared across widely varying performance signatures; we further show that an onset of quantum chaotic dynamics causes the performance breakdown and is directly induced by digitisation errors. In the important pre-threshold regime, we are able to identify new distinct regimes displaying qualitatively different quasiperiodic performance behaviours, and show analytic behaviour for properly defined operational Trotter errors. Our results rely crucially on diverse new analytical tools, and provide a previously missing unified picture of Trotterisation behaviour across local observables, the global quantum state, and the full Trotterised unitary. This work provides new insights and tools for addressing important questions about the algorithm performance and underlying theoretical principles of sufficiently complex Trotterisation-based DQS, that will help in extracting maximum simulation power from future quantum processors.</p>

            <p>Quantum reservoir computing has emerged as a promising paradigm within the field of quantum machine learning, harnessing the inherent properties of quantum systems to optimise and enhance information processing capabilities. Here, we explore the potential of quantum-inspired machine learning methodologies by leveraging the complex dynamics of quantum reservoirs to address computationally challenging tasks with enhanced efficiency and accuracy. To this end, we employ an open quantum system model comprising two-level atomic ensembles coupled to Lorentzian photonic cavities to construct a quantum physical reservoir computer layer for a recurrent neural network. We evaluate the effectiveness of this approach by applying it to a standard machine learning image-recognition problem and benchmarking its performance against a conventional neural network of similar architecture, but lacking the quantum physical reservoir computer layer. Remarkably, as the dataset size increases, the quantum physical reservoir computer outperforms the conventional neural network, requiring fewer training epochs and a smaller dataset to achieve comparable accuracy. Furthermore, we employ the quantum physical reservoir computing approach to model the dynamics of open quantum systems, focusing on atomic system ensembles interacting with a structured photonic reservoir associated with a photonic band-gap material. Our results reveal that the quantum reservoir computer provides equally powerful representations for quantum dynamical problems, maintaining effectiveness even under constraints of limited training data.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emily A Van Milligen, Eliana Jacobson, Ashlesha Patil, Gayane Vardoyan, Don Towsley, Saikat Guha</p>
            <p>Quantum networks will be able to service consumers with long-distance entanglement by use of quantum repeaters that generate Bell pairs (or links) with their neighbors, iid with probability $p$ and perform Bell State Measurements (BSMs) on the links that succeed iid with probability $q$. While global link state knowledge is required to maximize the rate of entanglement generation between any two consumers, it increases the protocol latency due to the classical communication requirements and requires long quantum memory coherence times. We propose two entanglement routing protocols that require only local link state knowledge to relax the quantum memory coherence time requirements and reduce the protocol latency. These protocols utilize multi-path routing protocol and time multiplexed repeaters. The time multiplexed repeaters first generate links for $k$-time steps before performing BSMs on any pairs of links. Our two protocols differ in the decision rule used for performing BSMs at the repeater: the first being a static path based routing protocol and second a dynamic distance based routing protocol. The performance of these protocols depends on the quantum network topology and the consumers' location. We observe that the average entanglement rate and the latency increase with the time multiplexing block length, $k$, irrespective of the protocol. When a step function memory decoherence model is introduced such that qubits are held in the quantum memory for an exponentially distributed time with mean $\mu$, an optimal $k$ ($k_\text{opt}$) value appears, such that for increasing $k$ beyond $k_{\rm opt}$ hurts the entanglement rate. $k_{\rm opt}$ decreases with $p$ and increases with $\mu$. $k_{\rm opt}$ appears due to the tradeoff between benefits from time multiplexing and the increased likelihood of previously established Bell pairs decohering due to finite memory coherence times.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco Mazzoncini, Balthazar Bauer, Peter Brown, Romain All√©aume</p>
            <p>We introduce an explicit construction for a key distribution protocol in the Quantum Computational Timelock (QCT) security model, where one assumes that computationally secure encryption may only be broken after a time much longer than the coherence time of available quantum memories. Taking advantage of the QCT assumptions, we build a key distribution protocol called HM-QCT from the Hidden Matching problem for which there exists an exponential gap in one-way communication complexity between classical and quantum strategies. We establish that the security of HM-QCT against arbitrary i.i.d. attacks can be reduced to the difficulty of solving the underlying Hidden Matching problem with classical information. Legitimate users, on the other hand, can use quantum communication, which gives them the possibility of sending multiple copies of the same quantum state while retaining an information advantage. This leads to an everlasting secure key distribution scheme over $n$ bosonic modes. Such a level of security is unattainable with purely classical techniques. Remarkably, the scheme remains secure with up to $\mathcal{O}\big( \frac{\sqrt{n}}{\log(n)}\big)$ input photons for each channel use, extending the functionalities and potentially outperforming QKD rates by several orders of magnitudes.</p>

            <p>Subwavelength atomic arrays feature strong light-induced dipole-dipole interactions, resulting in subradiant collective resonances characterized by narrowed linewidths. In this work, we present a sideband cooling scheme for atoms trapped in subwavelength arrays that utilizes these narrow collective resonances. Working in the Lamb-Dicke regime, we derive an effective master equation for the atomic motion by adiabatically eliminating the internal degrees of freedom of the atoms, and validate its prediction with numerical simulations of the full system. Our results demonstrate that subradiant resonances enable the cooling of ensembles of atoms to temperatures lower than those achievable without dipole interactions, provided the atoms have different trap frequencies. Remarkably, narrow collective resonances can be sideband-resolved even when the individual atomic transition is not. In such scenarios, ground-state cooling becomes feasible solely due to light-induced dipole-dipole interactions. This approach could be utilized for future quantum technologies based on dense ensembles of emitters, and paves the way towards harnessing many-body cooperative decay for enhanced motional control.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Long D. H. My, Shushen Qin, Hui Khoon Ng</p>
            <p>Bosonic codes encode quantum information into a single infinite-dimensional physical system endowed with error correction capabilities. This reduces the need for complex management of many physical constituents compared with standard approaches employing multiple physical qubits. Recent discussions of bosonic codes centre around correcting only boson-loss errors, with phase errors either actively suppressed or deferred to subsequent layers of encoding with standard qubit codes. Rotationally symmetric bosonic (RSB) codes, which include the well-known cat and binomial codes, are capable of simultaneous correction of loss and phase errors, offering an alternate route that deals with arbitrary errors already at the base layer. Here, we investigate the robustness of such codes, moving away from the more idealistic past studies towards a circuit-level noise analysis closer to the practical situation where every physical component in the device is potentially faulty. We extend the concept of fault tolerance to the case of RSB codes, and then examine the performance of two known error correction circuits under circuit-level noise. Our analysis reveals a significantly more stringent noise threshold for fault-tolerant operation than found in past works; nevertheless, we show how, through waiting-time optimization and the use of squeezing, we can restore the noise requirements to a regime achievable with near-term quantum hardware. While our focus here is on cat codes for concreteness, a similar analysis applies for general RSB codes.</p>

            <p>Starting from a coarse-grained map of a quantum many-body system, we construct the inverse map that assigns a microscopic state to a coarse-grained state based on the maximum entropy principle. Assuming unitary evolution in the microscopic system, we examine the resulting dynamics in the coarse-grained system using the assignment map. We investigate both a two-qubit system, with \swap\ and controlled-\textsc{not}\ gates, and $n$-qubit systems, configured either in an Ising spin chain or with all-to-all interactions. We demonstrate that these dynamics exhibit atypical quantum behavior, such as nonlinearity and non-Markovianity. Furthermore, we find that these dynamics depend on the initial coarse-grained state and establish conditions for general microscopic dynamics under which linearity is preserved. As the effective dynamics induced by our coarse-grained description of many-body quantum systems diverge from conventional quantum behavior, we anticipate that this approach could aid in describing the quantum-to-classical transition and provide deeper insights into the effects of coarse graining on quantum systems.</p>

            <p>The performance of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is promising compared to other quantum algorithms, but also depends significantly on the appropriate design of the underlying quantum circuit. Recent research by Bowles, Ahmend \& Schuld, 2024 [1] raises questions about the effectiveness of entanglement in circuits for quantum machine learning algorithms. In our paper we want to address questions about the effectiveness of state preparation via Hadamard gates and entanglement via CNOT gates in the realm of quantum optimisation. We have constructed a total of eight different circuits, varying in implementation details, solving a total of 100 randomly generated MaxCut problems. Our results show no improvement with Hadamard gates applied at the beginning of the circuits. Furthermore, also entanglement shows no positive effect on the solution quality in our small scale experiments. In contrast, the investigated circuits that used entanglement generally showed lower, as well as deteriorating results when the number of circuit layers is increased. Based on our results, we hypothesise that entanglement can play a coordinating role, such that changes in individual parameters are distributed across multiple qubits in quantum circuits, but that this positive effect can quickly be overdosed and turned negative. The verification of this hypothesis represents a challenge for future research and can have a considerable influence on the development of new hybrid algorithms.</p>

            <p>Quantum computers can efficiently simulate highly entangled quantum systems, offering a solution to challenges facing classical simulation of Quantum Field Theories (QFTs). This paper presents an alternative to traditional methods for simulating the real-time evolution in QFTs by leveraging Hamiltonian Truncation (HT). As a use case, we study the Schwinger model, systematically reducing the complexity of the Hamiltonian via HT while preserving essential physical properties. For the observables studied in this paper, the HT approach converges quickly with the number of qubits, allowing for the interesting physics processes to be captured without needing many qubits. Identifying the truncated free Hamiltonian's eigenbasis with the quantum device's computational basis avoids the need for complicated and costly state preparation routines, reducing the algorithm's overall circuit depth and required coherence time. As a result, the HT approach to simulating QFTs on a quantum device is well suited to Noisy-Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, which have a limited number of qubits and short coherence times. We validate our approach by running simulations on a NISQ device, showcasing strong agreement with theoretical predictions. We highlight the potential of HT for simulating QFTs on quantum hardware.</p>

            <p>Distributed quantum computing (DQC) has emerged as a promising approach to overcome the scalability limitations of monolithic quantum processors in terms of computational capability. However, realising the full potential of DQC requires effective resource management and circuit scheduling. This involves efficiently assigning each circuit to a subset of quantum processing units (QPUs), based on factors such as their computational power and connectivity. In heterogeneous DQC networks with arbitrary connectivity topologies and non-identical QPUs, this becomes a complex challenge. This paper addresses resource management and circuit scheduling in such settings, with a focus on computing resource allocation in a quantum data center. We propose circuit scheduling algorithms based on Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP). Our MILP model accounts for errors arising from inter-QPU communication. In particular, the proposed schemes consider key factors, including network topology, QPU capacities, and quantum circuit structure, to make efficient scheduling and allocation decisions. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithms significantly improve circuit execution time and scheduling efficiency (measured by makespan and throughput), while also reducing inter-QPU communication overhead, compared to a baseline random allocation strategy. This work provides valuable insights into resource management strategies for scalable and heterogeneous DQC systems.</p>

            <p>In June 1925 Heisenberg arrived at Helgoland/Heligoland island to escape a fit of hay fever. He returned with a sketch of a strange theory of the micro-world, which we now call quantum mechanics. This essay attempts to present a look at this theory, which tries to return to the original insight of Heisenberg on what should be the essence of a theory of atomic realm: it must be a theory of the observable events, in which fundamentally unobservable quantities have no place. No ontological status is given to elements of the mathematical formulation of the theory. The theory is about our description of events in laboratories, probabilities of which are given by the Born rule. Following Bohr, these events involve macroscopic measuring apparatuses, and the accessible final events are classically describable. Information about the events is cloneable, as it is of a classical nature. The modern quantum theory of classicality is the decoherence theory. It treats "the pointer variable" of measuring apparatus as an open system interacting with an environment consisting of all other "zillions" of degrees of freedom of the device, and anything coupled to it. Because such environment is uncontrollable we have no possibility to reverse measurements. The quantum mechanical measurement theory based on decoherence theory is reproducing the predictions of Born rule. Notwithstanding, possibility of reversing measurements and of application of Born rule in situations other than these which lead to macroscopically observable events are features of a modification of quantum mechanics which is called by its adherents "unitary quantum mechanics". As its predictions, which go beyond quantum mechanics, are not testable - we claim that unitary quantum mechanics in an interpretation of quantum mechanics. As such it is metaphysics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhijeet Alase, Salini Karuvade</p>
            <p>Quantum algorithms for estimating the eigenvalues of matrices, including the phase estimation algorithm, serve as core subroutines in a wide range of quantum algorithms, including those in quantum chemistry and quantum machine learning. The standard quantum eigenvalue (phase) estimation algorithm accepts a Hermitian (unitary) matrix and a state in an unknown superposition of its eigenstates as input, and coherently records the estimates for real eigenvalues (eigenphases) in an ancillary register. Extension of quantum eigenvalue and phase estimation algorithms to the case of non-normal input matrices is obstructed by several factors such as non-orthogonality of eigenvectors, existence of generalized eigenvectors and the fact that eigenvalues may lie anywhere on the complex plane. In this work, we propose a novel approach for estimating the eigenvalues of non-normal matrices based on preparation of a state that we call the "resolvent state". We construct the first efficient algorithm for estimating the phases of the unimodular eigenvalues of a given non-unitary matrix. We then construct an efficient algorithm for estimating the real eigenvalues of a given non-Hermitian matrix, achieving complexities that match the best known results while operating under significantly relaxed assumptions on the non-real part of the spectrum. The resolvent-based approach that we introduce also extends to estimating eigenvalues that lie on a parametrized complex curve, subject to explicitly stated conditions, thereby paving the way for a new paradigm of parametric eigenvalue estimation.</p>

            <p>We propose a systematic framework to construct a (d+1)-dimensional stabilizer model from an initial generic d-dimensional abelian symmetry. Our approach builds upon the iterative gauging procedure, developed by one of the authors in [J. Garre-Rubio, Nature Commun. 15, 7986 (2024)], in which an initial symmetric state is repeatedly gauged to obtain an emergent model in one dimension higher that supports the initial symmetry at its boundary. This method not only enables the construction of emergent states and corresponding commuting stabilizer Hamiltonians of which they are ground states, but it also provides a way to construct gapped boundary conditions for these models that amount to spontaneously breaking part of the boundary symmetry. In a detailed introductory example, we showcase our paradigm by constructing three-dimensional Clifford-deformed surface codes from iteratively gauging a global 0-form symmetry that lives in two dimensions. We then provide a proof of our main result, hereby drawing upon a slight extension of the gauging procedure of Williamson. We additionally provide two more examples in d=2 in which different type-I fracton orders emerge from gauging initial linear subsystem and Sierpinski fractal symmetries. En passant, we provide explicit tensor network representations of all of the involved gauging maps and the emergent states.</p>

            <p>Verifying whether a quantum device produces a specific state is a fundamental task in many applications of modern quantum technologies. In the conventional framework of quantum state verification, designing an optimal or efficient protocol for each type of state often requires intricate customization. Recently, Hsin-Yuan Huang et al. introduced a novel approach called the shadow overlap protocol in arXiv:2404.07281v1, which leverages classical shadows to efficiently verify multiple types of states simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a new verification protocol that integrates key ideas from both the conventional framework and the shadow overlap protocol. To achieve this, we first reformulate the shadow overlap protocol using the language of hypothesis testing, which also underpins the conventional framework, and then analyze the similarities and differences between them. Our approach enhances the capabilities of the shadow overlap protocol while addressing some of its limitations, leading to improved sample complexity and a more natural treatment of states with specific structures. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our protocol by applying it to GHZ states and stabilizer states.</p>

We show that the emergence of Markovianity is controlled by the spectral function of the ETH and that local detailed balance emerges in the Markovian regime for a broad class of pure bath states. We numerically verify this result by comparing the master equation to dynamics computed using exact diagonalization of a chaotic Hamiltonian. We also compare the master equation to exact dynamics for an integrable bath and find that at finite size they strongly disagree. Our work puts forward eigenstate thermalization as a foundation for open quantum systems theory, thus extending it beyond ensemble bath preparations to chaotic many-body environments in generic pure states.</p>

            <h2>Quantum-Optimal Frequency Estimation of Stochastic AC Fields</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anirban Dey, Sara Mouradian, Cosmo Lupo, Zixin Huang</p>
            <p>Resolving frequencies in a time-dependent field is classically limited by the measurement bandwidth. Using tools from quantum metrology and quantum control may overcome this limit, yet the full advantage afforded by entanglement so far remains elusive. Here we map the problem of frequency measurement to that of estimating a global dephasing quantum channel. In this way, we determine the ultimate quantum limits of {frequency estimation in stochastic AC} sensing. We find exact {quantum Fisher information bounds} for estimating frequency and frequency differences of stochastic fields. In particular, given two close signals with frequency separation $\omega_r$, we find that the quantum Fisher information (QFI) for the separation estimation is approximately $2/\omega_r^2$, {i.e.}~\emph{inversely} proportional to the separation parameter. The bounds are achievable in certain regimes by superpositions of Dicke states. GHZ states are suboptimal but improve precision over unentangled states, achieving Heisenberg scaling in the low-bandwidth limit. This work establishes a robust framework for stochastic AC signal sensing that can be extended to arbitrary time-dependent and stochastic fields.</p>

            <h2>Gradient projection method for constrained quantum control</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oleg Morzhin, Alexander Pechen</p>
            <p>In this work, we adopt the Gradient Projection Method (GPM) to problems of quantum control. For general $N$-level closed and open quantum systems, we derive the corresponding adjoint systems and gradients of the objective functionals, and provide the projection versions of the Pontryagin maximum principle and the GPM, all directly in terms of quantum objects such as evolution operator, Hamiltonians, density matrices, etc. Various forms of the GPM, including one- and two-step, are provided and compared. We formulate the GPM both for closed and open quantum systems, latter for the general case with simultaneous coherent and incoherent controls. The GPM is designed to perform local gradient based optimization in the case when bounds are imposed on the controls. The main advantage of the method is that it allows to exactly satisfy the bounds, in difference to other approaches such as adding constraints as weight to objective. We apply the GPM to several examples including generation of one- and two-qubit gates and two-qubit Bell and Werner states for models of superconducting qubits under the constraint when controls are zero at the initial and final times, and steering an open quantum system state to a target density matrix for simulating action of the Werner-Holevo channel, etc.</p>

            <h2>Subsystem Thermalization Hypothesis in Quantum Spin Chains with Conserved Charges</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Feng-Li Lin, Jhh-Jing Hong, Ching-Yu Huang</p>
            <p>We consider the thermalization hypothesis of pure states in quantum Ising chain with $Z_2$ symmetry, XXZ chain with $U(1)$ symmetry, and XXX chain with $SU(2)$ symmetries. Two kinds of pure states are considered: the energy eigenstates and the typical states evolved unitarily from the random product states for a long enough period. We further group the typical states by their expectation values of the conserved charges and consider the fine-grained thermalization hypothesis. We compare the locally (subsystem) reduced states of typical states/eigenstates with the ones of the corresponding thermal ensemble states. Besides the usual thermal ensembles such as the (micro-)canonical ensemble without conserved charges and the generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE) with all conserved charges included, we also consider the so-called partial-GGEs (p-GGEs), which include only part of the conserved charges in the thermal ensemble. Moreover, in the framework of p-GGE, the Hamiltonian and other conserved charges are on an equal footing. The introduction of p-GGEs extends quantum thermalization to a more general scope. The validity of the subsystem thermalization hypothesis can be quantified by the smallness of the relative entropy of the reduced states obtained from the GGE/p-GGE and the typical states/eigenstates. We examine the validity of the thermalization hypothesis by numerically studying the relative entropy demographics. We show that the thermalization hypothesis holds generically for the small enough subsystems for various p-GGEs. Thus, our framework extends the universality of quantum thermalization.</p>

            <h2>Temporally localized quantum operations on continuous-wave thermal light</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yunkai Wang, Yujie Zhang, Virginia O. Lorenz</p>
            <p>Previous work showed that thermal light with a blackbody spectrum cannot be decomposed into a mixture of independent localized pulses. However, we find that in the weak-source limit and under the assumption of a flat spectrum, the first non-vacuum term in the state expansion does form a mixture of such pulses. This decomposition is essential for quantum-enhanced astronomical interferometry, which typically operates on localized pulses even though stellar light is inherently continuous-wave. We present a quantum derivation of the van Cittert-Zernike theorem that incorporates finite bandwidth, thereby justifying the operations on localized pulses while processing continuous-wave thermal light. For general spectra in the weak-source limit, we establish a criterion under which correlations between pulses can be safely neglected. When this criterion is not met, we provide a corrected strategy that accurately accounts for both the spectral profile and the detector-defined pulse shape.</p>

            <p>We revisit the Extended Uncertainty Principle (EUP) from an operational viewpoint, replacing wavefunction-based widths with apparatus-defined position constraints such as a finite slit of width $\Delta x$ or a geodesic ball of radius $R$. Using Hermitian momentum operators consistent with the EUP algebra, we prove a sharp lower bound on the product of momentum spread and preparation size in one dimension and show that it reduces smoothly to the standard quantum limit as the deformation vanishes. We then extend the construction to the dimensions two and three on spaces of constant curvature and obtain the corresponding bound for spherical confinement, clarifying its geometric meaning via an isometry to $S^2$ and $S^3$. The framework links curvature-scale effects to operational momentum floors and suggests concrete tests in diffraction, cold-atom, and optomechanical settings.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matteo Turco, Gon√ßalo M. Quinta, Jo√£o Seixas, Yasser Omar</p>
            <p>One of the most ambitious goals of quantum simulation of quantum field theory is the description of scattering in real time, which would allow not only for computation of scattering amplitudes, but also for studying the collision process step by step. The initial state of such simulation is made of typically two wave packets of stable particles moving on top of the vacuum, whose preparation is difficult. Here we extend a previous work to create wave packets of a general kind of particle from the vacuum in lattice gauge theories in various dimensions, including three-dimensional QCD for the first time. The conceptual foundation of this approach is the Haag-Ruelle scattering theory, and the only theoretical limitation is given by the presence of massless particles. In the context of digital quantum computation, the wave packet creation from the vacuum is implemented with the technique known as LCU (linear combination of unitaries). The preparation is performed successfully upon measuring an ancillary register with a certain probability, which vanishes polynomially in the lattice spacing, the wave-packet energy and the momentum narrowness.</p>

            <p>We reveal a feature of quantum scarring in systems with many particles: Quantum scars, living densely near an unstable periodic orbit, must be compensated by corresponding anti-scarred states suppressed there to establish the uniformity of the whole. The uniformity of the underlying phase space is linked to early-time dynamics -- a regime beyond the predictions of random matrix theory and encapsulated in the eigenstate stacking theorem. By extending the domain of the stacking theorem, we apply our theory to a chaotic spinor Bose-Einstein condensate, whose quantum scar dynamics have recently been observed in the laboratory. Our work uncovers how scarring of some eigenstates affects the rest of the chaotic and thermal spectrum in quantum systems with many particles.</p>

            <p>There has been tremendous progress in the physical realization of quantum computing hardware in recent times, bringing us closer than ever before to realizing the promise of quantum computing. However, noise continues to pose a crucial challenge when it comes to scaling up present day quantum processors. While decoherence limits the qubits ability to store information for long periods in the presence of uncontrollable noise sources, the erroneous implementation of control methods for state preparation and measurements leads to faulty implementations of quantum circuits. Conventional noise spectroscopy protocols can characterize and model environmental noise but are usually resource intensive and lengthy. Moreover, the underlying noise can vary in nature over time, making noise profile extraction futile as this new information cannot be harnessed to improve quantum error correction or dynamical decoupling protocols. In this work, we address this challenge using a machine learning-based methodology to quickly extract noise spectra of multiple qubits and demonstrate a possible noise mitigation strategy. The procedure involves implementing undemanding dynamical decoupling sequences to record coherence decays of the investigated qubits and then predict the underlying noise spectra with the help of a convolution neural network pre-trained on a synthetic dataset. While our protocol is virtually hardware-agnostic, we validate its effectiveness using superconducting qubits available on the IBM Quantum platform. We further use these rapidly obtained, yet accurate, noise spectra to design bespoke dynamic decoupling sequences and perform time-dependent noise spectroscopy.</p>

            <p>We propose a framework for simulating the real-time dynamics of quantum field theories (QFTs) using continuous-variable quantum computing (CVQC). Focusing on ($1+1$)-dimensional $\varphi^4$ scalar field theory, the approach employs the Hamiltonian formalism to map the theory onto a spatial lattice, with fields represented as quantum harmonic oscillators. Using measurement-based quantum computing, we implement non-Gaussian operations for CQVC platforms. The study introduces methods for preparing initial states with specific momenta and simulating their evolution under the $\varphi^4$ Hamiltonian. Key quantum objects, such as two-point correlation functions, validate the framework against analytical solutions. Scattering simulations further illustrate how mass and coupling strength influence field dynamics and energy redistribution. Thus, we demonstrate CVQC's scalability for larger lattice systems and its potential for simulating more complex field theories.</p>

            <p>Coupling excitons with quantized radiation has been shown to enable coherent ballistic transport at room temperature inside optical cavities. Previous theoretical works employ a simple description of the material, depicting it as a one-dimensional single layer placed in the middle of an optical cavity, thereby ignoring the spatial variation of the radiation field. In contrast, in most experiments, the optical cavity is filled with organic molecules or multiple layers of two-dimensional materials. Here, we develop an efficient mixed-quantum-classical approach, introducing a bright layer description, to simulate the exciton-polariton quantum dynamics in three dimensions. Our simulations reveal that, for the same Rabi splitting, a multilayered material extends the quantum coherence lifetime and enhances transport compared to a single-layer material. We find that this enhanced coherence can be traced to a synchronization of phonon fluctuations over multiple layers, wherein the collective light-matter coupling in a multilayered material effectively suppresses the phonon-induced dynamical disorder.</p>

            <p>Nonreciprocal entanglement, characterized by inherently robust operation, is a cornerstone for quantum information processing and communications. However, it remains a great challenge to achieve nonreciprocal entanglement characterized by stability and robustness against environmental fluctuations. Here, we propose a universal nonlinear mechanism to engineer magnetic-free nonreciprocity in dissipative optomechanics by utilizing bistability, a phenomenon ubiquitous across nonlinear physical systems. By dynamically encircling the nexus of bistability, a cusp converged by the bistable surfaces, we obtain nonreciprocal displacement and then utilize it to achieve robust nonreciprocal entanglement. Owing to the unique landscape of bistability, our nonreciprocal displacement and entanglements exhibit stability and robustness through closed-loop operations. Our work presents a foundational framework for leveraging nonlinearity to achieve nonreciprocal quantum information processing. It paves new avenues for exploring nonreciprocal quantum information processing and designing backaction-immune quantum metrology with nonlinearity.</p>

            <p>Preparing matrix product states (MPSs) on quantum computers is an essential routine in the simulation of many-body physics. However, widely-used schemes based on staircase circuits are often too deep to execute on current hardware. Here we demonstrate that MPSs with short-range correlations can be prepared with shallow circuits by leveraging heuristics from approximate quantum compiling (AQC). We achieve this with ADAPT-AQC, an adaptive-ansatz preparation algorithm, and introduce a generalised initialisation procedure for the existing AQC-Tensor algorithm. We first compare these methods for the task of preparing a molecular electronic structure ground state. We then use them to prepare an antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state of the 50-site Heisenberg XXZ spin chain near the AFM-XY phase boundary. Through the execution of circuits with up to 59 CZ depth and 1251 CZ gates, we perform a global quench and observe the relaxation of magnetic ordering in a parameter regime previously inaccessible due to deep ground state preparation circuits. Our results demonstrate how the integration of quantum and classical resources can push the boundary of what can be studied on quantum computers.</p>

            <p>High-dimensional broadband quantum memory significantly expands quantum information processing capabilities, but the memory efficiency becomes insufficient when extended to high dimensions. We demonstrate an efficient quantum memory for hyper-dimensional photons encoded with orbital angular momentum (OAM) and spin angular momentum (SAM). OAM information is encoded from -5 to +5, combined with SAM encoding, enabling up to 22 dimensions. To ensure high memory efficiency, an artificial intelligence algorithm, a modified Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm using Chebyshev sampling, is developed to obtain a perfect signal-control waveform matching. Memory efficiency is experimentally achieved at 92% for single-mode Gaussian signal, 91% for information dimension of 6 and 80% for dimensional number to 22. The fidelity is achieved up to 99% for single-mode Gaussian signal, 95.5% for OAM information, 97.4% for SAM information, and 92% for whole hyper-dimensional signal, which is far beyond no-cloning limitation. Our results demonstrate superior performance and potential applications in high-dimensional quantum information processing.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Senwei Liang, Linghua Zhu, Xiaosong Li, Chao Yang</p>
            <p>Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) offer a promising approach to solving computationally demanding problems by combining parameterized quantum circuits with classical optimization. Estimating probabilistic outcomes on quantum hardware requires repeated measurements (shots). However, in practice, the limited shot budget introduces significant noise in the evaluation of the objective function. Gradient estimation in VQAs often relies on the finite-difference, which evaluates the noisy objective function at perturbed circuit parameter values. The accuracy of this estimation is highly dependent on the choice of step size for these perturbations. An inappropriate step size can exacerbate the impact of noise, causing inaccurate gradient estimates and hindering the classical optimization in VQAs. This paper proposes QuGStep, an algorithm that addresses the challenge of determining the appropriate step size for finite-difference gradient estimation under a shot budget. QuGStep is grounded in a theorem that proves the optimal step size, which accounts for the shot budget, minimizes the error bound in gradient estimation using finite differences. Numerical experiments approximating the ground state energy of several molecules demonstrate that QuGStep can identify the appropriate step size for the given shot budget to obtain effective gradient estimation. Notably, the step size identified by QuGStep achieved convergence to the ground state energy with over 94% fewer shots compared to using a default step size (i.e., step size of 0.01). These findings highlight the potential of QuGStep to improve the practical deployment and scalability of quantum computing technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammad Ayyash, Sahel Ashhab</p>
            <p>The dispersive regime of $n$-photon qubit-oscillator interactions is analyzed using Schrieffer-Wolff perturbation theory. Effective Hamiltonians are derived up to the second order in the perturbation parameters. These effective descriptions reveal higher-order qubit-oscillator cross-Kerr and oscillator self-Kerr terms. The cross-Kerr term combines a qubit Pauli operator with an $n$-degree polynomial in the oscillator photon number operator, while the self-Kerr term is an $(n-1)$-degree polynomial in the oscillator photon number operator. In addition to the higher-order Kerr terms, a qubit-conditional $2n$-photon squeezing term appears in the effective non-rotating-wave-approximation Hamiltonian. Furthermore, perturbation theory is applied to the case of multiple qubits coupled to a shared oscillator. A photon-number-dependent qubit-qubit interaction emerges in this case, which can be leveraged to tune the effective multiqubit system parameters using the oscillator state. Results for the converse setup of multiple oscillators and a single qubit are also derived. In this case, a qubit-conditional oscillator-oscillator nonlinear interaction is found. The spectral instabilities plaguing multiphoton qubit-oscillator models are carefully treated by introducing stabilizing higher-order terms in the Hamiltonian. The stabilizing terms preserve low-photon subspaces, avoid negative infinite energies and facilitate reliable numerical calculations used to validate analytical predictions. The effective descriptions developed here offer a simple and intuitive physical picture of dispersive multiphoton qubit-oscillator interactions that can aid in the design of implementations harnessing their various nonlinear effects.</p>

            <p>Quantum computing has recently been emerging in theoretical chemistry as a realistic avenue meant to offer computational speedup to challenging eigenproblems in the context of strongly-correlated molecular systems or extended materials. Most studies so far have been devoted to the quantum treatment of electronic structure and only a few were directed to the quantum treatment of vibrational structure, which at the moment remains not devoid of unknowns. In particular, we address here a formal problem that arises when simulating a vibrational model under harmonic second quantization, whereby the disruption of the closure relation (resolution of the identity) -- which occurs when truncating the infinite bosonic basis set -- may have some serious effects as regards the correct evaluation of Hamiltonian matrix elements. This relates intimately to the normal ordering of products of ladder operators. In addition, we discuss the relevance of choosing an adequate primitive basis set within the present context with respect to its variational convergence properties. Such fundamental, yet consequential, aspects are illustrated numerically in the present work on a one-dimensional anharmonic Hamiltonian model corresponding to a double-well potential showing strong tunneling, of interest both for vibrational spectroscopy and chemical reactivity.</p>

            <p>High-resolution array detectors are widely used in single-particle tracking, but their performance is limited by excess noise from background light and dark current. As pixel resolution increases, the diminished signal per pixel exacerbates susceptibility to noise, degrading tracking accuracy. To overcome this limitation, we use spatial-mode demultiplexing (SPADE) as a noise-robust approach for estimating the motion characteristics of an optical point-like source. We show that SPADE efficiently concentrate the information into a few key spatial modes, drastically reducing the number of detectors while maintaining high estimation precision. Furthermore, we enhance the robustness of the estimation against excess noise by elaborately designing the modes to be decomposed. We demonstrate, both theoretically and experimentally, that a SPADE with two specific modes outperforms direct imaging in estimating the micro-oscillation frequency of an optical point source in the presence of excess noise.</p>

            <p>Quantum optical systems comprising quantum emitters interacting with engineered optical modes generate non-classical states of light that can be used as resource states for quantum-enhanced interferometry. However, outside of well-controlled systems producing either single-mode states (e.g. Fock states or squeezed states) or highly symmetric multi-mode states (e.g. superradiant states), their potential for quantum advantage remains uncharacterized. In this work, we develop a framework to analyze quantum enhanced interferometry with general Markovian quantum light sources. First, we show how to compute the quantum Fisher Information (QFI) of the photons emitted by a source efficiently by just tracking its internal dynamics and without explicitly computing the state of the emitted photons. We then use this relationship to elucidate the connection between the level structure and spectrum of the source to a potential quantum advantage in interferometry. Finally, we analyze optimal measurement protocols that can be used to achieve this quantum advantage with experimentally available optical elements. In particular, we show that tunable optical elements with Kerr non-linearity can always be harnessed to implement the optimal measurement for any given source. Simultaneously, we also outline general conditions under which linear optics and photodetection is enough to implement the optimal measurement.</p>

            <p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable outcomes in complex problems, including math, coding, and analyzing large amounts of scientific reports. Yet, few works have explored the potential of LLMs in quantum computing. The most challenging problem is to leverage LLMs to automatically generate quantum circuits at a large scale. Fundamentally, the existing pre-trained LLMs lack the knowledge of quantum circuits. In this paper, we address this challenge by fine-tuning LLMs and injecting the domain-specific knowledge of quantum computing. We describe Agent-Q, an LLM fine-tuning system to generate and optimize quantum circuits. In particular, Agent-Q implements the mechanisms to generate training data sets and constructs an end-to-end pipeline to fine-tune pre-trained LLMs to generate parameterized quantum circuits for various optimization problems. Agent-Q provides 14,000 quantum circuits covering a large spectrum of the quantum optimization landscape: 12 optimization problem instances and their optimized QAOA, VQE, and adaptive VQE circuits. Based thereon, Agent-Q fine-tunes LLMs and constructs syntactically correct parametrized quantum circuits in OpenQASM 3.0. We have evaluated the quality of the LLM-generated circuits and parameters by comparing them to the optimized expectation values and distributions. Experimental results show superior performance of Agent-Q, compared to several state-of-the-art LLMs and better parameters than random. Agent-Q can be integrated into an agentic workflow, and the generated parametrized circuits with initial parameters can be used as a starting point for further optimization, e.g., as templates in quantum machine learning and as benchmarks for compilers and hardware.</p>

            <p>The negatively charged boron vacancy (VB-) in h-BN is a spin-1 defect functioning as an optically addressable spin qubit in two-dimensional materials. A precise understanding of its spin decoherence is essential to advance it into a robust qubit platform. First-principles quantum many-body simulations are employed to investigate VB- decoherence in dense nuclear spin baths of h-BN under magnetic fields from 0.01 to 3 T, considering isotopic variants h-10B14N, h-11B14N, h-10B15N, and h-11B15N. A transition boundary (TB) is observed where the dominant decoherence mechanism changes: below the TB, sub-microsecond decoherence is governed by independent nuclear spin dynamics, whereas above it, pairwise flip-flops dominate, extending T2 to tens of microseconds. Analytical predictions place the TB at 0.502 T for h-10B14N and 0.205 T for h-11B14N. The larger TB in h-10BN results from the larger nuclear spin of 10B (I = 3), which produces stronger nuclear modulation over a wider field range. The analytical approach also explains the magnetic-field-insensitive fast modulation observed below the TB.

            <h2>Integrated Multi-Wavelength Photonic Architectures for Future Scalable Trapped Ion Quantum Devices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alto Osada, Koichiro Miyanishi</p>
            <p>Recent advances of quantum technologies rely on precise control and integration of quantum objects, and technological breakthrough is anticipated for further scaling up to realize practical applications. Trapped-ion quantum technology is a promising candidates to realize them, while its scalability depends on the development of intra-node scaling up, reproducibility of quantum nodes and photonic interconnection among them. Utilization of integrated photonics instead of free-space optics is a crucial step toward mass production of trapped-ion quantum nodes and manifests itself as useful for laser delivery for various quantum operations and photon detection. However, whole architecture of the scalable photonic circuits for them is left unexplored. In this work, we discuss photonic architectures for trapped-ion quantum devices, in which lasers of multiple wavelengths are delivered to multiple trapping zones within a single chip. We analyze two methods of configuring nanophotonic waveguides and compare them in terms of loss of total laser power. This work opens up a new landscape of photonic architecture for various applications not only to quantum ones such as trapped-ion devices but also to classical photonics, e.g. optoelectronic devices and biochemical sensing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pratibha Raghupati Hegde, Paolo Marcandelli, Yuanchun He, Luca Pennati, Jeremy J. Williams, Ivy Peng, Stefano Markidis</p>
            <p>We present a hybrid quantum-classical electrostatic Particle-in-Cell (PIC) method, where the electrostatic field Poisson solver is implemented on a quantum computer simulator using a hybrid classical-quantum Neural Network (HNN) using data-driven and physics-informed learning approaches. The HNN is trained on classical PIC simulation results and executed via a PennyLane quantum simulator. The remaining computational steps, including particle motion and field interpolation, are performed on a classical system. To evaluate the accuracy and computational cost of this hybrid approach, we test the hybrid quantum-classical electrostatic PIC against the two-stream instability, a standard benchmark in plasma physics. Our results show that the quantum Poisson solver achieves comparable accuracy to classical methods. It also provides insights into the feasibility of using quantum computing and HNNs for plasma simulations. We also discuss the computational overhead associated with current quantum computer simulators, showing the challenges and potential advantages of hybrid quantum-classical numerical methods.</p>

            <p>We explore the usefulness of mid-circuit measurements to enhance quantum algorithmics. Specifically, we assess how quantum phase estimation (QPE) and mid-circuit measurements can improve the performance of variational quantum algorithms. Our focus is on the single-qubit version of QPE namely, the Hadamard test applied to the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) ansatz. We demonstrate that a mid-circuit measurement acts as a low-energy filter when the desired outcome is obtained. When the other outcome is measured we heuristically rely on the mixer to repopulate the low energy states. Numerical simulations show that this method effectively amplifies the ground state. We validate our approach on real quantum hardware namely the IBM Quantum system one ibm_quebec.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rishabh Tripathi, Krishna K. Maurya, Rohan Singh</p>
            <p>V-type three-level systems, where two excited states share a common ground state, serve as fundamental models for exploring coherent light-matter interactions in a range of quantum systems, from atomic gases to semiconductor nanostructures. In this work, we investigate the coherent evolution of such a system under strong femtosecond-pulse excitation by numerically solving the optical Bloch equations. We demonstrate that the coherent evolution of a three-level system critically depends on the product of the excitation-pulse duration and energy separation between the excited states. Using this understanding, we extend our analysis to simulate two-dimensional coherent spectra in a high-intensity regime. We show that by varying the pulse areas of the excitation pulses, one can selectively turn individual spectral features, corresponding to distinct quantum pathways, on or off. Moreover, we can precisely adjust the phase of these peaks, illustrating an advanced level of coherent control within the system. Our approach provides a simple and robust framework for achieving advanced coherent control in multilevel systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Augustin Vanrietvelde, Octave Mestoudjian, Pablo Arrighi</p>
            <p>Decompositional theories describe the ways in which a global physical system can be split into subsystems, facilitating the study of how different possible partitions of a same system interplay, e.g. in terms of inclusions or signalling. In quantum theory, subsystems are usually framed as sub-C* algebras of the algebra of operators on the global system. However, most decompositional approaches have so far restricted their scope to the case of systems corresponding to factor algebras. We argue that this is a mistake: one should cater for the possibility for non-factor subsystems, arising for instance from symmetry considerations. Building on simple examples, we motivate and present a definition of partitions into an arbitrary number of parts, each of which is a possibly non-factor sub-C* algebra. We discuss its physical interpretation and study its properties, in particular with regards to the structure of algebras' centres. We prove that partitions, defined at the C*-algebraic level, can be represented in terms of a splitting of Hilbert spaces, using the framework of routed quantum circuits. For some partitions, however, such a representation necessarily retains a residual pseudo-nonlocality. We provide an example of this behaviour, given by the partition of a fermionic system into local modes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Meng-Zhi Wu, Marko Toro≈°, Sougato Bose, Anupam Mazumdar</p>
            <p>Matter-wave interferometry is highly susceptible to inertial acceleration noises arising from the vibration of the experimental apparatus. There are various methods for noise suppression. In this paper, we propose leveraging the cross-correlation of multi-directional vibration noises to mitigate their dephasing effect in matter-wave interferometers. Specifically, we analyse an interferometer driven by its internal state under an external field and examine the dephasing caused by a two-dimensional random inertial force. As we will demonstrate, the coupling between the two-dimensional inertial force noise components will shift the resonance peak but not change the shape of the power spectral density. Moreover, when the noise approximately resonates with the intrinsic frequency of the test mass, we find that the standard deviation of the phase can be suppressed by a factor roughly equal to the Q-factor of the noise. This technique holds significant potential for future gravity experiments utilising quantum sensors, such as measuring gravitational acceleration and exploring quantum entanglement induced by gravity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yigal Ilin, Uzi Pereg</p>
            <p>Quantum relays are central to both quantum communication and distributed quantum computing, enabling long-distance transmission and modular architectures. Unlike classical repeaters, quantum repeaters preserve coherence without amplifying quantum information, relying on entanglement swapping and quantum error correction to overcome loss and decoherence. In this work, we investigate the transmission of quantum information via quantum relay channels. Our three-terminal relay model captures the trade-off between repeater-assisted and repeaterless communication strategies. Specifically, we propose a partial decode-forward strategy, in which quantum ``message system" consists of two components. The first component is decoded by the relay and then sent to the destination receiver, whereas the second component is decoded by the destination receiver without the relay's help. We analyze both entanglement-assisted and unassisted scenarios. As a special case, the full decode-forward strategy is recovered, with the relay decoding, re-encoding, and forwarding the entire message. Our framework allows for different entanglement topologies between the transmitter, the relay and the destination receiver, recovering known results on entanglement-assisted and unassisted communication. Furthermore, we discuss the interpretation of coding with quantum side information. These findings provide a foundation for designing secure, efficient, and reliable quantum networks and for realizing practical quantum repeaters and long-range quantum key distribution.</p>

            <p>Four-component Schr√∂dinger cat (4C) states are important physical resources for fault-tolerant quantum computing. However, the generation of 4C states in solid-state platforms remains challenging due to stringent nonlinearity requirements. In this paper, a Floquet-engineering scheme is proposed for generating 4C states in a hybrid ferromagnet-superconductor system. Numerical simulations show that the high-fidelity 4C states can be generated even if the decoherence of the system is considered. These results provide a scalable route to multi-component cat-state engineering in solid-state platforms and open new avenues for quantum computation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ankit Gill, Keun-Young Kim, Kunal Pal, Kuntal Pal</p>
            <p>We consider the geometry of quantum states associated with different classes of random matrix Hamiltonians, in particular ensembles that show integrability to chaotic transition in terms of the nearest neighbour energy level spacing distribution. In the case that the total Hamiltonian contains a single parameter, the distance between two states is captured by the fidelity susceptibility, whereas, when the total Hamiltonian contains multiple parameters, this distance is given in terms of the quantum metric tensor. Since the fidelity susceptibility is closely related to the two-point correlation function, we first calculate the relevant correlation functions of a random matrix belonging to the Gaussian unitary ensemble in terms of the spectral form factor of the total Hamiltonian, show how to obtain the fidelity susceptibility from this correlation function, and explain the role played by energy level correlation. Next, by performing suitable coordinate transformations, we solve the geodesic equations corresponding to the quantum metric tensor obtained from an integrability-breaking random matrix Hamiltonian and obtain the geodesic distance between two points on the parameter manifold to show that any point far away from the integrable phase can be reached by a finite value of this distance. Finally, we obtain and discuss different properties of the fidelity susceptibility associated with Hamiltonians belonging to another random matrix ensemble which shows integrability to chaos transition, namely the Gaussian $\beta$-ensembles with general values of the Dyson index $\beta$, and show that the fidelity susceptibility shares generic features with the first class of Hamiltonians.</p>

We demonstrate positive asymptotic key rates at detector efficiencies as low as 81\%, bringing DI QKD within the reach of current superconducting detector technology. Our security analysis employs the Entropy Accumulation Theorem to establish rigorous finite-size bounds, achieving finite-key rates at a detector efficiency of 89\%. This work represents a critical milestone toward device-independent security in quantum communication networks, providing experimentalists with practical implementation pathways while maintaining the strongest possible security guarantees against quantum adversaries.</p>

            <h2>Proof of Hiding Conjecture in Gaussian Boson Sampling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Laura Shou, Sarah H. Miller, Victor Galitski</p>
            <p>Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) is a promising protocol for demonstrating quantum computational advantage. One of the key steps for proving classical hardness of GBS is the so-called ``hiding conjecture'', which asserts that one can ``hide'' a complex Gaussian matrix as a submatrix of the outer product of Haar unitary submatrices in total variation distance. In this paper, we prove the hiding conjecture for input states with the maximal number of squeezed states, which is a setup that has recently been realized experimentally [Madsen et al., Nature 606, 75 (2022)]. In this setting, the hiding conjecture states that a $o(\sqrt{M})\times o(\sqrt{M})$ submatrix of an $M\times M$ circular orthogonal ensemble (COE) random matrix can be well-approximated by a complex Gaussian matrix in total variation distance as $M\to\infty$. This is the first rigorous proof of the hiding property for GBS in the experimentally relevant regime, and puts the argument for hardness of classically simulating GBS with a maximal number of squeezed states on a comparable level to that of the conventional boson sampling of [Aaronson and Arkhipov, Theory Comput. 9, 143 (2013)].</p>

            <p>The Hubbard model is a challenging quantum many-body problem and serves as a benchmark for quantum computing research. Accurate computation of its ground and excited state energies is essential for understanding correlated electron systems. In this study, the ground, first, and second excited state energies of 4$\times$1 and 2$\times$2 Hubbard lattices are obtained using a newly designed ansatz circuit. The ansatz is constructed by combining concepts from the Hamiltonian Variational Ansatz (HVA) and the Number-Preserving Ansatz (NPA). A hybrid optimization strategy is applied, where COBYLA is used for coarse convergence and L-BFGS for fine-tuning. The resulting energies are evaluated, and the corresponding physical properties of the systems are analyzed through phase diagrams of the energy excitation gaps for different charge and spin configurations.</p>

            <p>Scattering experiments with energetic particles, such as free electrons, have been historically used to reveal the quantum structure of matter. However, realizing coherent interactions between free-electron beams and solid-state quantum systems has remained out of reach, owing to their intrinsically weak coupling. Realizing such coherent control would open up opportunities for hybrid quantum platforms combining free electrons and solid-state qubits for coincident quantum information processing and nanoscale sensing. Here, we present a framework that employs negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy centers (NV-) in diamond as quantum sensors of a bunched electron beam. We develop a Lindblad master equation description of the magnetic free-electron--qubit interactions and identify spin relaxometry as a sensitive probe of the interaction. Experimentally, we integrate a confocal fluorescence microscopy setup into a microwave-bunched electron beam line. We monitor charge-state dynamics and assess their impact on key sensing performance metrics (such as spin readout contrast), defining safe operating parameters for quantum sensing experiments. By performing $T_1$ relaxometry under controlled electron beam exposure, we establish an upper bound on the free-electron--spin coupling strength. Our results establish NV- centers as quantitative probes of free electrons, providing a metrological benchmark for free-electron--qubit coupling under realistic conditions, and chart a route toward solid-state quantum control with electron beams.</p>

Nanofabrication processes, including diamond etching, are essential to realize these structures but can introduce crystal strain through lattice damage. In this work, we investigate the impact of ion implantation and nanofabrication-induced strain on the electronic spin levels of NV$^-$ centers. We demonstrate that the zero-field continuous-wave optically detected magnetic resonance (CW-ODMR) spectrum serves as a sensitive probe of local crystal strain, providing both quantitative and directional information.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hayato Goto, Ryo Hidaka, Kosuke Tatsumura</p>
            <p>Nonlinear dynamical systems with continuous variables can be used for solving combinatorial optimization problems with discrete variables. In particular, numerical simulations of them can be used as heuristic algorithms with a desirable property, namely, parallelizability, which allows us to execute them in a massively parallel manner using cutting-edge many-core processors, leading to ultrafast performance. However, the dynamical-system approaches with continuous variables are usually less accurate than conventional approaches with discrete variables such as simulated annealing. To improve the solution accuracy of a representative dynamical system-based algorithm called simulated bifurcation (SB), which was found from classical simulation of a quantum nonlinear oscillator network exhibiting quantum bifurcation, here we generalize it by introducing nonlinear control of individual bifurcation parameters and show that the generalized SB (GSB) can achieve almost 100% success probabilities for some large-scale problems. As a result, the time to solution for a 2,000-variable problem is shortened to 10 ms by a GSB-based machine, which is two orders of magnitude shorter than the best known value, 1.3 s, previously obtained by an SB-based machine. To examine the reason for the ultrahigh performance, we investigated chaos in the GSB changing the nonlinear-control strength and found that the dramatic increase of success probabilities happens near the edge of chaos. That is, the GSB can find a solution with high probability by harnessing the edge of chaos. This finding suggests that dynamical-system approaches to combinatorial optimization will be enhanced by harnessing the edge of chaos, opening a broad possibility to tackle intractable combinatorial optimization problems by nature-inspired approaches.</p>

            <p>We study the charging dynamics of a quantum battery coupled to a structured reservoir composed of two qubits, each in thermal equilibrium with its own bosonic bath. The structured reservoir interacts with a charger battery model through three distinct configurations: (I) direct coupling between the reservoir qubits and the battery, (II) common coupling between the reservoir qubits, the charger, and the battery, and (III) common coupling between the reservoir qubits and the charger, together with a local charger battery interaction. For both incoherent and coherent initial states, we analyze the stored energy, ergotropy, and charging power of the battery, and establish upper and lower bounds on the maximum extractable work of the battery based on the free energy of coherence, and exchanged correlations between the subsystems. Our results show that the nature of the interaction scenario and the presence of coherence crucially determine the efficiency of charging and the maximum ergotropy. We demonstrate that correlation exchange between subsystems, quantified by the difference between global and local coherence, acts as a resource for work extraction. These findings provide a deeper understanding of coherence and population and structured environments as resources for autonomous quantum batteries, and offer experimentally accessible predictions within the regime of superconducting qubits.</p>

The integration is performed over binary phase patterns encoded via a phase-only spatial light modulator, with polarization serving as an auxiliary degree of freedom. Our findings reveal a distinct contrast in how spatial correlations affect image analysis: spatially uncorrelated photons are more effective at capturing the global features of an image encoded in the modulator, whereas spatially correlated photons exhibit enhanced sensitivity to local image details. Importantly, the optical integration scheme presented here bears a strong conceptual and operational resemblance to the DQC1 (Deterministic Quantum Computation with One Qubit) model.

            <p>Current prevailing designs of quantum random number generators (QRNGs) designs typically employ post-processing techniques to distill raw random data, followed by statistical verification with suites like NIST SP 800-22. This paper demonstrates that this widely adopted practice harbors a critical flaw. We show that the powerful extraction process can create a false sense of security by perfectly concealing physical-layer attacks, rendering the subsequent statistical tests blind to a compromised entropy source. We substantiate this claim across two major QRNG architectures. Experimentally, we severely compromise an QRNG based on amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) with a power supply ripple attack. While the resulting raw data catastrophically fails NIST tests, a standard Toeplitz extraction transforms it into a final sequence that passes flawlessly. This outcome highlights a profound danger: since the validation process is insensitive to the quality of the raw data, it implies that even a fully predictable input could be processed to produce a certified, yet completely insecure, random sequence. Our theoretical analysis confirms this vulnerability extends to phase-noise-based QRNGs, suggesting a need for security validation to evolve beyond statistical analysis of the final output and consider the entire generation process.</p>

The second, a probabilistic* constraining law, impose relative frequency and randomness constraints that every physically possible world must satisfy. The constraining notion removes a major obstacle to a unified governing account of non-Humean laws, on which laws govern by constraining physical possibilities; it also provides independently motivated solutions to familiar problems for the Humean best-system account (the Big Bad Bug and the zero-fit problem). On either approach, probabilistic laws are tied more tightly to corresponding sets of possible worlds: some histories permitted by traditional probabilistic laws are now ruled out as physically impossible. Consequently, the framework avoids one variety of empirical underdetermination while bringing to light others that are typically overlooked.</p>

            <p>In high-energy particle collisions, charged track finding is a complex yet crucial endeavour. We propose a quantum algorithm, specifically quantum template matching, to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of track finding. Abstracting the Quantum Amplitude Amplification routine by introducing a data register, and utilising a novel oracle construction, allows data to be parsed to the circuit and matched with a hit-pattern template, without prior knowledge of the input data. Furthermore, we address the challenges posed by missing hit data, demonstrating the ability of the quantum template matching algorithm to successfully identify charged-particle tracks from hit patterns with missing hits. Our findings therefore propose quantum methodologies tailored for real-world applications and underline the potential of quantum computing in collider physics.</p>

            <h2>Deep Tensor Network</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yifan Zhang</p>
            <p>The quadratic complexity of dot-product attention introduced in Transformer remains a fundamental bottleneck impeding the progress of foundation models toward unbounded context lengths. Addressing this challenge, we introduce the Deep Tensor Network, a new architectural framework that fundamentally reformulates attention by unifying the expressive power of tensor algebra with neural network design. Our approach moves beyond both conventional dot-product attention and subsequent linear-time approximations to capture higher-order statistical dependencies. We introduce two core operators derived from this framework: \emph{Tensor Attention}, which models complex token-mixing via data-dependent polynomial kernels, and Tensor Interaction, a novel mechanism for adaptive channel-mixing. We demonstrate that these operators are powered by second-order summaries that entirely bypass the formation of $n \times n$ matrices, enabling a causality-preserving streaming implementation with $O(d^2)$ per-token updates and $O(d^2)$ state. This efficiency rivals that of modern State Space Models while retaining an attention-like formulation. The Deep Tensor Network thus provides a principled and powerful new class of building blocks for next-generation sequence models, bridging the gap between scalable computation and rich, expressive interaction modeling.</p>

We also argue for the potential applications of non-semisimple TQFTs toward topological quantum computation.</p>

            <h2>Probing $CP$ violation and mass ordering in neutrino oscillations in matter through quantum speed limits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Subhadip Bouri, Abhishek Kumar Jha, Subhashish Banerjee</p>
            <p>The quantum speed limits (QSLs) set fundamental lower bounds on the time required for a quantum system to evolve from a given initial state to a final state. In this work, we investigate $CP$ violation and the mass ordering problem of neutrino oscillations in matter using the QSL time as a key analytical tool. We examine the QSL time for the unitary evolution of two- and three-flavor neutrino states, both in vacuum and in the presence of matter. Two-flavor neutrino oscillations are used as a precursor to their three-flavor counterparts. We further compute the QSL time for neutrino state evolution and entanglement in terms of neutrino survival and oscillation probabilities, which are experimentally measurable quantities in neutrino experiments. A difference in the QSL time between the normal and inverted mass ordering scenarios, for neutrino state evolution as well as for entanglement, under the effect of a $CP$ violation phase is observed. Our results are illustrated using the length scales and energies of ongoing long-baseline accelerator neutrino experiments such as T2K, NOvA, and the upcoming DUNE experiment. Notably, three-flavor neutrino oscillations in constant matter density exhibit faster state evolution across all these neutrino experiments in the normal mass ordering scenario. Additionally, we observe fast entanglement suppression in DUNE assuming a normal mass ordering.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Hamilton-Jacobi Theory, Spectral Path Integrals and Exact-WKB Analysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mustafa T√ºre, Mithat √únsal</p>
            <p>We propose a new way to perform path integrals in quantum mechanics by using a quantum version of Hamilton-Jacobi theory. In classical mechanics, Hamilton-Jacobi theory is a powerful formalism, however, its utility is not explored in quantum theory beyond approximation schemes. The canonical transformation enables one to set the new Hamiltonian to constant or zero, but keeps the information about solution in Hamilton's characteristic function. To benefit from this in quantum theory, one must work with a formulation in which classical Hamiltonian is used. This uniquely points to phase space path integral. However, the main variable in HJ-formalism is energy, not time. Thus, we are led to consider Fourier transform of path integral, spectral path integral, $\tilde Z(E)$. The evaluation of path integral reduces to determining the quantum Hamilton's characteristic functions (which can be achieved via an asymptotic analysis), and a discrete sum over the quantum period lattice, generalizing Gutzwiller's sum.</p>

Finally, we derive the modular Hamiltonian directly, without using the modular flow, via the continuous limit of the expressions obtained in the discretized theory. In a specific coordinate system, the modular Hamiltonian assumes the form of a free field Hamiltonian on the Rindler wedge.</p>

            <p>The entanglement entropy of a massless scalar field in de Sitter space depends on multiple scales, such as the radius of the entangling surface, the Hubble constant and the UV cutoff. We perform a high-precision numerical calculation using a lattice model in order to determine the dependence on these scales in the Bunch-Davies vacuum. We derive the leading de Sitter corrections to the flat-space entanglement entropy for subhorizon entangling radii. We analyze the structure of the finite-size effects and we show that the contribution to the entanglement entropy of the sector of the theory with vanishing angular momentum depends logarithmically on the size of the overall system, which extends beyond the horizon.</p>

            <h2>Krylov complexity of purification</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rathindra Nath Das, Takato Mori</p>
            <p>In quantum systems, purification can map mixed states into pure states and a non-unitary evolution into a unitary one by enlarging the Hilbert space. We establish a connection between the complexities of mixed quantum states and their purification, proposing new inequalities among these complexities. By examining single qubits, two-qubit Werner states, 8-dimensional Gaussian random unitary ensemble, and infinite-dimensional systems, we demonstrate how these relationships manifest across a broad class of systems. We find that the spread complexity of purification of a vacuum state evolving into a thermal state equals the average number of Rindler particles. This complexity is also shown to adhere to the Lloyd-like bound, indicating a further relation to the quantum speed limit. Finally, using mutual Krylov complexity, we observe subadditivity of the Krylov complexities, which contrasts with known results from holographic volume complexity. We put forward Krylov mutual complexity as a diagnosis of a potential gravity dual of Krylov complexities.</p>

            <p>Time-division multiplexing of cryogenic signals is a promising approach to reduce space requirements, shorten cooldown times, and increase the number of quantum devices measured per cooldown. We demonstrate time-division multiplexing of non-dissipative supercurrents using voltage-controlled hybrid superconducting demultiplexers. These chips integrate superconducting Josephson Field Effect Transistors including Al superconducting electrodes, proximitized semiconducting InAs channels, and hafnium oxide gate insulators. Each transistor fully suppresses the switching current and increases the resistance 20 times under a gate voltage of -4.5 V. A demultiplexer with one input and eight outputs showed a non-dissipative input range of +-2 uA, operating up to 100 MHz in signal frequency and 100 kHz in switching frequency at 50 mK. It achieved near-zero insertion loss in the superconducting state and an ON/OFF ratio of 17.5 dB. By optimizing the signal layout, the operation was extended up to 4 GHz using a demultiplexer with two outputs.</p>

            <h2>Post-measurement Quantum Monte Carlo</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kriti Baweja, David J. Luitz, Samuel J. Garratt</p>
            <p>We show how the effects of large numbers of measurements on many-body quantum ground and thermal states can be studied using Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC). Density matrices generated by measurement in this setting feature products of many local nonunitary operators, and by expanding these density matrices as sums over operator strings we arrive at a generalized stochastic series expansion (SSE). Our 'post-measurement SSE' is based on importance sampling of operator strings contributing to a measured thermal density matrix. We demonstrate our algorithm by probing the effects of measurements on the spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the square lattice. Thermal states of this system have SU(2) symmetry, and at first we preserve this symmetry by measuring SU(2) symmetric observables. We identify classes of post-measurement states for which correlations can be calculated efficiently, as well as states for which SU(2) symmetric measurements generate a QMC sign problem when working in any site-local basis. For the first class, we show how deterministic loop updates can be leveraged. Using our algorithm we demonstrate the creation of long-range Bell pairs and symmetry-protected topological order, as well as the measurement-induced enhancement of antiferromagnetic correlations. We then study the effects of measuring the system in a basis where the standard (unmeasured) SSE is sign-free: For measurement schemes with this property, we can calculate correlations in all post-measurement states without a sign problem. The method developed in this work opens the door to scalable experimental probes of measurement-induced collective phenomena, which require numerical estimates for the effects of measurements.</p>

            <h2>Strong photon coupling to high-frequency antiferromagnetic magnons via topological surface states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Henrik T. Kaarb√∏, Henning G. Hugdal, Sol H. Jacobsen</p>
            <p>We show strong coupling between antiferromagnetic magnons and microwave cavity photons at both high and externally controllable magnon frequencies. Using the fully quantum mechanical path-integral method, we study an antiferromagnetic insulator (AFM) interfaced with a topological insulator (TI), taking Bi$_2$Se$_3$--MnSe as a representative example. We show that the mutual coupling of the spin-polarized surface states of the TI to both the squeezed magnons and the circularly polarized cavity photons results in a Chern-Simons term that activates the stronger electric, rather than magnetic, dipole coupling. Moreover, a squeezing-mediated enhancement of the coupling is achieved due to the unequal interfacial exchange coupling to the AFM sublattices, resulting in a coupling strength up to several orders stronger than for direct magnon-photon coupling. While direct cavity-AFM coupling has so far been limited in its applicability due to weak or low frequency coupling, this result may advance the utilization of high-frequency cavity magnonics and enable its incorporation into quantum information technology.</p>

            <p>Quantum computing is a rapidly advancing field with the potential to drive scientific, educational, and technological development. However, it faces a significant shortage of qualified experts, creating an urgent demand for skilled professionals. In Latin America, quantum education remains in its early stages, further widening the regional talent and access gap due to limited educational infrastructure and financial constraints. This work presents an initiative to integrate quantum computing into higher education in Latin America through the application of the European Competence Framework for Quantum Technologies, which offers a standardized approach to defining competency requirements and assessing essential skills in the field. We propose introductory courses aligned with the frameworks guidelines, designed to meet industry standards and reach a broad audience. Additionally, we introduce supplementary resources, including team dynamics and evaluation methodologies, to enhance the educational ecosystem. These initiatives aim to create a sustainable and comprehensive quantum education model across Latin America, to close the regional skills gap, foster inclusivity, and prepare a diverse workforce to contribute innovative solutions on the global stage.</p>

            <h2>A Practical Quantum Hoare Logic with Classical Variables, I</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mingsheng Ying</p>
            <p>In this paper, we present a Hoare-style logic for reasoning about quantum programs with classical variables. Our approach offers several improvements over previous work: (1) Enhanced expressivity of the programming language: Our logic applies to quantum programs with classical variables that incorporate quantum arrays and parameterised quantum gates, which have not been addressed in previous research on quantum Hoare logic, either with or without classical variables. (2) Intuitive correctness specifications: In our logic, preconditions and postconditions for quantum programs with classical variables are specified as a pair consisting of a classical first-order logical formula and a quantum predicate formula (possibly parameterised by classical variables). These specifications offer greater clarity and align more closely with the programmer's intuitive understanding of quantum and classical interactions. (3) Simplified proof system: By introducing a novel idea in formulating a proof rule for reasoning about quantum measurements, along with (2), we develop a proof system for quantum programs that requires only minimal modifications to classical Hoare logic. Furthermore, this proof system can be effectively and conveniently combined with classical first-order logic to verify quantum programs with classical variables. As a result, the learning curve for quantum program verification techniques is significantly reduced for those already familiar with classical program verification techniques, and existing tools for verifying classical programs can be more easily adapted for quantum program verification.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luca Marchetti, Edward Wilson-Ewing</p>
            <p>We construct relational observables in group field theory (GFT) in terms of covariant positive operator-valued measures (POVMs), using techniques developed in the context of quantum reference frames. We focus on matter quantum reference frames; this can be generalized to other types of frames within the same POVM-based framework. The resulting family of relational observables provides a covariant framework to extract localized observables from GFT, which is typically defined in a perspective-neutral way. Then, we compare this formalism with previous proposals for relational observables in GFT. We find that our quantum reference frame-based relational observables overcome the intrinsic limitations of previous proposals while reproducing the same continuum limit results concerning expectation values of the number and volume operators on coherent states. Nonetheless, there can be important differences for more complex operators, as well as for other types of GFT states. Finally, we also use a specific class of POVMs to show how to project states and operators from the more general perspective-neutral GFT Fock space to a perspective-dependent one where a scalar matter field plays the role of a relational clock.</p>

            <p>Dispersive readout of superconducting qubits is often limited by readout-drive-induced transitions between qubit levels. While there is a growing understanding of such effects in transmon qubits, the case of highly nonlinear fluxonium qubits is more complex. We theoretically analyze measurement-induced state transitions (MIST) during the dispersive readout of a fluxonium qubit. We focus on a new mechanism: a simultaneous transition/excitation involving the qubit and an internal mode of the Josephson junction array in the fluxonium circuit. Using an adiabatic Floquet approach, we show that these new kinds of MIST processes can be relevant when using realistic circuit parameters and relatively low readout drive powers. They also contribute to excess qubit dephasing even after a measurement is complete. In addition to outlining basic mechanisms, we also investigate the dependence of such transitions on the circuit parameters. We find that with a judicious choice of frequency allocations or coupling strengths, these parasitic processes can most likely be avoided.</p>

            <p>The demand for artificially generated data for the development, training and testing of new algorithms is omnipresent. Quantum computing (QC), does offer the hope that its inherent probabilistic functionality can be utilised in this field of generative artificial intelligence. In this study, we use quantum-classical hybrid generative adversarial networks (QuGANs) to artificially generate graphs of shipping routes. We create a training dataset based on real shipping data and investigate to what extent QuGANs are able to learn and reproduce inherent distributions and geometric features of this data. We compare hybrid QuGANs with classical Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), with a special focus on their parameter efficiency. Our results indicate that QuGANs are indeed able to quickly learn and represent underlying geometric properties and distributions, although they seem to have difficulties in introducing variance into the sampled data. Compared to classical GANs of greater size, measured in the number of parameters used, some QuGANs show similar result quality. Our reference to concrete use cases, such as the generation of shipping data, provides an illustrative example and demonstrate the potential and diversity in which QC can be used.</p>

            <p>We consider a spinning primordial black hole (PBH) described by the Kerr metric in Kerr-Schild polar coordinates. We derive an analytical expression for the four-vector gravitational potential in the underlying Hermitian Dirac Hamiltonian using these coordinates. This gravitational potential introduces an axial vector term in the Dirac equation in curved spacetime. We find that the magnitudes of the temporal and spatial components of the four-vector gravitational potential are significantly affected by the angle of the position vector of the spinor with respect to the spin axis of the PBH, its radial distance from the PBH, and the strength of the specific angular momentum of the PBH. These potentials modify the effective mass matrix of the neutrino-antineutrino system and significantly affect the transition probabilities during the flavor oscillation of the neutrino-antineutrino system. We then use the transition probability to investigate the quantum speed limit time bound ratio for the two-flavor oscillation of the neutrino-antineutrino system in curved spacetime. This helps us estimate how quickly the initial neutrino flavor state evolves over time under the influence of the gravitational field. Finally, we discuss quantum correlations such as entanglement entropy during the two-flavor oscillation of the neutrino-antineutrino system near a spinning PBH.</p>

We investigate the conditions under which a projected wave function constructed from fermionic partons can be rigorously shown to possess topological order.

We then use matrix product states to study states that interpolate between two distinct Majorana fermion codes, one yielding a $\mathbb Z_2$ spin liquid and the other a trivial polarized state upon projection. While the free-fermion states are adiabatically connected, we find that the projected states undergo a phase transition detected by the topological entanglement entropy. Our work underscores the profound impact of the Gutzwiller projection and cautions against inferring properties of quantum spin liquids solely from their unprojected counterparts.</p>

            <p>We report on the trapping and imaging of individual ytterbium atoms in arrays of optical tweezers, loaded from a magneto-optical trap (MOT) formed by only five beams in an orthogonal configuration. In our five-beam MOT, operating on the narrow ${}^1$S${}_0 \rightarrow {}^3$P${}_1$ intercombination transition, gravity balances the radiation pressure of a single upward-directed beam. This approach enables efficient trapping and cooling of the most common ytterbium isotopes (${}^{171}$Yb, ${}^{173}$Yb and ${}^{174}$Yb) to $\lesssim 20\,\mu$K at densities $\sim 10^{11}$ atoms/cm$^3$ within less than one second. This configuration allows for significantly reducing the complexity of the optical setup, potentially benefiting any ytterbium-atom based quantum science platform leveraging single-atom microscopy, from quantum processors to novel optical clocks. We then demonstrate the first single-atom-resolved imaging of the fermionic, large-spin isotope ${}^{173}$Yb ($I=5/2$), employing a two-color imaging scheme that does not rely on magic-wavelength trapping. We achieve a high single-atom detection fidelity of $99.96(1)\%$ and a large survival probability of $98.5(2)\%$, despite large differential light shifts affecting all nuclear spin sublevels of the excited ${}^3$P${}_1$ state involved in the cooling transition.

            <p>If axion simultaneously has the scalar couplings to the nucleons and pseudo-scalar couplings to the electrons, it may mediate a $\mathcal{P}$, $\mathcal{T}$-violating interaction between the electronic shell and nuclei in the molecules. The polyatomic molecule RaOH, which is considered as a promising platform for the $\mathcal{P}$, $\mathcal{T}$ violation searches, is studied for its sensitivity to such interactions. Due to the long-range nature (on molecular scales) of the axion-mediated interaction, it is important whether the enhancement parameter would be sensitive to the vibration of the molecule. Our results imply that the impact of the vibrations on the axion-mediated electron-nucleon interaction in the molecule is similar to the impact on the short-range electron-nucleon scalar-pseudoscalar interaction studied earlier.</p>

            <p>M√∂bius topological insulators have dispersive edge bands with M√∂bius twists in momentum space, which are protected by the combination of chiral and $Z_2$-projective translational symmetries. In this work, we reveal a unique type of M√∂bius topological insulator, whose edge bands could twist around the quasienergy $\pi$ of a periodically driven system and are thus of Floquet origin. By applying time-periodic quenches to an experimentally realized M√∂bius insulator model, we obtain interconnected M√∂bius edge bands around zero and $\pi$ quasienergies, which can coexist with a gapped or gapless bulk. These M√∂bius bands are topologically characterized by a pair of generalized winding numbers, which are integer-quantized due to an emergent chiral symmetry at a high-symmetry point in momentum space. Numerical investigations of the quasienergy and entanglement spectra provide consistent evidence for the presence of such M√∂bius topological phases. A protocol based on the adiabatic switching of edge-band populations is further introduced to dynamically characterize the topology of Floquet M√∂bius edge bands. Our findings thus extend the scope of M√∂bius topological phases to nonequilibrium settings and unveil a unique class of M√∂bius-twisted topological edge states without static counterparts.</p>

            <p>We study SU($N$) spin systems that mimic the behavior of particles in $N$-dimensional de Sitter space for $N=2,3$. Their Hamiltonians describe a dynamical system with hyperbolic fixed points, leading to emergent quasinormal modes at the quantum level. These manifest as quasiparticle peaks in the density of states. For a particle in 2-dimensional de Sitter, we find both principal and complementary series densities of states from a PT-symmetric version of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, having two hyperbolic fixed points in the classical phase space. We then study different spectral and dynamical properties of this class of models, including level spacing statistics, two-point functions, squared commutators, spectral form factor, Krylov operator and state complexity. We find that, even though the early-time properties of these quantities are governed by the saddle points -- thereby in some cases mimicking corresponding properties of chaotic systems, a close look at the late-time behavior reveals the integrable nature of the system.</p>

            <h2>Symmetry Sectors in Chord Space and Relational Holography in the DSSYK</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sergio E. Aguilar-Gutierrez</p>
            <p>In holography, gauging symmetries of the boundary theory leads to important modifications in the bulk. In this work, we study constraints to gauge symmetry sectors in the chord Hilbert space of the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) with matter, and we connect them to different proposals of its bulk dual. These sectors include chord parity symmetry, corresponding to End-Of-The-World (ETW) branes and Euclidean wormholes in sine dilaton gravity; and relative time-translations in a doubled DSSYK model (resulting from a single DSSYK with an infinitely heavy matter chord) used in de Sitter holography. We define and evaluate partition functions and thermal correlation functions of the ETW brane and Euclidean wormhole systems in the boundary theory. We deduce the holographic dictionary by matching geodesic lengths in the bulk with the spread complexity of the parity-gauged DSSYK. The Euclidean wormholes of fixed size are perturbatively stable, and their baby universe Hilbert space is non-trivial only when matter is added. We conclude studying the constraints in the path integral of the doubled DSSYK. We derive the gauge invariant operator algebra of one of the DSSYKs dressed to the other one and discuss its holographic interpretation.</p>

These tools offer an efficient means to study entanglement generation and particle production, particularly when analytical methods become insufficient and numerical simulations are essential. By evolving an initial Bunch-Davies vacuum through a two-mode squeezer, we simulate the behavior of the von Neumann entropy and logarithmic negativity across a wide range of cosmological backgrounds, each characterized by a distinct equation of state. The von Neumann entropy obtained via QuGIT simulations is compared with analytic R√©nyi entropy bounds, thereby validating the accuracy of our circuit implementation of the cosmological squeezing Hamiltonian in both accelerating and decelerating scenarios. We further investigate the role of thermal noise and demonstrate how the von Neumann entropy and logarithmic negativity are affected by its presence.</p>

            <p>The selection of a balanced active space is a critical step in multi-reference quantum chemistry calculations, particularly for systems with strong electron correlation. Likewise, active space selection is a key to unlock the potential of contemporary quantum computing in quantum chemistry. Albeit recent progress, there remains a lack of a unified, robust, and fully automated framework for active space selection that performs reliably across a wide range of molecular systems. In this work, we present a novel approach inspired by both the AVAS (Atomic Valence Active Space) and AutoCAS methods. Our method unifies orbital entropy analysis with atomic orbital projections to guide the construction of chemically and physically meaningful active spaces. This integrated scheme enables a more consistent and flexible selection of active orbitals while retaining automation and scalability. We validate our approach on a set of molecular systems relevant to photodynamic therapy, in particular a set of Ru(II)-complexes, selected to span increasing levels of electron correlation and structural complexity. These molecules serve as challenging test cases due to the presence of strong static correlation and the need for highly accurate electronic structure descriptions. Our results demonstrate that the method can reliably identify compact, chemically intuitive active spaces that capture the essential physics, making it suitable for both classical and quantum computational frameworks. Furthermore, we have developed this approach in a package that is intuitive to use for users and can be interfaced with both standard quantum chemistry and quantum computing applications, making it accessible to a broad research community.</p>

            <h2>Extracting Membrane-like hexagonal Boron Nitride hosting single Defect Centers for Resonator Integration</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Patrick Maier, Alexander Kubanek</p>
            <p>The integration of membranes into optical resonators plays a key role in a variety of applications, including optomechanics. If such membranes host atom-like systems, ideally with access to spin states, new roads in quantum photonics and also in optomechanics can be taken. Layered, two-dimensional materials have emerged as candidates for membranes hosting atom-like quantum emitters. Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is among the most promising two-dimensional platforms showing good mechanical properties combined with the ability to host various kinds of optical active (spin-) defects. However, the determinisitc creation of optically active defect centers in hBN membranes is an outstanding challenge. Commercially available flakes of hBN host defect centers with promising optical properties, but the integration into optical resonators suffers from scattering losses due to the flakes topography and suitable transfer, handling and manipulation techniques need to be established. Here, we develope a toolset of nano-scaled manipulation techniques to extract membrane-like structures of commercially-available hBN containing spectrally narrow single photon emitters. We demonstrate the transfer and integration into photonic devices, by coupling a single photon emitter in membran-like hBN to the mode of an open Fabry-Perot fiber cavity (FPFC) and observe cavity induced spectral enhancement by a factor of up to 100 at room temperature. Overcoming hBN-induced scattering for extracted hBN membranes, which host single photon emitters, paves the way for future applications such as its use as an optomechanical system.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Merzuk Kaltak, Alexander Hampel, Martin Schlipf, Indukuru Ramesh Reddy, Bongjae Kim, Georg Kresse</p>
            <p>We present a new constrained Random Phase Approximation (cRPA) method, termed spectral cRPA (s-cRPA), and compare it to established cRPA approaches for Scandium and Copper by varying the 3d shell filling. The s-cRPA consistently yields larger Hubbard $U$ interaction values. Applied to the realistic system CaFeO$_3$, s-cRPA produces interaction parameters significantly closer to those required within DFT+$U$ to induce the experimentally observed insulating state, overcoming the metallic behavior predicted by standard density functionals. We also address the issue of negative interaction values found in the projector cRPA method for filled d-shells, demonstrating that s-cRPA offers superior numerical stability through electron conversion. Overall, s-cRPA is more robust and effectively overcomes the known underestimation of $U$ in standard cRPA, making it a promising tool for the community. Additionally, we have enhanced our implementation with features for computing multi-center interactions to analyze spatial decay and developed a low-scaling variant with a compressed Matsubara grid to efficiently obtain full frequency-dependent interactions.</p>

            <p>Hybrid systems composed of a single nitrogen-vacancy center spin magnetically coupled to a macroscopic mechanical resonator constitute promising platforms for the realization of quantum information protocols and for quantum sensing applications. The magnetic structure that mediates the interaction must ensure high field gradients while preserving the spin and mechanical properties. We present a spin-mechanical setup built around a cobalt nanomagnet grown with focused electron beam-induced deposition. The magnetic structure is fully characterized, and a maximum gradient of $170\,\mathrm{kT/m}$ is directly measured at a spin-oscillator distance of a few hundred nanometers. Spin coherence was preserved at the value of $20\,\mathrm{ \mu s}$ up to a gradient of $25\,\mathrm{kT/m}$. The effect of the mechanical motion onto the spin dynamics was observed, thus signifying the presence of spin-mechanics coupling. Given the noninvasive nature of the nanomagnet deposition process, we foresee the adoption of such structures in hybrid platforms with high-quality factor resonators, in the "magnet on oscillator" configuration.</p>

            <h2>Correlated decoherence and thermometry with mobile impurities in a 1D Fermi gas</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sindre Brattegard, Thom√°s Fogarty, Thomas Busch, Mark T. Mitchison</p>
            <p>We theoretically investigate the correlated decoherence dynamics of two mobile impurities trapped within a gas of ultracold fermionic atoms. We use a mean-field approximation to self-consistently describe the effect of impurity-gas collisions on impurity motion, while decoherence of the impurities' internal state is computed exactly within a functional determinant approach. At equilibrium, we find that the impurities undergo bath-induced localisation as the impurity-gas interaction strength is increased. We then study the non-equilibrium dynamics induced by a sudden change of the impurities' internal state, which can be experimentally probed by Ramsey interferometry. Our theoretical approach allows us to investigate the effect of impurity motion on decoherence dynamics, finding strong deviations from the universal behaviour associated with Anderson's orthogonality catastrophe when the mass imbalance between impurity and gas atoms is small. Finally, we show that mobile impurities can be used as thermometers of their environment and that bath-mediated correlations can be beneficial for thermometric performance at low temperatures, even in the presence of non-trivial impurity motion. Our results showcase the interesting open quantum dynamics of mobile impurities dephasing in a common environment, and could help provide more precise temperature estimates of ultracold fermionic mixtures.</p>

As a result, while spatially uncorrelated photons can capture the global properties of an image displayed in a spatial light modulator, correlated photons capture the local properties of the image better.

            <p>Detailed understanding of physical measurements is essential for devising efficient metrological strategies and measurement-feedback schemes, as well as finding fundamental limitations on measurement sensitivity. In the quantum regime, measurements modify the state of the system of interest through measurement backaction as a direct consequence of the Heisenberg principle. In cavity optomechanics and electromechanics, a plethora of strategies exist for measuring the mechanical motion using electromagnetic fields, each leading to different competition between measurement imprecision and backaction. While this range of techniques allows broad applications of optomechanical and electromechanical devices, it makes direct comparison of different measurement methods difficult. We develop a formalism for quantifying the performance of optomechanical measurements using a few relevant figures of merit. Our approach is inspired by similar characterizations in quantum optics and quantifies the main properties of quantum measurements -- the ability to distinguish different quantum states and preservation of signal in the presence of measurement noise. We demonstrate our concept on the most common optomechanical measurements -- displacement detection, coherent quantum noise cancellation, and quantum nondemolition measurements -- and perform detailed analysis of errors in optomechanical nondemolition measurements. This newly acquired knowledge allows us to propose a strategy for quantum nondemolition measurements in levitodynamics using coherent scattering. Our results complement existing knowledge of linear optomechanical interactions and open the way to new understanding of optomechanical measurements, thus allowing also novel applications of optomechanical devices in fundamental physics and quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>Future optical quantum technologies, such as quantum networks, distributed quantum computing and sensing, demand efficient, broadband quantum memories. However, achieving high efficiency without introducing noise, reducing bandwidth, or limiting scalability remains a challenge. Here, we present a new approach to enhance quantum memory protocols by leveraging constructive light-matter interference, leading to an increase in memory efficiency without increasing atomic density or laser intensity. We implement this method in a Raman quantum memory in warm Cesium vapor, and achieve more than a three-fold improvement in total efficiency reaching $(34.3\pm8.4)\%$, while retaining GHz-bandwidth operation and low noise levels. Numerical simulations predict that this approach can boost efficiencies in systems limited by atomic density, such as cold atomic ensembles, from $65\%$ to beyond $96\%$, while in warm atomic vapors it could reduce the laser intensity needed to reach a given efficiency by over an order-of-magnitude, exceeding $95\%$ total efficiency. Furthermore, our method preserves the single-mode nature of the memory at high efficiencies. This new protocol is applicable to various memory architectures, paving the way toward scalable, efficient, low-noise, and high-bandwidth quantum memories.</p>

To estimate the separation between two spectral lines, we experimentally measure the mean squared error of the frequency estimate, achieving a sensitivity of 1/20 of the linewidth with a ($34\pm4$)-fold enhancement in precision over direct intensity measurements. This enhanced frequency resolution, combined with the memory's on-demand storage, retrieval, and mode conversion capabilities, paves the way for multifunctional memory-based time-frequency sensors and their integration within quantum networks.</p>

            <h2>Non-Markovian dynamics of giant emitters beyond the Weisskopf-Wigner approximation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Carlos A. Gonz√°lez-Guti√©rrez</p>
            <p>Giant quantum emitters, whose effective size is comparable to the wavelength of the radiation they couple to, give rise to interference effects and non-Markovian dynamics that lie beyond the scope of the standard Weisskopf-Wigner approximation. Here we study minimal models of giant emitters coupled to cavit$-array waveguides and identify symmetric configurations where the dynamics can be solved exactly. This allows us to capture the emergence of bound states both inside and outside the photonic continuum, and to demonstrate the possibility of engineering their coherent superpositions. Our results provide analytical insight into non-Markovian light-matter interaction and suggest a feasible implementation using superconducting circuit platforms.</p>

            <p>Future optical quantum technologies, such as quantum networks, distributed quantum computing and sensing, demand efficient, broadband quantum memories. However, achieving high efficiency without introducing noise, reducing bandwidth, or limiting scalability remains a challenge. Here, we present a new approach to enhance quantum memory protocols by leveraging constructive light-matter interference, leading to an increase in memory efficiency without increasing atomic density or laser intensity. We implement this method in a Raman quantum memory in warm Cesium vapor, and achieve more than a three-fold improvement in total efficiency reaching $(34.3\pm8.4)\%$, while retaining GHz-bandwidth operation and low noise levels. Numerical simulations predict that this approach can boost efficiencies in systems limited by atomic density, such as cold atomic ensembles, from $65\%$ to beyond $96\%$, while in warm atomic vapors it could reduce the laser intensity needed to reach a given efficiency by over an order-of-magnitude, exceeding $95\%$ total efficiency. Furthermore, our method preserves the single-mode nature of the memory at high efficiencies. This new protocol is applicable to various memory architectures, paving the way toward scalable, efficient, low-noise, and high-bandwidth quantum memories.</p>

            <p>Polarization-encoded spin-photon interfaces constitute promising candidates for the development of stationary nodes used as photon receivers, for quantum communication and distributed quantum computing. Here we introduce a time-resolved tomography approach which allows observing the dynamics of an electron spin, in a semiconductor quantum dot, mapped onto the dynamics of the polarization state of reflected photons. Through a single tomography experiment, we infer all the relevant spin dynamics timescales, including precession, decoherence and relaxation times. We also demonstrate and quantify the measurement back-action induced, on the embedded spin qubit, by the detection of a single reflected photon. We show that the induced population and coherence of the spin state can be tuned by the chosen polarization basis of the measurement. The control of the photon-induced back-action on the embedded spin qubit constitutes a crucial requirement for the use of spin-photon interfaces as quantum receivers.</p>

            <p>High-precision optical frequency measurement is indispensable to modern science and technology, yet conventional spectroscopic techniques struggle to resolve sub-linewidth spectral features. We introduce a unique platform for super-resolving frequency estimation utilizing a mode-selective atomic Raman quantum memory implemented in warm cesium vapor. By precisely engineering the light matter interaction, our memory coherently stores the optimal temporal mode with high fidelity and retrieves it on-demand, realizing a mode crosstalk as low as 0.34%. To estimate the separation between two spectral lines, we experimentally measure the mean squared error of the frequency estimate, achieving a sensitivity of 1/20 of the linewidth with a ($34\pm4$)-fold enhancement in precision over direct intensity measurements. This enhanced frequency resolution, combined with the memory's on-demand storage, retrieval, and mode conversion capabilities, paves the way for multifunctional memory-based time-frequency sensors and their integration within quantum networks.</p>

            <h2>Symmetry enforces entanglement at high temperatures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amir-Reza Negari, Leonardo A. Lessa, Subhayan Sahu</p>
            <p>Many-body quantum systems with local interactions undergo "sudden death of entanglement" at high temperatures, whereby thermal states become classical mixtures of product states. We investigate whether symmetry constraints can prevent this phenomenon. We prove that strongly symmetric thermal states (canonical ensemble) of generic Hamiltonians with on-site Abelian symmetries remain entangled with non-zero entanglement negativity at arbitrarily high temperatures, under mild conditions on the symmetry actions and the charge sector of the strong symmetry. Our results extend to weakly symmetric thermal states (Gibbs ensemble) under superselection rules, which restrict state decompositions to be symmetric. In particular, we show that fermionic Gibbs states do not exhibit sudden death of entanglement and have persistent fermionic negativity at high temperatures. These findings demonstrate that global symmetry correlations can preserve quantum entanglement despite thermal decoherence, providing new insights into the interplay between symmetry and quantum information in thermal equilibrium.</p>

            <p>The potential of quantum computers to outperform classical ones in practically useful tasks remains challenging in the near term due to scaling limitations and high error rates of current quantum hardware. While quantum error correction (QEC) offers a clear path towards fault tolerance, overcoming the scalability issues will take time. Early applications will likely rely on QEC combined with quantum error mitigation (QEM). We introduce a QEM scheme against both compilation errors and logical-gate noise that is circuit-, QEC code-, and compiler-agnostic. The scheme builds on quasi-probability distribution methods and uses information about the circuit's gates' compilations to attain an unbiased estimation of noiseless expectation values incurring a constant sample-complexity overhead. Moreover, it features maximal circuit size and QEC code-distance both independent of the target precision, in contrast to strategies based on QEC alone. We formulate the mitigation procedure as a linear program, demonstrate its efficacy through numerical simulations, and illustrate it for estimating the Jones polynomials of knots. Our method significantly reduces quantum resource requirements for high-precision estimations, offering a practical route towards fault-tolerant quantum computation with precision-independent overheads.</p>

            <p>Device-independent (DI) certification allows the verification of quantum systems based solely on observed statistics, without assumptions about their internal structure. While self-testing, the strongest DI certification, of a wide range of quantum states and measurements is done, the self-testing of quantum operations remains underdeveloped. Here, we show in a proof-of-principle way that any quantum unitary can be self-tested within the DI paradigm. For our purpose, we utilise the framework of quantum networks with multiple independent sources. Our work provides a fundamental step toward certifying quantum interactions directly from data, without detailed modelling assumptions. Moreover, the result also serves as a crucial ingredient for quantum computation, where verifying that quantum gates perform as intended is essential for building secure and reliable quantum processors.</p>

            <h2>Engineering Non-Gaussian Bosonic Gates through Quantum Signal Processing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pak-Tik Fong, Hoi-Kwan Lau</p>
            <p>Non-Gaussian operations are essential for most bosonic quantum technologies. Yet, realizable non-Gaussian gates are rather limited in type and generally suffer from accuracy-duration trade-offs. In this work, we propose to use quantum signal processing (QSP) techniques to engineer non-Gaussian gates on hybrid qumode-qubit systems. For systems with dispersive coupling, our scheme can generate a new non-Gaussian gate that produces a phase shift depending on the modulus of the boson number. This gate reproduces the selective number-dependent arbitrary phase (SNAP) gates under certain parameter choices, but with higher accuracy within a short, fixed and excitation-independent interaction time. The gate unlocks new applications, for example, in entangling logical qudits and deterministically generating multi-component cat states. Additionally, our versatile QSP formalism can be extended to systems with other interactions, and also engineer non-unitary operations, such as noiseless linear amplification and generalized-parity measurement.</p>

            <h2>Non-spatial symmetries in quantum nonlinear spectroscopy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Li Sun, Chong Chen, Ren-Bao Liu</p>
            <p>Nonlinear spectroscopy is a powerful approach to extracting information, in particular higher-order correlations of physical quantities. Quantum nonlinear spectroscopy (QNS) can access exponentially more types of correlations than its classical counterpart, since the responses to ``classical forces'' correspond to contour-time-ordered correlations (CTOCs) that involve only commutators, while in QNS ``quantum forces'' from a quantum sensor induce responses corresponding to CTOCs that involve both commutators and anti-commutators. Symmetries are important for constraining and analyzing nonlinear spectroscopy. Quantum and classical nonlinear spectroscopy have similar spatial symmetry properties. QNS, however, is expected to have its characteristic non-spatial symmetry properties since commutators and anti-commutators of physical quantities can behave differently under non-spatial transformations (such as exchange of operators). Here, we investigate how higher-order correlations extracted by QNS are constrained by non-spatial symmetries, including particle-hole (C), time-reversal (T), and their combination, i.e., chiral (S) symmetry. We find that the generalized C-symmetry imposes special selection rules on QNS, and the generalized T- and S-symmetry relate CTOCs to out-of-time-order correlations (OTOCs). This work discloses deep structures in higher-order quantum correlations due to non-spatial symmetries and provides access to certain types of OTOCs that are not directly observable.</p>

            <p>Lithium niobate (LN) microring resonators, characterized by an exceptionally high second-order nonlinear coefficient and superior electro-optic tunability, serve as an outstanding platform for the precise control of integrated quantum frequency combs (QFCs). In this study, we introduce a bipartite entanglement criterion to investigate the pairwise entanglement characteristics of QFCs generated via the spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) process in lithium niobate microring resonators operating below threshold. Furthermore, we propose a universal framework for analyzing multimode squeezing in quadratic frequency combs, enabling the realization of ultrabroadband and high-degree multimode squeezing. We further reveal the underlying physical mechanism: modulation instability (MI), regulated by temporal walk-off control, not only enables the formation of frequency combs but also induces multimode squeezing in the corresponding resonant modes. This study uncovers the previously unexplored role of on-chip multimode squeezing in quadratic frequency combs while facilitating collective noise suppression across multiple modes, thus holding substantial potential for advancing quantum precision measurement and quantum information processing.</p>

            <h2>Optimal Work Extraction from Finite-Time Closed Quantum Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shoki Sugimoto, Takahiro Sagawa, Ryusuke Hamazaki</p>
            <p>Extracting useful work from quantum systems is a fundamental problem in quantum thermodynamics. In scenarios where rapid protocols are desired -- whether due to practical constraints or deliberate design choices -- a fundamental trade-off between power and efficiency emerges as a key concern. Here, we investigate the problem of finite-time optimal work extraction from closed quantum systems, subject to a constraint on the magnitude of the control Hamiltonian. We first establish the trade-off relation between power and work under a general setup, stating that these fundamental performance metrics cannot be maximized simultaneously. Next, we introduce a framework of Lie-algebraic control, which involves a wide range of control problems including many-body control of the Heisenberg model and the SU(n)-Hubbard model. Within this framework, the optimal work extraction protocol becomes remarkably simple: it suffices to use a time-independent Hamiltonian, which is determined by a nonlinear self-consistent equation. We obtain an analytical solution for su(2) control, and a numerical solution for more complex cases like su(n) control using the steepest gradient descent method. Moreover, by exploiting the Lie-algebraic structure of the controllable terms, our approach is applicable to quantum many-body systems, enabling an efficient numerical computation. Our results highlight the necessity of rapid protocols to achieve the maximum power and establish a theoretical framework for designing optimal work extraction protocols under realistic time constraints.</p>

            <p>For decades, computational chemistry has been posited as one of the areas in which quantum computing would revolutionize. However, the algorithmic advantages that fault-tolerant quantum computers have for chemistry can be overwhelmed by other disadvantages, such as error correction, processor speed, etc. To assess when quantum computing will be disruptive to computational chemistry, we compare a wide range of classical methods to quantum computational methods by extending the framework proposed by Choi, Moses, and Thompson. Our approach accounts for the characteristics of classical and quantum algorithms, and hardware, both today and as they improve. We find that in many cases, classical computational chemistry methods will likely remain superior to quantum algorithms for at least the next couple of decades. Nevertheless, quantum computers are likely to make important contributions in two important areas. First, for simulations with tens or hundreds of atoms, highly accurate methods such as Full Configuration Interaction are likely to be surpassed by quantum phase estimation in the coming decade. Secondly, in cases where quantum phase estimation is most efficient less accurate methods like Couple Cluster and Moller-Plesset, could be surpassed in fifteen to twenty years if the technical advancements for quantum computers are favorable. Overall, we find that in the next decade or so, quantum computing will be most impactful for highly accurate computations with small to medium-sized molecules, whereas classical computers will likely remain the typical choice for calculations of larger molecules.</p>

            <p>The study of phase transitions and critical phenomena arising in quantum driven-dissipative systems, and whether a correspondence can be drawn to their equilibrium counterparts, is a pressing question in contemporary physics. The development of large-scale superconducting circuits provides an experimental platform for these theoretical models. We report an experimental study of a multi-mode dissipative first-order phase transition in a 1D Bose-Hubbard chain consisting of 21 superconducting resonators. This phase transition manifests itself as a simultaneous frequency jump in all resonator modes as the frequency or power of a pump tone is swept. By measuring the system's emission spectrum through the transition, we characterize the dim-to-bright phase transition and construct the full phase diagram. We further perform time-dependent measurements of the switching between the two phases in the transition region, from which we corroborate the transition line and extract transition times ranging from a few ms up to 143~s. Our model, based on single-mode mean-field theory and cross-Kerr interactions, captures the features at moderate pump powers and quantitatively reproduces the transition line. Our results open a new window into non-equilibrium quantum many-body physics and mark a step toward realizing and understanding dissipative phase transitions in the thermodynamic limit using superconducting quantum circuits.</p>

            <p>We investigate the effects of coupling a local electromagnetic cavity to a segment of a topological Kitaev chain (KC), with particular emphasis on the interplay between photons and Majorana zero modes (MZMs). In addition to the well-known {\it scissor effect}-which effectively partitions the chain and isolates free MZMs in the bulk-we provide evidence of non-trivial fusion rules and braiding operations, hallmark signatures of non-Abelian anyons, enabled by spatially selective ultrastrong KC-cavity coupling. We propose that these distinctive MZM properties can be experimentally probed via fermionic parity measurements and photon-induced Berry phases. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, in the so-called sweet-spot regime, the coupled system can be mapped onto a Rabi-like model with a homodyne-rotated quadrature, offering a simplified yet powerful theoretical description. Exploiting the symmetry of fermionic modes within a two-site cavity configuration, we also show the feasibility of generating hybrid MZM-polariton Schr√∂dinger cat states. Our findings offer a novel approach to manipulating topological quantum matter through local light-matter interactions and provide theoretical tools for future experimental realizations in platforms such as quantum materials or superconducting circuits.</p>

            <h2>Liouvillian and Hamiltonian exceptional points of atomic vapors: The spectral signatures of quantum jumps</h2>

            <p>We investigate spectral singularities in an alkali-metal atomic vapor modeled using four and effectively three hyperfine states. By comparing the eigenvalue spectra of a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian (NHH) and a Liouvillian superoperator, we analyze the emergence and characteristics of both semiclassical and quantum exceptional points. Our results reveal that, for atomic systems, the NHH approach alone may be insufficient to fully capture the system's spectral properties. While NHHs can yield accurate predictions in certain regimes, a comprehensive description typically requires the Liouvillian formalism, which governs the Lindblad master equation and explicitly incorporates quantum jump processes responsible for repopulation dynamics. We demonstrate that the inclusion of quantum jumps fundamentally alters the spectral structure of the system. In particular, we present examples in which the existence, location in parameter space, or even the order of spectral degeneracies differ significantly between the two approaches, thereby highlighting the impact of quantum jumps and the limitations of the NHH method. Finally, using the hybrid-Liouvillian formalism, we show how quantum jumps reshape spectral features initially predicted by the NHH, ultimately determining the full Liouvillian spectrum.</p>

Within this dictionary we derive the Barbero-Immirzi parameter directly from the entanglement/area increment of a minimal bridge, and show that a boundary edge-mode construction renders the Bekenstein - Hawking entropy coefficient universal and independent of $\gamma$ under a natural complex polarization. We further establish a refinement renormalization flow for spin-foam amplitudes driven by the finite-region curvature energy bound, which suppresses bubble divergences and yields a regulator-independent continuum limit under explicit conditions.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Torin Stetina, Nathan Wiebe</p>
            <p>We provide a simulation algorithm that properly addresses light matter interaction between non-relativistic first-quantized charged particles and quantum electromagnetic fields. Unlike previous work, our Hamiltonian does not include an explicit Coulomb interaction between particles. Rather, the Coulomb interaction emerges from the imposition of Gauss' law as a constraint upon the system in an appropriate non-relativistic limit. Furthermore, a form of topological protection emerges in our formalism, analogous to that of the Toric code Hamiltonian. This mechanism prevents simulation-induced electric field errors that can be contracted to a point from causing any deviations from Coulomb's law in the non-relativistic limit and any error that forms a non-contractable loop is energetically dissallowed in the limit of large volume. We find that, under appropriate continuity assumptions, the number of non-Clifford gates required by our algorithm scales in the thermodynamic limit as $\widetilde{O}(N^{2/3}\eta^{4/3} t \log^5(1/\epsilon))$ for $\eta$ particles, $N$ spatial grid points, simulation time $t$ and error tolerance $\epsilon$. In comparison, the more specific problem of simulating the Coulomb interaction scales as $\widetilde{O}(N^{1/3} \eta^{8/3} t \log^2(1/\epsilon))$. This suggests that if $N \in \tilde{o}(\eta^4)$ that our non-relativistic electrodynamic simulation method could provide a computational advantage for electronic structure problems in the thermodynamic limit under appropriate continuity assumptions as it obviates the need to compute the $O(\eta^2)$ pairwise interactions in the Coulomb Hamiltonian.</p>

In this work, we study the resonant TDJC model considering different modulations of the atom-field coupling. The model is presented and an analytical solution derived in a didactic way, allowing us to examine how time-dependent couplings affect atomic population inversion and atom-field entanglement. We also consider an atom traversing a partially cooled cavity, which induces periodicity and reveals the combined effects of atomic motion and thermal fluctuations. The Bloch vector is used to analyze the dynamics of the system, including the atomic state purity, and reveals phenomena such as atomic dipole alignment with the field due to the oscillating coupling, as well as atomic population trapping, which arises by increasing the initial mean thermal photon number.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dingwei Zhao, Abolfazl Bayat, Victor Montenegro</p>
            <p>Quantum sensors are powerful devices that exploit quantum effects to detect minute quantities with extremely high precision. Two obstacles to harnessing the full capacity of quantum probes are the resource-intensive preparation of the probe and the need for sophisticated measurements that typically require full access to the entire probe. Here, we address these challenges by investigating the driven Jaynes-Cummings system undergoing a dissipative quantum phase transition as a quantum sensor. We show that detuning the system off resonance significantly improves sensing performance by adequately selecting a preferred bistable state in phase space. Our dissipative sensor, independent of the initial probe preparation, exhibits a super-linear enhancement in sensitivity with respect to a specific sensing resource -- the strong-coupling regime ratio -- which manifests in both the full system and partial subsystem. Hence, quantum-enhanced sensitivity persists even when only partial system accessibility is available. Remarkably, we show that a homodyne detection of the field state, combined with Bayesian estimation, nearly saturates the ultimate sensitivity limit of the entire system.</p>

Utilizing suitable pulse parameters for two red-detuned, time-overlapping Gaussian pulses, the SUPER scheme enables close-to-unity population inversion in the targeted collective eigenstates. Furthermore, a tunable optical phase in the SUPER scheme enables the simultaneous inversions in both pure super- and subradiant states with finite populations, thereby resulting in the preparation of hybrid collective states. These results are possible to realize with or without an optical cavity. Our approach to populating the collective eigenstates in a cavity environment paves the way for the efficient preparation of these states in the presence of environmental decoherence. Our scheme enables single-photon generation, which is measured using the second-order correlation function. We also discuss in detail possible experimental realizations, in particular using solid-state emitters and molecules.</p>

            <h2>Casimir-Lifshitz interaction between bodies integrated in a micro/nanoelectromechanical quantum damped oscillator</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu. S. Barash</p>
            <p>A theory is proposed for the component of the Casimir-like force that arises between bodies embedded in a macroscopic quantum damped oscillator. When the oscillator's parameters depend on the distance between the bodies, the oscillator-induced Casimir-like force is generally determined by a broad spectral range extending to high frequencies, limited by the frequency dispersion of the damping function. Here it is shown that there is a large class of systems in which the low-frequency range dominates the forces. This allows for the use of the Ohmic approximation, which is crucial for extending the theory to the lumped element description of fluctuation-induced forces in electrical circuits. Estimates of the circuit-induced Casimir-Lifshitz force suggest that under certain conditions it can be identified experimentally due to its dependence on various circuit elements.</p>

            <h2>Optimal control on open quantum systems and application to non-Condon photo-induced electron transfer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zi-Fan Zhu, Yu Su, Yao Wang, Rui-Xue Xu</p>
            <p>In this work, we develop an optimal control theory on open quantum system and its environment, and exemplify the method with the application to the non-Condon photo-induced electron transfer (PET) in condensed phase. This method utilizes the dissipaton theory, proposed by Yan in 2014 for open quantum systems, which provides an exact description of the dissipative system while also enables rigorous characterization and control of environmental hybridization modes, fully taking into account the non-perturbative and non-Markovian effects. Leveraging the advantage of the dissipaton phase-space algebra, we present in this communication the theoretical strategy for optimal control on both system and environment simultaneously. The control protocol is successfully demonstrated on PET for the environment-targeted-control facilitated transfer. This work sheds the light on manipulating open systems dynamics via polarized environment.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michael Reitz, Stephan van den Wildenberg, Arghadip Koner, George C. Schatz, Joel Yuen-Zhou</p>
            <p>The collective interactions of nanoparticles arranged in periodic structures give rise to high-$Q$ in-plane diffractive modes known as surface lattice resonances (SLRs). While these resonances and their broader implications have been extensively studied within the framework of classical electrodynamics and linear response theory, a quantum optical theory capable of describing the dynamics of these structures, especially in the presence of material nonlinearities, beyond the use of \textit{ad hoc} few-mode approximations is largely missing. To this end, we consider here a lattice of metallic nanoparticles coupled to the background electromagnetic field and derive the quantum input-output relations within the electric dipole approximation. As a first application, we discuss coupling of the nanoparticle array to an external array of emitters and illustrate how the formalism can be extended to molecular optomechanics. Specifically, we show how the high $Q$-factors provided by SLRs can facilitate coupling between the nanoparticle array and collective vibrational modes. Finally, we examine a scenario in which the metallic nanoparticles themselves are replaced with saturable excitonic emitters, illustrating how the nonlinearity of the emitters can be used to switch the SLR condition between different electronic transitions. We further show, using a perturbative approach that explicitly accounts for population dynamics, how the resulting switching dynamics can be observed and characterized in pump-probe experiments. Our work provides a seamless framework to rigorously model SLR phenomena with quantum emitters without resorting to phenomenological treatments of either the electromagnetic environment or the material degrees of freedom.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anwei Zhang, C. M. Wang</p>
            <p>In recent years, the investigation of nonlinear electromagnetic responses has received significant attention due to its potential for elucidating the quantum properties of matter. Although remarkable progress has been achieved in developing quantum theories of nonlinear responses to electric field, a comprehensive quantum theory framework that systematically addresses nonlinear responses to both electric and magnetic fields has yet to be thoroughly discussed. Here, we present a systematic quantum theory of nonlinear electromagnetic response using the Matsubara Green's function approach, which explicitly incorporates the wave vector dependence of external electromagnetic fields. We provide diagrammatic representation and reveal the general properties of transport coefficients. We apply our theory to second-order responses, deriving the nonlinear Hall effects and magneto-nonlinear Hall effects in both time-reversal symmetric and time-reversal breaking systems. These effects stem from diverse quantum geometric quantities. Additionally, we analyze the contributions arising from the Zeeman interaction. Our work presents a unified quantum theory of nonlinear electromagnetic response, paving the way for further exploration of novel phenomena in this field.</p>

            <h2>Gain-Assisted and Dynamically Controlled Optical Bistability for Quantum Logic Gate Applications</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Parkhi Bhardwaj, Poonam Yadav, Bodhaditya Santra, Shubhrangshu Dasgupta</p>
            <p>The propagation of a probe field in an N-type four level cold atomic system is investigated under the influence of multiple coherent fields. Coherent control of quantum interference enables switching of the probe field between transparency and gain regimes. Subsequent analysis focuses on how the introduction of gain in the probe transition lowers the threshold for optical bistability, thereby enhancing the nonlinear response of the system at reduced input intensities. A detailed analysis of optical bistability is presented, focusing on its threshold, stability, and switching efficiency as functions of field strengths and detunings. Structured light beams, specifically Laguerre Gaussian modes carrying orbital angular momentum, are employed to tailor the bistable characteristics. The impact of Orbital angular momentum through the topological charge and azimuthal phase is shown to significantly influence the bistable behavior. Based on these features, a theoretical scheme is proposed to realize a Controlled-NOT gate via dynamic modulation of bistability. These results highlight the potential of integrating nonlinear optical effects with structured light in cold atomic systems for implementing scalable quantum logic and advancing photonic information processing.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Markovian master equation in the high-temperature limit</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ricardo C. Zamar, J. Agust√≠n Taboada</p>
            <p>We present a critical derivation of the high-temperature quantum Markovian master equation (HTME), examining its foundational assumptions, their quantum-mechanical implications, and its range of validity. Starting from the Born-Markov master equation, and combining the spin Hamiltonian eigenoperator formalism with a linear expansion in statistical coefficients, as the only assumption, we obtain a quantum dissipator that generalizes the Abragam-Redfield-Hubbard inhomogeneous master equation (ARH-IME). Our derivation naturally incorporates an additional term for non-thermal, high-order initial states, while reducing to ARH-IME for spin states evolving near thermal equilibrium (weak-order). Through an alternative operator-based derivation of the HTME, we confirm these results and reveal a symmetrization condition for the spectral densities in the linear thermal regime. We rigorously analyze the internal consistency of both approaches and compare them with prior literature. To illustrate these findings, we study: (i) A canonical spin-1/2 system interacting with a bosonic bath, demonstrating first-principles symmetrization of spectral densities at high temperatures. (ii) Singlet-triplet conversion in a correlated two-spin system, where the ARH-IME fails, exposing the limitations of the weak-order hypothesis in strongly correlated regimes. Our results challenge the traditional boundaries of NMR spin-lattice relaxation theory and provide a refined framework for modeling open quantum systems beyond weak order.</p>

            <p>We present a novel approach to chiral discrimination using gate-based quantum processors, addressing a key challenge in adapting conventional control techniques using modern quantum computing. Schemes such as stimulated rapid adiabatic passage (STIRAP) and shortcuts to adiabaticity (STAP) have shown strong potential for enantiomer discrimination; their reliance on analog and continuous-time control makes them incompatible with digital gate-based quantum computing architectures. Here, we adapt these protocols for quantum computers by discretizing their Gaussian-shaped pulses through Trotterization. We simulate the chiral molecule 1,2-propanediol and experimentally validate this gate-based implementation on IBM quantum hardware. Our results demonstrate that this approach is a viable foundation for advancing chiral discrimination protocols, preparing the way for quantum-level manipulation of molecular chirality on accessible quantum architectures.</p>

The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, first introduced in the context of polyacetylene, provides a paradigmatic example of a system exhibiting topological and non-topological phases. We explore the transmission of one and two excitations in anisotropic Heisenberg SSH spin chains and analyze the relationship between topological properties and state transfer efficiency. We examine the robustness of quantum state transmission against static disorder in the trivial and topological regimes, exploring how topological protection influences transmission fidelity. We also consider the effect of dipolar interactions, introducing long-range couplings and breaking the conservation of total magnetization. Furthermore, we employ optimal control theory to design driving pulses for state transmission, finding substantial differences between optimizing in the trivial and topological regimes. Our results provide insights about the interplay between topology, disorder, interactions, and control strategies in quantum state transfer.</p>

            <p>Faithfully simulating the dynamics of open quantum systems requires efficiently addressing the challenge of an infinite Hilbert space. Inspired by the shifted boson operator technique used in ground-state studies of the spin-boson model (SBM), we develop a novel algorithm that integrates a shifted optimized boson basis with the time-evolving block decimation method. We validate our approach by accurately reproducing the polarization dynamics of the sub-Ohmic SBM at a significantly reduced computational cost. For the Ohmic SBM, we demonstrate that the time-evolved final state converges precisely to the variational prediction at both zero and finite temperatures. Furthermore, our method reveals a new aperiodic pseudocoherent phase in the super-Ohmic SBM with an initially polarized bath. This work establishes an efficient and powerful approach for simulating the real-time dynamics of open quantum systems.</p>

            <p>The emerging hard X-ray - nuclear interfaces offer unique potential advantages over traditional optical-atomic interfaces for room-temperature, solid-state quantum information processing, including lower background noise, tighter focusing, and exceptionally high resonance quality. Leveraging such interfaces, a major milestone was recently achieved with the first implementation of nuclear quantum memory in the hard X-ray range [S. Velten et al., Nuclear quantum memory for hard X-ray photon wave packets, Sci. Adv. 10, eadn9825 (2024)] using the Doppler frequency comb protocol. However, this approach relies on the synchronous mechanical motion of multiple nuclear absorbers, posing experimental challenges for on-demand photon retrieval. We propose an on-demand hard X-ray quantum memory based on reversing the direction of an external magnetic field in a single stationary solid-state nuclear absorber with sets of Zeeman sublevels. This scheme is exemplified by the quantum storage of an 1.41-$\mu$s single photon wave packet at 6.2 keV for over 10 $\mu$s in a $^{181}$Ta metallic foil, providing a feasible pathway for the first experimental demonstration of on-demand hard X-ray photon storage.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Mpemba Effect in Dissipative Spin Chains at Criticality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zijun Wei, Mingdi Xu, Xiang-Ping Jiang, Lei Pan</p>
            <p>The Quantum Mpemba Effect (QME) is the quantum counterpart of the classical Mpemba effect--a counterintuitive phenomenon in which a system initially at a higher temperature relax to thermal eauilibrium faster than one at a lower temperature. In this work, we investigate the QME in one-dimensional quantum spin chains coupled to a Markovian environment. By analyzing the full relaxation dynamics governed by the Lindblad master equation, we reveal the emergence of a strong quantum Mpemba effect at quantum critical points. Our findings reveal that criticality enhances the non-monotonic dependence of relaxation times on the initial temperature, leading to anomalously accelerated equilibration. This phenomenon is directly linked to the structure of the Liouvillian spectrum at criticality and the associated overlaps with the initial states. These findings demonstrate that quantum phase transitions could provide a natural setting for realizing and enhancing non-equilibrium phenomena in open quantum systems.</p>

For uniform coupling along the line, we show that the ergotropy of the battery, evaluated at the point of maximum power transfer, decreases with the length of the charging line and vanishes beyond a critical size. By carefully engineering the initial state of the charger, nonzero ergotropy can still be harvested even beyond this critical length. We further examine scenarios in which the charging line is initialized in an entangled state, as well as configurations with nonuniform, parabolically varying coupling strengths. In the latter case, we demonstrate that high ergotropy values can be restored, highlighting the potential of spatially engineered interactions to enhance quantum battery performance.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> F.J. Rodr√≠guez, L. Quiroga, N.F.Johnson</p>
            <p>Twisted light (TL), a special kind of light carrying orbital angular momentum, provides a powerful tool for driving symmetry resolved transitions in quantum confined nanostructures. We study a realistic model where a TL pulse excites two interacting electrons in a nanostructure under a perpendicular magnetic field. To include image charge effects in layered systems, we use an effective electron electron potential of the form 1/r^n. For n = 2, the system exhibits an underlying su(1,1) dynamical symmetry, enabling analytical solutions and a clear interpretation of selection rules, parity changes, and angular momentum resolved absorption. We show that the bare Coulomb 1/r interaction produces similar spectra, indicating that twisted light driven excitations are robust against the precise interaction form. The excitation spectrum reveals strong chiral properties: TL pulses, unlike conventional dipolar fields, directly access interaction-driven transitions otherwise symmetry-forbidden. In particular, TL breaks the generalized Kohn theorem, exposing internal excitations through multi quanta orbital processes. More broadly, our results establish TL as a sensitive probe of correlations, symmetry, and magneto-optical dynamics in strongly interacting quantum systems, uncovering features that remain invisible to standard infrared absorption.</p>

            <p>In the pursuit of robust quantum computing, we put forth a platform based on photonic qubits in a circuit-QED environment. Specifically, we propose a versatile two-qubit gate based on two cavities coupled via a transmon, constituting a selective number-dependent phase gate operating on the in-phase eigenmodes of the two cavities, the Eigen-SNAP gate. This gate natively operates in the dispersive coupling regime of the cavities and the transmon, and operates by driving the transmon externally, to imprint desired phases on the number states. As an example for the utility of the Eigen-SNAP gate, we implement a $\sqrt{\text{SWAP}}$ gate on a system of two logical bosonic qubits encoded in the cavities. Further, we use numerical optimization to determine the optimal implementation of the $\sqrt{\text{SWAP}}$. We find that the fidelities of these optimal protocols are only limited by the coherence times of the system's components. These findings pave the way to continuous variable quantum computing in cavity-transmon systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S. Bayati, M.H. Naderi</p>
            <p>In this paper, we propose and explore an experimentally viable scheme to realize tunable optomechanically induced transparency (OMIT) and optomechanically induced absorption (OMIA) phenomena in a hybrid microwave-optomechanical circuit in which two single-Cooper-pair transistors (SCPTs) are coupled to a common microwave $LC$ resonator and two independent micromechanical resonators. We show that under special conditions such a system can be equivalently modeled as a two-mechanical-modes optomechanical cavity in which, besides the standard radiation-pressure coupling, the cavity mode interacts with the mechanical modes through the cross-Kerr (CK), a higher-order generalized CK, and a three-mode CK type of coupling. Furthermore, there is an induced CK coupling between the two-mechanical modes. Assuming that the cavity mode is simultaneously driven by a strong control field and a weak probe field, we analyze the response of the output probe field affected by the above-mentioned nonlinear couplings. In particular, our results reveal that the higher-order nonlinear CK and the three-mode CK couplings have remarkable impact on the characteristics of the OMIT and OMIA phenomena. Moreover, we find that these nonlinear couplings can give rise to the occurrence of the gain in the absorption profile and contribute to the amplification of the output probe field in specific frequency regions. We also show that the system offers tunable switching between slow and fast light behaviors. The proposed hybrid optomechanical circuit may find potential applications in light propagation, quantum sensing of physical quantities, and information processing.</p>

            <p>Accurately computing the free energies of biological processes is a cornerstone of computer-aided drug design but it is a daunting task. The need to sample vast conformational spaces and account for entropic contributions makes the estimation of binding free energies very expensive. While classical methods, such as thermodynamic integration and alchemical free energy calculations, have significantly contributed to reducing computational costs, they still face limitations in terms of efficiency and scalability. We tackle this through a quantum algorithm for the estimation of free energy differences by adapting the existing Liouvillian approach and introducing several key algorithmic improvements. We directly implement the Liouvillian operator and provide an efficient description of electronic forces acting on both nuclear and electronic particles on the quantum ground state potential energy surface. This leads to super-polynomial runtime scaling improvements in the precision of our Liouvillian simulation approach and quadratic improvements in the scaling with the number of particles. Second, our algorithm calculates free energy differences via a fully quantum implementation of thermodynamic integration and alchemy, thereby foregoing expensive entropy estimation subroutines used in prior works. Our results open new avenues towards the application of quantum computers in drug discovery.</p>

We investigate a galvanically connected direct-current superconducting quantum interference device (dc SQUID) as a minimal tunable coupling element for fluxonium qubits. Comparing grounded and floating fluxonium designs, we find that the latter contains an extra sloshing mode that strongly hybridizes with the qubit modes, leading to significant static ZZ crosstalk. In contrast, the grounded design avoids this issue and allows suppression of static ZZ crosstalk using a shunting capacitor. Leveraging fast flux control, we present two schemes to implement two-qubit gates, predicting a $\sqrt{i\text{SWAP}}$-like gate with $99.9\%$ open-system fidelity in less than 6 nanoseconds assuming modest relaxation and dephasing rates.</p>

            <p>Superconducting fluxonium qubits show a highly tunable energy-level structure, with transition frequencies spanning from a few MHz to few GHz. This range is well-aligned to the operational frequencies of highly coherent micro- and nano-mechanical resonators, making fluxonium an at- tractive candidate for hybrid electromechanical systems. In this work, we theoretically investigate a flux-tunable electromechanical system consisting of a fluxonium qubit coupled to a suspended mechanical resonator. The coupling arises from the motion-induced modulation of magnetic flux through the fluxonium loop, enabling both transverse and longitudinal electromechanical interac- tions that are tunable via external magnetic fields. By optimizing the design parameters of the fluxonium qubit, we demonstrate the feasibility of achieving strong resonant single-photon coupling near the flux-frustration point. We analyze the system dynamics across different coupling regimes, identifying signatures of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in the longitudinal regime and mode splitting in the transverse regime. Additionally, we show that ground-state preparation of both subsystems is possible through sideband cooling of the mechanical resonator. These results suggest that a fluxonium-based hybrid electromechanical device could be a promising platform for studying macroscopic quantum phenomena and for applications in quantum technology.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jie Liu, Yue Cai, Lei Tan</p>
            <p>Giant atoms are artificial atoms that can couple to a waveguide non-locally. Previous work has shown that two giant atoms in a braided configuration can interact through a one-dimensional infinite waveguide, with both individual and collective atomic relaxation being fully suppressed. In this paper, however, we show that the decoherence-free interaction (DFI) between two giant atoms can be realized in both braided and nested configurations when the waveguide is semi-infinite. This protected interaction fails to appear in semi-infinite waveguide systems containing two separate giant atoms or two small atoms. We also study the entanglement generation between two giant atoms coupled to a one-dimensional semi-infinite waveguide. The results show that the maximally entangled state is generated in both braided and nested configurations due to the formation of DFI, and in the separate configuration, the maximally achievable entanglement can exceed 0.5. This study presents a new scheme for realizing DFI and generating maximally entangled states in giant-atom waveguide-QED systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hayato Goto, Ryo Hidaka, Kosuke Tatsumura</p>
            <p>Nonlinear dynamical systems with continuous variables can be used for solving combinatorial optimization problems with discrete this http URL particular, numerical simulations of them can be used as heuristic algorithms with a desirable property, namely, parallelizability, which allows us to execute them in a massively parallel manner using cutting-edge many-core processors, leading to ultrafast performance. However, the dynamical-system approaches with continuous variables are usually less accurate than conventional approaches with discrete variables such as simulated annealing. To improve the solution accuracy of a representative dynamical system-based algorithm called simulated bifurcation (SB), which was found from classical simulation of a quantum nonlinear oscillator network exhibiting quantum bifurcation, here we generalize it by introducing nonlinear control of individual bifurcation parameters and show that the generalized SB (GSB) can achieve almost 100% success probabilities for some large-scale problems. As a result, the time to solution for a 2,000-variable problem is shortened to 10 ms by a GSB-based machine, which is two orders of magnitude shorter than the best known value, 1.3 s, previously obtained by an SB-based machine. To examine the reason for the ultrahigh performance, we investigated chaos in the GSB changing the nonlinear-control strength and found that the dramatic increase of success probabilities happens near the edge of chaos. That is, the GSB can find a solution with high probability by harnessing the edge of chaos. This finding suggests that dynamical-system approaches to combinatorial optimization will be enhanced by harnessing the edge of chaos, opening a broad possibility to tackle intractable combinatorial optimization problems by nature-inspired approaches.</p>

            <p>This work presents a machine learning approach based on support vector machines (SVMs) for quantum entanglement detection. Particularly, we focus in bipartite systems of dimensions 3x3, 4x4, and 5x5, where the positive partial transpose criterion (PPT) provides only partial characterization. Using SVMs with quantum-inspired kernels we develop a classification scheme that distinguishes between separable states, PPT-detectable entangled states, and entangled states that evade PPT detection. Our method achieves increasing accuracy with system dimension, reaching 80%, 90%, and nearly 100% for 3x3, 4x4, and 5x5 systems, respectively. Our results show that principal component analysis significantly enhances performance for small training sets. The study reveals important practical considerations regarding purity biases in the generation of data for this problem and examines the challenges of implementing these techniques on near-term quantum hardware. Our results establish machine learning as a powerful complement to traditional entanglement detection methods, particularly for higher-dimensional systems where conventional approaches become inadequate. The findings highlight key directions for future research, including hybrid quantum-classical implementations and improved data generation protocols to overcome current limitations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chenwei Lv, Thomas Bilitewski, Ana Maria Rey, Qi Zhou</p>
            <p>Recent advances in synthetic quantum matter allow researchers to design quantum models inaccessible in traditional materials. Here, we propose protocols to engineer a new class of quantum spin models, which we call spin Kitaev models. The building blocks are basic spin-exchange interactions combined with locally selective Floquet pulses, a capability recently demonstrated in a range of experimental platforms. The resulting flip-flip and flop-flop terms lead to intriguing quantum transport dynamics beyond conventional spin models. For instance, in the absence of a magnetic field, spin excitations polarized along the $x$ and $y$ axes propagate chirally in opposite directions, producing polarization-dependent spin transport. In the large-spin limit, the spin Kitaev model maps to a nonlinear Hatano-Nelson model, where the interplay of nonlinearity and the underlying curvature yields polarization-dependent chiral solitons. A magnetic field binds two oppositely polarized chiral solitons into a chiral solitonic molecule, whose travel direction depends on its orientation. Our results, directly accessible in current experiments, open new opportunities for simulating transport in curved spaces and for applications in spintronics, information processing, and quantum sensing.</p>

            <p>The creation of large-scale, high-fidelity quantum computers is not only a fundamental scientific endeavour in itself, but also provides increasingly robust proofs of quantum computational advantage (QCA) in the presence of unavoidable noise and the dynamic competition with classical algorithm improvements. To overcome the biggest challenge of photon-based QCA experiments, photon loss, we report new Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) experiments with 1024 high-efficiency squeezed states injected into a hybrid spatial-temporal encoded, 8176-mode, programmable photonic quantum processor, Jiuzhang 4.0, which produces up to 3050 photon detection events. Our experimental results outperform all classical spoofing algorithms, particularly the matrix product state (MPS) method, which was recently proposed to utilise photon loss to reduce the classical simulation complexity of GBS. Using the state-of-the-art MPS algorithm on the most powerful supercomputer EI Capitan, it would take > $10^{42}$ years to construct the required tensor network for simulation, while our Jiuzhang 4.0 quantum computer takes 25.6 $\mu$s to produce a sample. This work establishes a new frontier of QCA and paves the way to fault-tolerant photonic quantum computing hardware.</p>

            <p>Fluctuation theorems establish that thermodynamic processes at the microscale can occasionally result in negative entropy production. At the microscale, another distinct possibility becomes more likely: processes where no entropy is produced overall. In this work, we explore the constraints imposed by such null-entropy events on the fluctuations of thermodynamic currents. By incorporating the probability of null-entropy events, we obtain tighter bounds on finite-time thermodynamic uncertainty relations derived from fluctuation theorems. We validate this framework using an example of a qudit SWAP engine.</p>

            <p>Manipulating the frequency and bandwidth of light is crucial in classical and quantum applications including communication, spectroscopy, imaging, and signal processing. Such capabilities also offer potential for interfacing disparate quantum systems in quantum networking and for quantum information processing. We experimentally demonstrate deterministic, broadband frequency control of heralded telecom-band single photons via cross-phase modulation in a short length of single-mode fiber. An intense, ultrafast pump pulse imposes a transient, intensity-dependent refractive-index gradient which imparts a tunable phase shift on the single photons. We present absolute frequency shifts of up to $+6.46\pm0.01$\,THz and $-5.74\pm0.01$\,THz, and bandwidth manipulation ranging from a factor of $0.66\pm0.03$ to $8.4\pm0.3$ times that of the input. Spectral measurements are acquired with a time-of-flight spectrometer and superconducting nanowire detectors. Our scheme offers a compact and scalable route to spectral routing and bandwidth engineering for ultrafast quantum networking and quantum information processing.</p>

            <h2>Learning measurement-induced phase transitions using attention</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hyejin Kim, Abhishek Kumar, Yiqing Zhou, Yichen Xu, Romain Vasseur, Eun-Ah Kim</p>
            <p>Measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPTs) epitomize new intellectual pursuits inspired by the advent of quantum hardware and the emergence of discrete and programmable circuit dynamics. Nevertheless, experimentally observing this transition is challenging, often requiring non-scalable protocols, such as post-selecting measurement trajectories or relying on classical simulations. We introduce a scalable data-centric approach using Quantum Attention Networks (QuAN) to detect MIPTs without requiring post-selection or classical simulation. Applying QuAN to dynamics generated by Haar random unitaries and weak measurements, we first demonstrate that it can pinpoint MIPTs using their interpretation as "learnability" transitions, where it becomes possible to distinguish two different initial states from the measurement record, locating a phase boundary consistent with exact results. Motivated by sample efficiency, we consider an alternative "phase recognition" task-classifying weak- and strong-monitoring data generated from a single initial state. We find QuAN can provide an efficient and noise-tolerant upper bound on the MIPT based on measurement data alone by coupling Born-distribution-level (inter-trajectory) and dynamical (temporal) attention. In particular, our inspection of the inter-trajectory scores of the model trained with minimal sample size processing test data confirmed that QuAN paid special attention to the tail of the distribution of the Born probabilities at early times. This reassuring interpretation of QuAN's learning implies the phase-recognition approach can meaningfully signal MIPT in an experimentally accessible manner. Our results lay the groundwork for observing MIPT on near-term quantum hardware and highlight attention-based architectures as powerful tools for learning complex quantum dynamics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco Calcagno, Delmar G. A. Cabral, Ivan Rivalta, Victor S. Batista</p>
            <p>Designing molecules with optimized properties remains a fundamental challenge due to the intricate relationship between molecular structure and properties. Traditional computational approaches that address the combinatorial number of possible molecular designs become unfeasible as the molecular size increases, suffering from the so-called `curse of dimensionality' problem. Recent advances in quantum computing hardware present new opportunities to address this problem. Here, we introduce the Quantum Ensemble Variational Optimization (QEVO) method for near-term and early fault-tolerant quantum computing platforms. QEVO efficiently maps molecular structures onto an orthonormal basis of Pauli strings and samples from a superposition state generated by a variational ansatz. The ansatz is iteratively optimized to identify molecular candidates with the desired property. Our numerical simulations demonstrate the potential of QEVO in designing drug-like molecules with anticancer properties, employing a shallow quantum circuit that requires only a modest number of qubits. We envision that QEVO could be applied to a wide range of complex problems, offering practical solutions to problems with combinatorial complexity.</p>

            <p>The dynamic structure factor (DSF) is a central quantity for interpreting a vast array of inelastic scattering experiments in chemistry and materials science, but its accurate simulation is a considerable challenge for classical computational methods. In this work, we present a quantum algorithm and an end-to-end simulation framework to compute the DSF, providing a general approach for simulating momentum-resolved spectroscopies. We apply this approach to the simulation of electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) in the core-level electronic excitation regime, a spectroscopic technique offering sub-nanometer spatial resolution and capable of resolving element-specific information, crucial for analyzing battery materials. We derive a quantum algorithm for computing the DSF for EELS by evaluating the off-diagonal terms of the time-domain Green's function, enabling the simulation of momentum-resolved spectroscopies. To showcase the algorithm, we study the oxygen K-edge EELS spectrum of lithium manganese oxide ($Li_2MnO_3$), a prototypical cathode material for investigating the mechanisms of oxygen redox in battery materials. For a representative model of an oxygen-centered cluster of $Li_2MnO_3$ with an active space of 18 active orbitals, the algorithm requires a circuit depth of $3.25\times10^{8}$ T gates, 100 logical qubits, and roughly $10^4$ shots.</p>

            <p>Designing multi-qubit quantum logic gates with experimental constraints is an important problem in quantum computing. Here, we develop a new quantum optimal control algorithm for finding unitary transformations with constraints on the Hamiltonian. The algorithm, geodesic pulse engineering (GEOPE), uses differential programming and geodesics on the Riemannian manifold of $\textrm{SU}(2^n)$ for $n$ qubits. We demonstrate significant improvements over the widely used gradient-based method, GRAPE, for designing multi-qubit quantum gates. Instead of a local gradient descent, the parameter updates of GEOPE are designed to follow the geodesic to the target unitary as closely as possible. We present numerical results that show that our algorithm converges significantly faster than GRAPE for a range of gates and can find solutions that are not accessible to GRAPE in a reasonable amount of time. The strength of the method is illustrtated with varied multi-qubit gates in 2D neutral Rydberg atom platforms.</p>

            <h2>Dissipation-Driven Topological Phase Transition in Quantum Open Systems Independent of system Hamiltonian</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tian-Shu Deng, Fan Yang</p>
            <p>We investigate dissipation-driven topological phase transitions in one-dimensional quantum open systems governed by the Lindblad equation with linear dissipation operators, which ensure the density matrix retains its Gaussian form throughout the dynamics. By employing the modular Hamiltonian framework, we rigorously demonstrate that the $\rm{Z}_2$ topological invariant characterizing steady states in one-dimensional class D systems is exclusively dependent on the dissipation operators, rather than the system Hamiltonian. Through a quench protocol where the system evolves from the steady state of one Lindbladian to another, we reveal that topological transitions can occur at analytically predictable critical times, even when the initial and final steady states share identical topological indices. These transitions are shown, both theoretically and numerically, to depend solely on dissipation parameters. Entanglement spectrum analysis demonstrates bulk-edge correspondence in non-equilibrium density matrices via coexisting single-particle gap closures (periodic boundaries) and topologically protected zero modes (open boundaries), directly underpinning the detection of dissipation-induced topology in quantum simulators.</p>

            <p>The quantum Fisher information, the quantum analogue of the classical Fisher information, is a central quantity in quantum metrology and quantum sensing because of its connection to parameter estimation and fidelity susceptibility. Using numerically exact methods applied to a paradigmatic open quantum system, the spin-boson model, we calculate both static and dynamical quantum Fisher information matrix elements with respect to spin-bath couplings and magnetic field strengths. As the spin-bath interaction increases, we first show that the coupling-coupling matrix elements relative to the ground state of the Hamiltonian serve as a genuine witness of bipartite entanglement and the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless quantum phase transition through their non-monotonic behavior. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the time-dependent matrix elements can reveal non-Markovian effects as well as the transition from the coherent to incoherent regime at the Toulouse point. In the paradigmatic spin-boson model, the non-monotonic features of the quantum Fisher information matrix signal changes in quantum resources such as entanglement and coherence, quantify non-Markovian behavior, and enable criticality-enhanced quantum sensing, thereby shedding light on key features of open quantum systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robin Cockett (University of Calgary), Jean-Simon Pacaud Lemay (Macquarie University), Priyaa Varshinee Srinivasan (Tallinn University of Technology)</p>
            <p>Drazin inverses are a special kind of generalized inverses that can be defined for endomorphisms in any category. A natural question to ask is whether one can somehow extend the notion of Drazin inverse to arbitrary maps - not simply endomorphisms. It turns out that this is possible and, indeed, natural to do so for dagger categories. This paper, thus, introduces the notion of a dagger-Drazin inverse, which is a new kind of generalized inverse appropriate for arbitrary maps in a dagger category. This inverse is closely related to the Drazin inverse, for having dagger-Drazin inverses is equivalent to asking that positive maps have Drazin inverses. Moreover, dagger-Drazin inverses are also closely related to Moore-Penrose inverses as we observe that a map has a Moore-Penrose inverse if and only if it is a Drazin inverse. Furthermore, we explain how Drazin inverses of opposing pairs correspond precisely to dagger-Drazin inverses in cofree dagger categories. We also give examples of dagger-Drazin inverses for matrices over (involutive) fields, bounded linear operators, and partial injections.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Uta Isabella Meyer, Ivan ≈†upiƒá, Damian Markham, Fr√©d√©ric Grosshans</p>
            <p>Nonlocality is an essential concept that distinguishes quantum from classical models and has been extensively studied in systems of qubits. For higher-dimensional systems, certain results for their two-level counterpart, like Bell violations with stabilizer states and Clifford operators, do not generalize. On the other hand, similar to continuous variable systems, Wigner negativity is necessary for nonlocality in qudit systems. We propose a new generalization of the CHSH inequality for qudits by inquiring correlations related to the Wigner negativity of stabilizer states under the adjoint action of a generalization of the qubit $\pi/8$-gate. A specified stabilizer state maximally violates the inequality among all qudit states based on its Wigner negativity. The Bell operator not only serves as a measure for the singlet fraction but also quantifies the volume of Wigner negativity. Additionally, we show how a bipartite entangled qudit state can serve as a witness for contextuality when it exhibits Wigner negativity. Furthermore, we identify rational-phase diagonal unitaries as the key resource that exactly reproduce the CGLMP violation with the maximally entangled state through simple phase-difference alignment.</p>

            <p>We investigate the single-photon scattering spectrum of a driven $\Lambda$-type giant atom system chirally coupled to a one-dimensional (1D) waveguide. By employing a real-space scattering approach, we obtain analytical solutions for the scattering amplitudes that remain valid in both Markovian and non-Markovian regimes. We observe that an external driving field induces a splitting of the transmission spectrum's dip into double dips, with the distance between the two dips increasing as the strength of the driving field increases. The chiral nature of the coupling allows for controlled switching between complete transmission and perfect reflection of incident photons. In the Markovian limit, we predict robust perfect transmission at specific phase values, independent of the driving field this http URL, in the non-Markovian regime, as the size of the giant atom increases, the oscillatory behavior of the scattering spectrum becomes more pronounced. Adjusting the giant atom size enables control over the number of decoupling points as well as the number of complete reflection points.</p>

            <p>The topologically protected configuration embedded in skyrmions has prompted some investigations into their fundamental properties and versatile applications, sparking interest and guiding ongoing development. The topological protection associated with skyrmions was initially observed in systems with interactions. It is widely believed that skyrmions are stable yet relevant confirmation and empirical research remain limited. A pertinent question is whether skyrmion configurations formed by a single classical beam with two coupled degrees of freedom also exhibit topological stability. In this study, we affirm this hypothesis by investigating the effects of local decoherence. We analytically and numerically demonstrate the topological resilience of skyrmions and the occurrence of transition points of skyrmion numbers in local decoherence across three typical decoherence channels. On the other hand, we show that these qualities are independent of the initial state. From the numerical results, we find that inhomogeneous but continuous decoherence channels also have the same behaviors and maintain topological stability of skyrmions as homogeneous decoherence channels do. These properties of skyrmions contribute to further applications in various areas, including communication and imaging.</p>

            <p>It is believed that the theory of quantum gravity describing our universe is unitary. Nonetheless, if we only have access to a subsystem, its dynamics is described by nonequilibrium physics. Motivated by this, we investigate the planar limit of large $N$ one-matrix quantum mechanics obeying the Lindblad master equation with dissipative jump terms, focusing on the existence, uniqueness, and properties of steady states. After showing that Lindblad dissipation is absent in the gauged model at large $N$, we study nonequilibrium phase transitions in planar ungauged matrix quantum mechanics. In the first class of examples, where potentials are unbounded from below, we study nonequilibrium critical points above which strong dissipation allows for the existence of normalizable steady states that would otherwise not exist. In the second class of examples, termed matrix quantum optics, we find evidence of nonequilibrium phase transitions analogous to those recently reported in the quantum optics literature for driven-dissipative Kerr resonators. Preliminary results on two-matrix quantum mechanics are also presented. We implement bootstrap methods to obtain concrete and rigorous results for the nonequilibrium steady states of matrix quantum mechanics in the planar limit.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arman Sauliere, Guglielmo Lami, Corentin Boyer, Jacopo De Nardis, Andrea De Luca</p>
            <p>We study the anticoncentration properties of quantum circuits in the presence of different sources of noise. In the \textit{weak-noise regime}, we show that different types of noise act in a similar fashion, leading to a universal distribution for the probability of a given bit-string, largely independent of the specific noise channel or circuit architecture. In addition, we can identify three distinct depth-dependent regimes, each signaled by a different scaling of cross-entropy benchmarking (XEB) fidelity over time. In the shallow-depth regime, noise effects are perturbatively small; in the intermediate regime, circuit-induced fluctuations and noise compete on equal footing; and in the deep-depth regime, the output distribution becomes effectively classical, up to corrections that are exponentially small in the noise strength. We provide quantitative predictions for the anticoncentration of generic circuits at finite depth, which we benchmark with numerical simulations giving perfect agreement even for shallow circuits. Our findings are directly applicable to current quantum processors and demonstrate universal behavior beyond random-matrix-theory regimes which are only applicable at large depths.</p>

            <p>The exploration of tomography of bosonic Gaussian states is presumably as old as quantum optics, but only recently, their precise and rigorous study have been moving into the focus of attention, motivated by technological developments. In this work, we present an efficient and experimentally feasible Gaussian state tomography algorithm with provable recovery trace-distance guarantees, whose sample complexity depends only on the number of modes, and - remarkably - is independent of the state's photon number or energy, up to doubly logarithmic factors. Our algorithm yields a doubly-exponential improvement over existing methods, and it employs operations that are readily accessible in experimental settings: the preparation of an auxiliary squeezed vacuum, passive Gaussian unitaries, and homodyne detection. At its core lies an adaptive strategy that systematically reduces the total squeezing of the system, enabling efficient tomography. Quite surprisingly, this proves that estimating a Gaussian state in trace distance is generally more efficient than directly estimating its covariance matrix. Our algorithm is particularly well-suited for applications in quantum metrology and sensing, where highly squeezed - and hence high-energy - states are commonly employed. As a further contribution, we establish improved sample complexity bounds for standard heterodyne tomography, equipping this widely used protocol with rigorous trace-norm guarantees.</p>

Specific to our algorithm, the memory-assisted based system allows us to leverage the advantage of asynchronously loaded quantum memory when predicting the distribution rates. Specifically, by focusing on metropolitan distances, we perform simulations tailored toward a system based on free-space links and field-deployable quantum memory. We show the capabilities of our model to predict key rate distributions over ranges of 10-50 km for a set of atmospheric-based parameters and selection of QM efficiencies and coherence times. This tool provides impactful insights into the deployment and optimization of practical MA-MDI-QKD networks in urban environments. Our streamlined approach is a valuable addition to existing quantum network simulators for the smooth integration of quantum networking into the field of communications engineering.</p>

            <p>Contextuality, a key resource for quantum advantage, is a phenomenon where the outcome of a measurement is not independent of other compatible measurements, violating the premise of classical hidden variable descriptions of the theory. We investigate the harvesting of contextuality from the vacuum of a quantum field using Unruh-DeWitt detectors. We show that interactions with the field can endow initially non-contextual detectors with contextuality with respect to Heisenberg-Weyl measurements, as quantified by contextual fraction. The harvested contextuality correlates with the emergence of Wigner function negativity, in agreement with known equivalences between these notions. Our results establish contextuality harvesting as a fundamental phenomenon in relativistic quantum information, highlighting it as a resource that can be extracted directly from the quantum vacuum.</p>

            <p>The inherent noise in current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices presents a major obstacle to the accurate implementation of quantum algorithms such as the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) for quantum chemistry applications. This study examines the impact of error mitigation strategies on VQE performance. We show that, for small molecular systems, an older-generation 5-qubit quantum processing unit (IBMQ Belem), when combined with optimized Twirled Readout Error Extinction (T-REx), achieves ground-state energy estimations an order of magnitude more accurate than those obtained from a more advanced 156-qubit device (IBM Fez) without error mitigation. Our findings demonstrate that T-REx, a computationally inexpensive error mitigation technique, substantially improves VQE accuracy not only in energy estimation, but more importantly in optimizing the variational parameters that characterize the molecular ground state. Consequently, state-vector simulated energies suggest that the accuracy of the optimized variational parameters provides a more reliable benchmark of VQE performance than quantum hardware energy estimates alone. Our results point to the critical role of error mitigation in extending the utility of noisy quantum hardware for molecular simulations.</p>

We formulate equations of motion for an inhomogeneously broadened QD ensemble that is incoherently pumped and simultaneously driven by a coherent seed field, solve for steady states, and compute the output-field quadrature variances. The analysis identifies operating conditions that yield amplitude-quadrature squeezing, with photon-number fluctuations reduced below the coherent-state limit and squeezing levels as large as 5 dB attainable with presently accessible QD and cavity parameters using only ~ 1 uW pump power. We further show that quantum correlations originating from four-wave mixing play a dual role: they both shape the gain spectrum and generate squeezing. These correlations constitute the quantum counterpart of the mean-field (semiclassical) mechanisms responsible for self-mode-locking in QD lasers and the ultra-narrow lasing linewidths achieved under self-injection locking.</p>

            <h2>Wide-spectrum security of quantum key distribution</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hao Tan, Mikhail Petrov, Weiyang Zhang, Liying Han, Sheng-Kai Liao, Vadim Makarov, Feihu Xu, Jian-Wei Pan</p>
            <p>Implementations of quantum key distribution (QKD) need vulnerability assessment against loopholes in their optical scheme. Most of the optical attacks involve injecting or receiving extraneous light via the communication channel. An eavesdropper can choose her attack wavelengths arbitrarily within the quantum channel passband to maximise the attack performance, exploiting spectral transparency windows of system components. Here we propose a wide-spectrum security evaluation methodology to achieve full optical spectrum safety for QKD systems. This technique requires transmittance characterisation in a wide spectral band with a high sensitivity. We report a testbench that characterises insertion loss of fiber-optic components in a wide spectral range of 400 to 2300 nm and up to 70 dB dynamic range. To illustrate practical application of the proposed methodology, we give a full Trojan-horse attack analysis for some typical QKD system configurations and discuss briefly induced-photorefraction and detector-backflash attacks. Our methodology can be used for certification of QKD systems.</p>

            <p>Deterministically tailoring optical Fock states beyond the single-photon level is crucial for boson sampling, loss-tolerant photonic qubits, and quantum-enhanced sensing, however has yet remained elusive. Here, we report an all-linear-optical protocol that converts a resonantly driven single-photon emitter into a deterministic generator of vacuum--single-photon--two-photon states. A phase-stabilized, path-unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer combines vacuum--single-photon interference and Hong-Ou-Mandel effect, providing two knobs to shape photon-number probabilities. By tuning these knobs, we observe a dynamic transition from antibunching to strong bunching in correlation measurements. A fully quantum-mechanical, discrete time-bin model maps these results onto the tailored photon statistics. The same framework predicts that two indistinguishable emitters would extend the accessible space to deterministic NOON states and single-photon filtering. This protocol relying on linear optics and available single-photon sources provides a scalable, chip-compatible, and platform-independent route to on-demand and deterministic few-photon resources for quantum metrology, photonic computing, as well as long-distance quantum networks.</p>

            <p>Light-matter interaction models invariably rely on the multipole expansion of the electromagnetic potentials generated by complex charge distributions. These multipoles are typically taken to be traceless, however, for a correct evaluation of dispersion forces at all distances, the validity of this assumption has to be checked carefully. Here, we revisit the concept of dispersion forces on an atom near a dielectric surface from the perspective of macroscopic quantum electrodynamics and find that, beyond the quadrupole, the multipoles cannot always be taken as fully traceless. In particular, we show that the trace of the octupole moment contributes to Casimir-Polder interactions beyond the electrostatic regime.</p>

            <p>We investigate quantum-enhanced parameter estimation in boundary time crystals (BTCs) via continuous monitoring. By analytically deriving the global quantum Fisher information rate, we show that in the time-crystal phase the ultimate precision exhibits a cubic scaling with the system size, $f_{\mathrm{global}}\sim N^3$, surpassing both the sensitivity at the critical point and the standard quantum limit (SQL). We then numerically demonstrate that this bound can be attained already at finite $N$ using experimentally accessible strategies: continuous photodetection and, in particular, continuous homodyne detection. Moving towards realistic implementations, we derive the fundamental precision limits for inefficient detection ($\eta<1$). While inefficiencies asymptotically restore SQL scaling, a constant-factor quantum advantage remains possible, diverging as $\eta\!\to\!1$. Numerical simulations show that homodyne detection outperforms photodetection in approaching the ultimate bound and consistently provides a collective advantage over independent single-qubit protocols, which grows with $N$.</p>

A matter-wave interferometer with a massive particle can test numerous fundamental ideas, including the spatial superposition principle - a foundational concept in QM - in previously unexplored regimes. It also opens the possibility of probing the interface between QM and GR, such as testing the quantization of gravity. Consequently, there exists an intensive effort to realize such an interferometer. While several approaches are being explored, we focus on utilizing nanodiamonds with embedded spins as test particles which, in combination with Stern-Gerlach forces, enable the realization of a closed-loop matter-wave interferometer in space-time. There is a growing community of groups pursuing this path [1]. We are posting this technical note (as part of a series of seven such notes), to highlight our plans and solutions concerning various challenges in this ambitious endeavor, hoping this will support this growing community. Here we present our work on quantum control of a nitrogen-vacancy spin system in bulk diamonds and in levitated diamonds as a step towards Stern-Gerlach interferometry with levitated nanodiamonds. Our simulations show that the current state of the art for spin coherence time in nanodiamonds of a few tens of microseconds, is good enough to enable an SGI spatial splitting on the order of nanometers for an ND composed of 10^7 atoms.

These universal relations, valid without the need of any efficacy parameter, extend the well-known heat exchange fluctuation theorems for energy and particle transport to the case of non-Abelian quantum transport, where the non-commutativity of the charges allows bending standard thermodynamic rules.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arturo Konderak, Wojciech Bruzda, Remigiusz Augusiak</p>
            <p>Self-testing is a powerful device-independent technique that enables one to deduce the forms of both the quantum state and the measurements involved in a physical experiment based solely on observed correlations. Although numerous schemes for self-testing multipartite entangled states have been proposed, they are typically difficult to implement experimentally, as their complexity increases significantly with the number of subsystems or the local dimension. In this work, we introduce the first self-testing scheme of a relevant class of multiqudit genuinely entangled states that exploits only a constant number of binary measurements per observer, which significantly reduces the experimental effort to implement the scheme. Specifically, it enables the self-testing of multipartite Slater (or supersinglet) states composed of $d$ qu\textit{d}its with odd $d$ using only four two-outcome measurements per observer. Moreover, we prove that our scheme is robust to noise and experimental imperfections. For systems of even local dimension $d$, we also provide an adapted version of the scheme that requires only $d$ binary measurements per observer.</p>

A matter-wave interferometer with a massive particle, can test numerous fundamental ideas, including the spatial superposition principle - a foundational concept in QM - in completely new regimes, as well as the interface between QM and GR, e.g., testing the quantization of gravity. Consequently, there exists an intensive effort to realize such an interferometer. While several paths are being pursued, we focus on utilizing nanodiamonds as our particle, and a spin embedded in the ND together with Stern-Gerlach forces, to achieve a closed loop in space-time.

We are posting this technical note (as part of a series of seven such notes), to highlight our plans and solutions concerning various challenges in this ambitious endeavor, hoping this will support this growing community. In this work we demonstrate the neutralization of levitated nanodiamonds using ultraviolet photoemission, and characterize the dependence of this process on both the illumination wavelength and particle size. Furthermore, we demonstrate discrete, single-electron charge manipulation of levitated nanodiamond in a needle Paul trap at a pressure of 0.5\,Torr. Finally, we demonstrate fast neutralization of levitated nanodiamonds, achieving a neutralization rate much faster than the state of the art.

            <p>Recent advances in chip scale magnetic quantum sensing have produced platforms that pair unprecedented sensitivity with extreme miniaturization. Here, we demonstrate a hybrid quantum sensor by combining Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) centers in diamond with a rubidium (Rb) vapor cell, designed for precise magnetic field measurements and quantum exploration. The hybrid comagnetometer leverages the high resolution vector magnetic sensing of NV centers along with the high scalar field sensitivity of the Rb vapor, enhancing the estimation of the magnetic field in terms of magnitude, direction and spatial distribution. A micromachined mm scale vapor cell containing Rb atoms is paired with a bulk diamond, enabling optical and microwave control of both quantum systems for integrated field estimation. Simulations and experimental results confirm the improved accuracy of the system in magnetic field measurements, demonstrating a beyond 10 dB improvement. This NV and Rb platform offers a versatile route toward portable, sensitive magnetometry and opens new possibilities for integrated, multi-modal quantum sensing.</p>

            <p>Quantum machine learning has the potential to computationally outperform classical machine learning, but it is not yet clear whether it will actually be valuable for practical problems. While some artificial scenarios have shown that certain quantum machine learning techniques may be advantageous compared to their classical counterpart, evidence does not yet suggest that quantum machine learning has surpassed conventional approaches in dealing with standard classical datasets, such as MNIST dataset. In contrast, dealing with quantum data, such as quantum states or circuits, may be the task where we can benefit from quantum methods. Therefore, it is important to develop practically meaningful quantum datasets for which we expect quantum methods to be superior. In this paper, we propose a machine learning task that is likely to soon arise in the real world: clustering and classification of quantum circuits. We provide a dataset of quantum circuits optimized by the variational quantum eigensolver. We utilized six common types of Hamiltonians in condensed matter physics, with a range of 4-20 qubits, and applied ten different ansatz with varying depths (ranging from 3 to 32) to generate a quantum circuit dataset of six distinct classes, each containing 300 samples. We show that this dataset can be easily learned using quantum methods. In particular, we demonstrate a successful classification of our dataset using real four-qubit devices available through IBMQ. By providing a setting and an elementary dataset where quantum machine learning is expected to be beneficial, we hope to encourage and ease the advancement of the field.</p>

            <p>It is well known in quantum optics that any process involving the preparation of a multimode gaussian state, followed by a gaussian operation and gaussian measurements, can be efficiently simulated by classical computers. Here, we provide evidence that computing transition amplitudes of Gaussian processes with a single-layer of non-linearities is hard for classical computers. To do so, we show how an efficient algorithm to solve this problem could be used to efficiently approximate outcome probabilities of a Gaussian boson sampling experiment. We also extend this complexity result to the problem of computing transition probabilities of Gaussian processes with two layers of non-linearities, by developing a Hadamard test for continuous-variable systems that may be of independent interest. Given recent experimental developments in the implementation of photon-photon interactions, our results may inspire new schemes showing quantum computational advantage or algorithmic applications of non-linear quantum optical systems realizable in the near-term.</p>

Other QEC codes beyond surface code are being experimentally studied, such as color codes and quantum Low-Density Parity Check (qLDPC) codes, that could benefit from new quantum processing unit (QPU) architectures. We introduce the six-qubit star lattice architecture that offers parallelism and effective local all-to-all connectivity and thus enables hardware-efficient implementation of certain QEC codes. As a first demonstration of this new architecture, we encode two logical qubits in a six-qubit superconducting QPU with a star-topology using the [[4, 2, 2]] code and characterize the logical states with the classical shadow framework. Logical life-time and logical error rate are measured over repeated quantum error detection cycles for various logical states including a logical Bell state. We measure logical state fidelities above 96 % for every cardinal logical state, find logical life-times above the best physical element, and logical error-per-cycle values ranging from 0.25(2) % to 0.91(3) %. In future, such star QPU can be tiled to enable QEC codes with high-weight and overlapping stabilizers for improved encoding rates.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we have provided exact two-body solutions to the 2D and 3D Schr√∂dinger equations with isotropic van der Waals potentials of the form \(\pm 1/r^6\). Based on these solutions, we developed an analytical quantum defect theory (QDT) applicable to both quasi-2D and 3D geometries, and applied it to study the scattering properties and bound-state spectra of ultracold polar molecules confined in these geometries. Interestingly, we find that in the attractive (repulsive) van der Waals potential case, the short-range interaction can be effectively modeled by an infinite square barrier (finite square well), which leads to narrow and dense (broad and sparse) resonance structures in the quantum defect parameter. In the quasi-2D attractive case, shape resonances can appear in an ordered fashion across different partial waves, characterized by sharp phase jumps as the scattering energy is varied. Furthermore, the low-energy analytical expansions derived from QDT show excellent agreement with the exact numerical results, validating the accuracy and usefulness of our analytical approach in describing two-body physics governed by long-range van der Waals interactions.</p>

It sets a limit on dark photon dark matter at 148 GHz (0.6 meV) that is around 75 times better than previous constraints.

            <p>We propose using highly excited cyclotron states of a trapped electron to detect meV axion and dark photon dark matter, marking a significant improvement over our previous proposal and demonstration [Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 261801]. When the axion mass matches the cyclotron frequency $\omega_c$, the cyclotron state is resonantly excited, with a transition probability proportional to its initial quantum number, $n_c$. The sensitivity is enhanced by taking $n_c \sim 10^6 \left( \frac{0.1~\text{meV}}{\omega_c} \right)^2$. By optimizing key experimental parameters, we minimize the required averaging time for cyclotron detection to $t_{\text{ave}} \sim 10^{-6} $ seconds, permitting detection of such a highly excited state before its decay. An open-endcap trap design enables the external photon signal to be directed into the trap, rendering our background-free detector compatible with large focusing cavities, such as the BREAD proposal, while capitalizing on their strong magnetic fields. Furthermore, the axion conversion rate can be coherently enhanced by incorporating layers of dielectrics with alternating refractive indices within the cavity. Collectively, these optimizations enable us to probe the QCD axion parameter space from 0.1 meV to 2.3 meV (25-560 GHz), covering a substantial portion of the predicted post-inflationary QCD axion mass range. This sensitivity corresponds to probing the kinetic mixing parameter of the dark photon down to $\epsilon \approx 2 \times 10^{-16}$.</p>

            <p>Nuclear spins owe their long-lived magnetic states to their excellent isolation from the environment. At the same time, a finite degree of interaction with their surroundings is necessary for reading and writing the spin state. Therefore, detailed knowledge of and control over the atomic environment of a nuclear spin is key to optimizing conditions for quantum information applications. While various platforms enabled single-shot readout of nuclear spins, their direct environments were either unknown or impossible to controllably modify on the atomic scale. Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM), combined with electron spin resonance (ESR), provides atomic-scale information of individual nuclear spins via the hyperfine interaction. Here, we demonstrate single-shot readout of an individual $^{\text{49}}$Ti nuclear spin with an STM. Employing a pulsed measurement scheme, we find its lifetime to be in the order of seconds. Furthermore, we shed light on the pumping and relaxation mechanisms of the nuclear spin by investigating its response to both ESR driving and tunnelling current, which is supported by model calculations. These findings give an atomic-scale insight into the nature of nuclear spin relaxation and are relevant for the development of atomically assembled qubit platforms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthew R. Hennefarth, Younghwan Kim, Bhavnesh Jangid, Jacob Wardzala, Matthew R. Hermes, Donald G. Truhlar, Laura Gagliardi</p>
            <p>Multiconfiguration pair-density functional theory (MC-PDFT) is a post-MCSCF multireference electronic-structure method that explicitly models strong electron correlation, and linearized pair-density functional theory (L-PDFT) is a recently developed multi-state extension that can accurately model conical intersections and locally-avoided crossings. Because MC-PDFT and L-PDFT rely on an on-top energy functional, their accuracy depends on the quality of the on-top functional used. Recent work has introduced translated meta-gradient-approximation (meta-GA) on-top functionals, and specifically the MC23 hybrid meta-GA on-top functional, which is the first on-top functional specifically optimized for MC-PDFT. Here we report the derivation and implementation of analytic nuclear gradients for MC-PDFT calculations using meta-GA and hybrid meta-GA on-top functionals. This development also enables analytic nuclear gradients for the widely successful tPBE0 hybrid on-top functional. Because MC-PDFT nuclear-gradient calculations involve the derivative of the on-top functional, this development also enables the use of meta-GA on-top functionals in L-PDFT single-point energy calculations. We use the new capabilities to test MC23 for ground-state geometries, excited-state geometries, and vertical excitation energies of s-trans-butadiene and benzophenone as well as to test MC23, another hybrid meta-GA, and seven other meta-GA on-top functionals for 441 vertical excitation energies. We find MC23 performs the best of all nine meta and hybrid meta functionals for vertical excitation energies and is comparable in accuracy to tPBE0 and to the NEVPT2 multireference wave function method. Additionally, we directly compare our MC-PDFT vertical excitation results to previously computed TD-DFT values and find that MC-PDFT outperforms even the best performing Kohn-Sham density functional.</p>

This method inserts random twirling gates into a circuit to reduce errors while preserving unitarity and depth. We apply frame randomization to the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) with $p=1$ on a superconducting quantum circuit system, demonstrating its potential to improve energy calculations. Specifically, we investigate the use of QAOA to calculate the lowest energy state of a frustrated Ising ring system and compare the results of randomized circuits generated using two different randomized techniques. Our results show that both methods can mitigate errors, with expected extremal energy values of $5.25\pm0.145$ and $4.08\pm0.36$, for Randomized Compilation and Pauli frame randomization respectively, compared to $2.63\pm0.068$ without randomization and $5.676\pm0.006$ with a noiseless simulator.</p>

            <h2>Importance of Correlations for Neural Quantum States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fabian D√∂schl, Annabelle Bohrdt</p>
            <p>Neural quantum states (NQS) have emerged as a powerful variational ansatz for representing quantum many-body wave functions. Their internal mechanisms, however, remain poorly understood. We investigate the role of correlations for NQS-like quantum state representation by employing a correlation-based interpretable neural network architecture and thereafter proving our observations based on Boolean function theory. The correlator neural network demonstrates that, even for simple product states, up to all system-size correlation orders in the chosen computational basis are required to represent a quantum state faithfully. We explain these observations using the Fourier expansion, which reveals the correlator basis as the effective basis of the internal NQS structure, the resulting necessity for high-order correlations, potential linear dependencies in constrained Hilbert spaces, and connections between spin basis-rotations and the correlator basis. Furthermore, we analyze how activation functions, network architectures, and choice of reference basis influence correlation requirements. Our results provide new insights and a better understanding of the internal structure and requirements of NQS, enabling a more systematic use of NQS in future research.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tanmoy Pandit, Pritam Chattopadhyay, Kaustav Chatterjee, Varinder Singh</p>
            <p>We investigate a three-level maser quantum thermal machine in which the system-reservoir interaction is modeled via Unruh-DeWitt type coupling, with one or both reservoirs undergoing relativistic motion relative to the working medium. Motion induces Doppler reshaping of the reservoir spectra, modifying energy-exchange rates and enabling operation beyond the Carnot efficiency at finite power. We numerically analyze families of efficiency-power curves and extract the analytic form of a generalized Carnot bound, which recovers the Carnot limit. In addition, Doppler reshaping alters the boundaries between heat-engine and refrigerator operation, making it possible to extract positive work even in the absence of a temperature gradient. These findings establish relativistic motion as a genuine thermodynamic resource.</p>

            <h2>Excitonic Coupling and Photon Antibunching in Venus Yellow Fluorescent Protein Dimers: A Lindblad Master Equation Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ian T. Abrahams</p>
            <p>Strong excitonic coupling and photon antibunching have been observed together in Venus yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) dimers -- a cryptic combination under prevailing theoretical models. In 2019, Kim et al. demonstrated Davydov splitting in Venus dimer circular dichroism (CD) spectra, revealing large negative dimer coupling energy, while antibunching was confirmed by antibunching-fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (AB/FCS fingerprinting). To explain this coexistence, Venus dimer population dynamics are modeled here within a Lindblad master equation framework, justified by the separation of characteristic coupling, dephasing, and thermal relaxation rates. Simulations predict rapid decoherence, consistent with antibunching, indicating that coherence in both the excitonic and site bases is too short-lived to affect photon emission statistics. Despite the absence of long-lived coherence, Venus dimers provide a tractable platform for probing evolutionary pressures on fluorescent protein photophysics and quantum dynamics. Cryogenic cooling could extend coherence lifetimes into the regime required for quantum gate operations, suggesting a route toward fluorescent protein-based qubits. More broadly, the results highlight a structural design principle -- a "bioexciton motif" -- that links excitonic coupling, decoherence, and protein architecture, pointing to general rules by which biology both constrains and inspires quantum technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryotaro Fukuzumi, Kosei Hatakeyama, Daisuke Miki, Kazuhiro Yamamoto</p>
            <p>We analyze the conditional quantum state of a mechanical mirror in an optomechanical system under continuous measurement, feedback control, and quantum filtering. Our study identifies a regime in which the mirror's momentum is squeezed beyond the standard quantum limit achievable through appropriate tuning of the homodyne detection angle. We show that in this regime, optimal filtering effectively realizes a free-particle-like state. Notably, when applied to a setup involving two optomechanical systems, this phenomenon significantly boosts the signal of gravity-induced entanglement (GIE) because the momentum squeezing not only accentuates the difference between the common mode and the differential mode but, when the purity is high, also increases the position uncertainty due to the uncertainty principle, thereby enlarging the spatial extent of the superposition. Our results provide new insights into strategies for verifying the quantum nature of gravity using optomechanical platforms.</p>

            <p>Exploiting quantum features allows for estimating external parameters with precisions well beyond the capacity of classical sensors, a phenomenon known as quantum-enhanced precision. Quantum criticality has been identified as a resource for achieving such enhancements with respect to the probe size. However, they demand complex probe preparation and measurement and the achievable enhancement is ultimately restricted to narrow parameter regimes. On the other hand, non-equilibrium probes harness dynamics, enabling quantum-enhanced precision with respect to time over a wide range of parameters through simple probe initialization. Here, we unify these approaches through a Stark-Wannier localization platform, where competition between a linear gradient field and particle tunneling enables quantum-enhanced sensitivity across an extended parameter regime. The probe is implemented on a 9-qubit superconducting quantum device, in both single- and double-excitation subspaces, where we explore its performance in the extended phase, the critical point and the localized phase. Despite employing only computational-basis measurements we have been able to achieve near-Heisenberg-limited precision by combining outcomes at distinct evolution times. In addition, we demonstrate that the performance of the probe in the entire extended phase is significantly outperforming the performance in the localized regime. Our results highlight Stark-Wannier systems as versatile platforms for quantum sensing, where the combination of criticality and non-equilibrium dynamics enhances precision over a wide range of parameters without stringent measurement requirements.</p>

By injecting current into the chip, we realize a high-performance EPS with a bandwidth of 73 nm and an entanglement pair generation rate of 4.5*10^10 pairs/s/mW. The polarization entanglement shows Bell-state fidelities above 96% across frequency-correlated modes. This compact, integrated EPS enables key applications, including high-speed quantum key distribution via wavelength division multiplexing, satellite-based quantum communication, and entanglement-based quantum metrology.</p>

            <p>We present the experimental realisation of a robust CNOT quantum gate using Majorana zero modes simulated on a photonic platform. Three Kitaev chains supporting Majorana zero modes at their endpoints are used to encode two logical qubits, and both intra-chain and inter-chain braiding operations are performed to implement the CNOT gate. While the topological encoding of quantum information in Majorana fermions does not offer full topological protection in our non-interacting photonic setting, it nevertheless exhibits a natural resilience to the dominant noise and decoherence effects present in the experiment. Consequently, the fidelity of the CNOT gate is significantly enhanced, surpassing 0.992 and addressing a key limitation in the path toward scalable quantum computation. These results represent a major advancement in topological quantum computing with Majorana fermions and underscore the potential of photonic platforms for realising high-fidelity quantum gates.</p>

            <p>Quantum mechanics (QM) and General relativity (GR), also known as the theory of gravity, are the two pillars of modern physics. A matter-wave interferometer with a massive particle can test numerous fundamental ideas, including the spatial superposition principle - a foundational concept in QM - in previously unexplored regimes. It also opens the possibility of probing the interface between QM and GR, such as testing the quantization of gravity. Consequently, there exists an intensive effort to realize such an interferometer. While several approaches are being explored, we focus on utilizing nanodiamonds with embedded spins as test particles which, in combination with Stern-Gerlach forces, enable the realization of a closed-loop matter-wave interferometer in space-time. There is a growing community of groups pursuing this path [1]. We are posting this technical note (as part of a series of seven such notes), to highlight our plans and solutions concerning various challenges in this ambitious endeavor, hoping this will support this growing community. In this work we detail the trapping of a nanodiamond at 10^-8 mbar, which is good enough for the realization of a short-duration Stern-Gerlach interferometer. We describe in detail the cooling we have performed to sub-Kelvin temperatures, and demonstrate that the nanodiamond remains confined within the trap even under high-intensity 1560 nm laser illumination.

            <p>Quantum communication in the microwave regime is set to play an important role in distributed quantum computing and hybrid quantum networks. However, typical superconducting quantum circuits require millikelvin temperatures for operation, which poses a significant challenge for largescale microwave quantum networks. Here, we present a solution to this challenge by demonstrating the successful quantum teleportation of microwave coherent states between two spatially-separated dilution refrigerators over a thermal microwave channel with a temperature of $4$ K. We distribute two-mode squeezed states over the noisy channel and employ the resulting quantum entanglement for quantum teleportation of coherent states with fidelities of $72.3 \pm 0.5 ~\%$ at $1$ K and $59.9 \pm 2.5 ~\%$ at $4$ K, exceeding the no-cloning and classical communication thresholds, respectively. We successfully model the teleportation protocol using a Gaussian operator formalism that includes losses and noise. This analysis shows that the teleportation infidelity mainly stems from a parasitic heating of the cold quantum nodes due to the hot network connection. Our results prove the experimental feasibility of distributed superconducting architectures and motivate practical applications of noisy quantum networks in various frequency regimes.</p>

            <h2>Exploring the Interplay Between Quantum Entanglement and Decoherence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samuel Marquez Gonzalez</p>
            <p>Quantum entanglement manifests as a distinctive correlation between particles that transcends classical boundaries when their quantum states cannot be described independently. On the other hand, as quantum systems interact with their surroundings, decoherence emerges, leading to the gradual decay of quantum coherence and entanglement. In the case of entanglement, this is known as entanglement sudden death (ESD). Decoherence mechanisms are examined, focusing on how various environmental factors, such as thermal, electromagnetic, and collisional decoherence, influence the integrity of entangled states. The role of quantum noise, such as amplitude damping, phase damping, and depolarizing, is also analyzed. By integrating theoretical insights with experimental findings, this study highlights the delicate balance between maintaining entanglement and mitigating decoherence. The findings have significant implications for the development of quantum technologies, including quantum computing and quantum communication, where preserving entanglement is crucial for achieving robust and reliable performance.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Po-Han Tseng, Yong-Fan Chen</p>
            <p>Quantum memories are indispensable for quantum repeater networks, deterministic generation of single- or multi-photon states, and linear optical quantum computing. Although experiments have demonstrated that electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) quantum memories can store entangled photons, a definitive theoretical framework verifying the preservation of entanglement and nonlocality has not been rigorously established. Here, we develop a comprehensive model by integrating the dark-state polariton framework with reduced-density-operator theory to derive the retrieved density operator under realistic ground-state decoherence conditions. Our analysis reveals that decoherence inevitably causes probe photon loss, converting a Bell state into a mixed state. Crucially, we predict a critical storage efficiency threshold of 89.7%. Only when this threshold is exceeded does the retrieved probe photon state violate the Clauser-Horne inequality, thereby preserving nonlocality; below this point, nonlocal correlations vanish. Moreover, our theory shows that multiple spatially separated EIT memories can cooperatively store and retrieve N-qubit entangled states encoded in photon number, path, and polarization with near-unity fidelity in the ideal limit. This work bridges a long-standing theoretical gap and lays a solid foundation for the application of EIT memories in scalable quantum networks and quantum information processing.</p>

            <p>Investigating physical models with photonic synthetic dimensions has been generating great interest in vast fields of science. The rapid developing thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) platform, for its numerous advantages including high electro-optic coefficient and scalability, is well compatible with the realization of synthetic dimensions in the frequency together with spatial domain. While coupling resonators with fixed beam splitters is a common experimental approach, it often lacks tunability and limits coupling between adjacent lattices to sites occupying the same frequency domain positions. Here, on the contrary, we conceive the resonator arrays connected by electro-optic tunable Mach-Zehnder interferometers in our configuration instead of fixed beam splitters. By applying bias voltage and RF modulation on the interferometers, our design extends such coupling to long-range scenario and allows for continuous tuning on each coupling strength and synthetic effective magnetic flux. Therefore, our design enriches controllable coupling types that are essential for building programmable lattice networks and significantly increases versatility. As the example, we experimentally fabricate a two-resonator prototype on the TFLN platform, and on this single chip we realize well-known models including tight-binding lattices, topological Hall ladder and Creutz ladder. We directly observe the band structures in the quasi-momentum space and important phenomena such as spin-momentum locking and the Aharonov-Bohm cage effect. These results demonstrate the potential for convenient simulations of more complex models in our configuration.</p>

            <p>A chiral supersolid is a quantum phase that simultaneously exhibits crystalline order, superfluidity, and topological spin texture, with spontaneously broken translational, U(1) gauge, and chiral symmetries. Here, we demonstrate a chiral supersolid with tunable non-equilibrium dynamics in a spin-orbit coupled dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate. By adjusting dipolar interaction and spin-orbit coupling, we uncover two distinct quantum phase transitions: (i) a first-order transition from a single skyrmion superfluid to a triangular meron supersolid, and (ii) a second-order transition from this superfluid to a square skyrmion supersolid. These phases are characterized by their lattice symmetries, nonclassical rotational inertia, and spin textures. Under parity-time symmetric dissipation, we predict phase-dependent damping of the current oscillations, directly linked to the superfluid fraction. The predicted chiral supersolid phase can be experimentally observed in ultracold magnetic atoms with spin-orbit coupling. Our results establish dipolar quantum gases as a platform for designing topological matter with spintronic functionality.</p>

            <p>Spin defects in two-dimensional materials are a promising platform for quantum sensing. Simulating the defect's optical response and optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) contrast is key to identifying suitable candidates. However, existing simulation methods are typically unable to supply the required accuracy. Here, we propose two quantum algorithms to detect an imbalance in the triplet-to-singlet intersystem crossing (ISC) rates between excited states with the same and different spin projections -- a necessary condition for nonzero ODMR response. The lowest-cost approach evaluates whether the evolution of an $S=0$ state under the spin-orbit coupling induces ISC to $S=1$, and also whether there is an imbalance in its intensity depending on the final state spin projection. The second approach works by comparing the emission spectrum of a spin defect with and without the spin-orbit coupling operator, inferring ISC intensity for different spin transition channels from spectrum intensity changes. Additionally, we present an improved scheme to evaluate the defect's optical response, building upon previous work. We study these quantum algorithms in the context of the negatively charged boron vacancy in hexagonal boron nitride. We generate an embedded active space of 18 spatial orbitals using quantum defect embedding theory (QDET) and show that the ISC rate imbalance can be detected with as few as 105 logical qubits and $2.2 \times 10^8$ Toffoli gates. By avoiding direct and costly rate calculations, our methods enable faster screening of candidate defects for ODMR activity, advancing the prospect of using quantum simulations to aid the development of high-performing sensing devices.</p>

            <p>In a phononic quantum network, quantum information is stored and processed within stationary nodes defined by solid-state spins, and the information is routed between nodes by phonons. The phonon holds distinct advantages over its electromagnetic counterpart the photon, including smaller device footprints, reduced crosstalk, long coherence times at low temperatures, and strong interactions with both solid-state spins and electromagnetic waves. Enhanced interactions between a phononic cavity and a stationary qubit have been demonstrated in multiple platforms including superconducting qubits, spins in silicon carbide and spins in diamond. However, an outstanding issue is the compatibility between the spin's coupling to the resonant phononic cavity and the simultaneous use of pulse sequences to extend the coherence time of the spin by suppressing the low-frequency environmental noise. Here we demonstrate all-mechanical coherence protection of a solid-state spin qubit, where optical initialization, quantum operations, and readout are performed in a dressed basis that is highly immune to low-frequency noise and compatible with a phononic cavities. We additionally show record-high Rabi frequencies reaching 800 MHz, which allows for ultrafast quantum control.

Using the truncated Wigner approximation, we explore how multi-photon drives shape the interplay between quantum fluctuations, nonlinear interactions, and dissipative processes in such quantum systems. We identify two main regimes: a chaotic hydrodynamic regime characterized by the restoration of a local $\mathbb{U}(1)$ symmetry, photon saturation due to Kerr nonlinearity, and spatial prethermalization effects; and a non-chaotic resonant nonlinear wave (RNW) regime exhibiting sub-Poissonian photon statistics, persistent $\mathbb{Z}_n$ symmetry, and quantum-driven phase decoherence. Our findings reveal the universal nature of the hydrodynamic regime and highlight the RNW regime's sensitivity to boundary driving conditions, suggesting novel routes for quantum state engineering in driven-dissipative quantum devices.

We present quantitative analytical and numerical results on both the revival probability and time, and demonstrate that the system indeed returns arbitrarily close to its initial state in a time exponential in the number of qubits $N$. The revival times become astronomically large for systems with just a few tens of qubits.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jia-Jin Feng, Quntao Zhuang</p>
            <p>Random quantum states are essential for various applications in quantum information science. Prior approaches of generating genuine random states rely on a large bath to thermalize the system, such that a subsequent measurement on the bath post-selects a random state for the system. To reduce the size of the required bath, we propose an alternative approach based on holographic deep thermalization driven by Hamiltonian evolution, combined with mid-circuit measurements. By trading spatial and time resources, our approach achieves genuine randomness with a bath of constant size that is independent of the system size. We quantify randomness with the frame potential and analyze its dynamics throughout the evolution. Given a total evolution time, as we increase the number of mid-circuit measurements, the frame potential initially decreases exponentially with the number of measurements, due to the mechanism of holographic deep thermalization. Past a critical number of mid-circuit measurements, the frame potential rises again, signaling the onset of the quantum Zeno effect. We provide analytical results for the asymptotic behavior of the frame potential, which are in good agreement with the numerical simulations. Our findings offer practical guidance for generating Haar-random ensembles through Hamiltonian evolution and controlled measurement.</p>

            <h2>Quantum state engineering of maximally entangled photon pairs by path identity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Richard Bernecker, Baghdasar Baghdasaryan, Stephan Fritzsche</p>
            <p>Cutting-edge quantum technologies lean on sources of high-dimensional entangled states (HDES) that reliably prepare high-fidelity target states. The idea to overlap photon paths from distinct but indistinguishable sources was recently introduced for the creation of HDES, known as entanglement by path identity. In this regard, the use of orbital angular momentum (OAM) modes is promising, as they offer a high-dimensional and discrete Hilbert space to encode information. While entanglement by path identity with OAM has been verified experimentally, a detailed investigation of how the OAM distribution of photon pairs can be engineered to maximize the entanglement is lacking. We address this gap and identify an optimal dimensionality for maximally entangled states (MESs) when the spatial engineering of pump beam and the path identity approach are combined. Our theoretical study reveals notable limitations for the fidelity of high-dimensional target states and also establishes their equivalence to entangled biphoton states pumped by a spatially engineered beam. These findings constitute a valuable step toward the optimized preparation of MESs in high dimensions.</p>

            <h2>Accurate and Scalable Simulation of Cavity-Based Networks in Modular Quantum Architectures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sahar Ben Rached, Zezhou Sun, Guilu Long, Santiago Rodrigo, Carmen G. Almud√©ver, Eduard Alarc√≥n, Sergi Abadal</p>
            <p>Cavity-mediated interconnects are a promising platform for scaling modular quantum computers by enabling high-fidelity inter-chip quantum state transmission and entanglement generation. In this work, we first model the dynamics of deterministic inter-chip quantum state transfer using the Stimulated Raman Adiabatic Passage (STIRAP) protocol, analyzing fidelity loss mechanisms under experimentally achievable qubit-cavity coupling and decoherence parameters. We then extend the NetSquid simulator, typically used for simulating long-range quantum communication networks, to support cavity-based communication channels for mediating inter-chip state transfer and entanglement generation. We model cavities as amplitude damping channels parameterized by physical system characteristics; cavity decay rate k and qubit-cavity coupling strength g, and analyze the impact of intrinsic qubit decoherence factors dictated by T1 and T2 times. Our simulations accurately represent the system's dynamics in both strong and weak coupling regimes, and identify critical trade-offs between fidelity, latency, and noise factors. The proposed framework supports faithful modeling and scalable simulation of modular architectures, and provides insights into design optimization for practical quantum network implementations.</p>

            <h2>Extracting pairs of time-bin entangled photons from resonance fluorescence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xin-Xin Hu, Gabriele Maron, Luke Masters, Arno Rauschenbeutel, J√ºrgen Volz</p>
            <p>Photon-photon entanglement and photon antibunching are fundamental manifestations of the quantum nature of optical light fields, but are typically regarded as distinct phenomena. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that pairs of narrow-band time-bin entangled photons can be naturally extracted from resonance fluorescence. We split the collected fluorescence of a single trapped atom on a 50 : 50 beamsplitter, resulting in strong temporal correlations between photons at the beamsplitter outputs. A time-bin coincidence between the two output modes then projects their state onto a maximally entangled Bell state. This entanglement is evidenced by violating the CHSH-Bell inequality as well as by reconstructing the density matrix of the photon pair. Importantly, we show that the entanglement persists both for weak and strong excitation of the emitter. Our results establish resonance fluorescence as an efficient source of time-bin entangled photon pairs, i.e., a practical and scalable resource for quantum communication and photonic quantum technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Italo L. Soares Andrade, Kleber Pirota, Amir O. Caldeira, Francisco Rouxinol</p>
            <p>We report the observation of the Purcell effect in a cavity-metallic magnet hybrid system using electric-field-mediated coupling. In this configuration, microwave-induced axial currents in the microwire induce circular magnetic fields that drive the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) of the magnetized microwire. Field-dependent transmission and reflection spectroscopies reveal a clear cavity perturbation consistent with the Purcell regime, in which the magnetic loss rate exceeds the light-matter coupling strength. Despite the small magnetic volume ($\sim 10^{-13}\,\text{m}^3$), measurements performed at both room temperature and $T = 7$ mK show coupling rates as high as $g/2pi = 56$ MHz, one order of magnitude stronger than the one expected from conventional coupling at the magnetic antinode. Time-domain ringdown measurements directly show the magnetic-field-dependent modification of the cavity photon lifetime, in agreement with theoretical predictions. These results establish a versatile approach for coupling microwave fields to metallic magnets via geometric and electric-field-mediated interactions, opening new opportunities for hybrid cavity-magnet systems.</p>

            <h2>Detecting Many-Body Scars from Fisher Zeros</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuchen Meng, Songtai Lv, Yang Liu, Zefan Tan, Erhai Zhao, Haiyuan Zou</p>
            <p>The far-from-equilibrium dynamics of certain interacting quantum systems still defy precise understanding. One example is the so-called quantum many-body scars (QMBSs), where a set of energy eigenstates evade thermalization to give rise to long-lived oscillations. Despite the success of viewing scars from the perspectives of symmetry, commutant algebra, and quasiparticles, it remains a challenge to elucidate the mechanism underlying all QMBS and to distinguish them from other forms of ergodicity breaking. In this work, we introduce an alternative route to detect and diagnose QMBS based on Fisher zeros, i.e., the patterns of zeros of the analytically continued partition function $Z$ on the complex $\beta$ (inverse temperature) plane. For systems with scars, a continuous line of Fisher zeros will appear off the imaginary $\beta$ axis and extend upward, separating the $\beta$ plane into regions with distinctive thermalization behaviors. This conjecture is motivated from interpreting the complex $Z$ as the return amplitude of the thermofield double state, and it is validated by analyzing two models with QMBS, the $\bar{P}X\bar{P}$ model and the Ising chain in external fields. These models also illustrate the key difference between QMBS and strong ergodicity breaking including their distinctive renormalization group flows on the complex $\beta$ plane. This ``statistical mechanics" approach places QMBS within the same framework of thermal and dynamical phase transitions. It has the advantage of spotting scars without exhaustively examining each individual quantum state.</p>

            <h2>Non-Hermitian Hopf insulators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daichi Nakamura, Kohei Kawabata</p>
            <p>Hopf insulators represent a unique class of topological insulators that exist exclusively in two-band systems and are inherently unstable upon the inclusion of additional bands. Meanwhile, recent studies have shown that non-Hermiticity gives rise to distinctive complex-energy gap structures, known as point gaps, and associated topological phases with no analogs in Hermitian systems. However, non-Hermitian counterparts of Hopf insulators have remained largely elusive. Here, we generally classify topological phases of two-band non-Hermitian systems based on the homotopy theory and uncover Hopf-type point-gap topology present only for two bands. Specifically, we reveal such Hopf-type point-gap topology for three-dimensional systems with chiral symmetry (class AIII) and four-dimensional systems with no symmetry (class A). Explicitly constructing prototypical models from the Hermitian Hopf insulator, we further demonstrate that these non-Hermitian topological phases lead to anomalous point-gapless boundary states spectrally detachable from the bulk bands.</p>

            <h2>Comparative study of the butterfly velocity in holographic QCD models at finite temperature and chemical potential</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nikesh Lilani, Dilpreet Sandhu, Subhash Mahapatra</p>
            <p>In this work, we study quantum chaos in a variety of holographic QCD models at finite temperature and chemical potentials. This includes the 1 R-Charge black hole (1RCBH) model, the 2 R-Charge black hole (2RCBH) model, a potential reconstruction-based analytic bottom-up model, and a numerical bottom-up model. All these models are different avatars of the Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity action, distinguished by their specific choices of dilaton potentials and gauge-kinetic coupling functions. We focus on computing the chaos parameter, the butterfly velocity, using three distinct methods: entanglement wedge reconstruction, out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), and pole-skipping. We show that all three methods yield identical results for the butterfly velocity across all the holographic QCD models considered, further establishing the equivalence between the three approaches. Furthermore, we analyze in detail the behavior of the butterfly velocity as a function of chemical potential and temperature. Interestingly, a universal trend emerges across all models: the butterfly velocity increases/decreases with temperature/chemical potential for thermodynamically stable phases. Additionally, in the high-temperature limit, the butterfly velocity in all models approaches that of the chargeless plasma.</p>

            <h2>One, Two, Three: One empirical evaluation of a two-copy shadow tomography scheme with triple efficiency</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Viet T. Tran, Richard Kueng</p>
            <p>Shadow tomography protocols have recently emerged as powerful tools for efficient quantum state learning, aiming to reconstruct expectation values of observables with fewer resources than traditional quantum state tomography. For the particular case of estimating Pauli observables, entangling two-copy measurement schemes can offer an exponential improvement in sample complexity over any single-copy strategy conceivable [1, Huang, Kueng, Preskill, PRL(2021)]. A recent refinement of these ideas by King et al. [2, King, Gosset, Kothari, Babbush, SODA (2025)] does not only achieve polynomial sample complexity, but also maintains reasonable computational demands and utilizes joint measurements on only a small constant number of state copies. This `triple efficiency' is achievable for any subset of $n$-qubit Pauli observables, whereas single-copy strategies can only be efficient if the Pauli observables have advantageous structure. In this work, we complement existing theoretical performance guarantees with the empirical evaluation of triply efficient shadow tomography using classical, noise-free simulations. Our findings indicate that the empirical sample complexity aligns closely with theoretical predictions for stabilizer states and, notably, demonstrates slightly improved scaling for random Gibbs states compared to established theoretical bounds. In addition, we improve a central subroutine in the triply-efficient shadow protocol by leveraging insights from a refined quantum and quantum-inspired convex optimization algorithm [3, Henze et al. arXiv:2502.15426 (2025)]. To summarize, our empirical sample complexity studies of triply efficient shadow tomography not only confirm existing theoretical scaling behavior, but also showcase that the actual constants involved are comparatively benign. Hence, this protocol has the potential to also be very sample-efficient in practice.</p>

            <h2>Inducing macroscopic cat states of nonequilibrium electrons via cat-state light irradiation and projective measurements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shohei Imai</p>

Here we investigate the quantum dynamics of N independent two-level electrons interacting with Schr√∂dinger cat or kitten states of light. Without measurement, a macroscopic cat state of electrons appears only in an ultrashort time window. In contrast, we demonstrate that photon-number parity or quadrature projective measurements can restore a macroscopic cat state in nonequilibrium electrons, even in the thermodynamic limit. These dynamics are captured by an external-field approximation, in which the electronic system evolves into a Rabi-oscillation cat state. Our results highlight the need for precise quantum measurement techniques for light to control macroscopic quantum states of matter driven by quantum light.</p>

            <h2>Harvesting Contextuality from the Vacuum</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Philip A. LeMaitre</p>
            <p>Quantum contextuality is the notion that certain measurement scenarios do not admit a global description of their statistics and has been implicated as the source of quantum advantage in a number of quantum information protocols. It has been shown that contextuality generalizes the concepts of non-local entanglement and magic, and is an equivalent notion of non-classicality to Wigner negativity. In this paper, the protocol of contextuality harvesting is introduced and it is shown that Unruh-DeWitt models are capable of harvesting quantum contextuality from the vacuum of a massless scalar quantum field. In particular, it is shown that gapless systems can be made to harvest contextuality given a suitable choice of measurements. The harvested contextuality is also seen to behave similarly to harvested magic and can be larger in magnitude for specific parameter regimes. An Unruh-DeWitt qubit-qutrit system is also investigated, where it is shown that certain tradeoffs exist between the harvested contextuality of the qutrit and the harvested entanglement between the systems, and that there are harvesting regimes where the two resources can both be present. Some of the tools of contextuality, namely the contextual fraction, are also imported and used as general harvesting measures for any form of contextuality, including non-local entanglement and magic. Additionally, new criteria for genuine harvesting are put forward that also apply to individual systems, revealing new permissible harvesting parameter regimes.</p>

            <p>Simulating vibrational dynamics is essential for understanding molecular structure, unlocking useful applications such as vibrational spectroscopy for high-fidelity chemical detection. Quantum algorithms for vibrational dynamics are emerging as a promising alternative to resource-demanding classical approaches, but this domain is largely underdeveloped compared to quantum simulations of electronic structure. In this work, we describe in detail three distinct forms of the vibrational Hamiltonian: canonical bosonic quantization, real space representation, and the Christiansen second-quantized form. Leveraging Lie algebraic properties of each, we develop efficient fragmentation schemes to enable the use of Trotter product formulas for simulating time evolution. We introduce circuits required to implement time evolution in each form, and highlight factors that contribute to the simulation cost, including the choice of vibrational coordinates. Using a perturbative approach for the Trotter error, we obtain tight estimates of T gate cost for the simulation of time evolution in each form, enabling their quantitative comparison. Combining tight Trotter error estimates and efficient fragmentation schemes, we find that for the medium-sized CH$_4$ molecule with 9 vibrational modes, time evolution for approximately 1.8 ps may be simulated using as little as 36 qubits and approximately $3 \times 10^{8}$ T gates -- an order-of-magnitude speedup over prior-art algorithms. Finally, we present calculations of vibrational spectra using each form to demonstrate the fidelity of our algorithms. This work presents a unified and highly optimized framework that makes simulating vibrational dynamics an attractive use case for quantum computers.</p>

            <p>We address the challenge of multi-target quantum optimization, where the objective is to simultaneously optimize multiple cost functions defined over the same quantum search space. To accelerate optimization and reduce quantum resource usage, we investigate a range of strategies that enable knowledge transfer between related tasks. Specifically, we introduce a two-stage framework consisting of a training phase where solutions are progressively shared across tasks and an inference phase, where unoptimized targets are initialized based on prior optimized ones. We propose and evaluate several methods, including warm-start initialization, parameter estimation via first-order Taylor expansion, hierarchical clustering with D-level trees, and deep learning-based transfer. Our experimental results, using parameterized quantum circuits implemented with PennyLane, demonstrate that transfer techniques significantly reduce the number of required iterations while maintaining an acceptable cost value. These findings highlight the promise of multi-target generalization in quantum optimization pipelines and provide a foundation for scalable multi-target quantum optimization.</p>

            <h2>Dynamical Phase Transitions in Open Quantum Walks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stefano Longhi</p>
            <p>Dynamical phase transitions in the relaxation behavior of stochastic quantum walks are investigated, focusing on systems where coherent unitary evolution is periodically interrupted by dephasing. This interplay leads to a classicalization of the dynamics, effectively described by non-equilibrium Markovian processes that can violate detailed balance. As a result, such systems exhibit a richer and more complex spectral structure than their equilibrium counterparts. Extending recent insights from classical Markov dynamics [G. Teza {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 130}, 207103 (2023)], we demonstrate that these quantum-classical hybrid systems can host not only first-order dynamical phase transitions -- characterized by eigenvalue crossings -- but also second-order transitions marked by the coalescence of eigenvalues and eigenvectors at exceptional points. We analyze two paradigmatic models: a quantum walk on a ring under gauge fields and a walk on a finite line with internal degrees of freedom, both exhibiting distinct mechanisms for breaking detailed balance. These findings reveal a novel class of critical behavior in open quantum systems, where decoherence-induced classicalization enables access to non-Hermitian spectral phenomena. Beyond their fundamental interest, our results offer promising implications for quantum technologies, including quantum simulation, error mitigation, and the engineering of controllable non-equilibrium quantum states.</p>

            <h2>Unified quantification of entanglement and magic in information scrambling and their trade-off relationship</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mao Kaneyasu, Yoshihiko Hasegawa</p>
            <p>Information scrambling is a phenomenon observed in a wide range of quantum systems, in which initially localized information becomes distributed across the entire system. Clarifying the essence of this phenomenon is made possible by quantum resource theory, which provides an axiomatic framework for quantifying various forms of quantumness. Within this framework, information scrambling can be classified into two distinct types: entanglement scrambling and magic scrambling. Although each has been analyzed individually through their respective resource theories, such separate treatments fail to capture the inherent trade-off between them. In this study, we introduce a unified measure of the two types of scrambling, grounded in resource-theoretic principles. This unified approach reveals a rigorous trade-off relationship between entanglement and magic scrambling, as the exact maximum value of the proposed measure can be derived analytically. Furthermore, we quantify the scrambling capability of unitary transformations in terms of their ability to amplify this measure.</p>

Our emphasis is not only on whether or not there is such an enhancement, but also on whether or not any enhancement can be reasonably detected in an experiment. We begin by developing a model that includes radiative and nonradiative broadening to calculate the total scattered and absorbed energy. As an example calculation, we consider cesium atoms in a magneto-optical trap, and evaluate the fluorescence emission when driven by non-degenerate classical and squeezed light, in both the continuous-wave and pulsed regimes. We find that squeezed light can provide an enhancement in both regimes under ideal circumstances. These enhancements are in principle detectable. However, we stress that they are moderate at best compared to recently reported values for molecular systems.</p>

            <p>Reliable and robust control lies at the core of implementing quantum information processing with diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers. However, control pulses inevitably introduce multiple errors, leading to decoherence and hindering scalable applications. Here, we experimentally report an experiment-friendly multiple-noise-resilient nonadiabatic geometric quantum gate~(MNR-NGQG) that can significantly improve conventional dynamical gate in both robustness and coherence. Notably, even when the detuning fluctuation range is comparable to the maximum Rabi frequency, the single-qubit gate performance of the MNR-NGQG remains almost unchanged. Besides, the coherence time of the electron spin is significantly extended to 690 $\pm$ 30 $ \mu$s, 3.5 times that of the naive dynamical counterpart. As a result, the fidelity of single-qubit gates reaches 0.9992(1), as characterized by quantum process tomography. With its experimentally feasible design and relaxed hardware requirements, our work offers a solid paradigm for achieving high-fidelity quantum control in NV center system, paving the way for practical applications in quantum information science.</p>

We show how Qiskit facilitates hybrid classical-quantum workflows and enables the deployment of algorithms on physical quantum hardware through error mitigation and modular integration approaches. Our exploration covers several key applications, including quantum key distribution, climate simulation, and quantum-enhanced portfolio optimization, while providing practical insights into their implementation. This work also covers the framework's technical structure and current limitations associated with scalability and reproducibility.

It is shown that these criteria can identify certain $k$-nonstretchable states, and their practical applicability and advantages are illustrated through specific examples.</p>

The core difficulty lies in the fact that when acting such a map $\mathcal{N}$ on a state $\rho$, $\mathcal{N}(\rho)$ may not correspond to a valid density matrix, making it difficult to prepare directly in a physical system. We introduce Block Encoding of Linear Transformation (BELT), a systematic protocol that simulates arbitrary linear maps by embedding the output $\mathcal{N}(\rho)$ into a block of a unitary operator. BELT enables the manipulation and extraction of information about $\mathcal{N}(\rho)$ through coherent quantum evolution. Notably, BELT accommodates maps that fall outside the scope of quantum singular value transformation, such as the transpose map. BELT finds applications in entanglement detection, quantum channel inversion, and simulating pseudo-differential operators, and demonstrates improved sample complexity compared to protocols based on Hermitian-preserving map exponentiation.</p>

            <h2>Generalized quantum Chernoff bound</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kun Fang</p>
            <p>We establish a generalized quantum Chernoff bound for the discrimination of multiple sets of quantum states, thereby extending the classical and quantum Chernoff bounds to the general setting of composite and correlated quantum hypotheses. Specifically, we consider the task of distinguishing whether a quantum system is prepared in a state from one of several convex, compact sets of quantum states, each of which may exhibit arbitrary correlations. Assuming their stability under tensor product, we prove that the optimal error exponent for discrimination is precisely given by the regularized quantum Chernoff divergence between the sets. Furthermore, leveraging minimax theorems, we show that discriminating between sets of quantum states is no harder than discriminating between their worst-case elements in terms of error probability. This implies the existence of a universal optimal test that achieves the minimum error probability for all states in the sets, matching the performance of the optimal test for the most challenging states. We provide explicit characterizations of the universal optimal test in the binary composite case. Finally, we show that the maximum overlap between a pure state and a set of free states, a quantity that frequently arises in quantum resource theories, is equal to the quantum Chernoff divergence between the sets, thereby providing an operational interpretation of this quantity in the context of symmetric hypothesis testing.</p>

            <h2>Modified security analysis of device-independent quantum key distribution with random key basis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sawan Bhattacharyya, Turbasu Chatterjee, Pankaj Agrawal, Prasenjit Deb</p>
            <p>Security analysis is a critical part in any cryptographic protocol, may it be classical or quantum. Without security analysis, one cannot ensure the secrecy of the distributed keys. To perform a conclusive security analysis, it is very often necessary to frame the problem as an optimization problem. However, solving such optimization problems is quite challenging. In this article, we focus on the security analysis of device-independent quantum key distribution (DIQKD) with random key basis protocol. We show that the optimization cost of the existing security analysis can be reduced without compromising the key rate. In particular, we reframe the entire security analysis of this protocol as a strongly convex optimization problem and demonstrate that unlike the original security proof, optimization of Bob's measurement angles for finding a lower bound on Eve's uncertainty about Alice's key generation basis can be done with lesser cost. We derive an explicit form of the pessimistic error that arises while optimizing the measurement angles of both the parties. We also clarify a few parts of the original security proof, making the analysis more rigorous and complete.</p>

            <p>We consider an example scenario where we require several copies of a pure quantum state $|\psi\rangle$ for some quantum information processing task. Due to practical limitations, we only have access to $N = 10^3$ depolarized copies of $|\psi\rangle$ such that the fidelity $F$ of each copy with $|\psi\rangle$ is $0.75$. We denote this quantum asset with the ensemble $\mathcal{A}: (10^3, 0.75)_{|\psi\rangle}$. A genie appears and offers to trade $\mathcal{A}$ with either $\mathcal{B}: (10^4, 0.65)_{|\psi\rangle}$ or with $\mathcal{C}: (10^2, 0.90)_{|\psi\rangle}$. Should we accept the trade with either of these two ensembles? In this article, we attempt to answer this question with arbitrary $N$ and $F$. More specifically, we derive resource equivalence curves from quantum resource theory of purity, quantum state distinguishability, quantum state purification, and quantum state tomography. These curves enable ranking of these ensembles according to their operational usefulness for these tasks and allow us to answer the question of trading the aforementioned ensembles.</p>

            <h2>Dynamic syndrome decoder in volume-law phases of hybrid quantum circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dawid Paszko, Marcin Szyniszewski, Arijeet Pal</p>
            <p>Phases of matter with volume-law entanglement are frequently observed in quantum circuits and have numerous applications, ranging from deepening our understanding of quantum mechanics to advancements in quantum computing and cryptography. Their capacity to host entangled, complex quantum information is complemented by their ability to efficiently obscure it from quantum measurements through scrambling, reminiscent of quantum error-correction. However, the issue of initial-state decodability has primarily been studied in measurement-only models with area-law phases, which limit the entanglement of the encoded state. In this work, we introduce a class of Clifford circuits in one and two dimensions that feature a decodable volume law phase, allowing for information retrieval in logarithmic circuit depths. We present the Sign-Color Decoder that tracks stabilizers revealing the initial state, akin to monitoring a dynamically-changing syndrome for error-correcting codes. We demonstrate this approach in scenarios where error locations are either known or unknown to the decoder, and we provide new insights about the relationship between the decodability transition and measurement-induced phase transition. We propose that this decodability transition is universal across various settings, including different circuit geometries. Our findings pave the way for using volume law states as encoders with mid-circuit measurements, opening potential applications in quantum error correction and quantum cryptography.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Phase Estimation Beyond the Gaussian Limit</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kimin Park, Tanjung Krisnanda, Yvonne Gao, Radim Filip</p>
            <p>Quantum metrology aims to enhance measurement precision beyond the standard quantum limit (SQL), the benchmark set by classical resources, enabling advances in sensing, imaging, and fundamental physics. A critical milestone beyond the SQL is surpassing the Gaussian bound -- the fundamental precision limit achievable with any Gaussian state, such as optimally squeezed states. Certain non-Gaussian states, specifically asymmetric superpositions of coherent states (SCS) and superpositions of a vacuum and a Fock state (ON states), can outperform this Gaussian bound within an intermediate energy range. In particular, asymmetric SCS emerge as a highly practical resource for near-term quantum sensing architectures operating beyond the Gaussian limit due to their efficient preparation and processing via a constant-complexity protocol. Our comprehensive analysis under realistic loss, noise, and detection schemes quantifies the critical trade-off between achievable precision and the operational range of the non-Gaussian advantage. This work sheds light on the fundamental impact of non-Gaussianity and asymmetry on metrological tasks, and offers insights on how to leverage such resources in realistic near-term quantum enhanced sensors beyond the Gaussian limit.</p>

            <h2>Driven-Dissipative Interpretation of Measurement-Induced State Transitions Beyond Semiclassical Predictions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bo-Syun Pan, Yen-Hsiang Lin, Chiao-Hsuan Wang</p>
            <p>Dispersive readout plays a central role in superconducting quantum computing, enabling quantum nondemolition (QND) measurements of qubits through a coupled microwave resonator. However, under strong readout drives, multi-photon resonances can cause measurement-induced state transition (MIST), resulting in qubit leakage out of the computational subspace and compromising the QND character. We present a driven-dissipative interpretation of MIST using a reduced quantum model that captures the dynamics and entanglement structure underlying the breakdown of QND measurement, a feature inaccessible to previous semiclassical treatments. A super-MIST regime under strong drive is uncovered, characterized by steady-state qubit inversion and slow relaxation beyond the semiclassical Landau-Zener predictions. We further identify a transient readout condition in which the resonator becomes highly populated while the qubit remains near its original state. These results are broadly applicable to superconducting qubits such as fluxonium and transmon, unveil the nonequilibrium dynamics of MIST, and highlight strongly driven regimes that can be leveraged for measurement optimization.</p>

            <p>Reducing the size and complexity of high-performance timekeeping devices is an ever-growing need for various applications, such as 6G wireless technology, positioning, navigation and timing (PNT), Internet of Things (IoT), and ultrafast spectroscopy. This work presents a distributed feedback (DFB) laser-pumped Rb atomic clock, which features extraordinary frequency stability, small size and low power consumption. The DFB laser head employs a built-in isolator with a linewidth of approximately 1 MHz. For complete optical pumping of the atoms in the absorption cell, the laser beam is expanded to a diameter of 10 mm by using an optical diffuser-based beam expander. The physics package is based on a magnetron microwave cavity and surrounded by two layers of magnetic shielding. The overall volume of the optical system combined with the physics package is 250 cm$^3$. The proposed atomic clock is also designed to operate at a low temperature, whose absorption cell is maintained at 323 K. Benefiting from the lower Rb atom density, the excited atoms present a long population relaxation time of 5.8 ms. The frequency synthesizer and frequency-locked loop are implemented by digital circuits. The short-term stability of the atomic clock is measured to be $1.8\times10^{-12}\tau ^{-1/2}$ (1-100s). Our achievement paves the way for practical application of the laser-pumped Rb atomic clocks.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement harvesting and curvature of entanglement: A modular operator approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rupak Chatterjee</p>
            <p>An operator-algebraic framework based on Tomita-Takesaki modular theory is used to study aspects of quantum entanglement via the application of the modular conjugation operator $J$. The entanglement structure of quantum fields is studied through the protocol of entanglement harvesting whereby by quantum correlations evolve through the time evolution of qubit detectors coupled to a Bosonic field. Modular conjugation operators are constructed for Unruh-Dewitt type qubits interacting with a scalar field such that initially unentangled qubits become entangled. The entanglement harvested in this process is directly quantified by an expectation value involving $J$ offering a physical application of this operator. The modular operator formalism is then extended to the Markovian open system dynamics of coupled qubits by expressing entanglement monotones as functionals of a state $\rho$ and its modular reflection $J\rho J$. The second derivative of such functionals with respect to an external coupling parameter, termed the curvature of entanglement, provides a natural measure of entanglement sensitivity. At points of modular self-duality, the curvature of entanglement coincides with the quantum Fisher information measure. These results demonstrate that the modular conjugation operator $J$ captures both the harvesting of entanglement from quantum fields and the curvature of entanglement in coupled qubit dynamics providing parallel modular structures that connect these systems.</p>

            <p>In previous works, we showed that both time and space can emerge from entanglement within a globally constrained quantum Universe, with no background coordinates. By extending the Page and Wootters quantum time formalism to include both quantum clocks and rods, and imposing global constraints on total energy and momentum, we constructed a fully relational model of quantum spacetime. Here we take a further step: working in 1+1 dimensions, we show that the standard wave equations governing quantum particles (the Schr√∂dinger, Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations) emerge naturally from this framework. The solutions of the equations are derived directly from the constraints, without assuming any external spacetime structure. The second quantization formalism is also implemented and discussed. Our results provide further support for the idea that quantum dynamics in spacetime may emerge from entanglement and constraints.</p>

            <h2>Born's Rule from Quantum Frequentism</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lionel Brits</p>
            <p>Quantum theory has evolved from a set of provisional rules to an indispensable framework that underlies much of modern technology and infrastructure. Yet, after a century, Born's probability postulate remains at odds with the theory's unitary character. The problem stems from the linearity of the Schr√∂dinger equation, as linear systems are insensitive to the magnitudes of their solutions' coefficients. If measurement is unitary, and thus linear, how can the frequency of an outcome depend on the magnitude of its amplitude? And if not, at what scale does unitarity break down? This question remains pressing, as the assumption of unitarity underlies both the design of large-scale fault-tolerant quantum devices, as well as our understanding of fundamental aspects of our universe, for example, the black hole information problem. Proponents of the many-worlds interpretation have argued that Born's rule is observed because events that violate it have vanishing norms, and so must be unphysical. However, this argument has only been made explicit for special cases involving infinitely many identical states. In this paper we provide a generalized form of Born's rule applicable to measurements of arbitrarily-prepared factorizable states, and prove that such systems contain no histories that violate Born's rule. Our result therefore demonstrates that purely unitary evolution can co-exist with Born's rule under more relaxed conditions. In addition, we apply our generalized rule to the problem of quantum circuit fidelity, and provide a single-shot alternative to cross-entropy benchmarking based on self-information rate.</p>

            <p>Quantum networks that distribute entanglement among remote nodes will unlock transformational technologies in quantum computing, communication, and sensing. However, state-of-the-art networks utilize only a single optically-addressed qubit per node; this constrains both the quantum communication bandwidth and memory resources, greatly impeding scalability. Solid-state platforms provide a valuable resource for multiplexed quantum networking where multiple spectrally-distinguishable qubits can be hosted in nano-scale volumes. Here we harness this resource by implementing a two-node network consisting of several rare-earth ions coupled to nanophotonic cavities. This is accomplished with a protocol that entangles distinguishable 171Yb ions through frequency-erasing photon detection combined with real-time quantum feedforward. This method is robust to slow optical frequency fluctuations occurring on timescales longer than a single entanglement attempt: a universal challenge amongst solid-state emitters. We demonstrate the enhanced functionality of these multi-emitter nodes in two ways. First, we mitigate bottlenecks to the entanglement distribution rate through multiplexed entanglement of two remote ion pairs. Secondly, we prepare multipartite W-states comprising three distinguishable ions as a resource for advanced quantum networking protocols. These results lay the groundwork for scalable quantum networking based on rare-earth ions.</p>

Because the method is model agnostic, parallelizable and runs on current classical hardware, it can accelerate future variational optimization problems in quantum information, quantum computing and beyond.</p>

            <p>In classical thermodynamics, heat must spontaneously flow from hot to cold systems. In quantum thermodynamics, the same law applies when considering multipartite product thermal states evolving unitarily. If initial correlations are present, anomalous heat flow can happen, temporarily making cold thermal states colder and hot thermal states hotter. Such effect can happen due to entanglement, but also because of classical randomness, hence lacking a direct connection with nonclassicality. In this work, we introduce scenarios where anomalous heat flow \emph{does} have a direct link to nonclassicality, defined to be the failure of noncontextual models to explain experimental data. We start by extending known noncontextuality inequalities to a setup where sequential transformations are considered. We then show a class of quantum prepare-transform-measure protocols, characterized by time intervals $(0,\tau_c)$ for a given critical time $\tau_c$, where anomalous heat flow happens only if a noncontextuality inequality is violated. We also analyze a recent experiment from Micadei et. al. [Nat. Commun. 10, 2456 (2019)] and find the critical time $\tau_c$ based on their experimental parameters. We conclude by investigating heat flow in the evolution of two qutrit systems, showing that our findings are not an artifact of using two-qubit systems.</p>

We explore a top-down approach in which the subsystems emerge from the spectrum of the whole system. This approach has been referred to as quantum mereology. First we show that decomposing a system into subsystems is equivalent to decomposing a spectrum into other spectra. Then we argue that the number of subsystems (the volume of the system) can be inferred from the spectrum itself. In local models, this information is encoded in finite size corrections to the Gaussian density of states.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gang Liu, Gen Li, Huatang Tan, Jie Li</p>
            <p>We propose an efficient method for dissipative generation of magnonic cat states in a cavity-magnon-qubit hybrid system by exploiting a two-magnon driving and dissipation mechanism. When both the magnon and qubit are driven, a coherent nonlinear two-magnon interaction is induced, wherein the qubit and the magnon mode exchange energy through magnon pairs. The dissipation of the qubit is exploited to steer the magnon mode into a quantum superposition of distinct coherent states, where the magnon mode evolves into either an even or odd cat state, depending on the parity of the magnon initial state. For the case where the magnon initial state is a superposition state, e.g., of $\ket{0}$ and $\ket{1}$, the magnon mode can evolve into a weighted mixture of the even and odd cat states. We also find that magnon squeezed states may emerge during the short-time evolution, showcasing the capability of our mechanism in preparing diverse magnon non-classical states. Magnonic cat and squeezed states are macroscopic quantum states and find applications in macroscopic quantum studies and quantum sensing, e.g., in the dark matter search using ferromagnetic axion haloscopes.</p>

            <p>One of the key issues in quantum discrimination problems is understanding the extent of the advantages in discrimination performance when using resource states compared to resourceless states. We show that in any resource theory of states, which may not be convex, the extent to which the maximum average success probability can be improved in quantum channel discrimination problems without using auxiliary systems can be precisely quantified by the robustness measure. This result offers an intuitive operational meaning of the robustness measure in any convex resource theory. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the robustness measure can also quantify the improvement in channel discrimination problems that use auxiliary systems. Using these findings, resources can be fully characterized to achieve higher success probabilities than any state without the given resource in channel discrimination problems.</p>

            <p>Optical quantum computing is a promising approach for achieving large-scale quantum computation. While Gaussian operations have been successfully scaled, the inherently weak nonlinearity in optics makes generating highly non-Gaussian states a critical challenge for universality and fault tolerance. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a scalable method to generate optical non-Gaussian states with a resonator-based quantum memory that supports continuous-time storage and retrieval, in contrast to conventional loop-based memories. We introduce a dual-mode operation of the memory, enabling both storage and entangling functionalities within a single device. By employing a time-domain-multiplexed approach, we successfully demonstrate both cat and Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) breeding protocols in a scalable fashion, marking a key step toward quantum error correction. Our experiment also marks the first full demonstration of an optical resonator memory performing writing, storage, and readout operations. We validate the memory by storing squeezed single-photon states with up to 93% total efficiency, and measure an energy relaxation time $T_1 =$2.3$\mu$s and dephasing time $T_{\phi} =$0.96$\mu$s. These results establish a scalable pathway to generating complex non-Gaussian states required for fault-tolerant optical quantum computing. Beyond computation, our techniques provide new tools for enhancing quantum communication, sensing, and metrology.</p>

            <p>We study the impact of noise on the dynamics of entanglement in the transverse-field Ising chain, with the field quenched linearly across one or both of the quantum critical points of the model. Taking concurrence as a measure of entanglement, we find that a quench generates entanglement between nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor spins, with noise reducing the amount of entanglement. Focusing on the next-nearest-neighbor concurrence, known to exhibit Kibble-Zurek scaling with the square root of the quench rate in the noiseless case, we find a different result when noise is present: The concurrence now scales logarithmically with the quench rate, with a noise-dependent amplitude. This is also different from the ``anti-Kibble-Zurek" scaling of defect density with quench rate when noise is present, suggesting that noisy entanglement generation is largely independent from the rate of defect formation. Intriguingly, the critical time scale beyond which no entanglement is produced by a noisy quench scales as a power law with the strength of noise, with the same exponent as that which governs the optimal quench time for which defect formation is at a minimum in a standard quantum annealing scheme.</p>

            <p>Solving short and long time dynamics of closed quantum many-body systems is one of the main challenges of both atomic and condensed matter physics. For locally interacting closed systems, the dynamics of local observables can always be expanded into (pseudolocal) eigenmodes of the Liouvillian, so called dynamical symmetries. They come in two classes - transient operators, which decay in time and perpetual operators, which either oscillate forever or stay the same (conservation laws). These operators provide a full characterization of the dynamics of the system. Deriving these operators, apart from a very limited class of models, has not been possible. Here, we present a method to numerically and analytically derive some of these dynamical symmetries in infinite closed systems by introducing a naturally emergent open boundary condition on the Krylov chain. This boundary condition defines a partitioning of the Krylov space into system and environment degrees of freedom, where non-local operators make up an effective bath for the local operators. We demonstrate the practicality of the method on some numerical examples and derive analytical results in two idealized cases. Our approach lets us directly relate the operator growth hypothesis to thermalization and exponential decay of observables in chaotic systems.</p>

            <p>Trapped magnetic vortices in niobium introduce microwave losses that degrade the performance of superconducting resonators. While such losses have been extensively studied above 1~K, we report here their direct quantification in the millikelvin and low-photon regime relevant to quantum devices. Using a high-quality factor 3-D niobium cavity cooled through its superconducting transition in controlled magnetic fields, we isolate vortex-induced losses and find the resistive component of the sensitivity to trapped flux $S$ to be approximately 2~n$\Omega$/mG at 10~mK and 6~GHz. The decay rate is initially dominated by two-level system (TLS) losses from the native niobium pentoxide, with vortex-induced degradation of $T_1$ occurring above $B_{\text{trap}}\sim$~50~mG. In the absence of the oxide, even 10~mG of trapped flux limits performance $Q_0\sim$~10$^{10}$, or $T_1\sim$~350~ms, underscoring the need for stringent magnetic shielding. The resistive sensitivity $S$ decreases with temperature and remains largely field-independent, whereas the reactive component, $S'$, exhibits a maximum near 0.8~K. These behaviors are well modeled within the Coffey-Clem framework in the zero-creep limit, under the assumption that vortex pinning is enhanced by thermally activated processes. Our results suggest that niobium-based transmon qubits can tolerate vortex-induced dissipation at trapped field levels up to several hundred mG, but achieving long coherence times still requires careful magnetic shielding to suppress lower-field losses from other mechanisms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Angela Rosy Morgillo, Stefano Mancini, Massimiliano F. Sacchi, Chiara Macchiavello</p>
            <p>Time-varying quantum channels are essential for modeling realistic quantum systems with evolving noise properties. Here, we consider Gaussian lossy channels varying from one use to another and we employ neural networks to classify, regress, and forecast the behavior of these channels from their Choi-Jamiolkowski states. The networks achieve at least 87% of accuracy in distinguishing between non-Markovian, Markovian, memoryless, compound, and deterministic channels. In regression tasks, the model accurately reconstructs the loss parameter sequences, and in forecasting, it predicts future values, with improved performance as the memory parameter approaches 1 for Markovian channels. These results demonstrate the potential of neural networks in characterizing and predicting the dynamics of quantum channels.</p>

            <h2>Detector noise in continuous-variable quantum key distribution</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shihong Pan, Dimitri Monokandylos, Bing Qi</p>
            <p>Detector noise is a critical factor in determining the performance of a quantum key distribution (QKD) system. In continuous-variable (CV) QKD with optical coherent detection, the widely adopted \textit{trusted detector noise} model improves both the secret key rate and transmission distance. This model assumes that detector noise is inherently random and inaccessible to an adversary. Its validity depends on two key assumptions: (1) the detector can be accurately calibrated by the legitimate user and remains isolated from the adversary, and (2) the detector noise is truly random from the adversary's perspective. While substantial research has focused on strengthening the first assumption, the second is far more difficult to justify. Indeed, in quantum random number generation using optical homodyne detection, detector noise is often treated as ``untrusted'' and unsuitable for generating true randomness. In this paper, we introduce a \textit{calibrated detector noise} model for CV-QKD, which relies solely on the first assumption. Specifically, our model applies even when detector noise is predictable to the adversary. We analyze the electrical noise of a commercial balanced photoreceiver and perform numerical simulations to compare different noise models. Our results show that when the detector noise variance is an order of magnitude below the vacuum noise, the proposed model achieves a secret key rate comparable to that of the trusted detector noise model, while eliminating the questionable assumption of ``truly random'' detector noise.</p>

            <h2>Purely quantum memory in closed systems observed via imperfect measurements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jorge Tabanera-Bravo, Alja≈æ Godec</p>
            <p>The detection and quantification of non-Markovianity, a.k.a. memory, in quantum systems is a central problem in the theory of open quantum systems. There memory is as a result of the interaction between the system and its environment. Little is known, however, about memory effects induced by imperfect measurements on closed systems, where an entanglement with the environment is not possible. We investigate the emergence and characteristics of memory in closed systems observed via imperfect stroboscopic quantum measurements yielding coarse-grained outcomes. We consider ideal and two kinds of imperfect measurements: von Neumann measurements--the analogue of classical lumping--which destroy any coherence in the system, and genuinely quantum-lumping L√ºders measurements preserving certain quantum correlations. Whereas the conditions for Markov dynamics under von Neumann lumping are the same as for classical dynamics, quantum-lumping requires stronger conditions, i.e. the absence of any detectable coherence. We introduce the concept of purely quantum memory having no classical counterpart. We illustrate our results with a quantum walk on a lattice and discuss their implications for dissipative dynamics and decoherence effects induced by more realistic measurements.</p>

            <p>Multi-dimensional entangled photon states represent an important resource in quantum communication networks. Specifically, hyperentangled states presenting simultaneous entanglement in several degrees of freedom (DoF), stand out for their noise resilience and information capacity. In this work, we demonstrate the generation of hyperentangled photon pairs in the time and frequency-bin domain by spontaneous four-wave mixing from the coherent driving of two integrated Silicon microresonators. We demonstrate entanglement in each DoF by proving the violation of the Clauser Horne Shimony Holt (CHSH) inequality by more than 27 standard deviations (STDs) in each reduced space. Genuine hyperentanglement is then assessed from the negativity of an hyperentanglement witness, which is verified by more than 60 STDs. These results mark, to the best of our knowledge, the first demonstration of time-frequency bin hyperentanglement in an integrated silicon photonic device.</p>

            <h2>A Lazy Resynthesis Approach for Simultaneous T Gate and Two-Qubit Gate Optimization of Quantum Circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mu-Te Lau, Hsiang-Chun Yang, Hsin-Yu Chen, Chung-Yang Ric Huang</p>
            <p>State-of-the-art quantum circuit optimization (QCO) algorithms for T-count reduction often lead to a substantial increase in two-qubit gate count (2Q-count) -- a drawback that existing 2Q-count optimization techniques struggle to address effectively. In this work, we propose a novel lazy resynthesis approach for modern tableau-based QCO flows that significantly mitigates the 2Q-gate surges commonly introduced during T-count optimization in Clifford+T circuits. Experimental results show that our approach reduces 2Q-count overhead by 54.8%, 15.3%, and 68.0% compared to tableau-based, ZX-calculus-based, and path-sum-based QCO algorithms, respectively. In terms of runtime, our method achieves speedups of 1.81$\times$ and 13.1$\times$ over the tableau-based and ZX-calculus-based methods, while performing comparably to the path-sum-based approach. In summary, the proposed lazy resynthesis technique not only enhances the quality and performance of tableau-based QCO algorithms but also demonstrates superior efficiency and scalability compared to alternative QCO approaches such as ZX-calculus and path-sum-based techniques.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Philipp Stammer</p>
            <p>This work extends quantum optical models of high harmonic generation by considering a quantum stochastic analysis of the field modes coupled to an environment. In particular, we study the open system dynamics by solving the quantum Langevin equation for a non-linear driven cavity coupled to the environment. For an unstructured environment without memory, we show that the emission characteristics of the intense driven cavity is isomorphic to the process of high harmonic generation and a non-linear antenna. This is achieved by using the quantum regression theorem for the Markovian dynamics, and further allows to obtain the upper bound of the radiated power due to the emitter fluctuations. This opens the path to connect current quantum optical approaches of HHG with open system descriptions and towards driven-dissipative systems in the non-linear regime.</p>

            <h2>Stability of quasicrystalline ultracold fermions to dipolar interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paolo Molignini</p>
            <p>Quasiperiodic potentials can be used to interpolate between localization and delocalization in one dimension. With the rise of optical platforms engineering dipolar interactions, a key question is the stability of quasicrystalline phases under these long-range interactions. In this work, we study repulsive ultracold dipolar fermions in a quasiperiodic optical lattice to characterize the behavior of interacting quasicrystals. We simulate the full time evolution of the typical experimental protocols used to probe quasicrystalline order and localization properties. We extract experimentally measurable dynamical observables and correlation functions to characterize the three phases observed in the noninteracting setting: localized, intermediate, and extended. We then study the stability of such phases to repulsive dipolar interactions. We find that dipolar interactions can completely alter the shape of the phase diagram by stabilizing the intermediate phase, mostly at the expense of the extended phase. Moreover, in the strongly interacting regime, a resonance-like behavior characterized by density oscillations appears. Remarkably, strong dipolar repulsions can also localize particles even in the absence of quasiperiodicity if the primary lattice is sufficiently deep. Our work shows that dipolar interactions in a quasiperiodic potential can give rise to a complex, tuneable coexistence of localized and extended quantum states.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniele Toniolo, Sougato Bose</p>
            <p>In the context of the Many-Body-Localization phenomenology we consider arbitrarily large one-dimensional local spin systems, the XXZ model with random magnetic field is a prototypical example. Without assuming the existence of exponentially localized integrals of motion (LIOM), but assuming instead that the system's dynamics gives rise to a Lieb-Robinson bound (L-R) with a logarithmic lightcone, we rigorously evaluate the dynamical generation, starting from a generic product state, of $ \alpha$-R√©nyi entropies, with $ \alpha $ close to one, obtaining a $\log \, t$-law, that denotes a slow spread of entanglement. This is in sharp contrast with Anderson localized phases that show no dynamically generated entanglement. To prove this result we apply a general theory recently developed by us in arXiv:2408.00743 that quantitatively relates the L-R bounds of a local Hamiltonian with the dynamical generation of entanglement. Assuming instead the existence of LIOM we provide new independent proofs of the known facts that the L-R bound of the system's dynamics has a logarithmic light cone and show that the dynamical generation of the von Neumann entropy has for large times a $ \log \, t$-shape. L-R bounds, that quantify the dynamical spreading of local operators, may be easier to measure in experiments in comparison to global quantities such as entanglement.</p>

            <p>Monolithic integration, which refers to the incorporation of all device functionalities within a single material, shows significant potential for creating scalable solid-state quantum devices. This study demonstrated the coherent control of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) spins using an electronic circuit monolithically integrated within diamond: a patterned, conductive boron-doped diamond (BDD) microwave waveguide. First, we validated the high-frequency performance of the circuit by characterizing its impedance up to the microwave range, confirming its capability for efficient microwave transmission. Then, using this monolithically integrated BDD--NV hybrid system, we performed optically detected magnetic resonance and observed noticeable Rabi oscillations driven by the metallic BDD circuit. Importantly, we verified that the BDD antenna has a minimal detrimental impact on the NV spins; microwave-induced heating is negligible under both pulsed and continuous driving, and the spin relaxation time ($T_1$) remains unperturbed. This approach paves the way for a new class of compact, robust, and versatile quantum platforms suitable for sensing and information processing in various environments.</p>

            <h2>Velocity correlations of vortices and rarefaction pulses in compressible planar quantum fluids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ashton S. Bradley, Nils A. Krause</p>
            <p>We present a quantitative analytical framework for calculating two-point velocity correlations in compressible quantum fluids, focusing on two key classes of superfluid excitations: vortices and rarefaction pulses. We employ two complementary approaches. First, we introduce a new ansatz for vortex cores in planar quantum fluids that enhances analytic integrability. This ansatz yields closed-form expressions for power spectra and velocity correlations for general vortex distributions. Using it, we identify distinct signatures of short- and long-range velocity correlations corresponding to vortex dipoles and vortex pairs, respectively. Second, we analyze the fast rarefaction pulse regime of the Jones-Roberts soliton. By applying the asymptotic high-velocity wavefunction, we derive analytic expressions for the velocity power spectrum and correlation function, capturing the soliton characteristic length scale. We validate our analytical results for the homogeneous system against numerical treatment of a large trapped system, finding close quantitative agreement. Our findings provide the first analytic treatment of velocity correlations for Jones-Roberts solitons in quantum fluids of light [M. Baker-Rasooli et al., Physical Review Letters, 134, 233401 (2025)], and establish a foundation for characterizing vortices and solitons in compressible quantum fluids.</p>

            <h2>Quantum entanglement of fermionic symmetry-enriched quantum critical points in one dimension</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wen-Hao Zhong, Hai-Qing Lin, Xue-Jia Yu</p>
            <p>Quantum entanglement can be an effective diagnostic tool for probing topological phases protected by global symmetries. Recently, the notion of nontrivial topology in critical systems has been proposed and is attracting growing attention. In this work, as a concrete example, we explore the quantum entanglement properties of fermionic symmetry-enriched quantum critical points by constructing exactly solvable models based on stacked multiple Kitaev chains. We first analytically establish the global phase diagram using entanglement entropy and reveal three topologically distinct gapped phases with different winding numbers, along with three topologically distinct transition lines separating them. Importantly, we unambiguously demonstrate that two transition lines exhibit fundamentally different topological properties despite sharing the same central charge. Specifically, they display nontrivial topological degeneracy in the entanglement spectrum under periodic boundary conditions, thereby generalizing the Li-Haldane bulk-boundary correspondence to a broader class of fermionic symmetry-enriched criticality. Additionally, we identify a novel Lifshitz multicritical point at the intersection of the three transition lines, which also exhibits nontrivial topological degeneracy. This work provides a valuable reference for investigating gapless topological phases of matter from the perspective of quantum entanglement.</p>

            <h2>Synthetic and cosmological axion hybridization: entangled photons, (HBT) and quantum beats</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Boyanovsky</p>
            <p>In this article it is argued that synthetic axions, emergent collective excitations in topological insulators or Weyl semimetals hybridize with the cosmological axion, a compelling dark matter candidate via a common two photon decay channel since they both couple to electromagnetic fields via a Chern-Simons term. We point out an analogy to a V-type three level system with the two upper levels identified with the synthetic and cosmological axions decaying into a two-photon state. The Weisskopf-Wigner theory of spontaneous decay in multi level atoms is complemented and extended to describe the dynamics of hybridization. The final two-photon state features both kinematic and polarization entanglement and displays quantum beats as a consequence of the interference between the decay paths. An initial population of either axion induces a population of the other via hybridization. Consequently, a dark matter axion condensate induces a condensate of the synthetic axion, albeit with small amplitude. We obtain a momentum and polarization resolved Hanbury- Brown Twiss (HBT) second order coherence describing coincident correlated two-photon detection. It exhibits quantum beats with a frequency given by the difference between the energies of the synthetic and cosmological axion and \emph{perhaps may be harnessed} to detect either type of axion excitations. The case of synthetic axions individually is obtained in the limit of vanishing coupling of the cosmological axion and features similar two-photon correlations. Hence second order (HBT) two-photon coherence \emph{may} provide an alternative detection mechanism for emergent condensed matter axionic collective excitations. Similarities and differences with parametrically down converted photons are discussed.</p>

            <p>We investigate various types of quantum entanglement in the octanuclear heterometallic $3d/4f$ complexes denoted as Ni$^{2+}_4$Gd$^{3+}_4$ under an external magnetic field, using the exact diagonalization approach. These molecular magnets, which can be effectively described by Heisenberg spin models, consist of two identical $\{\text{Ni}^{2+}_2\text{Gd}^{3+}_2\}$ cubane subunits bridged by acetate and hydroxide ligands. Our analysis reveals that their magnetization exhibits intermediate plateaus at low temperatures, indicating distinct ground states characteristic of Ni-containing compounds. Using negativity as a measure of quantum entanglement, we examine the influence of single-ion anisotropy and magnetic field on tetrapartite, bipartite, 1$-$3 tangle, and 2$-$2 tangle entanglements in two families of Ni$^{2+}_4$Gd$^{3+}_4$ complexes: $\boldsymbol{(1)}$ without anisotropy and $\boldsymbol{(2)}$ with anisotropy. Complex $\boldsymbol{(1)}$ exhibits strong bipartite entanglement between Ni ions, which persists up to $T \approx 3.0\,\text{K}$ and $B \approx 4.0\,\text{T}$, but shows significantly weaker tetrapartite entanglement and vanishing bipartite entanglement between Gd$\cdots$Gd and Ni$\cdots$Gd pairs. In contrast, complex $\boldsymbol{(2)}$ displays nonzero and sizable values for all types of entanglement considered. These findings emphasis the crucial role of single-ion anisotropy in generating and shaping the entanglement landscape of heterometallic Ni$^{2+}_4$Gd$^{3+}_4$ complexes. Notably, we find that the 1$-$3 tangle entanglement between a Ni ion and the remaining sites in a cubane unit serves as a reliable indicator of ground-state phase transitions, exhibiting distinct changes across phase boundaries irrespective of the presence of single-ion anisotropy.</p>

            <p>A classical dynamical system can be viewed as a probability space equipped with a measure-preserving time evolution map, admitting a purely algebraic formulation in terms of the algebra of bounded functions on the phase space. Similarly, a quantum dynamical system can be formulated using an algebra of bounded operators in a non-commutative probability space equipped with a time evolution map. Chaos, in either setting, can be characterized by statistical independence between observables at $ t = 0 $ and $ t \to \infty $, leading to the vanishing of cumulants involving these observables. In the quantum case, the notion of independence is replaced by free independence, which only emerges in the thermodynamic limit (asymptotic freeness). In this work, we propose a definition of quantum chaos based on asymptotic freeness and investigate its emergence in quantum many-body systems including the mixed-field Ising model with a random magnetic field, a higher spin version of the same model, and the SYK model. The hallmark of asymptotic freeness is the emergence of the free convolution prediction for the spectrum of operators of the form $ A(0) + B(t) $, implying the vanishing of all free cumulants between $A(0)$ and $B(t)$ in the thermodynamic limit for an infinite-temperature thermal state. We systematically investigate the spectral properties of $ A(0) + B(t) $ in the above-mentioned models, show that fluctuations on top of the free convolution prediction follow universal Wigner-Dyson statistics, and discuss the connection with quantum chaos. Finally, we argue that free probability theory provides a rigorous framework for understanding quantum chaos, offering a unifying perspective that connects many different manifestations of it.</p>

            <p>The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, a prime example of a one-dimensional topologically nontrivial insulator, has been extensively studied in flat space-time. In recent times, many studies have been conducted to understand the properties of the low-dimensional quantum matter in curved spacetime, which can mimic the gravitational event horizon and black hole physics. However, the impact of curved spacetime on the topological properties of such systems remains unexplored. Here, we investigate the curved spacetime (CST) version of the SSH model by introducing a position-dependent hopping parameter. We show, using different topological markers, that the CST-SSH model can undergo a topological phase transition. We find that the topologically non-trivial phase can host zero-energy edge modes, but those edge modes are asymmetric, unlike the usual SSH model. Moreover, we find that at the topological transition point, a critical slowdown takes place for zero-energy wave packets near the boundary, indicating the presence of a horizon, and interestingly, if one moves even a slight distance away from the transition point, wave packets start bouncing back and reverse direction before reaching the horizon. An extended version of the CST-SSH model, which supports distinct topological phases characterized by higher winding numbers, has also been studied. We show that a similar critical slowdown of wave packets near the boundary occurs at all topological transition points between any two distinct phases. A semiclassical description of the wave packet trajectories also supports these results.</p>

We demonstrate that, under appropriate conditions, AQMBS states can be obtained as low-lying gapless excited states of a parent Hamiltonian, which has a QMBS state as its ground state. Furthermore, our formalism reveals a connection between QMBS and supersymmetric (SUSY) quantum mechanics. The QMBS state can be interpreted as a SUSY-unbroken ground state.</p>

We achieve an average shuttling fidelity of \SI{99.8}{\percent}. The residual shuttling error is highly sensitive to the ratio between interdot tunnel coupling and Zeeman splitting, with tuning of these parameters enabling up to a twenty-fold variation in error rate.

            <h2>Continuous topological phase transition between $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topologically ordered phases</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qi Zhang, Wen-Tao Xu</p>
            <p>Topological phase transitions beyond anyon condensation remain poorly understood. A notable example is the transition between the toric code (TC) and double semion (DS) phases, which has two distinct $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders in (2 + 1)D. Previous studies reveal that the transition between them can be either first order or via an intermediate phase, thus the existence of a directly continuous transition between them remains a long-standing problem. Motivated by the fact that both phases can arise from condensing distinct anyons in the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ topological order, we introduce a perturbed $\mathbb{Z}_4$ quantum double (QD) model to study the TC-DS transition. We confirm the existence of a continuous (2 + 1)D XY* transition between the TC and DS phases by mapping it to a two-coupled quantum Ising model. Importantly, using the condensation order parameters and the area law coefficients of the Wilson loops, we further reveal that $\mathbb{Z}_4$ anyons, fractionalized from the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders, become deconfined at the transition between $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topologically ordered phases. Our results open a path toward developing a theoretical framework for topological phase transitions beyond anyon condensation.</p>

            <h2>Generation of frequency-bin-encoded dual-rail cluster states via time-frequency multiplexing of microwave photonic qubits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiling Wang, Takeaki Miyamura, Yoshiki Sunada, Keika Sunada, Jesper Ilves, Kohei Matsuura, Yasunobu Nakamura</p>
            <p>Cluster states are a class of multi-qubit entangled states with broad applications such as quantum metrology and one-way quantum computing. Here, we present a protocol to generate frequency-bin-encoded dual-rail cluster states using a superconducting circuit consisting of a fixed-frequency transmon qubit, a resonator and a Purcell filter. We implement time-frequency multiplexing by sequentially emitting co-propagating microwave photons of distinct frequencies. The frequency-bin dual-rail encoding enables erasure detection based on photon occupancy. We characterize the state fidelity using quantum tomography and quantify the multipartite entanglement using the metric of localizable entanglement. Our implementation achieves a state fidelity exceeding 50$\%$ for a cluster state consisting of up to four logical qubits. The localizable entanglement remains across chains of up to seven logical qubits. After discarding the erasure errors, the fidelity exceeds 50% for states with up to eight logical qubits, and the entanglement persists across chains of up to eleven qubits. These results highlight the improved robustness of frequency-bin dual-rail encoding against photon loss compared to conventional single-rail schemes. This work provides a scalable pathway toward high-dimensional entangled state generation and photonic quantum information processing in the microwave domain.</p>

            <h2>The Role of Entanglement in Quantum Reservoir Computing with Coupled Kerr Nonlinear Oscillators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ali Karimi, Hadi Zadeh-Haghighi, Youssef Kora, Christoph Simon</p>
            <p>Quantum Reservoir Computing (QRC) uses quantum dynamics to efficiently process temporal data. In this work, we investigate a QRC framework based on two coupled Kerr nonlinear oscillators, a system well-suited for time-series prediction tasks due to its complex nonlinear interactions and potentially high-dimensional state space. We explore how its performance in time-series prediction depends on key physical parameters: input drive strength, Kerr nonlinearity, and oscillator coupling, and analyze the role of entanglement in improving the reservoir's computational performance, focusing on its effect on predicting non-trivial time series. Using logarithmic negativity to quantify entanglement and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) to evaluate predictive accuracy, our results suggest that entanglement provides a computational advantage on average-up to a threshold in the input frequency-that persists under some levels of dissipation and dephasing. In particular, we find that higher dissipation rates can enhance performance. While the entanglement advantage manifests as improvements in both average and worst-case performance, it does not lead to improvements in the best-case error. These findings contribute to the broader understanding of quantum reservoirs for high performance, efficient quantum machine learning and time-series forecasting.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Control of Thermal Emission from Photonic Crystals with Two-Level Atoms</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chih-Wei Wang, Jhih-Sheng Wu</p>
            <p>Thermal light engineering is a field of considerable interest and potential. We study quantum light-matter interactions in a one-dimensional photonic crystal with two-level atoms as the active medium, replacing classical oscillators in traditional blackbody models. In a thermal bath with pumping, these atoms modulate thermal emission via interactions with photonic modes. The model with quantum two-level systems enables the processes of spontaneous emission, stimulated absorption, and stimulated emission. Equilibrium and nonequilibrium regimes depend on competition between pumping and thermal relaxation rates. Strong light-matter interaction and photon decay govern dynamics and steady states. In equilibrium, with a high thermal relaxation rate, photon numbers are initially determined by spontaneous emission and later stabilize due to stimulated absorption, influenced by light-matter interaction strength. In-band-gap photons reach steady states at a time scale of one or two orders of magnitude longer than outside-band-gap photons. Interestingly, for a strong light-matter interaction, all photons in the equilibrium regimes show Planckian radiation, regardless of their frequencies in or out of the band gaps. Band-gap suppression of thermal emission is more pronounced with weaker light-matter interaction or larger photon decay. In the nonequilibrium regime, the dynamics of photon numbers exhibit a multi-time-scale process transitioning to steady states due to strong pumping and stimulated processes. Steady-state electron populations of two-level atoms deviate from the Fermi-Dirac distribution, and the steady-state photon numbers exhibit super-Planckian emission. These findings enable quantum control of thermal emission spectra, which is relevant for reducing thermal noise in quantum computing or enhancing radiative cooling.</p>

            <h2>Multi-QIDA method for VQE state preparation in molecular systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fabio Tarocco, Davide Materia, Leonardo Ratini, Leonardo Guidoni</p>
            <p>The development of quantum algorithms and their application to quantum chemistry has introduced new opportunities for solving complex molecular problems that are computationally infeasible for classical methods. In quantum chemistry, the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm designed to estimate ground-state energies of molecular systems. Despite its promise, VQE faces challenges such as scalability issues, high circuit depths, and barren plateaus that make the optimization of the variational wavefunction. To mitigate these challenges, the Quantum Information Driven Ansatz (QIDA) leverages Quantum Mutual Information (QMI) to construct compact, correlation-driven circuits. In this work, we go back to the original field of application of QIDA, by applying the already defined Multi-Threshold Quantum Information Driven Ansatz (Multi-QIDA) methodology on Molecular Systems. to systematically construct shallow, layered quantum circuits starting from approximate QMI matrices obtained by Quantum Chemistry calculations. The Multi-QIDA approach combines efficient creation of the QMI map, reduction of the number of correlators required by exploiting Minimum/Maximum spanning tress, and an iterative layer-wise VQE optimization routine. These enhancements allow the method to recover missing correlations in molecular systems while maintaining computational efficiency. Additionally, the approach incorporates alternative gate constructions, such as SO(4) correlators, to enhance the circuit expressibility without significantly increasing the circuit complexity. We benchmark Multi-QIDA on systems ranging from small molecules like H2O, BeH2, and NH3 in Iterative Natural Orbitals (INOs) basis set, to active-space models such as H2O-6-31G-CAS(4,4) and N2-cc-pVTZ-CAS(6,6), comparing it to traditional hardware-efficient ansatze.</p>

            <p>The squeezed photons, as a quantum-correlated light with reduced noise, have emerged as a great resource for sensing the structures of matter. Here we study the transient absorption (TA) scheme using the squeezed photons whose spectral correlation of amplitudes can be tailored. A microscopic theory is developed, revealing a highly time-energy-resolved nature of the signal that is not attainable by conventional TA scheme. Such a capability is elaborated by applying to monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide materials (TMDs), achieving a real-time monitoring of valley excitons and their dynamics. Moreover, we show the intermediate squeezing regime-not the strong squeezing-which the time-resolved spectroscopy is in favor of. Our work offers a new paradigm for studying nonequilibrium dynamics of matter, in light of the photocatalysis and optoelectronics.</p>

            <h2>Generation and certification of pure phase entangled light</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rounak Chatterjee, Mayuresh Kanagal, Vikas S Bhat, Kiran Bajar, Sushil Mujumdar</p>
            <p>Biphoton systems exhibiting entanglement in position-momentum variables, known as spatial entanglement, are among the most intriguing and well-studied phenomena in quantum optics. A notable subset of these are phase entangled states, where entanglement manifests purely through correlations in the spatial phase of the wavefunction. While the generation of such states from biphotons via spontaneous parametric down-conversion has been explored, their physical implications and applications remain under-investigated. In this work, we theoretically and experimentally examine a unique form of phase entanglement known as `pure' phase entanglement. This state exhibits the unusual feature that the position of one photon is correlated with the momentum of the other. Unlike typical spatially entangled states, it shows no direct correlation in position or momentum between the two photons, underscoring that all correlations arise purely from the spatial phase of the wavefunction. We delve deeper into the theory of this state and experimentally construct it from known phase-entangled states. To certify its properties, we propose a setup that performs a "one-particle momentum measurement" and explore the various tunable parameters. We also highlight potential applications of this state in quantum optics and imaging experiments.</p>

            <h2>The Effect of Permanent Dipoles on Dark States in Molecular Dimers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthew Freed, Dominic M. Rouse, Andrea Rocco, Jim Al-Khalili, Marian Florescu, Adam Burgess</p>
            <p>Many organic molecules possess large permanent dipole moments that differ depending on the electronic state. These permanent dipoles influence both intermolecular coupling and interactions with the optical fields, yet they are often neglected in typical theoretical quantum optics treatments. Here, we investigate the optical properties and their effect on dark states of dimers possessing such permanent dipoles. We show that when monomers have excitation-dependent permanent dipoles, optical transitions between the bright and dark states of the dimer are enabled. We investigate how permanent dipoles allow for the existence of static driving terms between the ground and excited states of each monomer. In turn, these can cause the excited states of the monomers to couple indirectly to the zero excitation state of the dimer. This leads to interference between permanent and transition dipoles and can result in the formation of dark states that are entirely localised. Furthermore, dark states formed through indirect coupling exhibit enhanced robustness against energy level fluctuations, which may improve the efficiency of the design of photovoltaic devices.</p>

            <h2>Suppression of coherent light scattering in a three-dimensional atomic array</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Kun Lu, Hanzhen Lin, Jiahao Lyu, Yoo Kyung Lee, Vitaly Fedoseev, Wolfgang Ketterle</p>
            <p>Understanding how atoms collectively interact with light is not only important for fundamental science, but also crucial for designing light-matter interfaces in quantum technologies. Over the past decades, numerous studies have focused on arranging atoms in ordered arrays and using constructive (destructive) interference to enhance (suppress) the coupling to electromagnetic fields, thereby tailoring collective light-matter interactions. These studies have mainly focused on one- and two-dimensional arrays. However, only three-dimensional (3D) arrays can demonstrate destructive interference of coherent light scattering in all directions. This omnidirectional suppression of coherent light scattering in 3D atomic arrays has thus far not been experimentally demonstrated. Here, we observe a strong reduction of light scattering in a 3D atomic array prepared in the form of a Mott insulator in optical lattices. The residual light scattering is shown to be caused by the delocalization of atoms, Raman scattering, and inelastic scattering associated with saturation. We also demonstrate how light scattering can be a sensitive probe for density fluctuations in many-body states in optical lattices, enabling us to characterize the superfluid-to-Mott insulator phase transition as well as defects generated by dynamical parameter ramps. The results of our work can be used to prepare subradiant states for photon storage and probe correlations for many-body systems in optical lattices.</p>

            <p>Exciton-polaritons formed inside optical cavities offer a highly tunable platform for exploring novel quantum phenomena. Here, we introduce and theoretically characterize a light-matter moir√© effect (LMME) that arises when a 2D material is tilted inside a planar optical cavity, in contrast to stacking multiple layers at a twist angle as is done in forming 2D moir√© hetero-structures. We show that this geometric tilt produces emergent periodicity in the light-matter coupling, yielding displaced replicas of the polariton dispersion and flat bands near the Brillouin-zone center. Through time-dependent quantum dynamical simulations, we demonstrate that LMME enables coherent frequency conversion and remains robust against phonon-induced decoherence. Our findings establish LMME as a new platform for engineering polariton band structures, the generation of flat bands and performing coherent frequency conversion relevant for developing polariton-based quantum devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haiyue Kang, John F. Kam, Gary J. Mooney, Lloyd C. L. Hollenberg</p>
            <p>Quantum teleportation is not merely a fascinating corollary of quantum entanglement, it also finds utility in quantum processing and circuit compilation. In this paper, we measure and track the entanglement and fidelity of two-qubit states prepared on a 127-qubit IBM Quantum device, as one of the qubits is teleported across 19 qubits. We design, evaluate and compare two distinct approaches to teleportation: post-selected measurement categorisation and dynamic circuit corrections based on mid-circuit measurements, and compare with direct state transportation using SWAP gates. By optimally choosing the teleportation path which exhibits the highest total negativity entanglement measure across nearest-neighbour pairs, we show the entanglement of a two-qubit graph state is sustained after at least 19 hops in teleportation using the post-selection approach and 17 hops using the dynamic circuit approach. We observe a higher level of teleported entanglement in paths determined from two-qubit negativities compared to those obtained from gate errors, demonstrating an advantage in using the negativity map over the gate error map for compiling quantum circuits.</p>

            <p>Achieving and controlling non-reciprocity in engineered photonic structures is of fundamental interest in science and engineering. Here, we introduce a tunable, non-Hermitian, nonlinear microwave dimer designed to precisely implement phase-non-reciprocal hopping dynamics between two spatially separated cavities at room temperature. Our system incorporates simple components such as three-dimensional microwave cavities, unidirectional amplifiers, digital attenuators, and a digital phase shifter. By dividing the energy transfer into forward and backward paths, our platform enables precise control over the amplitude and phase of the propagating signals in each direction. Through a combination of theoretical and numerical analysis, we model the dynamics of the system under different operating conditions, including a parameter regime where the gain not only compensates for but significantly exceeds the inherent loss. Our model quantitatively reproduces the observed weak-drive transmission spectra, the amplitude and frequency of self-sustained limit cycles, and the phase locking synchronization effect between the limit cycle and an external microwave tone. Our results may have implications in areas ranging from sensing and synthetic photonic materials to neuromorphic computing and quantum networks, while providing new insight into the interplay between non-Hermitian and nonlinear dynamics.</p>

            <p>We propose a model of a scalable qudit-based quantum processor that uses rotational degrees of freedom of polar molecules. Entangling gates between qudits are implemented via moving molecule in optical traps by exploiting dipole-dipole interactions to mediate coherent coupling.

This approach enables the realization of a universal set of quantum gates. In particular, we exploit additional levels that are present in the d=3 and d=5 qudits, which allows one to simplify the decomposition of multiqubit gates. We then analyze the relevant experimental parameters to realize our schemes with SrF and 87Rb133Cs molecules. The proposed approach offers a promising route towards scalable and versatile quantum information processing with multilevel systems, which can be potentially realized using currently available experimental facilities.</p>

            <p>Variational quantum algorithms have emerged as a cornerstone of contemporary quantum algorithms research. While they have demonstrated considerable promise in solving problems of practical interest, efficiently determining the minimal quantum resources necessary to obtain such a solution remains an open question. In this work, inspired by concepts from classical machine learning, we investigate the impact of overparameterization on the performance of variational algorithms. Our study focuses on the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) -- a prominent variational quantum algorithm designed to solve combinatorial optimization problems. We investigate if circuit overparametrization is necessary and sufficient to solve such problems in QAOA, considering two representative problems -- MAX-CUT and MAX-2-SAT. For MAX-CUT we observe that overparametriation is both sufficient and (statistically) necessary for attaining exact solutions, as confirmed numerically for up to $20$ qubits. In fact, for MAX-CUT on 2-regular graphs we show the necessity to be exact, based on the analytically found optimal depth. In sharp contrast, for MAX-2-SAT, underparametrized circuits suffice to solve most instances. This result highlights the potential of QAOA in the underparametrized regime, supporting its utility for current noisy devices.</p>

            <p>Classical simulations of quantum circuits are vital for assessing potential quantum advantage and benchmarking devices, yet they require sophisticated methods to avoid the exponential growth of resources. Tensor network approaches, in particular matrix product states (MPS) combined with the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm, currently dominate large-scale circuit simulations. These methods scale efficiently when entanglement is limited but suffer rapid bond dimension growth with increasing entanglement and handle long-range gates via costly SWAP insertions. Motivated by the success of the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) in many-body physics, we reinterpret quantum circuits as a series of discrete time evolutions, using gate generators to construct an MPS-based circuit simulation via a local TDVP formulation. This addresses TEBD's key limitations by (1) naturally accommodating long-range gates and (2) optimally representing states on the MPS manifold. By diffusing entanglement more globally, the method suppresses local bond growth and reduces memory and runtime costs. We benchmark the approach on five 49-qubit circuits: three Hamiltonian circuits (1D open and periodic Heisenberg, 2D 7x7 Ising) and two algorithmic ones (quantum approximate optimization, hardware-efficient ansatz). Across all cases, our method yields substantial resource reductions over standard tools, establishing a new state-of-the-art for circuit simulation and enabling advances across quantum computing, condensed matter, and beyond.</p>

            <p>Topological quantum computing promises intrinsic fault tolerance by encoding quantum information in non-Abelian anyons, where quantum gates are implemented via braiding. While braiding operations are robust against local perturbations, a critical yet often overlooked challenge arises when scaling beyond two qubits: the naive extension of braiding based gates fails to support even the full Clifford group. To overcome this limitation, we incorporate projective measurements that enable transitions between different qubit encodings, thus restoring computational universality. We perform many-body simulations of braiding dynamics augmented with measurement-based switching, explicitly preparing the Bell state and GHZ state for systems of two and five qubits, respectively. Furthermore, we execute a random unitary circuit on five qubits, achieving a fidelity exceeding 99%. We analyze the circuit's robustness by studying its fidelity dependence on total braid duration and static potential disorder. Our results show that the fidelity remains above 99% for moderate disorder, underscoring the intrinsic fault tolerance of the architecture. Finally, we demonstrate a random circuit on a ten qubit system to showcase the scalability of our techniques.</p>

            <p>Open quantum systems described by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian exhibit rich dynamics due to the topology of their complex energy spectrum. By encircling an exceptional point degeneracy, this topology allows for topological state transport, chiral geometric phases, and eigenvalue braiding. To access these topological features, it is desirable to drive the system adiabatically. However, adiabatic transport in a system with complex spectrum is conventionally only possible for the eigenstate whose eigenenergy has the lowest loss. Previous experiments have demonstrated such adiabatic evolution for the quantum state with relative gain, yet observed a breakdown in adiabaticity for quantum states with relative loss. In this work, we harness a shortcut to adiabaticity -- counterdiabatic driving -- to avoid the effects of loss while maintaining trajectories that follow the instantaneous eigenstates in significantly shorter timescales. We experimentally investigate the robustness of this control method using a superconducting transmon circuit with engineered dissipation. We observe that counterdiabatic driving stabilizes quasistatic transport and preserves the complex energy spectrum's topology.</p>

            <h2>Time-resolved certification of frequency-bin entanglement over multi-mode channels</h2>

            <p>Frequency-bin entangled photons can be efficiently produced on-chip which offers a scalable, robust and low-footprint platform for quantum communication, particularly well-suited for resource-constrained settings such as mobile or satellite-based systems. However, analyzing such entangled states typically requires active and lossy components, limiting scalability and multi-mode compatibility. We demonstrate a novel technique for processing frequency-encoded photons using linear interferometry and time-resolved detection. Our approach is fully passive and compatible with spatially multi-mode light, making it suitable for free-space and satellite to ground applications. As a proof-of-concept, we utilize frequency-bin entangled photons generated from a high-brightness multi-resonator source integrated on-chip to show the ability to perform arbitrary projective measurements over both single- and multi-mode channels. We report the first measurement of the joint temporal intensity between frequency-bin entangled photons, which allows us to certify entanglement by violating the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality, with a measured value of $|S|=2.32\pm0.05$ over multi-mode fiber. By combining time-resolved detection with energy-correlation measurements, we perform full quantum state tomography, yielding a state fidelity of up to $91\%$. We further assess our ability to produce non-classical states via a violation of time-energy entropic uncertainty relations and investigate the feasibility of a quantum key distribution protocol. Our work establishes a resource-efficient and scalable approach toward the deployment of robust frequency-bin entanglement over free-space and satellite-based links.</p>

            <h2>Light Storage and Retrieval in an Atomic Tripod System</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shan Zhong, A. J. Sudler, D. Blume, Alberto M. Marino</p>
            <p>Highly-efficient quantum memories are essential for advancing quantum information processing technologies, including scalable quantum computing and quantum networks. We experimentally demonstrate a light storage and retrieval protocol in a tripod system using an ensemble of laser-cooled $^{87}$Rb atoms. The tripod system, which consists of three ground states and an excited state, offers rich dynamics: its use to coherently store and retrieve a weak probe pulse in the $^{87}$Rb $F=1$ ground state manifold leads to the interference of two spin-wave excitations during storage time that translate to an interference in the peak intensity of the retrieved probe pulse. Our work shows that these interferences, which manifest when varying the pulse sequence or energy level structure, can be controlled experimentally by varying the storage time, optical phase, and magnetic field strength. Theoretical simulations exhibit excellent agreement with the experimental results. This work demonstrates the rich dynamics and versatile capabilities of atomic tripod systems for light storage and retrieval, with key advantages over conventional $\Lambda$-systems, highlighting the potential of atomic tripod systems for applications in quantum information processing, quantum synchronization, and atomic memory protocols.</p>

            <p>The superradiant phase transition in the dissipative Dicke lattice model, driven by on-site collective atom-photon interactions and inter-site photon hopping, is a cornerstone of nonequilibrium quantum many-body physics. However, little is still known about the influence of boundaries in experimental achievable systems of finite size. Here we investigate the dissipative superradiant phase transition in the Dicke lattice model with a small number of sites and reveal a striking sensitivity of this model to the nature of the boundary conditions. Specifically, we find that under open boundary conditions a whole zoo of superradiant phases with broken translational symmetry appears, which is not observed in the corresponding infinite lattice system. Our results demonstrate the crucial influence of boundary effects on the stationary phases of dissipative lattice models, which offers intriguing new opportunities for studying these phenomena in near term experimental realizations of such models in quantum optics and circuit QED.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Valeriia P. Kosheleva, Shahram Panahiyan, Angel Rubio, Frank Schlawin</p>
            <p>Recent advances in nanoscale and microscale photon-pair sources have enabled quantum-light-matter interactions in regimes where standard approximations, such as the paraxial limit, break down. Identifying quantum advantages in these domains requires a unified, first-principles framework that treats arbitrary quantum states of light and realistic material systems without restrictive assumptions. Here, we present a fully relativistic, beyond-paraxial theory of multiphoton ionization driven by quantum light, incorporating the full spatial structure and correlations of the field alongside material properties. As a case study, we apply the formalism to resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) of neutral sodium atoms by momentum-entangled photons. We predict cross-section enhancements of several orders of magnitude compared to coherent light, arising entirely from non-paraxial effects and vanishing in the paraxial limit. The enhancement is strongly channel-dependent, with odd multipole transitions benefiting most from favorable parity and interference conditions. The predicted enhancement is accessible with current state-of-the-art photonic and atomic technologies, highlighting a promising avenue for exploiting quantum light in high-precision ionization and spectroscopy experiments.</p>

            <p>Entanglement generation in polariton systems is fundamentally constrained by high losses and decoherence, which typically outweigh polariton nonlinearities. Here, we propose a conceptually different approach that uses optomechanical interactions, rather than polariton-polariton interactions, to generate entangled polaritons. Our double-resonant scheme relies on strong exciton-phonon coupling, found in both inorganic and molecular semiconductors, enabling room-temperature generation of spectrally disparate photon pairs. The quantum coherent and delocalized nature of polariton states inside an optical cavity ensures efficient single-mode outcoupling and allows for unconditional quantum state preparation--not relying on any post-selection or projective measurements. When conditioned on exciton-polariton emission, single phonon-polariton states can be prepared that subsequently yield bright, heralded single-photon emission in the mid-IR. We introduce a double-resonant optomechanical platform that enables scalable, room-temperature quantum polaritonics without relying on conventional excitonic nonlinearities.</p>

            <p>We propose a model of a scalable qudit-based quantum processor that uses rotational degrees of freedom of polar molecules. Entangling gates between qudits are implemented via moving molecule in optical traps by exploiting dipole-dipole interactions to mediate coherent coupling. We develop encoding schemes that map single qubits (d=2) into qudits of dimensions 2 <= d <= 5, and pairs of qubits into higher-dimensional qudits with d=4, 5. This approach enables the realization of a universal set of quantum gates. In particular, we exploit additional levels that are present in the d=3 and d=5 qudits, which allows one to simplify the decomposition of multiqubit gates. We then analyze the relevant experimental parameters to realize our schemes with SrF and 87Rb133Cs molecules. The proposed approach offers a promising route towards scalable and versatile quantum information processing with multilevel systems, which can be potentially realized using currently available experimental facilities.</p>

            <p>Ground State Energy Estimation (GSEE) is a central problem in quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics, demanding efficient algorithms to solve complex electronic structure calculations. This work introduces a structured benchmarking framework for evaluating the performance of both classical and quantum solvers on diverse GSEE problem instances. We assess three prominent methods -- Semistochastic Heat-Bath Configuration Interaction (SHCI), Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG), and Double-Factorized Quantum Phase Estimation (DF QPE) -- ighlighting their respective strengths and limitations. Our results show that fully optimized SHCI achieves near-universal solvability on the benchmark set, DMRG excels for low-entanglement systems, and DF QPE is currently constrained by hardware and algorithmic limitations. However, we observe that many benchmark Hamiltonians are drawn from datasets tailored to SHCI and related approaches, introducing a bias that favors classical solvers. To mitigate this, we propose expanding the benchmark suite to include more challenging, strongly correlated systems to enable a more balanced and forward-looking evaluation of solver capabilities. As quantum hardware and algorithms improve, this benchmarking framework will serve as a vital tool for tracking progress and identifying domains where quantum methods may surpass classical techniques.

            <p>The selection of a balanced active space is a critical step in multi-reference quantum chemistry calculations, particularly for systems with strong electron correlation. Likewise, active space selection is a key to unlock the potential of contemporary quantum computing in quantum chemistry. Albeit recent progress, there remains a lack of a unified, robust, and fully automated framework for active space selection that performs reliably across a wide range of molecular systems. In this work, we present a novel approach inspired by both the AVAS (Atomic Valence Active Space) and AutoCAS methods. Our method unifies orbital entropy analysis with atomic orbital projections to guide the construction of chemically and physically meaningful active spaces. This integrated scheme enables a more consistent and flexible selection of active orbitals while retaining automation and scalability. We validate our approach on a set of molecular systems relevant to photodynamic therapy, in particular a set of Ru(II)-complexes, selected to span increasing levels of electron correlation and structural complexity. These molecules serve as challenging test cases due to the presence of strong static correlation and the need for highly accurate electronic structure descriptions. Our results demonstrate that the method can reliably identify compact, chemically intuitive active spaces that capture the essential physics, making it suitable for both classical and quantum computational frameworks. Furthermore, we have developed this approach in a package that is intuitive to use for users and can be interfaced with both standard quantum chemistry and quantum computing applications, making it accessible to a broad research community.</p>

            <h2>Gauging the variational optimization of projected entangled-pair states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei Tang, Laurens Vanderstraeten, Jutho Haegeman</p>
            <p>Projected entangled-pair states (PEPS) constitute a powerful variational ansatz for capturing ground state physics of two-dimensional quantum systems. However, accurately computing and minimizing the energy expectation value remains challenging, in part because the impact of the gauge degrees of freedom that are present in the tensor network representation is poorly understood. We analyze the role of gauge transformations for the case of a U(1)-symmetric PEPS with point group symmetry, thereby reducing the gauge degrees of freedom to a single class. We show how gradient-based optimization strategies exploit the gauge freedom, causing the tensor network contraction to become increasingly inaccurate and to produce artificially low variational energies. Furthermore, we develop a gauge-fixed optimization strategy that largely suppresses this effect, resulting in a more robust optimization. Our study underscores the need for gauge-aware optimization strategies to guarantee reliability of variational PEPS in general settings.</p>

Proceeding in such a manner, every aspect of quantum mechanics acquires a clear physical interpretation or a logical explanation, providing, for instance, in a natural way the reason for the structure of complex algebra and the matrix structure of the formulation of Werner Heisenberg of quantum mechanics. Last but not least, the very general hypotheses assumed, allow one to state that quantum mechanics is the unique minimal description of physical reality.</p>

            <p>Proving threshold theorems for fault-tolerant quantum computation is a burdensome endeavor with many moving parts that come together in relatively formulaic but lengthy ways. It is difficult and rare to combine elements from multiple papers into a single formal threshold proof, due to the use of different measures of fault-tolerance. In this work, we introduce composable fault-tolerance, a framework that decouples the probabilistic analysis of the noise distribution from the combinatorial analysis of circuit correctness, and enables threshold proofs to compose independently analyzed gadgets easily and rigorously. Within this framework, we provide a library of standard and commonly used gadgets such as memory and logic implemented by constant-depth circuits for quantum low-density parity check codes and distillation. As sample applications, we explicitly write down a threshold proof for computation with surface code and re-derive the constant space-overhead fault-tolerant scheme of Gottesman using gadgets from this library. We expect that future fault-tolerance proofs may focus on the analysis of novel techniques while leaving the standard components to the composable fault-tolerance framework, with the formal proof following the intuitive ``napkin math'' exactly.</p>

            <h2>Can randomly structured metasurfaces be used for quantum tomography of high-dimensional spatial qudits?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuming Niu, Kai Wang</p>
            <p>Reconstructing the density matrix of the quantum state of photons through a tomographically complete set of measurements, known as quantum state tomography, is an essential task in nearly all applications of quantum science and technology, from quantum sensing to quantum communications. Recent advances in optical metasurfaces enable the design of ultra-thin nanostructured optical elements performing such state tomography tasks, promising greater simplicity, miniaturization, and scalability. However, reported metasurfaces on this goal were limited to a small Hilbert dimension, e.g., polarization qubits or spatial qudits with only a few states. When scaling up to higher-dimensional qudit tomography problems, especially those involving spatial qudits, a natural question arises: whether a metasurface with randomized nanostructures is sufficient to perform such qudit tomography, achieving optimal conditions. In this work, we attempt to answer this question through a set of numerical experiments with random metasurfaces, utilizing large-scale simulations of over 11,000 distinct metasurfaces each exceeding 200 wavelengths in size. We show that with sufficient redundancy in the number of detectors, random metasurfaces perform reasonably well in quantum photonic spatial qudit tomography encoded in Hermite-Gaussian states for up to approximately 10 states. Furthermore, we discuss additional considerations for optimizing metasurfaces in multi-photon cases. Our work opens a pathway toward computationally efficient, miniaturized, and error-tolerant quantum measurement platforms.</p>

            <p>We formulate exact sum rules (ESRs) and zeta generating formulas (ZGFs) for quantum mechanics defined by the ${\cal PT}$-symmetric potential $V_{\cal PT}(x) = x^{2K} (ix)^\varepsilon$ with $K,\varepsilon \in \mathbb{N}$, as well as the Hermitian potential $V_{\cal H}(x) = x^{2 K}$ with $K \in {\mathbb N} + 1$, based on the fusion relations of the $A_{2M-1}$ T-system in the framework of the ODE/IM correspondence. In this setup, the fusion relations on the integrable model (IM) side correspond to recurrence relations among quantization conditions on the ordinary differential equation (ODE) side, which we reformulate in terms of spectral zeta functions (SZFs), $\zeta_n(s) = \sum_{\alpha \in {\mathbb N}_0} E_{n,\alpha}^{-s}$, where $n$ denotes the fusion label. The ESRs yield algebraic relations among SZFs at fixed $n$, while the ZGFs establish explicit functional mappings between SZFs at different fusion labels. These structures are governed by a selection rule depending on both $M$ and $n$, induced in general by the combination of the structure of the Chebyshev polynomials appearing in the fusion relations and the $\mathbb{Z}_{2M+2}$ Symanzik rotational symmetry. Our results provide a novel spectral interpretation of the T-system in integrable models and point toward hidden algebraic structures governing global spectral data in $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric and Hermitian quantum mechanics.</p>

            <p>Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for producing high-fidelity data samples, yet their performance is constrained by the quality of latent representations, typically sampled from classical noise distributions. This study investigates hybrid quantum-classical GANs (HQCGANs) in which a quantum generator, implemented via parameterised quantum circuits, produces latent vectors for a classical discriminator. We evaluate a classical GAN alongside three HQCGAN variants with 3, 5, and 7 qubits, using Qiskit's AerSimulator with realistic noise models to emulate near-term quantum devices. The binary MNIST dataset (digits 0 and 1) is used to align with the low-dimensional latent spaces imposed by current quantum hardware. Models are trained for 150 epochs and assessed with Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and Kernel Inception Distance (KID). Results show that while the classical GAN achieved the best scores, the 7-qubit HQCGAN produced competitive performance, narrowing the gap in later epochs, whereas the 3-qubit model exhibited earlier convergence limitations. Efficiency analysis indicates only moderate training time increases despite quantum sampling overhead. These findings validate the feasibility of noisy quantum circuits as latent priors in GAN architectures, highlighting their potential to enhance generative modelling within the constraints of the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arash Azizi</p>
            <p>Non-Gaussian states are essential for achieving a quantum advantage in continuous-variable (CV) information processing. Among these, superpositions of squeezed states offer a rich phenomenology, yet a complete analytical understanding of their higher-order quantum statistics-such as the transition from extreme bunching ($g^{(k)} \to \infty$) to suppression ($g^{(k>2)} \to 0$)-has remained elusive. In this work, we introduce and provide an exact solution for the displaced Janus state-a coherent superposition of two squeezed coherent states. We develop a powerful analytical framework built upon a new family of Generalized Squeezing Polynomials that yields closed-form expressions for its arbitrary-order coherence functions, Wigner function, and quantum Fisher information. This enables a full characterization of the state's tunable non-Gaussianity, revealing how quantum interference can transform the extreme photon bunching of its components into strong antibunching or perfect multiphoton suppression. We identify parameter regimes that generate Wigner negativity and can be harnessed for achieving Heisenberg-limited metrological precision. Our work provides a foundational toolkit for engineering non-Gaussian states, establishing the displaced Janus state as a key resource for hybrid quantum protocols and fault-tolerant CV computation.</p>

            <p>Qubit-resolved operations and measurements are required for most current quantum information processing schemes. However, these operations can be experimentally costly due to the need for local addressing, demanding significant classical control. A more resource-efficient alternative to extract information is uniform measurement, where a site-independent rotation of qubits is performed before measuring in the computational basis. This operation can be performed in parallel, or globally, in atom- and ion-based platforms, reducing resource cost and increasing fidelity. In this work, we initiate the exploration of the utility of this operation in quantum information processing. In particular, we demonstrate that uniform measurements can certify certain graph states, a family of highly entangled and broadly useful quantum states. We provide a sample-efficient certification algorithm with a proved performance guarantee, together with an experimental scheme based on analog-mode Rydberg atom arrays. Uniform measurements, therefore, allow direct and efficient characterization of quantum states on quantum platforms in a hitherto unexplored manner.</p>

We show that this system offers excellent scaling properties, characterized by engineered zero $ZZ$-crosstalk in the idle regime, a substantial reduction of level-crowding challenges through the alternating arrangement of different qubit types within the lattice, and parameter regimes that circumvent the capacitive loading problem commonly associated with fluxoniums. In numerical simulations, we show a parametrically driven CZ-gate that achieves a closed-system infidelity that is orders of magnitude below the coherence limit for gate durations $\gtrsim 30\,\rm{ns}$ using a two-tone flux pulse on the tunable coupler. Furthermore, we show that this gate scheme retains its fidelity in the presence of spectator qubits, making it a scalable solution for large lattices. Moreover, for the implementation of error correcting codes, our approach can leverage the long coherence times and large non-linearities of fluxoniums as data qubits, while fixed-frequency transmons with established readout techniques can serve as measurement ancillas.</p>

We show that the interference between time-separated pulses depends on the relative phase and time between the pulses of light. The use of a quantum memory enables us to illuminate exactly where and how interference occurs between time separated pulses. Time-frequency Fourier manipulation is a well established technique in classical optical systems.

The system supports static bound states with persistent atomic excitations, and oscillating bound states with periodic atom-photon or atom-atom excitation exchange. Under certain conditions, oscillating bound states can contain more harmonic components owing to the emergence of additional quasi-dark modes, rendering them promising platforms for high-capacity quantum information processing.

            <p>Carrier transport in quantum networks is governed by a variety of factors, including network dimensionality and connectivity, on-site energies, couplings between sites and whether they are short- or long-range, and environmental effects. In this work, we identify classes of quasi-one-dimensional chains with energy profiles that optimize carrier transport under such influences. Specifically, we optimize on-site energies using Optax's optimistic gradient descent and AdaMax algorithms, enabled by the JAX automatic differentiation framework. Focusing on steady-state transport, we study the system's behavior under combined unitary and nonunitary (dephasing and dissipative) effects using the Lindblad quantum master equation. After validating our optimization scheme on short chains, we extend the study to larger systems where we identify systematic patterns in energy profiles. Our analysis reveals that different types of energy landscape enhance transport, depending on whether inter-site tunneling couplings in the chain are short- or long-range, the existence of environmental interactions, and the temperature of the environment. Our classification and insights of optimal energy landscapes offer guidance for designing efficient transport systems for electronic, photovoltaic and quantum communication applications.</p>

            <h2>Lifshitz-like Metastability and Optimal Dephasing in Dissipative Bosonic Lattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stefano Longhi</p>
            <p>In dissipative bosonic systems, dephasing is typically expected to accelerate relaxation and suppress coherent dynamics. However, we show that in networks of coherently coupled bosonic modes with non-uniform local dissipation, the presence of quasi-dark states leads to a nontrivial response to dephasing: while weak dephasing facilitates equilibration, moderate to strong dephasing induces a pronounced slowdown of relaxation, revealing the existence of an optimal dephasing rate that enhances equilibration. Using exact dynamical equations for second-order moments, we demonstrate that dephasing suppresses coherent transport and gives rise to long-lived collective modes that dominate the system's late-time behavior. This phenomenon bears striking similarities to Lifshitz-tail states, which are known in disordered systems to cause anomalously slow relaxation. Our results uncover a counterintuitive mechanism by which dephasing, rather than promoting equilibration, can dynamically decouple specific modes from dissipation, thereby protecting excitations. These findings highlight how non-Hermitian physics in open bosonic systems can give rise to unexpected dynamical regimes, paving the way for new strategies to control relaxation and decoherence in bosonic quantum systems, with broad implications for both experimental and theoretical quantum science.</p>

            <h2>Hybrid Optomechanical Cooling with Kerr Magnons and Squeezed Vacuum</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiao-Hong Fan, Qin-Geng Chen, Jiaojiao Chen, Wei Xiong</p>
            <p>Ground-state cooling is essential for accessing the quantum regime and enabling quantum control of macroscopic systems. However, achieving optomechanical cooling in the unresolved-sideband regime ($\omega_b < \kappa$) remains challenging. In this Letter, we propose an efficient cooling strategy based on a hybrid optomechanical system incorporating a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere embedded in an optomechanical cavity. Under strong cavity driving, the Kerr nonlinearity of the magnons hosted in the YIG sphere gives rise to a two-magnon process. Adiabatic elimination of the magnons yields an effective two-photon process in the cavity, which destructively interferes with all dissipative channels, surpassing the quantum backaction limit and enabling \textit{complete suppression} of heating under optimal conditions, even in the deeply unresolved sideband regime (DUSR: $\omega_b \ll \kappa$). Moreover, injecting squeezed vacuum noise into the cavity not only preserves these advantages but also delivers additional enhancements, including higher net cooling rates, reduced optomechanical coupling requirements, and improved noise robustness. Comparative analysis shows that our approach outperforms existing schemes without Kerr magnons, underscoring the potential of integrating nonlinear magnonics with optomechanics for quantum control of macroscopic mechanical systems.</p>

            <h2>Quantum statistics of single-mode radiation emitted by superradiant Dicke states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. Yadav, D. D. Yavuz</p>
            <p>We study the quantum statistics of single-mode radiation emitted by an atomic ensemble when the ensemble is initially prepared in a superradiant Dicke state. We show that while the radiation is well approximated by the Glauber coherent state at early times in the evolution, the emission can be truly quantum at later times. In particular, one can observe a large amount of photon-number squeezing in the emission under certain conditions; even a Fock state can be produced. We discuss the quantum statistics of the emission for various parameters, including different initial conditions for the atomic ensemble. To obtain these results, we have developed a formalism where we are able to calculate the quantum statistics of the emission over long time-scales even when the number of atoms in the ensemble is quite large.</p>

            <p>We investigate entanglement mediated by DC current induced nonreciprocal graphene plasmon polaritons. Nonreciprocal systems are ideal for the enhancement, control, and preservation of entanglement due to the potential for unidirectional beam-like wave propagation, i.e., efficiently transporting photons from one emitter to another. Using a quantum master equation and three-dimensional Green's function analysis, we investigate a system consisting of two two-level emitters dominantly interacting via electric current induced nonreciprocal plasmonic modes of a graphene waveguide. We use concurrence as a measure of entanglement. We show that nonreciprocal graphene plasmon polaritons are a promising candidate to generate and mediate concurrence, where it is shown that there is good enhancement and control of entanglement over vacuum, which is beneficial for the broad applications of entanglement as a quantum resource. We believe our findings contribute to the development of quantum devices, enabling efficient and tunable entanglement between two-level systems, which is a central goal in quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>Quantum computing with discrete variable (DV, qubit) hardware is approaching the large scales necessary for computations beyond the reach of classical computers. However, important use cases such as quantum simulations of physical models containing bosonic modes, and quantum error correction are challenging for DV-only systems. Separately, hardware containing native continuous-variable (CV, oscillator) systems has received attention as an alternative approach, yet the universal control of such systems is non-trivial. In this work, we show that hybrid CV-DV hardware offers a great advantage in meeting these challenges, offering a powerful computational paradigm that inherits the strengths of both DV and CV processors. We provide a pedagogical introduction to CV-DV systems and the multiple abstraction layers needed to produce a full software stack connecting applications to hardware. We present a variety of new hybrid CV-DV compilation techniques, algorithms, and applications, including the extension of quantum signal processing concepts to CV-DV systems and strategies to simulate systems of interacting spins, fermions, and bosons. To facilitate the development of hybrid CV-DV processor systems, we introduce formal Abstract Machine Models and Instruction Set Architectures -- essential abstractions that enable developers to formulate applications, compile algorithms, and explore the potential of current and future hardware for realizing fault-tolerant circuits, modules, and processors. Hybrid CV-DV quantum computations are beginning to be performed in superconducting, trapped ion, and neutral atom platforms, and large-scale experiments are set to be demonstrated in the near future. We present a timely and comprehensive guide to this relatively unexplored yet promising approach to quantum computation and providing an architectural backbone to guide future development.</p>

            <h2>Scalable Quantum Simulations of Scattering in Scalar Field Theory on 120 Qubits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nikita A. Zemlevskiy</p>
            <p>Simulations of collisions of fundamental particles on a quantum computer are expected to have an exponential advantage over classical methods and promise to enhance searches for new physics. Furthermore, scattering in scalar field theory has been shown to be BQP-complete, making it a representative problem for which quantum computation is efficient. As a step toward large-scale quantum simulations of collision processes, scattering of wavepackets in one-dimensional scalar field theory is simulated using 120 qubits of IBM's Heron superconducting quantum computer ibm_fez. Variational circuits compressing vacuum preparation, wavepacket initialization, and time evolution are determined using classical resources. By leveraging physical properties of states in the theory, such as symmetries and locality, the variational quantum algorithm constructs scalable circuits that can be used to simulate arbitrarily-large system sizes. A new strategy is introduced to mitigate errors in quantum simulations, which enables the extraction of meaningful results from circuits with up to 4924 two-qubit gates and two-qubit gate depths of 103. The effect of interactions is clearly seen, and is found to be in agreement with classical Matrix Product State simulations. The developments that will be necessary to simulate high-energy inelastic collisions on a quantum computer are discussed.</p>

            <h2>Doubly-polylog-time-overhead fault-tolerant quantum computation by a polylog-time parallel minimum-weight perfect matching decoder</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yugo Takada, Hayata Yamasaki</p>
            <p>Reducing space and time overheads of fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC) has been receiving increasing attention as it is crucial for the development of quantum computers and also plays a fundamental role in understanding the feasibility and limitations of realizing quantum advantages. Shorter time overheads are particularly essential for demonstrating quantum computational speedups without compromising runtime advantages. However, surpassing the conventional polylogarithmic (polylog) scaling of time overheads has remained a significant challenge, since it requires addressing all potential bottlenecks, including the nonzero runtime of classical computation for decoding in practical implementations. In this work, we construct a protocol that achieves FTQC with doubly polylog time overhead while maintaining the conventional polylog space overhead. The key to our approach is the development of a highly parallelizable minimum-weight perfect matching (MWPM) decoder, which achieves a polylog parallel runtime in terms of the code size while providing theoretical guarantees on threshold existence and overhead bounds. Our protocol integrates this decoder with a topological-code protocol that incorporates single-shot decoding for efficient syndrome extraction; furthermore, we concatenate this with the concatenated Steane codes to guarantee the existence of the threshold while avoiding a backlog problem, enabling us to achieve doubly polylog time overheads even when accounting for the decoder's runtime. These results suggest the feasibility of surpassing the conventional polylog-time-overhead barrier, opening a new frontier in low-overhead FTQC.</p>

            <h2>Non-Perturbative Topological Gadgets for Many-Body Coupling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Headley, Nicholas Chancellor</p>
            <p>Continuous-time quantum hardware implementations generally lack the native capability to implement high-order terms that would facilitate efficient compilation of quantum algorithms. This limitation has, in part, motivated the development of perturbative gadgets -- multi-qubit constructions used to effect a desired Hamiltonian using engineered low-energy subspaces of a larger system constructed using simpler, usually two-body, primitives. In this work, we demonstrate how a class of non-perturbative gadgets can produce high-order multi-body interactions by taking advantage of the odd-even properties of topological defect subspaces. The simplest example is based on domain-wall defects forming an effective Ising spin-chain based on three-body coupling with linear connectivity, alongside three-, or five-body driving terms depending on the intended use. Although this will be the main focus of the paper due to conceptual simplicity, there exist systems constructed with only two-body couplings where the boundaries determine whether there are an odd or even number of defects, namely ice-like systems which may yield more complex gadget-like constructions.</p>

            <p>The creation of large-scale, high-fidelity quantum computers is not only a fundamental scientific endeavour in itself, but also provides increasingly robust proofs of quantum computational advantage (QCA) in the presence of unavoidable noise and the dynamic competition with classical algorithm improvements. To overcome the biggest challenge of photon-based QCA experiments, photon loss, we report new Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) experiments with 1024 high-efficiency squeezed states injected into a hybrid spatial-temporal encoded, 8176-mode, programmable photonic quantum processor, Jiuzhang 4.0, which produces up to 3050 photon detection events. Our experimental results outperform all classical spoofing algorithms, particularly the matrix product state (MPS) method, which was recently proposed to utilise photon loss to reduce the classical simulation complexity of GBS. Using the state-of-the-art MPS algorithm on the most powerful supercomputer EI Capitan, it would take > $10^{42}$ years to construct the required tensor network for simulation, while our Jiuzhang 4.0 quantum computer takes 25.6 $\mu$s to produce a sample. This work establishes a new frontier of QCA and paves the way to fault-tolerant photonic quantum computing hardware.</p>

            <p>Optically addressed atomic defects in the solid-state are widely used as single-photon sources and memories for quantum network applications. The solid-state environment allows for a high density of electron and nuclear spins with the potential to form registers for coherent information processing. However, it is challenging to reliably address individual spins at nanometer separations where interactions are large. Rare-earth ions offer a unique solution, as their narrow homogeneous optical linewidth allows frequency-domain resolution of a large number of emitters without regard to their spatial separation. In this work, we realize coherent optical and spin control of a pair of interacting Er$^{3+}$ ions, together with a nearby nuclear spin ancilla. We demonstrate two-qubit electron-electron gates and use them to perform repeated quantum non-demolition measurements on one of the Er$^{3+}$ ions. We also demonstrate electron-nuclear gates to allow coherent storage and retrieval of qubit information in a nuclear spin, and show that the nuclear spin coherence survives readout of the electron spin. These techniques can be readily scaled to larger numbers of electron and nuclear spins, paving the way for massively multiplexed quantum network nodes.</p>

            <p>We study the quantum Newman-Moore model, or quantum triangular plaquette model (qTPM), in the presence of a longitudinal field (qTPMz). We present evidence that indicates that the ground state phase diagram of the qTPMz includes various frustrated phases breaking translational symmetries, dependent on the specific sequence of system sizes used to take the large-size limit. This phase diagram includes the known first-order phase transition of the qTPM, but also additional first-order transitions due to the frustrated phases. Using the average longitudinal magnetization as an order parameter, we analyze the magnetization plateaus that characterize the ground state phases, describe their degeneracies, and obtain the qTPMz phase diagram using classical transfer matrix and quantum matrix product state techniques. We identify a region of parameter space which can be effectively described by a Rydberg blockade model on the triangular lattice and also find indications of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order connecting the quantum paramagnetic and classical frustrated phases.</p>

            <p>The dynamical trajectory of a dissipative Rydberg many-body system could be flipped under a microwave field driving, displaying an enhanced sensitivity. This is because the intersection of the folded hysteresis trajectories exhibits a sharp peak near the phase transition, amplifying the response to small changes in the microwave field. Here, we demonstrate an experiment of enhanced metrology through flipping the hysteresis trajectory in a cold atomic system, displaying an approach to improve sensitivity near the gap-closing points. By measuring the intersection points of hysteresis trajectories versus Rabi frequency of the microwave field, we quantify the equivalent sensitivity to be 1.6(5) nV cm-1 Hz-1/2. The measurement is also dependent on the interaction time, optical depth and principal quantum number since the long-range interaction between Rydberg atoms could dramatically change the shape of hysteresis trajectories. The reported results suggest that flipping trajectory features in cold Rydberg many-body systems could advance sensing and metrology applications.</p>

            <h2>Untwisted and Twisted R√©nyi Negativities: Toward a R√©nyi Proxy for Logarithmic Negativity in Fermionic Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fo-Hong Wang, Xiao Yan Xu</p>
            <p>Entanglement entropy is a fundamental measure of quantum entanglement for pure states, but for large-scale many-body systems, R√©nyi entanglement entropy is much more computationally accessible. For mixed states, logarithmic negativity (LN) serves as a widely used entanglement measure, but its direct computation is often intractable, leaving R√©nyi negativity (RN) as the practical alternative. In fermionic systems, RN is further classified into untwisted and twisted types, depending on the definition of the fermionic partial transpose. However, which of these serves as the true R√©nyi proxy for LN has remained unclear -- until now. In this work, we address this question by developing a robust quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) method to compute both untwisted and twisted RNs, focusing on the rank-4 twisted RN, where non-trivial behavior emerges. We identify and overcome two major challenges: the singularity of the Green's function matrix and the exponentially large variance of RN estimators. Our method is demonstrated in the Hubbard model and the spinless $t$-$V$ model, revealing critical distinctions between untwisted and twisted RNs, as well as between rank-2 and high-rank RNs. Remarkably, we find that the twisted R√©nyi negativity ratio (RNR) adheres to the area law and decreases monotonically with temperature, in contrast to the untwisted RNR but consistent with prior studies of bosonic systems. This study not only establishes the twisted RNR as a more pertinent R√©nyi proxy for LN in fermionic systems but also provides comprehensive technical details for the stable and efficient computation of high-rank RNs. Our work lays the foundation for future studies of mixed-state entanglement in large-scale fermionic many-body systems.</p>

            <p>The fuzzy onion model formed by connecting a set of concentric fuzzy spheres of increasing radius is motivated by studies of quantum space but can also be used to study standard physics. The main feature of the model is that functions in three-dimensional space -- like scalar fields or wavefunctions -- are expressed in terms of Hermitian matrices of a certain structure. Relevant equations are then matrix equations, and some problems, such as searching for the energy spectrum for fixed quantum numbers $(l,m)$, can be expressed as an eigenvalue problem. We show how this simple approach can reproduce the results of other studies analyzing the hydrogen atom in a spherical cavity. We also test the effect of the short-distance quantum structure of the space on these solutions -- not looking for the phenomenological consequences, as the scale of quantum space is many orders below the order of the Bohr radius, but to understand the effect of quantum space in general. We observe a set of solutions without a classical counterpart which have been suggested also in a former theoretical study.</p>

            <p>Single neutral atoms in optical tweezer arrays offer a promising platform for high-fidelity quantum computing at local nodes. Nonetheless, creating entanglement between remote nodes in a distributed quantum network remains challenging due to inherently weak atom-light coupling. Here, we design a distributed quantum network architecture in which cold atomic ensembles with strong atom-light interactions act as quantum antennas, interfacing single-atom qubits with flying photons to enable high-efficiency atom-photon entanglement generation -- analogous to the role of antennas in classical communication. Using realistic experimental parameters, we estimate an efficiency of $\eta \simeq 0.548$ for generating atom-photon entanglement, a probability of $P_{E} \simeq 6 \%$ for generating atom-atom entanglement, and a remote entanglement generation rate of $16.6 $ kHz. This performance not only surpasses that of state-of-the-art cavity-based or high-numerical-aperture-lens-based architectures but also offers notable advantages in simplicity, tunability, and experimental accessibility. Our scheme also integrates a long-lived quantum memory, providing a storage advantage for quantum repeater design. By leveraging the complementary strengths of single-atom qubits for local operations and cold atomic ensembles for networking, this approach paves the way for scalable distributed quantum computing and sensing.</p>

We demonstrate the split spectroscopy exhibits a single delta-function peak if and only if the investigated eigenstate is triseparable. Our framework is illustrated using two paradigmatic spin models that undergo quantum phase transitions. Furthermore, we show that the spectral entropy serves as a powerful indicator of quantum phase transitions and captures the scaling behavior of entanglement.

            <p>In this study, the energy spectrum and thermal equilibrium states of the finite-size Dicke-Stark model were numerically obtained within the extended coherent state space by solving the dressed master equation for strongly coupled light-atom systems. The critical point of the superradiant phase transition in the infinite-size Dicke-Stark model was analytically derived using the mean-field approach and confirmed with numerical calculation. Under thermal equilibrium conditions, analyses of the negativity, zero-time-delay two-photon correlation function, and atom-spin squeezing parameters in the finite-size Dicke-Stark model reveal that as the coupling strength increases, the light field undergoes a transition from photon bunching to anti-bunching and then back to bunching. The Stark field can modulate both the maximum and minimum values of the two-photon correlation function and their corresponding coupling strengths. At low temperatures, the system exhibits entanglement and spin squeezing. As temperature rises, entanglement gradually diminishes, while strong coupling facilitates the preservation of entanglement in the system state. Atom-spin squeezing spin squeezing is highly sensitive to temperature and vanishes rapidly with increasing temperature. This work contributes to the fundamental understanding of quantum phenomena in Dicke-Stark systems.</p>

            <p>Quantum emitters coupled to one-dimensional waveguides constitute a paradigmatic quantum-optical platform for exploring collective phenomena in open quantum many-body systems. For appropriately spaced emitters, they realize the Dicke model, whose characteristic permutation symmetry allows for efficient exact solutions featuring superradiance.

In this work, we introduce a novel numerical method to study the dynamics of such systems by extending the time-dependent neural quantum state (t-NQS) framework to open quantum systems. We benchmark our approach across a range of waveguide QED settings and compare its performance with tensor-network calculations. Our results demonstrate that the t-NQS approach is competitive with other numerical methods and highlight the potential of t-NQSs for studying open quantum many-body systems out of equilibrium.</p>

            <p>The advantage of attosecond measurements is the possibility of time-resolving ultrafast quantum phenomena of electron dynamics. Many such measurements are of interferometric nature, and therefore give access to the phase. Likewise, weak measurements are intrinsically interferometric and specifically take advantage of interfering probability amplitudes, therefore encoding the phase information of the process. In this work, we show that attosecond interferometry experiments can be seen as a weak measurement, which unveils how this notion is connected to strong field physics and attosecond science. In particular, we show how the electron trajectory picks up a new phase, which occurs due to the weak measurement of the process. This phase can show significant contributions in the presence of spectral features of the measured system. Furthermore, extending this approach to include non-classical driving fields shows that the generated harmonics exhibit non-trivial features in their quantum state and photon statistics. This opens the path towards investigations of attosecond quantum interferometry experiments.</p>

            <p>We explore the competition between light-mediated and intrinsic matter-matter interactions in waveguide quantum electrodynamics. For this, we couple a superconducting transmission line to a model magnetic material, made of organic free radical molecules with a spin $S=1/2$ and a $g_{S}$ factor very close to that of a free electron. The microwave transmission has been measured in a wide range of temperatures ($0.013$ K $\leq T \leq 2$ K), magnetic fields ($0\leq B \leq 0.5$ T) and frequencies ($0 \leq \omega/2 \pi \leq 14$ GHz). We find that molecules belonging to one of the two crystal sublattices form one-dimensional spin chains. Temperature then controls the intrinsic correlations along these chains in a continuous and monotonic way. In the paramagnetic region ($T > 0.7$ K), the microwave transmission shows evidences for the collective coupling of quasi-identical spins to the propagating photons, with coupling strengths that reach values close to the dissipation rates. As $T$ decreases, the growth of spin correlations, combined with the anisotropy in the spin-spin exchange constants, tend to suppress the collective spin-photon coupling. In this regime, the spin visibility in transmission reflects also a gradual change in the nature of the dominant spin excitations, from single spin flips to bosonic magnons.</p>

            <h2>Sub-Poissonian Light in a Waveguide Kerr-medium</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> R. Singh, A. E. Teretenkov, A. V. Masalov</p>
            <p>Waveguides on a chip represent a new medium for implementing nonlinear optical transformations of light. Modern $\text{Si}_3\text{N}_4$ chip waveguides are attractive due to their high Kerr nonlinearity, suppressed Brillouin scattering on guided acoustic waves (GAWBS), and lengths up to one meter. The capabilities of waveguides for generating sub-Poissonian light in the form of a displaced Kerr state are analyzed. We offer new analytical formulas for estimating the capabilities of suppressing photon fluctuations of a displaced Kerr state for any value of input light amplitude. The results of numerical calculations are presented. It is shown that the degree of photon noise suppression can reach values of 5 - 15 dB with 100 mW light power in waveguides a few meters long.</p>

            <h2>A quantum computing approach to efficiently simulating correlated materials using impurity models and dynamical mean field theory</h2>

            <p>The accurate theoretical description of materials with strongly correlated electrons is a formidable challenge, at the forefront of condensed matter physics and computational chemistry alike, and it is one of the targets for quantum computing. Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT) is a successful approach that predicts behaviors of such systems by incorporating some correlated behavior, but it is limited by the need to calculate the Green's function for the impurity model. This work proposes a framework for DMFT calculations on quantum computers, focusing on near-term applications. It leverages the structure of the impurity problem, combining a low-rank Gaussian subspace representation of the ground state and a compressed, short-depth quantum circuit that joins the Gaussian state preparation with the time evolution to compute the necessary Green's functions. We demonstrate the convergence of the DMFT algorithm using the Gaussian subspace in a noise-free setting, and show the hardware viability of the circuit compression by extracting the impurity Green's function on IBM quantum processors for a single impurity coupled to three bath orbitals (8 physical qubits and 1 ancilla). We discuss the potential paths forward towards realizing this use case of quantum computing in materials science.</p>

            <h2>Learning to stabilize nonequilibrium phases of matter with active feedback using partial information</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giovanni Cemin, Markus Schmitt, Marin Bukov</p>
            <p>We investigate the role of information in active feedback control of quantum many-body systems using reinforcement learning. Active feedback breaks detailed balance, enabling the engineering of steady states and dynamical phases of matter otherwise inaccessible in equilibrium. We train reinforcement learning agents using partial state information to prevent entanglement spreading in (1+1)-dimensional stabilizer circuits with up to 128 qubits. We find that, above a critical information threshold, learned near-optimal strategies are non-greedy, stochastic, and reduce volume-law entangled steady states to area-law scaling. The agents achieve this by placing a series of bottlenecks that induce pyramidal structures in the long-time spatial entanglement distribution, which effectively split the system and reduce the maximum accessible entanglement. Crucially, learned strategies are inherently out of equilibrium and require real-time active feedback; we find that the learned behavior cannot be replaced by simple human-designed control rules. This work establishes the foundations for classically implemented, information-driven individual control of many interacting quantum degrees of freedom, demonstrating the capabilities of reinforcement learning to stabilize and uncover novel critical properties of many-body nonequilibrium steady states.</p>

            <h2>Nondegenerate Josephson Mixers with Enhanced Bandwidth and Saturation Power for Quantum Signal Amplification and Transduction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Baleegh Abdo, Dongbing Shao, Shayne Cairns, Jae-woong Nah, Oblesh Jinka, Srikanth Srinivasan, Thomas McConkey, Vincent Arena, Corrado Mancini</p>
            <p>Nondegenerate Josephson mixers (JMs), formed by coupling two different transmission-line resonators to Josephson ring modulators (JRMs), are vital and versatile devices capable of processing microwave signals at the quantum limit. Owing to the lossless nondegenerate three-wave mixing process enabled by the JRM, JMs can perform phase preserving amplification of quantum signals, generate two-mode squeezed states, and perform noiseless frequency conversion. However, due to their limited bandwidth and saturation power, such resonator-based JMs are generally unable to simultaneously process frequency-multiplexed signals required in large quantum processors. To overcome this longstanding dual challenge, we redesign the JRM parameters by optimizing its inductances to suppress higher order mixing products and engineer its electromagnetic environment by incorporating lumped-element coupled-mode networks between the JRM and the two distinct ports of the JM. By implementing these strategies, we measure for JMs realized with four coupled modes per port, operated in amplification (conversion), bandwidths of about 400 MHz (700 MHz) with power reflections above 10 dB (below -10 dB) and saturation powers of about -110 dBm at 15 dB (-91 dBm at -26 dB). Similarly, we demonstrate for a low external quality factor resonant-mode JM operated in conversion, a maximum bandwidth of about $670$ MHz with power reflections below -10 dB and a maximum saturation power of about -86 dBm at -17 dB. Such nondegenerate JMs with enhanced bandwidths and saturation powers could serve in a variety of frequency-multiplexed settings ranging from high fidelity qubit readout and unidirectional routing of quantum signals to generation of remote entanglement with continuous variables.</p>

            <p>Many quantum networking applications require efficient photonic interfaces to quantum memories which can be produced at scale and with high yield. Synthetic diamond offers unique potential for the implementation of this technology as it hosts color centers which retain coherent optical interfaces and long spin coherence times in nanophotonic structures. Here, we report a technique enabling wafer-scale processing of thin-film diamond that combines ion implantation and membrane liftoff, high-quality overgrowth, targeted color center implantation, and serial, high-throughput thermocompression bonding with yields approaching unity. The deterministic deposition of thin diamond membranes onto semiconductor substrates facilitates consistent integration of photonic crystal cavities with silicon-vacancy (SiV) quantum memories. We demonstrate reliable, strong coupling of SiVs to photons with cooperativities approaching 100. Furthermore, we show that photonic crystal cavities can be reliably fabricated across several membranes bonded to the same handling chip. Our platform enables modular fabrication where the photonic layer can be integrated with functionalized substrates featuring electronic control lines such as coplanar waveguides for microwave delivery. Finally, we implement passive optical packaging with sub-decibel insertion loss. Together, these advances pave the way to the scalable assembly of optically addressable quantum memory arrays which are a key building block for modular photonic quantum interconnects.</p>

            <h2>Rotation Errors Due to Field Quantization for Simultaneously Driven Atoms</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hunter Lindemann, Shanon Vuglar, Julio Gea-Banacloche</p>
            <p>When an electromagnetic field in a coherent or quasiclassical (e.g., squeezed) state is used to simultaneously drive an ensemble of two-level atoms, the quantum nature of the field will, in general, cause the final state of the atoms to differ from the one predicted for a totally classical field. This is a potential source of error in quantum logic gates in which the gate is the rotation of the atoms by a laser. In this paper, we use second order perturbation theory to find how this error scales with the number of atoms, $N$, being driven simultaneously, for an arbitrary rotation angle. The result depends on the initial atomic state: for some highly entangled states, and a field in a coherent state, the error may scale as $N^2$, yet we find that the average over a random distribution of initial states only scales as $N$. We discuss possible ways to mitigate the error, including the use of squeezed states, as well as adjusting the interaction time between the field and atoms to be different from what would be expected from the classical-field treatment.</p>

            <h2>Squeezed Magnons-Induced Nonreciprocal Entanglement in a Magnomechanical Cavity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ziyad Imara, Khadija El Anouz, ƒ∞lkay Demir, Abderrahim El Allati</p>
            <p>Magnomechanical cavities offer a new frontier in quantum electrodynamics that give rise to several significant theoretical and experimental results. In this paper, we propose a novel theoretical mechanism for achieving a nonreciprocal macroscopic entanglement between magnons, photons and phonons, based on the use of an alternative squeezed magnons method. Indeed, in contrast to conventional approaches, we show how precise control of the amplitude and phase of the squeezed mode allows to obtain a tunable nonreciprocity of entanglement. The magnons resulting from the collective motion of the spin in a macroscopic ferrimagnet become coupled to the microwave photons via magnetic dipole interaction and to the phonons via magnetostrictive interaction. Moreover, we establish that the proposed scheme achieves ideal nonreciprocity, which can be optimized by cavity-magnon coupling and bath temperature control. Finally, by using the parameters that are experimentally feasible with current technologies, this work provides new perspectives for hybrid magnon-based quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>Non-phase-matched spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) in atomically thin materials provides new degrees of freedom and enhanced quantum information capacity compared to conventional phase-matched sources. These systems emerged as promising platforms for quantum computing, communication, and imaging, with the potential to support higher-order nonlinear processes. However, direct observation of photon-pair emission from a monolayer has remained experimentally challenging. In this work, we theoretically modeled SPDC emission across the full angular space from a monolayer GaSe film and experimentally validated the model through measurements of both co- and counter-propagating photon pairs. We demonstrated two-photon quantum correlations in the telecom C-band from the thinnest SPDC source reported to date. The spatially symmetric, broadband emission predicted by theory was confirmed experimentally. Furthermore, we observed high-fidelity Bell states in the counter-propagating configuration, marking the first realization of polarization-entangled photon pairs from a monolayer. Our results revealed the emission characteristics of SPDC in the deeply subwavelength, non-phase-matched regime, and introduced atomically thin, counterpropagating SPDC as a scalable and integrable platform for programmable quantum state generation, extendable via moir√© superlattice engineering.</p>

            <h2>Optimal Quantum Estimation with Stabilizer-Based Local Measurements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jia-Xuan Liu, Hai-Long Shi, Chunfeng Wu, Sixia Yu</p>
            <p>A central challenge in quantum metrology is to identify optimal protocols under measurement constraints that reflect realistic experimental conditions, e.g., local measurements in multipartite scenarios. Here, we present a sufficient criterion for metrological schemes to saturate the quantum Cram√©r-Rao bound (QCRB) using local measurements, based on stabilizer formalism. In ideal settings, we show that graph states always admit local estimation protocols with an optimal estimation precision determined only by the underlying graph structure. A family of graph states is identified as probe states that achieve suboptimal precision scaling. In noisy environments, we construct several subspaces of probe states (mixed in general) that not only saturate the QCRB with local measurements but also maintain approximately invariant precision scaling. These subspaces offer multiple metrological advantages, including high precision, partial noise resilience, and noise-correcting capability prior to parameter encoding. Under dephasing noise, they exhibit markedly better performance than Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states. Our results advance the framework for local-measurement quantum metrology, achieving a robust trade-off between precision and noise tolerance.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tom Schmit, Catalin-Mihai Halati, Tobias Donner, Giovanna Morigi, Simon B. J√§ger</p>
            <p>Quantum gases of atoms and molecules in optical cavities offer a formidable laboratory for studying the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of long-range interacting systems. Multiple scattering of cavity photons mediate interactions, and the emerging phases of matter are determined by the interplay of photon-mediated forces, dissipation, and quantum and thermal fluctuations. Control of these dynamics requires a detailed understanding of the mechanisms at play. Due to the number of degrees of freedom, however, effective theoretical models often work in specific limits, where either the cavity field is treated as a semiclassical variable or the cavity state is a slightly perturbed vacuum state. In this work, we present the derivation of an effective Lindblad master equation for the dynamics of the sole motional variables of polarizable particles, such as atoms or molecules, that dispersively couple to the cavity field. The master equation is valid even for relatively large intracavity photon numbers, and is apt to study both the steady-state regime and the out-of-equilibrium dynamics where quantum fluctuations of the field seed the onset of macroscopic coherences. We validate the theoretical description by showing that it captures the dynamics across a wide temperature interval, from Doppler cooling down to the ultra-cold regime, and from weak to strong cavity-mediated interactions. Our theory provides a powerful framework for the description of the dynamics of quantum gases in cavities and permits, amongst others, to connect models and hypotheses of statistical mechanics with a versatile experimental platform.</p>

            <h2>$\bf A^2$-robust superradiant phase transition in hybrid qubit-cavity optomechanics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gang Liu, Wei Xiong</p>
            <p>The $\mathbf{A}^2$ term presents a fundamental challenge to realizing the superradiant phase transition (SPT) in cavity quantum electrodynamics. Here, we propose a hybrid quantum system enabling SPT regardless of the presence of the $\mathbf{A}^2$ term. The system consisting of a qubit, a mechanical mode, and an optical cavity, where the qubit and mechanical mode constitute a quantum Rabi model, while the mechanical mode and cavity form an optomechanical system. Crucially, the auxiliary cavity introduces a switchable $\mathbf{A}^2$ term that effectively counteracts or even fully eliminates the original $\mathbf{A}^2$ effect. This allows controllable observation of SPT, diagnosed via the second-order equal-time correlation function $g^{(2)}(0)$ of phonons. Furthermore, the auxiliary cavity exponentially reduces the critical coupling strength, significantly relaxing experimental requirements. Besides, we show that phonons in the normal phase are bunching, but coherent in the superradiant phase. Interestly, higher-order squeezing is found in both phases, with near-perfect higher-order squeezing achieved at SPT point, establishing it as a probe for SPT behavior. Our work demonstrates that hybridizing optomechanics and cavity quantum electrodynamics provides a promising route to accessing SPT physics in the presence of the $\mathbf{A}^2$ term.</p>

            <p>Quantum electrodynamics (QED), a cornerstone framework that describes light-matter interactions rooted in Abelian symmetries, renders the harnessing of synthetic non-Abelian gauge fields as a fundamental yet uncharted frontier. Here, we develop a general theory of light-matter interaction of quantum emitters embedded in non-Abelian photonic lattices. Based on analytical solutions to the non-Abelian Landau dressed states beyond the continuum limit, we reveal chiral photon emission and vortices with emergent nonreciprocity enabled by selective coupling between emitters and spin-momentum-locked bands. When coexisting with Abelian and non-Abelian magnetic fields, emitters hybridize with Landau dressed orbits to form spin-polarized, squeezed Landau polaritons that carry quantized angular momenta, with Rabi frequencies tunable via Landau levels and pseudospin interactions. Multi-emitter dynamics further exhibit collective phenomena governed by real-space staggered phases induced by nonsymmorphic crystalline symmetry. These results bridge non-Abelian physics with quantum optics, and establish non-Abelian gauge fields as a versatile tool for synthesizing topological quantum optical states, angular momentum transfer, and controlling photon-mediated correlations in QED systems, relevant for applications in quantum simulations and chiral quantum optical networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akihiko Sekine, Ryo Murakami, Yoshiyasu Doi</p>
            <p>The quantum transduction, or equivalently quantum frequency conversion, between microwave and optical photons is essential for realizing scalable quantum computers with superconducting qubits. Due to the large frequency difference between microwave and optical ranges, the transduction needs to be done via intermediate bosonic modes or nonlinear processes. Regarding the transduction mediated by magnons, previous studies have so far utilized ferromagnetic magnons in ferromagnets. Here, we formulate a theory for the microwave-to-optical quantum transduction mediated by antiferromagnetic magnons in antiferromagnets. We derive analytical expressions for the transduction efficiency in the cases with and without an optical cavity, where a microwave cavity is used in both cases. In contrast to the case of the quantum transduction using ferromagnets, we find that the quantum transduction can occur even in the absence of an external static magnetic field. We also find that, in the case with an optical cavity the transduction efficiency takes a peak structure with respect to the sample thickness, indicating that there exists an optimal thickness, whereas in the case without an optical cavity the transduction efficiency is a monotonically increasing function of the sample thickness. Our study opens up a way for possible applications of antiferromagnetic materials in future quantum interconnects.</p>

            <p>We investigate how low-frequency gravitational waves (LFGWs), originating from distant astrophysical or cosmological sources, can induce purely quantum geometric phases in mesoscopic optomechanical systems. These phases represent subtle imprints with no classical counterpart, going beyond standard dynamical or Berry-type contributions that admit Hannay-angle analogues. Such ultra-weak waves couple to the motion of a mechanical mirror and generate distinctive phase shifts in the system's quantum state that cannot arise in any classical description. To access this effect, we propose a Ramsey-type interferometric protocol in which the photon-number states of a quantized optical mode become entangled with the mirror's center-of-mass motion, enabling a direct readout of the LFGW-induced geometric phase. This framework establishes a distinctly quantum approach for probing low-frequency gravitational wave modes, offering an alternative to conventional detection strategies based on spacetime strain.</p>

A crucial but elusive step towards realizing this platform is to engineer a device with a high-quality factor mechanical mode while preserving the bulk-like coherence of embedded spins. Here we demonstrate sideband-resolved diamond OMCs with mechanical quality factors in excess of $10^6$ at cryogenic temperatures, and find coherence times up to $T_2$ = 270 $\mu$s for embedded nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers. Furthermore, we measure these devices across five orders of magnitude in intracavity optical power, demonstrating robust power handling and a high optomechanical cooperativity ($C\gg1$) at cryogenic temperatures that is essential for a broad range of quantum protocols requiring strong, coherent interactions between photons and phonons. These results are enabled by a robust, high-throughput method for forming single-crystal diamond membranes in combination with chemical vapor deposition (CVD) diamond overgrowth with nitrogen $\delta$-doping.

            <p>Recently, it was shown that quantum interference in a system containing a polarized and unpolarized emitter can allow directional emission of photons into a circulating cavity. Here, we ask whether high directionality of photon emission in this system implies a high degree of quantum correlation between the two emitters. We show that the answer is a qualified "yes", with photon emission directionality and emitter-emitter entanglement showing a monotonic relationship over a broad parameter range. The relationship only breaks down in the limit of perfect directionality. Furthermore, under reasonable assumptions for experimental parameters and stability, we show that the statistics of measured directionality allow a reliable estimate of the concurrence. This result implies that directionality of photon emission in the state preparation stage can be used to determine the entanglement between the emitters, with potential applications to more generic cases including quantum networks.</p>

All-optical control is achieved via phase modulation of a signal field detuned from the near-degenerate two-photon absorption ladder in warm rubidium vapor. The ultimate performance of our switch, combining both speed and efficiency, will find applications in active multiplexing, loop-based quantum memory, and feedforward for quantum error-correction protocols.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Geometric Phases as a New Window on Gravitational Waves</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Partha Nandi Frederik G. Scholtz</p>
            <p>We investigate how low-frequency gravitational waves (LFGWs), originating from distant astrophysical or cosmological sources, can induce purely quantum geometric phases in mesoscopic optomechanical systems. These phases represent subtle imprints with no classical counterpart, going beyond standard dynamical or Berry-type contributions that admit Hannay-angle analogues. Such ultra-weak waves couple to the motion of a mechanical mirror and generate distinctive phase shifts in the system's quantum state that cannot arise in any classical description. To access this effect, we propose a Ramsey-type interferometric protocol in which the photon-number states of a quantized optical mode become entangled with the mirror's center-of-mass motion, enabling a direct readout of the LFGW-induced geometric phase. This framework establishes a distinctly quantum approach for probing low-frequency gravitational wave modes, offering an alternative to conventional detection strategies based on spacetime strain.</p>

            <h2>Magnetization-induced reordering of ground states phase diagram in a two-component Bose-Hubbard model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oskar Stachowiak, Hubert Dunikowski, Emilia Witkowska</p>
            <p>We investigate the influence of non-zero magnetization on the ground-state phase diagram of the two-component Bose-Hubbard model. Employing a mean-field theoretical framework, both analytically and numerically, we demonstrate that positions and sizes of specific phases on the diagram are magnetization dependent. In particular, non-zero magnetization introduces different Mott insulator phase boundaries for each of the two components. This effect leads to the emergence of a hybrid phase characterized by the coexistence of superfluid in one of the components and Mott insulator in the another one. Our findings highlight the important role of a conserved quantities, which is magnetization here, in reshaping the phase landscape, significantly influencing the stability and emergence of distinct quantum phases.</p>

            <h2>Simulating Floquet non-Abelian topological insulator with photonic quantum walks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Quan Lin, Tianyu Li, Haiping Hu, Wei Yi, Peng Xue</p>
            <p>Floquet non-Abelian topological phases emerge in periodically driven systems and exhibit properties that are absent in their Abelian or static counterparts. Dubbed the Floquet non-Abelian topological insulators (FNATIs), they are characterized by non-Abelian topological charges and feature multifold bulk-boundary correspondence, making their experimental observation challenging. Here we simulate the FNATI using a higher-dimensional photonic quantum walk and develop dynamic measurement schemes to demonstrate key signatures of the FNATI. Importantly, combining a direct bulk-dynamic detection for the underlying quaternion topological charge, and a spatially-resolved injection spectroscopy for the edge states, we experimentally establish the multifold bulk-boundary correspondence, and, in particular, identify the anomalous non-Abelian phase where edge states appear in all band gaps, despite the presence of a trivial topological charge. Our experiment marks the first experimental characterization of the FNATI, providing general insight into the non-Abelian topological phases.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> SiYi Chen, Jessica Illiano, Angela Sara Cacciapuoti, Marcello Caleffi</p>
            <p>Entanglement is unanimously recognized as the key communication resource of the Quantum Internet. Yet, the possibility of implementing novel network functionalities by exploiting the marvels of entanglement has been poorly investigated so far, by mainly restricting the attention to bipartite entanglement. Conversely, in this paper, we aim at exploiting multipartite entanglement as inter-network resource. Specifically, we consider the interconnection of different Quantum Local Area Networks (QLANs), and we show that multipartite entanglement allows to dynamically generate an inter-QLAN artificial topology, by means of local operations only, that overcomes the limitations of the physical QLAN topologies. To this aim, we first design the multipartite entangled state to be distributed within each QLAN. Then, we show how such a state can be engineered to: i) interconnect nodes belonging to different QLANs, and ii) dynamically adapt to different inter-QLAN traffic patterns. Our contribution aims at providing the network engineering community with a hands-on guideline towards the concept of artificial topology and artificial neighborhood.</p>

            <p>Multimode multiphoton states are at the center of many photonic quantum technologies, from photonic quantum computing to quantum sensing. In this work, we derive a procedure to generate exactly, and with a controlled number of steps, any such state by using only multiport interferometers, photon number resolving detectors, photon additions, and displacements. We achieve this goal by establishing a connection between photonic quantum state engineering and the algebraic problem of symmetric tensor decomposition. This connection allows us to solve the problem by using corresponding results from algebraic geometry and unveils a mechanism of photon catalysis, where photons are injected and subsequently retrieved in measurements, to generate entanglement that cannot be obtained through Gaussian operations. We also introduce a tensor decomposition, that generalizes our method and allows to construct optimal circuits for particular classes of states. As a benchmark, we numerically evaluate our method and compare its performance with state-of-the art results, confirming 100% fidelity on different classes of states.</p>

The authors argue that their findings challenge the validity of Bohmian particle dynamics because, according to the Bohmian guiding equation, the velocities in the classically forbidden region would be zero. In this note, we explain why this claim is false and the experimental findings are in perfect agreement with Bohmian mechanics. We also clarify why the operationally defined speeds reported in the paper are unrelated to particle velocities in the sense described by Bohmian mechanics. In contrast to other recent replies, our analysis relies solely on the standard Bohmian guidance equation for single particles.</p>

            <h2>Power and Limitations of Linear Programming Decoder for Quantum LDPC Codes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shouzhen Gu, Mehdi Soleimanifar</p>
            <p>Decoding quantum error-correcting codes is a key challenge in enabling fault-tolerant quantum computation. In the classical setting, linear programming (LP) decoders offer provable performance guarantees and can leverage fast practical optimization algorithms. Although LP decoders have been proposed for quantum codes, their performance and limitations remain relatively underexplored. In this work, we uncover a key limitation of LP decoding for quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes: certain constant-weight error patterns lead to ambiguous fractional solutions that cannot be resolved through independent rounding. To address this issue, we incorporate a post-processing technique known as ordered statistics decoding (OSD), which significantly enhances LP decoding performance in practice. Our results show that LP decoding, when augmented with OSD, can outperform belief propagation with the same post-processing for intermediate code sizes of up to hundreds of qubits. These findings suggest that LP-based decoders, equipped with effective post-processing, offer a promising approach for decoding near-term quantum LDPC codes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dara Murphy, Anthony Kiely, Irene D'Amico, Steve Campbell</p>
            <p>We examine the transport of useful energy, i.e. extractable work as quantified by the ergotropy, along a spin chain with tuneable exchange couplings between the sites. We focus on, and interpolate between, the two physically relevant limits of uniform interaction strengths and engineered couplings which achieve perfect state transfer (PST). By modelling the individual constituents as quantum batteries, we consider how the manner in which the extractable work appears in the initial state of the first site impacts the chain's ability to transport ergotropy to the final site. For non-PST couplings, we establish that there is a clear quantum advantage when the ergotropy is initially endowed in quantum coherences and demonstrate that this ergotropy is more efficiently transferred. For extractable work encoded in a population inverted state, we show that this considerably limits the length of chain over which any ergotropy can be faithfully transported. For PST couplings, we consider the robustness to disorder and again demonstrate a quantum advantage for coherently endowed ergotropy. Finally, we examine the work probability distribution associated with quenching on the interactions which provides insight into the work cost in switching on the couplings. We show that PST couplings lead to smaller fluctuations in this work cost, indicating that they are more stable.</p>

            <h2>Universal quantum phase classification on quantum computers from machine learning</h2>

            <p>The classification of quantum phases of matter remains a fundamental challenge in condensed matter physics. We present a novel framework that combines shadow tomography with modern time-series machine learning models to enable efficient and practical quantum phase classification. Our approach leverages the definition of quantum phases based on connectivity through finite-depth local unitary circuits, generating abundant training data by applying Haar random evolution to representative quantum states for a given phase. In this way, the training data can be efficiently obtained from a quantum simulator. Additionally, we demonstrate that advanced time-series models can be used to process the training data and achieve universal quantum phase classification that does not rely on local order parameters. To validate the universality and versatility of our method, we test the model against one-dimensional quantum spin chains such as the Ising model and the axial next-nearest-neighbor Ising (ANNNI) model, showing excellent agreement with known phase boundaries.</p>

We present an updated survey of various techniques to generate such strongly entangled states, including those going beyond the standard construction of graph and stabilizer states. Our contribution includes, in particular, analysis of the degree of entanglement of reduced states obtained by partial trace of AME projectors, states obtained by a symmetric superposition of GHZ states, an orthogonal frequency square representation of the "golden" AME state and an updated summary of the number of local unitary equivalence classes.</p>

            <p>We outline a theoretical framework for quantum metrology in non-Hermitian systems, demonstrating both significant failure and exceptional regimes in PT-symmetric Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer chains. Through biorthogonal quantum Fisher information analysis, we identify two distinct regimes: exponential sensitivity suppression in the non-Hermitian skin effect phase ($F_Q \propto N^3 e^{-2\kappa N}$) where eigenstates localize exponentially, and quadratic enhancement near PT-breaking exceptional points [1-4] ($F_Q \propto N^2/\delta$) achieving Heisenberg scaling. Our multiparameter analysis establishes optimal simultaneous estimation of chemical potential, Peierls phase, and gain/loss strength with quantum Fisher information matrix scaling as $N^2$, surpassing the standard quantum limit by factors exceeding $10^2$. For realistic parameters ($t/2\pi=10$ MHz, $\Delta/2\pi=1$ MHz, $N=50$), we predict enhancement factors $\eta_\mu \approx 20\sqrt{N}=141$ for chemical potential estimation and $\eta_\phi \approx t^2 \sqrt{3N/2}=100\sqrt{N}$ over classical sensing.

            <p>We construct stabilizer states and error-correcting codes on combinations of discrete- and continuous-variable systems, generalizing the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) quantum lattice formalism. Our framework absorbs the discrete phase space of a qudit into a hybrid phase space parameterizable entirely by the continuous variables of a harmonic oscillator. The unit cell of a hybrid quantum lattice grows with the qudit dimension, yielding a way to simultaneously measure an arbitrarily large range of non-commuting position and momentum displacements. Simple hybrid states can be obtained by applying a conditional displacement to a Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) state and a Pauli eigenstate, or by encoding some of the physical qudits of a stabilizer state into a GKP code. The states' oscillator-qudit entanglement cannot be generated using symplectic (i.e., Gaussian-Clifford) operations, distinguishing them as a resource from tensor products of oscillator and qudit stabilizer states. We construct general hybrid error-correcting codes by relating stabilizer codes to non-commutative tori and obtaining logical operators via Morita equivalence. We provide examples using commutation matrices, integer symplectic matrices, and binary codes.</p>

            <p>Fast and accurate quantum error correction (QEC) decoding is crucial for scalable fault-tolerant quantum computation. Most-Likely-Error (MLE) decoding, while being near-optimal, is intractable on general quantum Low-Density Parity-Check (qLDPC) codes and typically relies on approximation and heuristics. We propose HyperBlossom, a unified framework that formulates MLE decoding as a Minimum-Weight Parity Factor (MWPF) problem and generalizes the blossom algorithm to hypergraphs via a similar primal-dual linear programming model with certifiable proximity bounds. HyperBlossom unifies all the existing graph-based decoders like (Hypergraph) Union-Find decoders and Minimum-Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) decoder, thus bridging the gap between heuristic and certifying decoders. We implement HyperBlossom in software, namely Hyperion. Hyperion achieves a 4.8x lower logical error rate compared to the MWPM decoder on the distance-11 surface code and 1.6x lower logical error rate compared to a fine-tuned BPOSD decoder on the $[[90, 8, 10]]$ bivariate bicycle code under code-capacity noise. It also achieves an almost-linear average runtime scaling on both the surface code and the color code, with numerical results up to sufficiently large code distances of 99 and 31 for code-capacity noise and circuit-level noise, respectively.</p>

            <p>The ability to prepare states for quantum chemistry is a promising feature of quantum computers, and efficient techniques for chemical state preparation is an active area of research. In this paper, we implement and investigate two methods of quantum circuit preparation for multiconfigurational states for quantum chemical applications. It has previously been shown that controlled Givens rotations are universal for quantum chemistry. To prepare a selected linear combination of Slater determinants (represented as occupation number configurations) using Givens rotations, the gates that rotate between the reference and excited determinants need to be controlled on qubits outside the excitation (external controls), in general. We implement a method to automatically find the external controls required for utilizing Givens rotations to prepare multiconfigurational states on a quantum circuit. We compare this approach to an alternative technique that exploits the sparsity of the chemical state vector and find that the latter can outperform the method of externally controlled Givens rotations; highly reduced circuits can be obtained by taking advantage of the sparse nature (where the number of basis states is significantly less than 2$^{n_q}$ for $n_q$ qubits) of chemical wavefunctions. We demonstrate the benefits of these techniques in a range of applications, including the ground states of a strongly correlated molecule, matrix elements of the Q-SCEOM algorithm for excited states, as well as correlated initial states for a quantum subspace method based on quantum computed moments and quantum phase estimation.</p>

By employing a real-space scattering approach, we obtain analytical solutions for the scattering amplitudes that remain valid in both Markovian and non-Markovian regimes. We observe that an external driving field induces a splitting of the transmission spectrum's dip into double dips, with the distance between the two dips increasing as the strength of the driving field increases. The chiral nature of the coupling allows for controlled switching between complete transmission and perfect reflection of incident photons. In the Markovian limit, we predict robust perfect transmission at specific phase values, independent of the driving field this http URL, in the non-Markovian regime, as the size of the giant atom increases, the oscillatory behavior of the scattering spectrum becomes more pronounced.

Our approach involves partitioning the Pauli operators into mutually commuting clusters and finding Clifford unitaries that diagonalize each cluster. We then design an ansatz that uses these Clifford unitaries for efficient switching between the clusters, complemented by a layer of parameterized single qubit rotations for each individual cluster. By conducting numerical simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in accurately determining the ground state energy of different quantum chemistry Hamiltonians.

            <p>Dissipative phase transitions (DPT) are defined by sudden changes in the physical properties of nonequilibrium open quantum systems and they present characteristics that have no analog in closed and thermal systems. Several methods to detect and characterize DPT have been suggested in the literature, the most famous of which -- the $\textit{Liouvillian gap}$ -- can be derived from a spectral analysis of the Liouvillian super-operator that governs the complex interplay between coherent and dissipative dynamics. Here, we consider the $\textit{output current}$, defined as the average total quantum jumps per unit time between the open quantum system and the environment. We propose that output current fluctuations, and in particular their dynamical correlations, their power spectrum, and their characteristic timescale can provide valuable information about DPT, confirming a dramatic change of behavior at the critical point. We validate our proposal using the dissipative XYZ model and the nonlinear driven-dissipative Kerr model, showing good agreement with previous estimates of the location of the critical point.

            <h2>Fidelity-Aware Multipath Routing for Multipartite State Distribution in Quantum Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Evan Sutcliffe, Alejandra Beghelli</p>
            <p>We consider the problem of distributing entangled multipartite states across a quantum network with improved distribution rate and fidelity. For this, we propose fidelity-aware multi-path routing protocols, assess their performance in terms of the rate and fidelity of the distributed Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states, and compare such performance against that of single-path routing. Simulation results show that the proposed multi-path routing protocols select routes that require more Bell states compared to single-path routing, but also require fewer rounds of Bell state generation. We also optimised the trade-off between distribution rate and fidelity by selecting an appropriate cutoff to the quantum memory storage time. Using such a cutoff technique, the proposed multi-path protocols can achieve up to an 8.3 times higher distribution rate and up to a 28% improvement in GHZ state fidelity compared to single-path routing. These results show that multi-path routing both improves the distribution rates and enhances fidelity for multipartite state distribution.</p>

            <h2>Tesseract: A Search-Based Decoder for Quantum Error Correction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Laleh Aghababaie Beni, Oscar Higgott, Noah Shutty</p>
            <p>Tesseract is a Most-Likely Error decoder designed for low-density-parity-check quantum error-correcting codes. Tesseract conducts a search through a graph on the set of all subsets of errors to find the lowest cost subset of errors consistent with the input syndrome. Although this graph is exponentially large, the search can be made efficient in practice for random errors using $A^*$ search technique along with a few pruning heuristics. We show through benchmark circuits for surface, color, and bivariate-bicycle codes that Tesseract is significantly faster than integer programming-based decoders while retaining comparable accuracy at moderate physical error rates. We also find that Tesseract can decode transversal CNOT protocols for surface codes on neutral atom quantum computers. Finally, we compare surface code and bivariate bicycle code circuits, finding that the [[144,12,12]] bivariate bicycle code is $14\times$ to $19\times$ more efficient than surface codes using our most-likely error decoding, whereas using correlated matching and BP+OSD decoders would have implied only a $10\times$ improvement. Assuming instead that long-range couplers are $10\times$ noisier, the improvement drops to around $4\times$ using Tesseract or $2\times$ using correlated matching and BP+OSD.</p>

            <h2>Fault-tolerant Fusion-based Quantum Computing with the Four-legged Cat Code</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Harshvardhan K. Babla, James D. Teoh, Jahan Claes, Daniel K. Weiss, Shraddha Singh, Robert J. Schoelkopf, Shruti Puri</p>
            <p>The four-legged cat code is a quantum error-correcting code designed to address the predominant error in bosonic modes: single-photon loss. It was the first such code to surpass the break-even point, thereby demonstrating the practical utility of quantum error correction. In this work, we propose a planar fault-tolerant architecture for this code by concatenating it with the XZZX code via fusion-based error-correction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first 2D nearest-neighbor architecture for fault-tolerant fusion-based error-correction. We demonstrate how all the required operations, namely resource state preparation and Bell measurements, can be carried out using standard circuit-QED techniques, such as intercavity beam-splitter coupling, cavity displacements, cavity-transmon dispersive coupling, and transmon drives. We show analytically and numerically that all dominant hardware errors in the bosonic modes and control ancillae are corrected, to first-order, at the hardware level. Consequently, the outer XZZX code only needs to address smaller residual errors, which are quadratically suppressed, effectively doubling the architecture's fault-distance. Moreover, the performance of our architecture is not limited by unwanted nonlinearities such as cavity self-Kerr, and it avoids demanding coupling techniques like $\chi$-matching or high-order coupling. Overall, our architecture substantially reduces the hardware complexity needed to achieve fault tolerance with the four-legged cat code.</p>

            <h2>Qunity: A Unified Language for Quantum and Classical Computing (Extended Version)</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Finn Voichick, Liyi Li, Robert Rand, Michael Hicks</p>
            <p>We introduce Qunity, a new quantum programming language designed to treat quantum computing as a natural generalization of classical computing. Qunity presents a unified syntax where familiar programming constructs can have both quantum and classical effects. For example, one can use sum types to implement the direct sum of linear operators, exception-handling syntax to implement projective measurements, and aliasing to induce entanglement. Further, Qunity takes advantage of the overlooked BQP subroutine theorem, allowing one to construct reversible subroutines from irreversible quantum algorithms through the uncomputation of "garbage" outputs. Unlike existing languages that enable quantum aspects with separate add-ons (like a classical language with quantum gates bolted on), Qunity provides a unified syntax and a novel denotational semantics that guarantees that programs are quantum mechanically valid. We present Qunity's syntax, type system, and denotational semantics, showing how it can cleanly express several quantum algorithms. We also detail how Qunity can be compiled into a low-level qubit circuit language like OpenQASM, proving the realizability of our design.</p>

We show that the anisotropy parameter of the {\it XXZ} model can be tuned by applying a magnetic field, and in particular, that it changes drastically near the F√∂rster resonance points. Based on this result, we propose experimental realizations of spin-1/2 and spin-1 Heisenberg-type quantum spin models in Rydberg atom quantum simulators, without relying on Floquet engineering. Our results provide guidance for future experiments of Rydberg atom quantum simulators and offer insight into quantum many-body phenomena emerging in the Heisenberg model.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amer Alrakik, Gian Luigi Bendazzoli, Stefano Evangelisti, J. Arjan Berger</p>
            <p>We present a general theory to treat periodic solids with quantum-chemistry methods. It relies on two main developments: 1) the modeling of a solid as a Clifford torus which is a torus that is both periodic and flat and 2) the introduction of a periodic gaussian basis set that is compatible with the topology of the Clifford torus. We illustrate our approach by calculating the ground-state energy of a periodic chain of hydrogen atoms within both Hartree-Fock and coupled cluster theory. We demonstrate that our approach yields the correct ground-state energy in the thermodynamic limit by comparing it to the ground-state energy of a ring of hydrogen atoms in the same limit. Since equivalent ring-like calculations for three-dimensional solids are impossible, our approach is an excellent alternative to perform quantum-chemistry calculations of solids. Our Clifford formalism can be seamlessly combined with current implementations of quantum-chemistry methods designed for atoms and molecules to make them applicable to solids.</p>

            <p>Accurately simulating molecular vibronic spectra remains computationally challenging due to the exponential scaling of required calculations. Here, we show that employing the linear coupling model within the gaussian boson sampling framework effectively addresses this limitation. We implement the algorithm for simulating the pentacene molecule through three distinct approaches, using numerical simulation on a classical computer and experimentally using two optical setups equipped with different photon detectors (SNSPD and SPAD). High fidelity $(F>0.999)$ was achieved between the simulated Franck-Condon profiles and analytically calculated profiles obtained by enumerating all possible transitions within the linear coupling model. Furthermore, simulations were performed for larger molecular systems using 48 vibrational modes of naphthalene and 64 vibrational modes of anthracene. Comparison with experimental data confirms that the simulated spectra accurately reproduce both the positions and shapes of the measured spectral bands. A notable advantage of our algorithm is its scalability, requiring only a fixed minimal set of optical components irrespective of the size of the studied system.</p>

            <p>Nonreciprocity-the ability to transmit signals in one direction while blocking them in the reverse-has become a powerful resource in quantum technologies, enabling directional amplification, routing of quantum information, and topologically protected quantum states. Recent experimental advances have demonstrated nonreciprocal behavior in low-loss, fully integrated devices operating with weak or no magnetic bias, enabled by synthetic gauge fields, optomechanical interactions, and chiral light-matter coupling. These achievements overcome the limitations of more traditional approaches, making nonreciprocity compatible with superconducting circuits and scalable quantum photonic architectures as well as an integral part of the next generation of modular quantum computers, distributed quantum networks, and precision metrology. Here we highlight the key concepts for engineering nonreciprocity in quantum systems and describe how this functionality can be employed for high-fidelity qubit readout, robust quantum state transfer, and boosting the sensitivity of quantum sensors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Huang Xin, Liu Jingyu, Lin Shirong</p>
            <p>While cavity-magnon hybridization offers intriguing physics, its practical implementation is hindered by intrinsic damping in both cavity and magnon modes, leading to short coherence times and constrained applications. Recently, with the emergence of tunable external gain at the macroscopic scale, the research focus has shifted from purely lossy systems to gain-loss balanced non-Hermitian systems. Here, we propose a pseudo-Hermitian model with two magnon and two cavity modes coupled via phase-dependent interaction. We link the energy spectrum to phase transitions, observing exceptional points when pseudo-Hermitian symmetry breaks. We also observed level attraction and level repulsion. The former corresponds to four phase transitions and manifests as a double Z-shaped energy spectrum, the latter corresponds to two phase transitions, with the repulsive gap depending on the coupling phase. In the phase diagram defined by non-Hermiticity and coupling phase, we reveal a distinctive correspondence: pseudo-Hermitian symmetry breaking is intrinsically linked to coupling mode transitions, enabling new strategies for controlling hybrid quantum states in spintronic systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mahmoud Kalash, Ui-Nyung Han, Young-Sik Ra, Maria V. Chekhova</p>
            <p>Multimode squeezed light is a key resource for high-dimensional photonic quantum technologies, enabling applications in quantum-enhanced sensing, quantum communication, and quantum computing. Efficient detection of such a multimode squeezed state is essential for unlocking its full potential. Optical parametric amplification (OPA) has recently gained attention as a powerful technique offering loss-tolerant, direct broadband detection, and multimode operation. While OPA has been used to characterize spatially multimode squeezing, its application to spectrally multimode squeezing has not yet been demonstrated. Here, we report on the first experimental demonstration of spectrally multimode squeezing detection using OPA. We achieve simultaneous detection of squeezing across more than 60 spectral modes of a broadband squeezed vacuum state. The observed squeezing is nearly uniform, ranging from -6.5 to -7 dB, which makes the source particularly suitable for constructing continuous-variable cluster states, and indicates the multimode capability of the OPA. The results extend the capabilities of OPA detection into the spectral domain, advancing spectral-mode-based high-dimensional photonic quantum technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Henrique Guerra, Tailan S. Sarubi, Rafael Chaves, Jonas Maziero</p>
            <p>The entanglement swapping protocol (ESP) is a fundamental primitive for distributing quantum correlations across distant nodes in a quantum network. Recent studies have demonstrated that even when the involved qubit pairs are only partially entangled, it is still possible to concentrate and transmit entanglement via Bell-basis measurements. In this work, we extend these ideas to quantum networks with various topologies - including linear, star, and hybrid configurations - by analyzing the application of the ESP to initially partially entangled states. We investigate how entanglement evolves under such protocols by examining the transformations of the initial states and evaluating the success probabilities for generating maximally entangled states at the output. Our results offer new insights into the dynamics of the entanglement distribution in quantum networks and provide practical guidelines for designing robust quantum communication strategies under realistic conditions.</p>

The von Neumann entropy obtained via QuGIT simulations is compared with analytic R√©nyi entropy bounds, thereby validating the accuracy of our circuit implementation of the cosmological squeezing Hamiltonian in both accelerating and decelerating scenarios.

            <p>Quantifying correlation and entanglement between molecular orbitals can elucidate the role of quantum effects in strongly correlated reaction processes. However, accurately storing the wavefunction for a classical computation of those quantities can be prohibitive. Here we use the Quantinuum H1-1 trapped-ion quantum computer to calculate von Neumann entropies which quantify the orbital correlation and entanglement in a strongly correlated molecular system relevant to lithium-ion batteries (vinylene carbonate interacting with an O$_2$ molecule). As shown in previous works, fermionic superselection rules decrease correlations and reduce measurement overheads for constructing orbital reduced density matrices. Taking into account superselection rules we further reduce the number of measurements by finding commuting sets of Pauli operators. Using low overhead noise reduction techniques we calculate von Neumann entropies in excellent agreement with noiseless benchmarks, indicating that correlations and entanglement between molecular orbitals can be accurately estimated from a quantum computation. Our results show that the one-orbital entanglement vanishes unless opposite-spin open shell configurations are present in the wavefunction.</p>

            <p>We implement a quantum generalization of a neural network on trapped-ion and IBM superconducting quantum computers to classify MNIST images, a common benchmark in computer vision. The network feedforward involves qubit rotations whose angles depend on the results of measurements in the previous layer. The network is trained via simulation, but inference is performed experimentally on quantum hardware. The classical-to-quantum correspondence is controlled by an interpolation parameter, $a$, which is zero in the classical limit. Increasing $a$ introduces quantum uncertainty into the measurements, which is shown to improve network performance at moderate values of the interpolation parameter. We then focus on particular images that fail to be classified by a classical neural network but are detected correctly in the quantum network. For such borderline cases, we observe strong deviations from the simulated behavior. We attribute this to physical noise, which causes the output to fluctuate between nearby minima of the classification energy landscape. Such strong sensitivity to physical noise is absent for clear images. We further benchmark physical noise by inserting additional single-qubit and two-qubit gate pairs into the neural network circuits. Our work provides a springboard toward more complex quantum neural networks on current devices: while the approach is rooted in standard classical machine learning, scaling up such networks may prove classically non-simulable and could offer a route to near-term quantum advantage.</p>

            <p>Quantum batteries (QBs) have emerged as promising platforms for microscale energy storage, yet most existing studies assume weak system-environment coupling and Markovian dynamics. Here we explore how physical catalysis can regulate the maximum extractable work (ergotropy) of a spin-chain QB strongly coupled to a cavity environment. We model the system using a Nakajima-Zwanzig-type non-Markovian master equation and simulate the time evolution of ergotropy under various physical parameters. Our results show that increasing the catalyst-spin coupling, spin energy or cavity frequency can effectively suppress ergotropy oscillations and yield quasi-stationary ergotropy regime, while overly strong catalyst, especially when accompanied by increasing system-environment coupling under such conditions, can destabilize work extraction. This study demonstrates how quantum catalysis can serve as a control knob for optimizing battery performance in strongly coupled non-Markovian regimes.</p>

            <p>We report the observation of the Purcell effect in a cavity-metallic magnet hybrid system using electric-field-mediated coupling. In this configuration, microwave-induced axial currents in the microwire induce circular magnetic fields that drive the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) of the magnetized microwire. Field-dependent transmission and reflection spectroscopies reveal a clear cavity perturbation consistent with the Purcell regime, in which the magnetic loss rate exceeds the light-matter coupling strength. Despite the small magnetic volume ($\sim 10^{-13}\,\text{m}^3$), measurements performed at both room temperature and 7 mK show coupling rates as high as 56 MHz, one order of magnitude stronger than expected from conventional coupling at the magnetic antinode. Time-domain ringdown measurements directly show the magnetic-field-dependent modification of the cavity photon lifetime, in agreement with theoretical predictions. These results establish a versatile approach for coupling microwave fields to metallic magnets via geometric and electric-field-mediated interactions, opening new opportunities for hybrid cavity-magnet systems.</p>

Furthermore, we estimate the systematic and statistical errors in the measurement of GIE using the Fourier transformation over a finite measurement time. Based on the error estimations using the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in GIE detection, we find that a total measurement time of 10^6 s is required to achieve SNR=1 when using squeezed input light, whereas 10^{6.8} s is needed without squeezed input light.

We identify optimal measurement strategies and show that spatial mode demultiplexing--a technique already accessible in current experimental setups--can achieve these quantum limits and in many situations improve the sensitivity of conventional intensity measurements. Building on this, we introduce an advanced imaging scheme based on vortex beams, which we predict to enhance the image information in the final quantum state of light and thereby lead to even higher resolution and sensitivity. These findings establish a clear path for enhancing nonlinear imaging techniques using concepts from quantum science, bridging the gap between established microscopy methods and the emerging capabilities of quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>As quantum computing, sensing, timing, and networking technologies mature, quantum network testbeds are being deployed across the United States and around the world. To support the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL)'s mission of building heterogeneous quantum networks, we report on the development of Quantum Local Area Networks (QLANs) operating at telecommunications-band frequencies. The multi-node, reconfigurable QLANs include deployed optical fiber and free-space links connected to pristine laboratory environments and rugged outdoor test facilities. Each QLAN is tailored to distinct operating conditions and use cases, with unique environmental characteristics and capabilities. We present network topologies and in-depth link characterization data for three such networks. Using photonic integrated circuit-based sources of entangled photons, we demonstrate entanglement distribution of time-energy Bell states across deployed fiber in a wooded environment. The high quality of the entanglement is confirmed by a Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality violation of $S=2.700$, approaching the theoretical maximum of $S=2.828$. We conclude with a discussion of future work aimed at expanding QLAN functionality and enabling entanglement distribution between heterogeneous matter-based quantum systems, including superconducting qubits and trapped ions. These results underscore the practical viability of field-deployable, qubit-agnostic quantum network infrastructure.</p>

            <p>In conventional exchange-only (EO) spin qubit demonstrations, quantum gates have been implemented using sequences of individually pulsed pairwise exchange interactions with only one exchange coupling active at a time. Alternatively, multiple non-commuting exchange interactions can be pulsed simultaneously, reducing circuit depths and providing protection against leakage. We demonstrate high-fidelity quantum control of an always-on exchange-only (AEON) qubit, operated using simultaneous exchange pulses in a triangular quantum dot (QD) array. We use blind randomized benchmarking to characterize the performance of the full AEON single-qubit Clifford gate set, achieving an average Clifford gate fidelity $F_{\rm C1}$ = 99.86\%. Extensions of this work may enable more efficient EO two-qubit entangling gates as well as the implementation of native $i$-Toffoli gates in Loss-DiVincenzo single-spin qubits.</p>

            <p>We report a two-stage, heterodyne rf-to-microwave transducer that combines a tunable electrostatic pre-amplifier with a superconducting electromechanical cavity. A metalized Si$_3$N$_4$ membrane (3 MHz frequency) forms the movable plate of a vacuum-gap capacitor in a microwave LC resonator. A dc bias across the gap converts any small rf signal into a resonant electrostatic force proportional to the bias, providing a voltage-controlled gain that multiplies the cavity's intrinsic electromechanical gain. In a flip-chip device with a 1.5 $\mathrm{\mu}$m gap operated at 10 mK we observe dc-tunable anti-spring shifts, and rf-to-microwave transduction at 49 V bias, achieving a charge sensitivity of 87 $\mathrm{\mu}$e/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ (0.9 nV/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$). Extrapolation to sub-micron gaps and state-of-the-art $Q>10^8$ membrane resonators predicts sub-200 fV/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ sensitivity, establishing dc-biased electromechanics as a practical route towards quantum-grade rf electrometers and low-noise modular heterodyne links for superconducting microwave circuits and charge or voltage sensing.</p>

            <h2>Enhanced Gravity-Induced Entanglement via Squeezed Input Light under Finite Measurement Time</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kosei Hatakeyama, Daisuke Miki, Yamamoto Kazuhiro</p>
            <p>We investigate the advantage of using squeezed input light for generating gravity-induced entanglement (GIE) through Fourier-domain analysis. Based on the findings of [1], which demonstrated the feasibility of detecting GIE in optomechanical systems under quantum control, we further demonstrate that squeezed input light can reduce the optical noise in the mechanical conditional state and enhance GIE. Furthermore, we estimate the systematic and statistical errors in the measurement of GIE using the Fourier transformation over a finite measurement time. Based on the error estimations using the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in GIE detection, we find that a total measurement time of 10^6 s is required to achieve SNR=1 when using squeezed input light, whereas 10^{6.8} s is needed without squeezed input light. This result highlights the effectiveness of optomechanical systems and the critical role of squeezed input light in enhancing the detectability of GIE.</p>

            <p>The realization of long-distance quantum communication and the envisioned quantum internet relies on coherent hybrid light-matter interfaces connecting quantum light emitters with quantum memory (QM) systems. Unlike probabilistic photon pair sources such as spontaneous parametric down-conversion, deterministic quantum light emitters enable the on-demand production of pure and bright single and entangled photons, essential for scalable quantum networks. In this work, we present the first experimental realization of a coherent hybrid light-matter interface between a chip-integrated InAsP/InP nanowire quantum dot (QD) and a solid-state QM based on Er$^{3+}$ ions doped in a glass silica fiber (erbium-doped fiber, EDF). The emission spectrum of the InAsP/InP nanowire QD aligns with the absorption bandwidth of the EDF at 980 nm at cryogenic temperatures, allowing efficient interaction between the two systems. To demonstrate this, we present a spectroscopic characterization of the $^{4}I_{15/2} \leftrightarrow ^{4}I_{11/2}$ optical transition in EDF at 980 nm. Our measurements reveal substantial inhomogeneous broadening of this optical transition and a long spin population lifetime, underscoring EDFs potential for broadband QM implementation. We implement an 8 GHz bandwidth multimode QM based on the Atomic Frequency Comb protocol, enabling the storage and retrieval of 59 weak coherent pulses. Furthermore, we characterize single-photon emission from an InAsP/InP nanowire QD at 980 nm and demonstrate its deterministic storage and recall in the EDF QM. Notably, this is achieved without spectral tuning of the QD emission, demonstrating its direct compatibility with a solid-state QM.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Sensing with Bright Two-Mode Squeezed Light in a Distributed Network of Gyroscopes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Priyanka M. Kannath, Girish S. Agarwal, Ashok Kumar</p>
            <p>Recent developments in quantum technologies have enabled significant improvements in the precision of optical sensing systems. This work explores the integration of distributed quantum sensing (DQS) with optical gyroscopes to improve the estimation accuracy of angular velocity. Utilizing bright two-mode squeezed states (bTMSS), which offer high photon numbers and strong bipartite quantum correlations, we propose a novel configuration that leverages continuous-variable entanglement across multiple spatially separated optical gyroscopes. Unlike traditional quantum sensing that enhances a single sensor, our approach focuses on estimating a global phase shift corresponding to the average angular rotation across distributed optical gyroscopes with quantum-enhanced sensitivity. We analyze the phase sensitivities of different bTMSS configurations, including M mode-entangled bTMSS and separable M-bTMSS, and evaluate their performance through the quantum Cram√©r-Rao bound. The analysis shows that, with 5% photon loss in every channel in the system, the proposed scheme shows a sensitivity enhancement of ~9.3 dB beyond the shot-noise limit, with an initial squeezing of ~9.8 dB. The present scheme has potential applications in quantum-enhanced inertial navigation and precision metrology within emerging quantum networks.</p>

            <p>Optical frequency combs, named for their comb-like peaks in the spectrum, are essential for various sensing applications. As the technology develops, its performance has reached the standard quantum limit dictated by the quantum fluctuations of coherent light field. Quantum combs, with their quantum fluctuation engineered via squeezing and entanglement, are the necessary ingredient for overcoming such limits. We develop the theory for designing and analyzing quantum combs, focusing on dual-comb interferometric measurement. Our analyses cover both squeezed and entangled quantum combs with division receivers and heterodyne receivers, leading to four protocols with quantum advantages scalable with squeezing/entanglement strength. In the spectroscopy of a single absorption line, whereas the division receiver with the squeezed comb suffers from amplified thermal noise, the other three protocols demonstrate a surprising robustness to loss at a few comb lines. Such a unique loss-robustness of a scalable quantum advantage has not been found in any traditional quantum sensing protocols.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. Rivera-Dean, P. Stammer, C. Figueira de Morisson Faria, M. Lewenstein</p>
            <p>Above-threshold ionization (ATI) is a strong-field-driven process where electrons absorb more photons than required for ionization. While ATI dynamics and outputs are well-understood when driven by classical, perfectly coherent light, the recent development of non-classical light sources for strong-field phenomena has spurred interest in their effect on the involved electron dynamics. In this work, we present a microscopic quantum optical theory describing ATI under the influence of strong squeezed light. We observe that squeezed light significantly enhances the coupling between light and matter, making their mutual backaction more important than under classical driving. This backaction profoundly impacts the electronic ionization times, as well as the non-classical properties of the joint electron-light state. This results in pronounced entanglement features, both immediately after ionization, and at later times. These entanglement features are reflected in the properties of the quantum optical state of the driving field revealing notable non-Gaussian features that depend on both, the amount of squeezing, and the number of ionization events occurring during the interaction.</p>

            <p>Orbital angular momentum (OAM) as both classical and quantum states of light has proven essential in numerous applications, from high-capacity information transfer to enhanced precision and accuracy in metrology. Here, we extend OAM metrology to relativistic scenarios to determine the Lorentz factor of a moving reference frame, exploiting the fact that OAM is not Lorentz invariant. Using OAM correlations of entangled states, we show that their joint OAM spectrum is modified by length contraction, where the rescaling of spatial dimensions alters the orthogonality of the OAM modes themselves. In an emulated experiment, we confirm the predicted broadening of the OAM spectrum and use this to quantitatively infer the Lorentz (contraction) factor, reaching experimentally simulated velocities of up to 0.99c. Our work provides a pathway for novel measurement techniques suitable for relativistic conditions that leverages OAM structured light as a resource.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Edwin Tham, Min Ye, Ilia Khait, John Gamble, Nicolas Delfosse</p>
            <p>We propose an architecture for a quantum memory distributed over a $2 \times L$ array of modules equipped with a cyclic shift implemented via flying qubits. The logical information is distributed across the first row of $L$ modules and quantum error correction is executed using ancilla modules on the second row equipped with a cyclic shift. This work proves that quantum LDPC codes such as BB codes can maintain their performance in a distributed setting while using solely one simple connector: a cyclic shift. We propose two strategies to perform quantum error correction on a $2 \times L$ module array: (i) The cyclic layout which applies to any stabilizer codes, whereas previous results for qubit arrays are limited to CSS codes. (ii) The sparse cyclic layout, specific to bivariate bicycle (BB) codes. For the $[[144,12,12]]$ BB code, using the sparse cyclic layout we obtain a quantum memory with $12$ logical qubits distributed over $12$ modules, containing $12$ physical qubits each. We propose physical implementations of this architecture using flying qubits, that can be faithfully transported, and include qubits encoded in ions, neutral atoms, electrons or photons. We performed numerical simulations when modules are long ion chains and when modules are single-qubit arrays of ions showing that the distributed BB code achieves a logical error rate below $2 \cdot 10^{-6}$ when the physical error rate is $10^{-3}$.</p>

            <p>Distributed quantum sensing, which estimates a global parameter across distant nodes, has attracted significant interest for applications such as quantum imaging, sensor networks, and global-scale clock synchronization. $N00N$ states are regarded as one of the optimal quantum resources for quantum metrology, enabling the Heisenberg scaling. Recently, the concept of $N00N$ states has been extended to multi-mode $N00N$ states for quantum-enhanced multiple-parameter estimation. However, the application of multi-mode $N00N$ states in distributed quantum sensing remains unexplored. Here, we propose a distributed quantum sensing scheme that achieves the Heisenberg scaling using multi-mode $N00N$ states. We theoretically show that multi-mode $N00N$ states can reach the Heisenberg scaling by examining both the Cram√©r-Rao bound and the quantum Cram√©r-Rao bound. For experimental demonstration, we employ a four-mode $2002$ state to estimate the average of two spatially distributed phases, achieving a 2.74 dB sensitivity enhancement over the standard quantum limit. We believe that utilizing multi-mode $N00N$ states for distributed quantum sensing offers a promising approach for developing entanglement-enhanced sensor networks.</p>

            <p>We propose an all-optical Moir√©-like exciton confinement by means of spatially periodic optical cavities. Such periodic photonic structures can control the material properties by coupling the matter excitations to the confined photons and their quantum fluctuations. We develop a low energy non-perturbative quantum electro-dynamical description of strongly coupled excitons and photons at finite momentum transfer. We find that in the classical limit of a laser driven cavity the induced optical confinement directly emulates Moir√© physics. In a dark cavity instead, the sole presence of quantum fluctuations of light generates a sizable renormalization of the excitonic bands and effective mass. We attribute these effects to long-range cavity-mediated exciton-exciton interactions which can only be captured in a non-perturbative treatment. With these findings we propose spatially structured cavities as a promising avenue for cavity material engineering.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Smitarani Mishra, Shaon Sahoo</p>
            <p>We revisit the J1-J2 frustrated Heisenberg spin-1/2 chain with dimerization ({\delta}) or modulation in the nearest-neighbor couplings to investigate its thermalization behavior. While the dimerization tends to induce localization, the next-nearest-neighbor interaction J2 generally favors thermalization, making the assessment of the model's compliance with the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) particularly subtle. The challenge is further compounded by the model's SU(2) symmetry; the study of ETH compliance is necessarily done for each symmetry sector but separating different sectors of this symmetry is known to be a computationally demanding task. The current study is driven by two main motivations: first, to explore whether the well-known ground-state phases of the model have any bearing on its thermalization properties; and second, to understand how the interplay between two competing factors, namely, the non-uniformity (via {\delta}) and the beyond-nearest-neighbor interactions (via J2) governs the system's approach to thermal equilibrium. A systematic analysis shows that the ETH is most strongly satisfied for intermediate values of {\delta} (~ 0.5) with J2 ranging from intermediate (~ 0.5) to large (~ 1)- a parameter regime falls within the spiral ground-state phase. It is also found that when the system is in the gapless ground-state phase (which falls within the N'eel phase), the ETH is more prone to violation. In the regime of large {\delta} and small J2, the system is seen to enter a localized phase (characterized here by modulation in density-of-states; assessing ETH compliance is less meaningful for this phase.</p>

            <p>The Tavis-Cummings (TC) model, which serves as a natural physical realization of a quantum battery, comprises $N_b$ atoms as battery cells that collectively interact with a shared photon field, functioning as the charger, initially containing $n_0$ photons. In this study, we introduce the invariant subspace method to effectively represent the quantum dynamics of the TC battery. Our findings indicate that in the limiting case of $n_0\!\gg\! N_b$ or $N_b\!\gg\! n_0$, a distinct SU(2) symmetry emerges in the dynamics, thereby ensuring the realization of optimal energy storage. We also establish a negative relationship between the battery-charger entanglement and the energy storage capacity. As a result, we demonstrate that the asymptotically optimal energy storage can be achieved in the scenario where $N_b\!=\!n_0\!\gg\! 1$. Our approach not only enhances our comprehension of the algebraic structure inherent in the TC model but also contributes to the broader theoretical framework of quantum batteries. Furthermore, it provides crucial insights into the relation between energy transfer and quantum correlations.</p>

            <p>The dynamical trajectory of a dissipative Rydberg many-body system could be flipped under a microwave field driving, displaying an enhanced sensitivity. This is because the intersection of the folded hysteresis trajectories exhibits a sharp peak near the phase transition, amplifying the response to small changes in the microwave field. Here, we demonstrate an experiment of enhanced metrology through flipping the hysteresis trajectory in a cold atomic system, displaying an approach to improve sensitivity near the gap-closing points. By measuring the intersection points of hysteresis trajectories versus Rabi frequency of the microwave field, we quantify the equivalent sensitivity to be 1.6(5) nV cm-1 Hz-1/2. The measurement is also dependent on the interaction time, optical depth and principal quantum number since the long-range interaction between Rydberg atoms could dramatically change the shape of hysteresis trajectories. The reported results suggest that flipping trajectory features in cold Rydberg many-body systems could advance sensing and metrology applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Panagiotis Dorlis, Nick E. Mavromatos, Sarben Sarkar, Sotirios-Neilos Vlachos</p>
            <p>We propose, in (3+1)-dimensional spacetimes, a novel astrophysical source of squeezed graviton states, due to superradiant axionic clouds surrounding rotating (Kerr-type) black holes (BH). The microscopic origin of these axions is diverse, ranging from the Kalb-Ramond (model-independent) axions and compactification axions in string theory, to \cm contorted geometries exemplified by a totally antisymmetric component of torsion in Einstein-Cartan theory. The axion fields couple to chiral gauge and gravitational Chern-Simons (CS) anomaly terms in the effective gravitational actions. In the presence of a Kerr BH background, such axions lead, upon acquiring a mass, to superradiance and the production of pairs of entangled gravitons in a squeezed state. The specific microscopic origin of the axions is not important, provided they are massive. This multimode squeezed-graviton state is examined through a Takagi-like decomposition, used in quantum optics. In the effective action it is shown that squeezing effects associated with conventional general relativity (GR) dominate, by many orders of magnitude, the corresponding effects due to the CS gravitational anomaly terms. For a sufficiently long lifetime of the axionic cloud of the BH, we find that significant squeezing (quantified through the average number of gravitons with respect to the appropriate vacuum) can be produced from the GR effects. It is also demonstrated explicitly that the structure of the entangled states (when the latter are expressed in a left-right polarization basis) depends highly on whether the GR or the anomalous CS effects produce the entanglement.</p>

At low thickness, the force density is proportional to the square of the thickness, but this is the case at low thicknesses, when the continuum model is no longer applicable.

            <p>We propose an experimentally feasible optomechanical system (OMS) that is dispersively driven and operates in the reversed dissipation regime (RDR), where the mechanical damping rate far exceeds the cavity decay rate. We demonstrate that coherent, fast-time modulation of the driving laser frequency-on time scales longer than the mechanical decoherence time-allows for adiabatic elimination of the mechanical mode, resulting in strong parametric amplification of quantum vacuum fluctuations of the intracavity field. This mechanism, known as the parametric dynamical Casimir effect (parametric-DCE), leads to the generation of Casimir photons. In the dispersive RDR, we find that the total system Hamiltonian-including the DCE term-is intrinsically modified by a generalized optomechanical Kerr-type nonlinearity. This nonlinearity not only saturates the mean number of radiated Casimir photons on short time scales, even without dissipation, but also induces oscillatory behavior in their dynamics and quantum characteristics. Remarkably, the presence of the Kerr nonlinearity causes the generated DCE photons to exhibit nonclassical features, including sub-Poissonian statistics, negative Wigner function and quadrature squeezing which can be controlled by adjusting the system parameters. The proposed nonclassical microwave radiation source possesses the potential to be applied in quantum information processing, quantum computing as well as microwave quantum sensing.</p>

            <p>Theoretical accounts of ultrastrongly coupled light-matter systems commonly assume that it arises from the interaction of an emitter with propagating photon modes supported by a structure, understanding photons as the excitations of the transverse electromagnetic field. This description discards the Coulomb interaction between the emitter and structure charges. Here, we show with a general argument based on electromagnetic constraints that the emitter-photon coupling strength is fundamentally limited. Accordingly, we conclude that the ultrastrong coupling regime cannot be reached with photons. Instead, it must originate from the Coulomb interactions between charges. A further corollary is that the so-called polarization self-energy term does not need to be included. We illustrate our claims by solving an analytical model of the paradigmatic case of an emitter next to a metallic nanosphere. These findings shed light on the fundamental processes underlying ultrastrong coupling, clarify the role of the polarization self-energy term and compel a reevaluation of previous literature.</p>

We use our approach to propose a framework for strong light-matter coupling in which collective excitations of periodic arrays of quantum emitters are strongly coupled to the light modes supported by the metasurface, leading to the formation of crystal polaritons. As a proof-of-principle example of their potential, we show that interactions between crystal polaritons can lead to an efficient and directional generation of entangled photon pairs.</p>
