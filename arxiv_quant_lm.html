            <h2>Temporal entanglement transition in chaotic quantum many-body dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ilya Vilkoviskiy, Michael Sonner, Qi Camm Huang, Wen Wei Ho, Alessio Lerose, Dmitry A. Abanin</p>
            <p>Temporal entanglement (TE) of an influence matrix (IM) has been proposed as a measure of complexity of simulating dynamics of local observables in a many-body system. Foligno et al. [Phys. Rev. X 13, 041008 (2023)] recently argued that the TE in chaotic 1d quantum circuits obeys linear (volume-law) scaling with evolution time. To reconcile this apparent high complexity of IM with the rapid thermalization of local observables, here we study the relation between TE, non-Markovianity, and local temporal correlations for chaotic quantum baths. By exactly solving a random-unitary bath model, and bounding distillable entanglement between future and past degrees of freedom, we argue that TE is extensive for low enough bath growth rate, and it reflects genuine non-Markovianity. This memory, however, is entirely contained in highly complex temporal correlations, and its effect on few-point temporal correlators is negligible. An IM coarse-graining procedure, reducing the allowed frequency of measurements of the probe system, results in a transition from volume- to area-law TE scaling. We demonstrate the generality of this TE transition in 1d circuits by analyzing the kicked Ising model analytically at dual-unitary points, as well as numerically away from them. This finding indicates that dynamics of local observables are fully captured by an area-law IM. We provide evidence that the compact IM MPS obtained via standard compression algorithms accurately describes local evolution.</p>

            <h2>Realistic GKP stabilizer states enable universal quantum computation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fariba Hosseinynejad, Pavithran Iyer, Guillaume Dauphinais, David L. Feder</p>
            <p>Physical Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) states are inherently noisy as ideal ones would require infinite energy. While this is typically considered as a deficiency to be actively corrected, this work demonstrates that imperfect GKP stabilizer states can be leveraged in order to apply non-Clifford gates using only linear optical elements. In particular, Gaussian operations on normalizable GKP states, combined with homodyne measurements, permit two key primitives: clean projection onto Pauli eigenstates in the normalizable GKP codespace, thereby implementing Clifford gates with high fidelity; and probabilistic projection of unmeasured modes onto non-Pauli eigenstates. These results demonstrate that normalizable GKP stabilizer states combined with Gaussian operations provide a practical framework for computational universality within the measurement-based model of quantum computation in a realistic continuous-variable setting.</p>

            <h2>Controlled growth of rare-earth-doped TiO$_{2}$ thin films on III-V semiconductors for hybrid quantum photonic interfaces</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Henry C. Hammer, Caleb Whittier, Nathan A. Helvy, Christopher Rouleau, Nabil D. Bassim, Ravitej Uppu</p>
            <p>Quantum photonic networks require two distinct functionalities: bright single-photon sources and long-lived quantum memories. III-V semiconductor quantum dots excel as deterministic and coherent photon emitters, while rare-earth ions such as erbium (Er$^{3+}$) in crystalline oxides offer exceptional spin and optical coherence at telecom wavelengths. Combining these systems and their functionalities via direct epitaxy is challenging due to lattice mismatch and incompatible growth conditions. Here we demonstrate low-temperature pulsed laser deposition of Er$^{3+}$-doped TiO$_{2}$ thin films directly on GaAs and GaSb substrates. Controlled surface preparation with an arsenic cap and an oxygen-deficient buffer layer enables the growth of epitaxial anatase TiO$_{2}$ (001) at 390$^{o}$C with sub-300 pm surface roughness, while avoiding interface degradation. In contrast, high-temperature oxide desorption or growth temperatures drive the transition to rough, polycrystalline rutile film, as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. Minimal coincident interface area (MCIA) modeling explains the orientation-selective growth on GaAs and GaSb. Raman and cryogenic photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy verify the crystal phase and optical activation of Er$^{3+}$ ions. This multi-parameter growth strategy helps preserve III-V quantum dot functionality and yields smooth surfaces suitable for low-loss nanophotonic structures. Our results establish a materials platform for monolithically integrating rare-earth quantum memories with semiconductor photon sources, paving the way toward scalable hybrid quantum photonic chips.</p>

            <p>Quantum imaging is emerging as a transformative approach for biomedical applications, applying nonclassical properties of light, such as entanglement, squeezing, and quantum correlations, to overcome fundamental limits of conventional techniques. These methods promise superior spatial resolution, enhanced signal-to-noise ratios, improved phase sensitivity, and reduced radiation dose, for potentially safer and more precise imaging for delicate biological samples. Here, we present an overview of quantum optical biomedical imaging technologies as well as quantum-inspired imaging methods, including quantum optical coherence tomography, quantum optical microscopy, ghost imaging, multi-parameter quantum imaging, and imaging with quantum-grade cameras. We describe the operating principles, biomedical applications, and unique advantages of each approach, along with the specific challenges for their translation into real-life practice. This review aims to guide future research toward advancing quantum imaging from experimental demonstrations to impactful biomedical tools.</p>

            <h2>Quantum error correction for multiparameter metrology</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mauricio Gutiérrez, Chiranjib Mukhopadhyay, Victor Montenegro, Abolfazl Bayat</p>
            <p>For single-parameter sensing, Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) probes achieve optimal quantum-enhanced precision across the unknown parameter range, solely relying on parameter-independent separable measurement strategies for all values of the unknown parameter. However, in the multiparameter setting, a single GHZ probe not only fails to achieve quantum advantage but also the corresponding optimal measurement becomes complex and dependent on the unknown parameters. Here, we provide a recipe for multiparameter sensing with GHZ probes using quantum error correction techniques by treating all but one unknown parameters as noise, whose effects can be corrected. This strategy restores the core advantage of single parameter GHZ-based quantum sensing, namely reaching optimally quantum-enhanced precision for all unknown parameter values while keeping the measurements separable and fixed. Specifically, given one shielded ancilla qubit per GHZ probe, our protocol extracts optimal possible precision for any probe size. While this optimal precision is shot-noise limited for a single GHZ probe, we recover the Heisenberg scaling through use of multiple complementary GHZ probes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the protocol with Bayesian estimation.</p>

            <h2>Anomalous heat flow and quantum Otto cycle with indefinite causal order</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qing-Feng Xue, Qi Zhang, Xu-Cai Zhuang, Yun-Jie Xia, Enrico Russo, Giulio Chiribella, Rosario Lo Franco, Zhong-Xiao Man</p>
            <p>The principle that heat spontaneously flows from higher temperature to lower temperature is a cornerstone of classical thermodynamics, often assumed to be independent of the sequence of interactions. While this holds true for macroscopic systems at equilibrium, here we show that, when the order of interactions between two identical thermalization channels is indefinite, an anomalous heat flow emerges, whereby heat can sometime flow from a colder entity to a hotter one. Taking advantage of this anomalous heat flow, we design a quantum Otto cycle with indefinite causal order, which not only achieves refrigeration but also generates work. The anomalous heat flow and the quantum Otto cycle are experimentally simulated in a photonic quantum setup, which provides a proof-of-principle demonstration of the theory.</p>

            <h2>Unifying contextual advantages in state discrimination</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kieran Flatt, Joonwoo Bae</p>
            <p>Quantum state discrimination, alongside its other applications, has recently found use as a tool for witnessing generalised contextuality. In this article, we derive noncontextuality inequalities for both conclusive and inconclusive outcomes across various guessing strategies. For minimum- error discrimination, the advantage is in terms of the confidences of individual outcomes, while for unambiguous state discrimination, it is in terms of the average guessing probability. For maximum- confidence discrimination, we show that contextual advantages occur not only for the confidence but also their average, the guessing probability, as well as the inconclusive outcome rate. Our results unify the contextual advantages across all state discrimination schemes and figures of merit. We envisage that various quantum information applications based on state discrimination may offer advantages over non-contextual theories.</p>

            <h2>Controllable Non-Hermitianity in Continuous-Variable Qubits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ke-Xiong Yan, Zhi-Cheng Shi, Ye-Hong Chen, Yan Xia</p>
            <p>Pure dephasing is the dominant leak mechanism in photonic cat qubits because its phase errors disrupt the parity protection, rendering the qubit vulnerable to energy relaxation. In this manuscript, we reveal that this dephasing mechanism conceals an interesting physical phenomenon: it induces \textit{asymmetric leakage} from the cat-state subspace, where even- and odd-parity cat states decay at different rates. This leak asymmetry enables the dynamics of the system to be described by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, thereby transforming the cat qubit into a platform with controllable gain and loss for probing non-Hermitian physics. Within this platform, we demonstrate the possibility to control the parity-time symmetry phase transition in a single cat qubit by adjusting its amplitude. Moreover, we couple two cat qubits to realize an entanglement phase transition induced by the exceptional point. Our work constructs a controllable non-Hermitian system simulator, overturning the conventional paradigm that treats dephasing as harmful noise.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Key Distribution via Charge Teleportation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amir Yona, Yaron Oz</p>
            <p>We introduce a quantum key distribution (QKD) primitive based on charge teleportation: by Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC) on an entangled many-body ground state, Alice's one-bit choice steers the sign of a local charge shift at Bob, which directly encodes the key bit. Relative to energy teleportation schemes, the charge signal is bit-symmetric, measured in a single basis, and markedly more robust to realistic noise and model imperfections. We instantiate the protocol on transverse-field Ising models, star-coupled and one-dimensional chain, obtain closed-form results for two qubits, and for larger systems confirm performance via exact diagonalization, circuit-level simulations, and a proof-of-principle hardware run. We quantify resilience to classical bit flips and local quantum noise, identifying regimes where sign integrity, and hence key correctness, is preserved. These results position charge teleportation as a practical, low-rate QKD primitive compatible with near-term platforms.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Chip Co-Design for Fidelity and Entanglement Preservation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ahmad Salmanogli, Hesam Zandi</p>
            <p>This study introduces a superconducting quantum chip architecture designed to simultaneously preserve entanglement and readout fidelity, addressing one of the key trade-offs in the development of scalable quantum hardware. In conventional quantum circuits, strong qubit qubit coupling enhances entanglement but often leads to undesired crosstalk, dephasing, and reduced measurement fidelity. To mitigate these effects, we propose a hybrid multiqubit configuration consisting of nine transmon qubits organized into interior and exterior groups, interconnected via a flux tunable qubit and a network of distributed resonators. The interior qubits along with tunable qubit form an entanglement core, while the exterior qubits operate in the dispersive regime under large detuning to enable readout. The degree of entanglement can be dynamically tuned by adjusting the coupling between the central tunable qubit and the interior qubits. The total Hamiltonian includes all significant coupling contributions, encompassing effective exchange interactions among interior and exterior qubits, as well as their mediated couplings through interface resonators. By numerically solving the complete Hamiltonian alongside the Lindblad master equation, the system dynamics are characterized, allowing evaluation of both spectroscopic features and separation fidelity. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed design maintains strong entanglement by creating the avoided-crossing region while sustaining measurement fidelity around 0.995 under realistic noise conditions. These findings confirm that entanglement strength and readout fidelity can be co-optimized within a single, reconfigurable architecture, establishing a viable route toward high-performance and scalable superconducting quantum processors.</p>

            <h2>Engineered Robustness for Nonadiabatic Geometric Quantum Gates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xuan Zhang, XIao-le Li, Jingjing Niu, Tongxing Yan, Yuanzhen Chen</p>
            <p>While geometric quantum gates are often theorized to possess intrinsic resilience to control errors by exploiting the global properties of evolution paths, this promise has not consistently translated into practical robustness. We present a streamlined framework for nonadiabatic geometric quantum gates (NGQGs) that incorporates additional auxiliary constraints to suppress dynamical contamination and achieve super-robust performance. Within this framework, we also design NGQGs using noncyclic paths, offering enhanced design flexibility. Implemented on superconducting transmon qubits, our scheme realizes high-fidelity single-qubit gates that are robust against Rabi amplitude error $\epsilon$, with infidelity scaling as $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^4)$, in contrast to the $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^2)$ behavior of conventional dynamical gates. We further analyze two-qubit NGQGs under parametric driving. Our results identify subtle limitations that compromise performance in two-qubit scenarios, underscoring the importance of phase compensation and waveform calibration. The demonstrated simplicity and generality of our super-robust NGQG scheme make it applicable across diverse quantum platforms.</p>

            <h2>Local quantum coherence with intersource interactions at nonzero temperature</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yehor Hudenko, Michal Kolář, Radim Filip, Artem Ryabov</p>
            <p>Local quantum coherence in a two-level system (TLS) is typically generated via time-dependent driving. However, it can also emerge autonomously from symmetry-breaking interactions between the TLS and its surrounding environment at a low temperature. Although such environments often consist of interacting atoms or spins, the role of interactions within the environment in generating the autonomous local coherence has remained unexplored. Here, we address this gap by analyzing an exactly solvable model, which comprises a target TLS coupled to $N$ interacting source TLSs that represent the environment, with the whole system being in thermal equilibrium. We show that the local coherence not only persists but can be enhanced at finite temperatures of the environment compared to the case of no inter-source interactions. The temperature dependence of the coherence bears signatures of a quantum phase transition, and our analytical results suggest strategies for its optimization. Our findings reveal generic properties of the autonomously generated quantum coherence and point to viable routes for observing the coherence at nonzero temperatures.</p>

            <h2>Cluster States Generation with a Quantum Metasurface</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yehonatan Levin, Uri Israeli, Rivka Bekenstein</p>
            <p>We investigate the implementation of photonic cluster state generation protocols using quantum metasurfaces comprising sub-wavelength atomic arrays which enables quantum-controlled reflectivity. These cluster states are generated using fundamental quantum logic gates and enable wide-ranging applications in quantum computation and communication. In the past few years, certain protocols have been developed, but their physical realizations induces natural losses on the system mainly originated from coupling the photonic structures, setting a limit on the efficiency and maximal qubit number. In this paper, we examine a physical implementation of two specific protocols for generating distinct cluster states: a two-dimensional cluster state and a tree cluster state. Our approach leverages the unique properties of a quantum metasurface and its free space settings to implement two-qubit quantum-logic gates, namely CNOT, CZ, and E gates, with practical fidelities exceeding 0.9, and potential speed-up due to parallelism. In addition, we analyze these protocols fidelities for practical conditions of potential implementation experiments, such as thermal fluctuation of trapped atoms.</p>

            <h2>Neutral-atom quantum computation using multi-qubit geometric gates via adiabatic passage</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sinchan Snigdha Rej, Bimalendu Deb</p>
            <p>Adiabatic geometric phase gates offer enhanced robustness against fluctuations compared to con- ventional Rydberg blockade-based phase gates that rely on dynamical phase accumulation. We theoretically demonstrate two- and multi-qubit phase gates in a neutral atom architecture, relying on a double stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (double-STIRAP) pulse sequence that imprints a controllable geometric phase on the qubit systems. The system is designed in such a way that every atom is individually addressable, and moreover, no extra laser is required to be applied on the target atom while scaling up the system from two- to multi-qubit quantum gates. The gate fidelity has been numerically analyzed by changing the gate operation time, and we find that 98% to 99% fidelity can be achieved for gate time $\simeq$ 0.6 $\mu$s. We perform a systematic error analysis, which re- veals that our proposed gates can exhibit strong resilience against fluctuations in Rabi frequencies, finite blockade strength, and atomic position variations. These results establish our approach as a physically feasible and scalable pathway toward fault-tolerant quantum computation with neutral atoms. We simulate Grover's search algorithm for two-, three-, and four-qubit systems with high success probability and thereby demonstrate the utility and scalability of our proposed gates for quantum computation.</p>

            <h2>Hybrid Single-Ion Atomic-Ensemble Node for High-Rate Remote Entanglement Generation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benedikt Tissot, Soubhadra Maiti, Emil R. Hellebek, Anders Søndberg Sørensen</p>
            <p>Different quantum systems possess different favorable qualities. On the one hand, ensemble-based quantum memories are suited for fast multiplexed long-range entanglement generation. On the other hand, single-atomic systems provide access to gates for processing of information. Both of those can provide advantages for high-rate entanglement generation within quantum networks. We develop a hybrid architecture that takes advantage of these properties by combining trapped-ion nodes and nodes comprised of spontaneous parametric down conversion photon pair sources and absorptive memories based on rare-earth ion ensembles. To this end, we solve the central challenge of matching the different bandwidths of photons emitted by those systems in an initial entanglement-generation step. This enables the parallel execution of multiple probabilistic tasks in the initial stage. We show that our approach can lead to a significant speed-up for the fundamental task of creating ion-ion entanglement over hundreds of kilometers in a quantum network.</p>

            <h2>Scaling advantage with quantum-enhanced memetic tabu search for LABS</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alejandro Gomez Cadavid, Pranav Chandarana, Sebastián V. Romero, Jan Trautmann, Enrique Solano, Taylor Lee Patti, Narendra N. Hegade</p>
            <p>We introduce quantum-enhanced memetic tabu search (QE-MTS), a non-variational hybrid algorithm that achieves state-of-the-art scaling for the low-autocorrelation binary sequence (LABS) problem. By seeding the classical MTS with high-quality initial states from digitized counterdiabatic quantum optimization (DCQO), our method suppresses the empirical time-to-solution scaling to $\mathcal{O}(1.24^N)$ for sequence length $N \in [27,37]$. This scaling surpasses the best-known classical heuristic $\mathcal{O}(1.34^N)$ and improves upon the $\mathcal{O}(1.46^N)$ of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm, achieving superior performance with a $6\times$ reduction in circuit depth. A two-stage bootstrap analysis confirms the scaling advantage and projects a crossover point at $N \gtrsim 47$, beyond which QE-MTS outperforms its classical counterpart. These results provide evidence that quantum enhancement can directly improve the scaling of classical optimization algorithms for the paradigmatic LABS problem.</p>

            <h2>QEF: Reproducible and Exploratory Quantum Software Experiments</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vincent Gierisch, Wolfgang Mauerer</p>
            <p>Commercially available Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices now make small hybrid quantum-classical experiments practical, but many tools hide configuration or demand ad-hoc scripting. We introduce the Quantum Experiment Framework (QEF): A lightweight framework designed to support the systematic, hypothesis-driven study of quantum algorithms. Unlike many existing approaches, QEF emphasises iterative, exploratory analysis of evolving experimental strategies rather than exhaustive empirical evaluation of fixed algorithms using predefined quality metrics. The framework's design is informed by a comprehensive review of the literature, identifying principal parameters and measurement practices currently reported in the field. QEF captures all key aspects of quantum software and algorithm experiments through a concise specification that expands into a Cartesian product of variants for controlled large-scale parameter sweeps. This design enables rigorous and systematic evaluation, as well as precise reproducibility. Large sweeps are automatically partitioned into asynchronous jobs across simulators or cloud hardware, and ascertain full hyper-parameter traceability. QEF supports parameter reuse to improve overall experiment runtimes, and collects all metrics and metadata into a form that can be conveniently explored with standard statistical and visualisation software. By combining reproducibility and scalability while avoiding the complexities of full workflow engines, QEF seeks to lower the practical barriers to empirical research on quantum algorithms, whether these are designed for current NISQ devices or future error-corrected quantum systems.</p>

It is a key component to the implementation of CV quantum-information protocols and benefits from operating, by design, at room temperature. However, performing high-speed quantum information processing remains a major challenge, as conventional homodyne detectors often fail to sustain pulsed operation at high repetition rates due to electronic limitations. We present wideband homodyne detectors operating at near-infrared (NIR) and telecom wavelengths, with optimized performance at repetition rates up to 150 MHz. We demonstrate their performance by resolving the pulse-by-pulse structure of squeezed states of light at telecom wavelengths while preserving their spectral multimode properties.</p>

            <h2>Controlling Hong-Ou-Mandel antibunching via parity governed spectral shaping of biphoton states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mikhail Guselnikov, Alexei D. Kiselev, Andrei Gaidash, George Miroshnichenko, Anton Kozubov</p>
            <p>We investigate into experimentally detectable effects such as the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) bunching and antibunching. These regimes can be characterized using the symmetry degree parameter $D_S$ that enters the two-photon coincidence probability $P_{2c}=(1-D_S)/2$. In the case of HOM bunching (antibunching), $D_S$ is positive (negative). Though the symmetry degree can generally be expressed in terms of the difference between the contributions coming from the symmetric and antisymmetric parts of the biphoton joint spectral amplitude (JSA), $\psi(\omega_1,\omega_2)$, for a certain physically realizable class of the JSA, where $\psi(\omega_1,\omega_2)$ is proportional to the product of amplitudes $\varphi_1(\omega_1)\varphi_2(\omega_2)$ multiplied by a Gaussian shaped entangling factor, we find the sign of $D_S$ is primarily governed by the parity properties of the spectral function, $\varphi_{12}(\omega)=\varphi_1(\omega)\varphi_2^*(\omega)$. It is the even (odd) part of $\varphi_{12}=\varphi_{12}^{(+)}+\varphi_{12}^{(-)}$ that meets the parity condition $\varphi_{12}^{(+)}(\omega-\Omega)=\varphi_{12}^{(+)}(\Omega-\omega)$ ($\varphi_{12}^{(-)}(\omega-\Omega)=- \varphi_{12}^{(-)}(\Omega-\omega)$) to yield the positive (negative) contribution, $D_S^{(+)}$ ($-D_S^{(-)}$), to the symmetry degree parameter: $D_S=D_S^{(+)}-D_S^{(-)}$. We have shown that switching between the bunching and antibunching regimes can be realized using the experimentally accessible family of modulated biphoton states produced using the spectral phase modulation fine-tuned via the sub-nanometer scale variation of the path length. For this class of modulated states, the Schmidt number has been computed as a function of the modulation parameter. This dependence reveals the structure of narrow resonance peaks strongly correlated with the corresponding narrow dips of the symmetry degree where the HOM antibunching occurs.</p>

            <h2>Automated Discovery of Non-local Photonic Gates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sören Arlt, Mario Krenn, Xuemei Gu</p>
            <p>Interactions between quantum systems enable quantum gates, the building blocks of quantum information processing. In photonics, direct photon-photon interactions are too weak to be practically useful, so effective interactions are engineered with linear optics and measurement. A central challenge is to realize such interactions non-locally, i.e., between photons that remain spatially separated. We present experimental proposals for several essential non-local multiphoton quantum gates that act on spatially separated photons, in both qubit and high-dimensional qudit systems. All solutions were discovered by the AI-driven discovery system called PyTheus. Rather than using pre-shared entanglement or Bell state measurements, our gates use as a resource quantum indistinguishability by path identity - a technique that exploits coherent superpositions of the photon pair origins. While analyzing these solutions, we uncovered a new mechanism that mimics much of the properties of quantum teleportation, without shared entanglement or Bell state measurements. Technically, our results establish path indistinguishability as a practical resource for distributed quantum information processing; conceptually, they demonstrate how automated discovery systems can contribute new ideas and techniques in physics.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Search With Generalized Wildcards</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arjan Cornelissen, Nikhil S. Mande, Subhasree Patro, Nithish Raja, Swagato Sanyal</p>
            <p>In the search with wildcards problem [Ambainis, Montanaro, Quantum Inf.~Comput.'14], one's goal is to learn an unknown bit-string $x \in \{-1,1\}^n$. An algorithm may, at unit cost, test equality of any subset of the hidden string with a string of its choice. Ambainis and Montanaro showed a quantum algorithm of cost $O(\sqrt{n} \log n)$ and a near-matching lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$. Belovs [Comput.~Comp.'15] subsequently showed a tight $O(\sqrt{n})$ upper bound. We consider a natural generalization of this problem, parametrized by a subset $\cal{Q} \subseteq 2^{[n]}$, where an algorithm may test whether $x_S = b$ for an arbitrary $S \in \cal{Q}$ and $b \in \{-1,1\}^S$ of its choice, at unit cost. We show near-tight bounds when $\cal{Q}$ is any of the following collections: bounded-size sets, contiguous blocks, prefixes, and only the full set. All of these results are derived using a framework that we develop. Using symmetries of the task at hand we show that the quantum query complexity of learning $x$ is characterized, up to a constant factor, by an optimization program, which is succinctly described as follows: `maximize over all odd functions $f : \{-1,1\}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ the ratio of the maximum value of $f$ to the maximum (over $T \in \cal{Q}$) standard deviation of $f$ on a subcube whose free variables are exactly $T$.' To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first work to use the primal version of the negative-weight adversary bound (which is a maximization program typically used to show lower bounds) to show new quantum query upper bounds without explicitly resorting to SDP duality.</p>

            <h2>Krylov Complexity Meets Confinement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xuhao Jiang, Jad C. Halimeh, N. S. Srivatsa</p>
            <p>In high-energy physics, confinement denotes the tendency of fundamental particles to remain bound together, preventing their observation as free, isolated entities. Interestingly, analogous confinement behavior emerges in certain condensed matter systems, for instance, in the Ising model with both transverse and longitudinal fields, where domain walls become confined into meson-like bound states as a result of a longitudinal field-induced linear potential. In this work, we employ the Ising model to demonstrate that Krylov state complexity--a measure quantifying the spread of quantum information under the repeated action of the Hamiltonian on a quantum state--serves as a sensitive and quantitative probe of confinement. We show that confinement manifests as a pronounced suppression of Krylov complexity growth following quenches within the ferromagnetic phase in the presence of a longitudinal field, reflecting slow correlation dynamics. In contrast, while quenches within the paramagnetic phase exhibit enhanced complexity with increasing longitudinal field, reflecting the absence of confinement, those crossing the critical point to the ferromagnetic phase reveal a distinct regime characterized by orders-of-magnitude larger complexity and display trends of weak confinement. Notably, in the confining regime, the complexity oscillates at frequencies corresponding to the meson masses, with its power-spectrum peaks closely matching the semiclassical predictions.</p>

            <h2>Legal Entanglement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicholas Godfrey, Ted Sichelman</p>
            <p>Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon in which two physical systems are correlated in such a way that they appear to instantaneously affect one another, regardless of the distance between them. As commonly understood, Bell's Theorem famously demonstrates that any causal explanation of entanglement must discard either locality (the principle that nothing, including information, travels faster than light) or classical notions of realism (or both). Drawing on this concept, several legal scholars have metaphorically described 'entangled' legal concepts. For instance, if a state's highest court redefines the concept of 'foreseeability' in negligence law, this redefinition alters the concept of 'reasonable care' immediately in the eyes of the law. Godfrey (2024) is the first work to mathematically model entangled legal concepts, particularly in the context of legal interpretation. Here, we extend the quantification to the formulation and delineation of law (lawmaking) and the adjudication of law (judgment). In so doing, we connect legal entanglement to Sichelman's (2022) work on legal entropy, complexity, and the informational content of law. In addition to quantifying entanglement across various legal contexts, our approach provides broader insights. For example, it offers a more comprehensive analysis of the uses and limits of 'modularity' in law--specifically, the role legal boundaries (spatial or intangible) play in reducing information costs within legal systems. Moreover, we discuss how our model can improve theories of legal artificial intelligence. Finally, we explore the application of legal theory back to physics. If quantum physical entanglement operates analogously to legal entanglement, it requires discarding both locality and classical realism, though not in the manner commonly imagined.</p>

            <h2>Unified Effective Field Theory for Nonlinear and Quantum Optics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaochen Liu, Ken-Tye Yong</p>
            <p>Predicting phenomena that mix few-photon quantum optics with strong field nonlinear optics is hindered by the use of separate theoretical formalisms for each regime. We close this gap with a unified effective field theory valid for frequencies lower than the material-dependent cutoff set by the band gap, plasma frequency, or similar scale. The action couples the electromagnetic gauge field to vector polarisation modes. An isotropic potential generates the optical susceptibilities, while a higher-dimension axion-like term captures magnetoelectric effects; quantisation on the Schwinger-Keldysh contour with doubled BRST ghosts preserves gauge symmetry in dissipative media. One-loop renormalisation-group equations reproduce the measured dispersion of the third-order susceptibility from terahertz to near-visible frequencies after matching a single datum per material. Real-time dynamics solved with a matrix-product-operator engine yield two to four percent agreement with published results for GaAs polariton cavities, epsilon-near-zero indium-tin-oxide films and superconducting quarton circuits. The current formulation is limited to these 1-D geometries and sub-cut-off frequencies; higher-dimensional or above-cut-off phenomena will require additional degrees of freedom or numerical methods.</p>

            <p>Hydrides have long been considered promising candidates for achieving room-temperature superconductivity; however, the extremely high pressures typically required for high critical temperatures remain a major challenge in experiment. Here, we propose a class of high-Tc ambient-pressure superconductors with MH4 stoichiometry. These hydrogen-based compounds adopt the bcc PtHg4 structure type, in which hydrogen atoms occupy the one-quarter body-diagonal sites of metal lattices, with the metal atoms acting as chemical templates for hydrogen assembly. Through comprehensive first-principles calculations, we identify three promising superconductors, PtH4, AuH4 and PdH4, with superconducting critical temperatures of 84 K, 89 K, and 133 K, respectively, all surpassing the liquid-nitrogen temperature threshold of 77 K. The remarkable superconducting properties originate from strong electron-phonon coupling associated with hydrogen vibrations, which in turn arise from phonon softening in the mid-frequency range. Our results provide crucial insights into the design of high-Tc superconductors suitable for future experiments and applications at ambient pressure.</p>

            <p>Quarks and gluon, as quantum particles, are subjects to various effects that go beyond the naive parton picture and are not captured by ordinary parton densities. In this work, we investigate the twist-three parton distribution functions, which encode quantum interference between quark-gluon-quark states, and for the first time, determine them directly from experimental data. The analysis combines observables described by collinear and transverse-momentum-dependent factorization theorems within a unified global fit, incorporating a complete leading-order QCD evolution at the twist-three level. The extracted distributions reveal a clear flavor-dependent patterns and distinct from zero at a statistically significant level ($2-3\sigma$). These findings provide the first quantitative evidence for quark-gluon-quark correlations within the proton, revealing its genuinely quantum nature and opening a new direction for precision studies of partonic correlations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eugenia Pyurbeeva, Ronnie Kosloff</p>
            <p>Continuous particle exchange thermal machines require no time-dependent driving, can be realised in solid-state electronic devices, and miniaturised to nanometre scale. Quantum dots, providing a narrow energy filter and allowing to manipulate particle flow between the hot and cold reservoirs are at the heart of such devices. It has been theoretically shown that by mitigating passive heat flow, Carnot efficiency can be approached arbitrarily closely in a quantum dot heat engine, and experimentally, values of 0.7{\eta}C have been reached. However, for practical applications, other parameters of a thermal machine, such as maximum power, efficiency at maximum power, and noise - stability of the power output or heat extraction - take precedence over maximising efficiency. We explore the effect of internal microscopic dynamics of a quantum dot on these quantities and demonstrate that its performance as a thermal machine depends on few parameters - the overall conductance and three inherent asymmetries of the dynamics. These parameters will act as a guide to engineering the quantum states of the quantum dot, allowing to optimise its performance beyond that of the simplest case of a two-fold spin-degenerate transmission level.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Entanglement as a Cohomological Obstruction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kazuki Ikeda</p>
            <p>We recast quantum entanglement as a cohomological obstruction to reconstructing a global quantum state from locally compatible information. We address this by considering presheaf cohomologies of states and entanglement witnesses. Sheafification erases the global-from-local signature while leaving within-patch multipartite structure, captured by local entanglement groups introduced here. For smooth parameter families, the obstruction admits a differential-geometric representative obtained by pairing an appropriate witness field with the curvature of a natural unitary connection on the associated bundle of amplitudes. We also introduce a Quantum Entanglement Index (QEI) as an index-theoretic invariant of entangled states and explain its behavior. Finally, we outline a theoretical physics approach to probe these ideas in quantum many-body systems and suggest a possible entanglement-induced correction as an experimental target.</p>

            <h2>Emergent Dynamical Translational Symmetry Breaking as a Dynamical Order Principle for Localization and Topological Transitions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yucheng Wang</p>
            <p>Localization transitions represent a fundamental class of continuous phase transitions, yet they occur without any accompanying symmetry breaking. We resolve this by introducing the concept of dynamical translational symmetry (DTS), which is defined not by the Hamiltonian but by the long-time dynamics of local observables. Its order parameter, the time-averaged local translational contrast (TLTC), quantitatively diagnoses whether evolution restores or breaks translational equivalence. We demonstrate that the TLTC universally captures the Anderson localization transition, the many-body localization transition, and topological phase transitions, revealing that these disparate phenomena are unified by the emergent breaking of DTS. This work establishes a unified dynamical-symmetry framework for phases transitions beyond the equilibrium paradigm.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Siyu He, Hao Song</p>
            <p>We study a broad class of qudit stabilizer codes, termed $\mathbb{Z}_N$ bivariate-bicycle (BB) codes, arising either as two-dimensional realizations of modulated gauge theories or as $\mathbb{Z}_N$ generalizations of binary BB codes. Our central finding, derived from the polynomial representation, is that the essential topological properties of these $\mathbb{Z}_N$ codes can be determined by the properties of their $\mathbb{Z}_p$ counterparts, where $p$ are the prime factors of $N$, even when $N$ contains prime powers ($N = \prod_i p_i^{k_i}$). This result yields a significant simplification by leveraging the well-studied framework of codes with prime qudit dimensions. In particular, this insight directly enables the generalization of the algebraic-geometric methods (e.g., the Bernstein-Khovanskii-Kushnirenko theorem) to determine anyon fusion rules in the general qudit situation. Moreover, we analyze the model's symmetry-enriched topological order (SET) to reveal a quasi-fractonic behavior, resolving the anyon mobility puzzle in this class of models. We also present a computational algebraic method using Gröbner bases over the ring of integers to efficiently calculate the topological order and its SET properties.</p>

In this work, we present the first machine learning algorithm with the ability to automatically locate the charge transitions of an ion-implanted donor in a silicon device, tune single-shot charge readout, and identify the gate voltage parameters where tunnelling rates in and out the donor site are the same. The entire tuning pipeline is completed on the order of minutes. Our results enable both automatic characterisation and tuning of a donor in silicon devices faster than human experts.</p>

            <h2>Fermionic Casimir densities for a uniformly accelerating mirror in the Fulling-Rindler vacuum</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. A. Saharian, L. Sh. Grigoryan, V. Kh. Kotanjyan</p>
            <p>We investigate the local characteristics of the Fulling-Rindler vacuum for a massive Dirac field induced by a planar boundary moving with constant proper acceleration in $(D+1)$-dimensional flat spacetime. On the boundary, the field operator obeys the bag boundary condition. The boundary divides the right Rindler wedge into two separate regions, called RL and RR regions. In both these regions, the fermion condensate and the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the energy-momentum tensor are decomposed into two contributions. The first one presents the VEVs in the Fulling-Rindler vacuum when the boundary is absent and the second one is the boundary-induced contribution. For points away from the boundary, the renormalization is reduced to the one for the boundary-free geometry. The total VEVs are dominated by the boundary-free parts near the Rindler horizon and by the boundary-induced parts in the region near the boundary. For a massive field the boundary-free contributions in the fermion condensate and the vacuum energy density and effective pressures are negative everywhere. The boundary-induced contributions in the fermion condensate and the energy density are positive in the RL region and negative in the RR region. For a massless field the fermion condensate vanishes in spatial dimensions $D\geq 2$, while the VEV of the energy-momentum tensor is different from zero. This behavior contrasts with that of the VEVs in the Minkowski vacuum for the geometry of a boundary at rest relative to an inertial observer. In the latter case, the fermion condensate for a massless field is nonzero, while the VEV of the energy-momentum tensor becomes zero.</p>

In parallel, we apply an independent dynamical approach that combines compressibility and sound velocity measurements to determine the superfluid fraction. Both methods yield consistent results in good agreement with simulations of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation as well as with the Leggett bounds determined from the measured density profiles.</p>

            <h2>Path distributions for describing eigenstates of the harmonic oscillator and other 1-dimensional problems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Randall M. Feenstra</p>
            <p>The manner in which probability amplitudes of paths sum up to form wave functions of a harmonic oscillator, as well as other, simple 1-dimensional problems, is described. Using known, closed-form, path-based propagators for each problem, an integral expression is written that describes the wave function. This expression conventionally takes the form of an integral over initial locations of a particle, but it is re-expressed here in terms of a characteristic momentum associated with motion between the endpoints of a path. In this manner, the resulting expression can be analyzed using a generalization of stationary-phase analysis, leading to distributions of paths that exactly describe each eigenstate. These distributions are valid for all travel times, but when evaluated for long times they turn out to be real, non-negative functions of the characteristic momentum. For the harmonic oscillator in particular, a somewhat broad distribution is found, peaked at value of momentum that corresponds to a classical energy which in turn equals the energy eigenvalue for the state being described.</p>

            <p>Ground state preparation is a central application for quantum computers but remains challenging in practice. In this work, we quantitatively investigate the performance and gate counts of double-bracket quantum algorithms (DBQAs) for ground state preparation. We propose a practical strategy in which DBQAs refine initial state preparation circuits, and we compile them for Heisenberg chains using controlled-Z and single-qubit gates. Warm-started DBQAs consistently improve both the energy and ground-state fidelity relative to the initial states provided by variational ansätze, indicating that DBQAs offer an effective unitary synthesis method. To demonstrate compatibility with near-term hardware, we executed a proof-of-concept example on IBM devices. With error mitigation, we observed a statistically significant improvement over the corresponding warm-start circuit. Furthermore, numerical emulations for the same system size indicate that executing DBQAs on Quantinuum's hardware could achieve similar cost-function gains without requiring error mitigation. These findings suggest that DBQAs are a promising approach for enhancing ground-state approximations on near-term quantum devices.</p>

            <p>Quantum computing is an emerging field recognized for the significant speedup it offers over classical computing through quantum algorithms. However, designing and implementing quantum algorithms pose challenges due to the complex nature of quantum mechanics and the necessity for precise control over quantum states. Despite the significant advancements in AI, there has been a lack of datasets specifically tailored for this purpose. In this work, we introduce QCircuitBench, the first benchmark dataset designed to evaluate AI's capability in designing and implementing quantum algorithms using quantum programming languages. Unlike using AI for writing traditional codes, this task is fundamentally more complicated due to highly flexible design space. Our key contributions include: 1. A general framework which formulates the key features of quantum algorithm design for Large Language Models. 2. Implementations for quantum algorithms from basic primitives to advanced applications, spanning 3 task suites, 25 algorithms, and 120,290 data points. 3. Automatic validation and verification functions, allowing for iterative evaluation and interactive reasoning without human inspection. 4. Promising potential as a training dataset through preliminary fine-tuning results. We observed several interesting experimental phenomena: LLMs tend to exhibit consistent error patterns, and fine-tuning does not always outperform few-shot learning.

            <p>Warehouses play a central role in industrial logistics, functioning as critical hubs for storing and organizing inventory to support efficient production. Optimizing item allocation within these facilities is essential for reducing operational costs and improving delivery times. In this work, we address the optimization of inventory allocation in warehouses equipped with gravity-flow racks, which are designed for First In, First Out (FIFO) logistics, a configuration that inherently requires item reinsertions during retrieval operations to maintain flow continuity. These reinsertions, however, are time-consuming and costly, so minimizing their occurrence is crucial for operational efficiency. We propose an optimization strategy that simultaneously allocates multiple items, determining their placement across available shelves in a single decision step, explicitly accounting for every item and every shelf in the warehouse. By jointly evaluating multiple items, our approach enables globally optimized placement decisions, minimizing conflicts that arise in sequential methods. The problem is formulated as a QUBO, allowing implementation on both classical metaheuristics and quantum-hybrid solvers. We assess performance by comparing three classical optimization approaches - two variants of Simulated Annealing and the commercial solver Gurobi - with D-Wave's hybrid solver, which uniquely combines quantum annealing with classical metaheuristics. Complementing these benchmarks, a factory-scale simulation based on real operational data shows that considering larger batches of items in the allocation step can significantly reduce reinsertions, highlighting the practical potential of the proposed approach for industrial logistics.</p>

            <p>We introduce a classical computational method for quantum dynamics that relies on a global-in-time variational principle. Unlike conventional time-stepping approaches, our scheme computes the entire state trajectory over a finite time window by minimizing a loss function that enforces the Schrödinger's equation. The variational state is parametrized with a Galerkin-inspired ansatz based on a time-dependent linear combination of time-independent Neural Quantum States. This structure is particularly well-suited for exploring long-time dynamics and enables bounding the error with the exact evolution via the global loss function. We showcase the method by simulating global quantum quenches in the paradigmatic Transverse-Field Ising model in both 1D and 2D, uncovering signatures of ergodicity breaking and absence of thermalization in two dimensions. Overall, our method is competitive compared to state-of-the-art time-dependent variational approaches, while unlocking previously inaccessible dynamical regimes of strongly interacting quantum systems.</p>

At small mutual laser detunings (<=0.5GHz), the results are accurately described by the pure-state model [Nat. Commun. 16, 6453 (2025)], which treats all resonance-fluorescence photons as spontaneous emission. At larger detunings, we uncover an anomalous feature in the two-photon interference, where the normalised second-order correlation function under orthogonal polarisations yields g2_vert(0) < 0.5.</p>

            <p>Although particle production in curved quantum field theories (cQFTs) is key to our understanding of the early universe and black hole physics, its direct observation requires extreme conditions or unrealistic sensitivities. Recent progress in quantum simulators indicates that analogues of cosmological particle production can be observed in table-top experiments of cold atomic gases described by effective cQFTs. This promises a high degree of tunability in the synthesised curved spacetimes and, moreover, sets a clear roadmap to explore the interplay of particle production with other non-perturbative effects genuine to interacting QFTs. We hereby focus on the appearance of scalar and pseudo-scalar condensates for self-interacting Dirac fermions, and study how dynamical mass generation and spontaneous symmetry breaking affects real-time dynamics through the lens of entanglement. We use the entanglement contour (EC) to analyse the spatio-temporal structure of particle production, showing that a quasi-particle picture for the EC captures the cosmological horizon in accelerating spacetimes, while also being sensitive to the effect of different symmetry-breaking processes. In particular, we show that the combined breakdown of time-reversal symmetry due to the expanding spacetime, and parity due to a pseudo-scalar condensate, manifests through the structure of the light-cone-like propagation of entanglement.</p>

            <p>The deterministic and time-reversal symmetric dynamics of isolated quantum systems is at odds with irreversible equilibration observed in generic thermodynamic systems. Standard approaches at a reconciliation employ subjective restrictions on the space of observables or states and do not explain how a single macroscopic quantum system achieves equilibrium dynamically. We instead argue that quantum theory is an effective theory and requires corrections to accurately describe systems approaching the thermodynamic limit. We construct a stochastic extension of quantum theory which is practically identical to quantum mechanics for microscopic systems, yet allows single, isolated macroscopic systems to objectively thermalize, generically. A fluctuation-dissipation relation guarantees physical consistency including norm preservation, energy conservation, no superluminal signalling and the emergence of microcanonical equilibrium. We further discuss the inclusion of objective collapse, thereby realizing a falsifiable theory of spontaneous universal irreversibility which describes the quantum-to-classical crossover dynamics of macroscopic quantum systems. The dynamics of the model describe spontaneous symmetry breaking, quantum state reduction and objective quantum thermalization for individual systems while realizing an emergent hybrid statistics for ensembles which interpolates between Born's rules and microcanonical equilibrium.</p>

            <p>We derive some properties of the hydrogen atom inside a box with an impenetrable wall that have not been discussed before. Suitable scaling of the Hamiltonian operator proves to be useful for the derivation of some general properties of the eigenvalues. The radial part of the Schrödinger equation is conditionally solvable and the exact polynomial solutions provide useful information. There are accidental degeneracies that take place at particular values of the box radius, some of which can be determined from the conditionally-solvable condition. Some of the roots stemming from the conditionally-solvable condition appear to converge towards the critical values of the model parameter. This analysis is facilitated by the Rayleigh-Ritz method that provides accurate eigenvalues.</p>

            <h2>Approximate Quadratization of High-Order Hamiltonians for Combinatorial Quantum Optimization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sabina Drăgoi, Alberto Baiardi, Daniel J. Egger</p>
            <p>Combinatorial optimization problems have wide-ranging applications in industry and academia. Quantum computers may help solve them by sampling from carefully prepared Ansatz quantum circuits. However, current quantum computers are limited by their qubit count, connectivity, and noise. This is particularly restrictive when considering optimization problems beyond the quadratic order. Here, we introduce Ansatze based on an approximate quadratization of high-order Hamiltonians which do not incur a qubit overhead. The price paid is a loss in the quality of the noiseless solution. Crucially, this approximation yields shallower Ansatze which are more robust to noise than the standard QAOA one. We show this through simulations of systems of 8 to 16 qubits with variable noise strengths. Furthermore, we also propose a noise-aware Ansatz design method for quadratic optimization problems. This method implements only part of the corresponding Hamiltonian by limiting the number of layers of SWAP gates in the Ansatz. We find that for both problem types, under noise, our approximate implementation of the full problem structure can significantly enhance the solution quality. Our work opens a path to enhance the solution quality that approximate quantum optimization achieves on noisy hardware.</p>

            <h2>Low-Level and NUMA-Aware Optimization for High-Performance Quantum Simulation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ali Rezaei, Luc Jaulmes, Maria Bahna, Oliver Thomson Brown, Antonio Barbalace</p>
            <p>Scalable classical simulation of quantum circuits is crucial for advancing quantum algorithm development and validating emerging hardware. This work focuses on performance enhancements through targeted low-level and NUMA-aware tuning on a single-node system, thereby not only advancing the efficiency of classical quantum simulations but also establishing a foundation for scalable, heterogeneous implementations that bridge toward noiseless quantum computing. Although few prior studies have reported similar hardware-level optimizations, such implementations have not been released as open-source software, limiting independent validation and further development. We introduce an open-source, high-performance extension to the QuEST state vector simulator that integrates state-of-the-art low-level and NUMA-aware optimizations for modern processors. Our approach emphasizes locality-aware computation and incorporates hardware-specific techniques including NUMA-aware memory allocation, thread pinning, AVX-512 vectorization, aggressive loop unrolling, and explicit memory prefetching. Experiments demonstrate substantial speedups--5.5-6.5x for single-qubit gate operations, 4.5x for two-qubit gates, 4x for Random Quantum Circuits (RQC), and 1.8x for the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT). Algorithmic workloads further achieve 4.3-4.6x acceleration for Grover and 2.5x for Shor-like circuits. These results show that systematic, architecture-aware tuning can significantly extend the practical simulation capacity of classical quantum simulators on current hardware.</p>

            <h2>Positive maps and extendibility hierarchies from copositive matrices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aabhas Gulati, Ion Nechita, Sang-Jun Park</p>
            <p>This work introduces and systematically studies a new convex cone of PCOP (pairwise copositive). We establish that this cone is dual to the cone of PCP (pairwise completely positive) and, critically, provides a complete characterization for the positivity of the broad class of covariant maps. We provide a way to lift matrices from the cone of COP to PCOP, thereby creating a powerful bridge between the theory of copositive forms and the positive maps. We develop an analogous framework for decomposable maps, introducing the cone PDEC. As a primary application of this framework, we define a novel family of linear maps $\Phi_t^G$ parameterized by a graph $G$ and a real parameter $t$. We derive exact thresholds on $t$ that determine when these maps are positive or decomposable, linking these properties to fundamental graph-theoretic parameters. This construction yields vast new families of positive indecomposable maps, for which we provide explicit examples derived from infinite classes of graphs, most notably rank 3 strongly regular graphs such as Paley graphs. On the dual side, we investigate the entanglement properties of large classes of (symmetric) states. We prove that the SOS hierarchies used in polynomial optimization to approximate the cone of copositive matrices correspond precisely to dual cones of witnesses for different levels of the PPT bosonic extendibility hierarchy}-. In the setting of the DPS hierarchy for separability, we construct a large family of optimal entanglement witnesses that are not certifiable by any level of the PPT bosonic extendibility hierarchy, answering a long standing open question from [DPS04]. Leveraging the duality, we also provide an explicit construction of (mixture of) bipartite Dicke states that are simultaneously entangled and $K_r$-PPT bosonic extendible for any desired hierarchy level $r \geq 2$ and local dimension $n \geq 5$.</p>

            <h2>Learning stabilizer structure of quantum states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Srinivasan Arunachalam, Arkopal Dutt</p>
            <p>We consider the task of learning a structured stabilizer decomposition of an arbitrary $n$-qubit quantum state $|\psi\rangle$: for $\epsilon > 0$, output a state $|\phi\rangle$ with stabilizer-rank $\textsf{poly}(1/\epsilon)$ such that $|\psi\rangle=|\phi\rangle+|\phi'\rangle$ where $|\phi'\rangle$ has stabilizer fidelity $< \epsilon$. We first show the existence of such decompositions using the recently established inverse theorem for the Gowers-$3$ norm of states [AD,STOC'25]. To learn this structure, we initiate the task of self-correction of a state $|\psi\rangle$ with respect to a class of states $S$: given copies of $|\psi\rangle$ which has fidelity $\geq \tau$ with a state in $S$, output $|\phi\rangle \in S$ with fidelity $|\langle \phi | \psi \rangle|^2 \geq \tau^C$ for a constant $C>1$. Assuming the algorithmic polynomial Frieman-Rusza (APFR) conjecture in the high doubling regime (whose combinatorial version was recently resolved [GGMT,Annals of Math.'25]), we give a polynomial-time algorithm for self-correction of stabilizer states. Given access to the state preparation unitary $U_\psi$ for $|\psi\rangle$ and its controlled version $cU_\psi$, we give a polynomial-time protocol that learns a structured decomposition of $|\psi\rangle$. Without assuming APFR, we give a quasipolynomial-time protocol for the same task. As our main application, we give learning algorithms for states $|\psi\rangle$ promised to have stabilizer extent $\xi$, given access to $U_\psi$ and $cU_\psi$. We give a protocol that outputs $|\phi\rangle$ which is constant-close to $|\psi\rangle$ in time $\textsf{poly}(n,\xi^{\log \xi})$, which can be improved to polynomial-time assuming APFR. This gives an unconditional learning algorithm for stabilizer-rank $k$ states in time $\textsf{poly}(n,k^{k^2})$. As far as we know, learning arbitrary states with even stabilizer-rank $2$ was unknown.</p>

            <p>A central concept in quantum information processing is genuine multipartite entanglement (GME), a type of correlation beyond biseparability, that is, correlations that cannot be explained by statistical mixtures of partially separable states. GME is relevant for characterizing and benchmarking complex quantum systems, and it is an important resource for applications such as quantum communication. Remarkably, it has been found that GME can be activated from multiple copies of biseparable quantum states, which do not possess GME individually. Here, we experimentally demonstrate unambiguous evidence of such GME activation from two copies of a biseparable three-qubit state in a trapped-ion quantum processor. These results not only challenge notions of quantum resources but also highlight the potential of using multiple copies of quantum states to achieve tasks beyond the capabilities of the individual copies.</p>

            <h2>Matrix product state approach to lossy boson sampling and noisy IQP sampling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sojeong Park, Changhun Oh</p>
            <p>Sampling problems have emerged as a central avenue for demonstrating quantum advantage on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. However, physical noise can fundamentally alter their computational complexity, often making them classically tractable. Motivated by the recent success of matrix product state (MPS)-based classical simulation of Gaussian boson sampling (Oh et al., 2024), we extend this framework to investigate the classical simulability of other noisy quantum sampling models. We develop MPS-based classical algorithms for lossy boson sampling and noisy instantaneous quantum polynomial-time (IQP) sampling, both of which retain the tunable accuracy characteristic of the MPS approach through the bond dimension. Our approach constructs pure-state decompositions of noisy or lossy input states whose components remain weakly entangled after circuit evolution, thereby providing a means to systematically explore the boundary between quantum-hard and classically-simulable regimes. For boson sampling, we analyze single-photon, Fock, and cat-state inputs, showing that classical simulability emerges at transmission rates scaling as $O(1/\sqrt{N})$, reaching the known boundary of quantum advantage with a tunable and scalable method. Beyond reproducing previous thresholds, our algorithm offers significantly improved control over the accuracy-efficiency trade-off. It further extends the applicability of MPS-based simulation to broader classes of noisy quantum sampling models, including IQP circuits.</p>

            <p>Electromagnetic simulations form an indispensable part of the design and optimization process for superconducting quantum devices. Although several commercial platforms exist, open-source alternatives optimized for high-performance computing remain limited. To address this gap, we introduce SQDMetal, a Python-based API that integrates Qiskit Metal (IBM), Gmsh, Palace (AWS), and Paraview (Kitware) into an open-source, highly parallel simulation workflow for superconducting quantum circuits. SQDMetal enables accurate, efficient, and scalable simulations while remaining community-driven and free from commercial constraints. In this work, we validate SQDMetal through mesh convergence studies which benchmark SQDMetal against COMSOL Multiphysics and Ansys, demonstrating excellent agreement for both eigenmode and electrostatic (capacitance) simulations. Furthermore, we simulate superconducting resonators and transmon qubits, showing reasonable agreement with experimental measurements. SQDMetal also supports advanced capabilities, including Hamiltonian extraction via the energy participation ratio (EPR) method, incorporation of kinetic inductance effects, and full 3D modelling of device geometry for improved predictive accuracy. By unifying open-source tools into a single framework, SQDMetal lowers the barriers to entry for community members seeking to access high-performance simulations to assist in the design and optimization of their devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Manuel Calixto, Octavio Castaños</p>
            <p>Quantum information measures are proposed to analyze the structure of near-gap electronic states in HgTe quantum wells in a strip geometry $(x,y)\in (-\infty,\infty)\times [0,L]$ of finite width $L$. This allows us to establish criteria for distinguishing edge from bulk states in the topological insulator phase, including the transition region and cutoff of the wave number $k_x$ where edge states degenerate with bulk states. Qualitative and quantitative information on the near-gap Hamiltonian eigenstates, obtained by tight-binding calculations, is extracted from localization measures, like the inverse participation ratio (IPR), entanglement entropies of the reduced density matrix (RDM) to the spin sector --measuring quantum correlations due to the spin-orbit coupling (SOC)-- and from correlation functions for a $y$-space partition. The analysis of IPR and entanglement entropies in terms of spin, wave number $k_x$ and position $y$, evidences a spin polarization structure and spatial confinement of near-gap wave functions at the boundaries $y=0,L$ and low $k_x$, as correspond to helical edge states. IPR localization measures provide momentum $k_x$ cutoffs from which near-gap states are no longer localized at the boundaries of the sample and become part of the bulk. Below this $k_x$-point cutoff, the entanglement entropy and the spin probabilities of the RDM also capture the spin polarization structure of edge states and exhibit a higher variability compared to the relatively low entropy of the bulk state region. For a real-space partition, the edge-state region in momentum space exhibits lower correlation modulus, but higher correlation arguments, than the bulk-state region.</p>

We extend this formula to describe particle and energy currents with gain or loss in the intermediate region by using the Lindblad-Keldysh formalism. Based on the derived formula, several novel effects induced by gain or loss in the current are discussed: the breaking of inversion symmetry in the gain and loss terms or in the system can lead to current generation; the anomalous phenomenon that disorder can induce current generation; the presence of gain and loss makes the thermal and electrical conductances continuous and ensures they follow the Wiedemann-Franz law even outside the energy band; the effect of bond loss-induced skin effect on current.

            <p>In this paper, we revisit Fujikawa's path integral formulation of the chiral anomaly and develop a generalised framework for systematically defining a regularised functional measure. This construction extends the $\eta$ regularisation scheme to operator language, making the connection between spectral asymmetry and measure transformation fully explicit. Before recovering Fujikawa's expression for the chiral anomaly from the regularised measure, we explore the deeper number-theoretic structure underlying the ill-defined spectral sum associated with the anomaly, interpreting it through the lens of smoothed asymptotics. Our approach unifies two complementary perspectives: the analytic regularisation of Fujikawa and the topological characterisation given by the Atiyah-Singer index theorem. We further investigate how the measure transforms under changes to the regularisation scale and derive a function $\iota_E(\Lambda)$ that encodes this dependence, showing how its Mellin moments govern the appearance of divergences. Finally, we comment on the conceptual relationship between the regularised measure, $\eta$ regularisation, and the generalised Schwinger proper-time formalism, with a particular focus on the two-dimensional Schwinger model.</p>

While AQMBS states are closely related to quantum many-body scar (QMBS) states, they exhibit key differences. Unlike QMBS states, AQMBS states are not energy eigenstates of the Hamiltonian, making their construction more challenging. We demonstrate that, under appropriate conditions, AQMBS states can be obtained as low-lying gapless excited states of a parent Hamiltonian, which has a QMBS state as its ground state. Furthermore, our formalism reveals a connection between QMBS and supersymmetric (SUSY) quantum mechanics. The QMBS state can be interpreted as a SUSY-unbroken ground state.</p>

            <p>We study, using the metric variables, how an effective theory for the Oppenheimer-Snyder gravitational collapse can be built with the $\bar{\mu}$ scheme from Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG). The collapse is analyzed for both the flat and spherical models. In both scenarios the effective theory make possible to avoid the formation of the singularity. The source of this is found in the presence of a negative pressure term inside the stress-energy tensor of the gravitational field. This pressure is analyzed and is concluded that the effective polymer model is the reason why the negative pressure appears. A characterization of the solutions for both models is also carried out, showing that the collapse is altered and avoided in favor of a transition from a black hole state to a white hole one, transition that occurs when the collapse has reached a Planckian regime.</p>

            <p>In holography, gauging symmetries of the boundary theory leads to important modifications in the bulk. In this work, we study constraints to gauge symmetry sectors in the chord Hilbert space of the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) with matter, and we connect them to different proposals of its bulk dual. These sectors include chord parity symmetry, corresponding to End-Of-The-World (ETW) branes and Euclidean wormholes in sine dilaton gravity; and relative time-translations in a doubled DSSYK model (resulting from a single DSSYK with an infinitely heavy matter chord) used in de Sitter holography. We define and evaluate partition functions and thermal correlation functions of the ETW brane and Euclidean wormhole systems in the boundary theory. We deduce the holographic dictionary by matching geodesic lengths in the bulk with the spread complexity of the parity-gauged DSSYK. The Euclidean wormholes of fixed size are perturbatively stable, and their baby universe Hilbert space is non-trivial only when matter is added. We conclude studying the constraints in the path integral of the doubled DSSYK. We derive the gauge invariant operator algebra of one of the DSSYKs dressed to the other one and discuss its holographic interpretation.</p>

            <h2>A Conservative Theory of Semiclassical Gravity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francisco Pipa</p>
            <p>We argue that semiclassical gravity can be made consistent by assuming that quantum systems source or are classically affected by a gravitational field only when they undergo certain non-gravitational interactions that give rise to environment-induced decoherence. When systems are not affected by this decoherence-inducing process, they do not source a gravitational field, and the expectation value of their stress-energy tensor does not enter the semiclassical equations describing the gravitational field in a region. In the absence of these interactions in a region, spacetime may be flat. We argue that this can be tested by investigating the gravitational field sourced by quasi-isolated systems and the absence of gravity-mediated entanglement in the Bose-Marletto-Vedral (BMV) experiment, providing distinct predictions. We propose a possible kind of decoherence-inducing interactions that give rise to gravity, which involve chains of causally ordered non-gravitational localized interactions between quantum systems modeled via decoherence and test functions that we call Stable Determination Chains (SDCs). SDCs obey conditions that aim to address the measurement problem and allow for a conservative theory of gravity. It is conservative because it does not need to modify the fundamental equations of quantum theory, unlike spontaneous and gravity-induced collapse approaches to semiclassical gravity, and without invoking relationalism. Furthermore, it does not appeal to nonlocal, retrocausal, or superdeterministic hidden variables. We argue that these SDCs provide additional benefits, such as a semiclassical estimate of the value of the cosmological constant, the prediction of a time-varying cosmological constant that weakens with time, in agreement with some of the recent evidence, and a proposal about how SDCs give rise to gravity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhao Zhang, Cecilie Glittum</p>
            <p>The Hubbard model in the $U\to\infty$ limit has recently been shown to have resonant valence bond (RVB) ground states on the corner-sharing sawtooth and pyrochlore lattices in the dilute doping limit of a single vacancy. The two results were obtained by different approaches which do not apply to one another. We make the first step towards unifying them by studying the quasi-1D lattice of a pyrochlore stripe, where all corners are not shared between two tetrahedra, and the valence bond configurations are not fixed by the location of the vacancy. The energy level ordering of irreducible representations of each tetrahedron shows that a chain of them has exponentially degenerate partial RVB or dimer-monomer ground states where each tetrahedron hosts one spin-$1/2$ monomer and one spin-$0$ dimer. The exact ground states in the infinitely long chain limit are analytically solved by introducing basis transformations between local Hilbert spaces of neighboring tetrahedra, and its energy agrees with the extrapolation of numerical exact diagonalization results of finite sized systems.</p>

In addition to standard localized and ergodic phases, we identify a regime that exhibits volume-law entanglement coexisting with intermediate spectral statistics. We also identify another nonstandard regime marked by Poisson level statistics, sub-volume entanglement growth, and rare-event-dominated correlations, indicative of emerging ergodic instabilities. These results highlight unconventional routes of ergodicity breaking and offer fresh perspectives on how Anderson localization may be destabilized.</p>

The behaviors of these quantum correlations differ from those in elementary particle-antiparticle systems such as the top quark and tau lepton due to the polarization effect. The hierarchy of quantum correlations is examined and partially confirmed in hyperon-antihyperon systems: $ \textrm{Bell Nonlocality} \subset \textrm{Steering} \subset \textrm{Entanglement} \subset \text{Discord}$.

            <p>Recent advances in scaling up spin-based quantum processors have revealed unanticipated issues related to thermal effects. Microwave pulses required to manipulate and read the qubits are found to overheat the spins environment, which unexpectedly induces Larmor frequency shifts, reducing thereby gate fidelities. In this study, we shine light on these elusive thermal effects, by experimentally characterizing the temperature dependence of the Larmor frequency for a single hole spin in silicon. Our results unambiguously reveal an electrical origin underlying the thermal susceptibility, stemming from the spin-orbit-induced electric susceptibility. We perform an accurate modeling of the spin electrostatic environment and gyromagnetic properties, allowing us to pinpoint electric dipoles as responsible for these frequency shifts, that unfreeze as the temperature increases. Surprisingly, we find that the thermal susceptibility can be tuned with the magnetic field angle and can even cancel out, unveiling a sweet spot where the hole spin is rendered immune to thermal effects. These findings bear important implications for optimizing spin-based quantum processors fidelity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bowen Ouyang, Pratik Rath</p>
            <p>Previous work on Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity has shown that, at low temperatures, the annealed entropy becomes negative and departs from the quenched entropy. From the perspective of the random-matrix theory (RMT) dual of JT gravity, this effect is encoded in the continuous spectrum at the spectral edge that is universally described by the Airy model. At low temperature, the quenched entropy exhibits a power law dependence determined by the symmetry class of the RMT ensemble. Here we study the same question in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model which possesses much more structure than RMT. Through numerical simulations, we find that the level spacing statistics of the SYK model match the relevant RMT ensembles even near the spectral edge, thus leading to an agreement with the RMT prediction for the power-law behaviour of the quenched entropy at low temperatures. We also show similar effects in supersymmetric wormholes filled with matter, which is modeled by the $\mathcal N = 2$ supersymmetric SYK model. Numerically extracting the spectral edge properties of the BPS operators allows us to compute the quenched entanglement entropy of the wormhole in the large particle number limit.</p>

            <h2>Universality in Ionic Three-body Systems Near an Ion-atom Feshbach Resonance</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jacek Gȩbala, Michał Tomza, José P. D'Incao</p>
            <p>We calculate bound and scattering properties of a system of two neutral atoms and an ion near an atom-ion Feshbach resonance. Our results indicate that long-range atom-ion interactions lead to significant deviations from universal behavior derived from contact or van der Waals potentials. We find that ionic systems display an overall suppression of inelastic transitions leading to recombination rates and lifetimes of Efimov state orders of magnitude smaller with respect to those for neutral atoms. We further characterize the dense spectra of triatomic molecular ions with extended lifetimes. Our results provide a deeper insight on the universality and structure of three-body ionic systems and establishing them as a promising platform for exploring novel few- and many-body phenomena with long-range interactions.</p>

            <h2>High-temperature superconducting Majorana fermions platforms in the layered Kitaev Materials: Case study of $Li_2IrO_3$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elnaz Rostampour, Badie Ghavami</p>
            <p>Recent advances in Kitaev materials have highlighted their potential to host Majorana fermions without or high-temperature of superconductivity. In this research, we propose $Li_2IrO_3$ as a promising High-temperature superconducting platform supporting Majorana edge modes due to its strong spin-orbit coupling, honeycomb lattice structure, and proximity to a quantum spin liquid (QSL) phase. A theoretical and numerical framework based on the Kitaev-Heisenberg Hamiltonian is developed to model spin interactions in $Li_2IrO_3$. Here, the existence of topological zero-energy states is demonstrated, and their signatures in the edge-localized spectral weight are identified. A device concept based on this material is also proposed with potential industrial applications in spintronics, magnetic field sensing, and topological quantum memory.</p>

            <h2>Clifford Hierarchy Stabilizer Codes: Transversal Non-Clifford Gates and Magic</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryohei Kobayashi, Guanyu Zhu, Po-Shen Hsin</p>
            <p>A fundamental problem in fault-tolerant quantum computation is the tradeoff between universality and dimensionality, exemplified by the the Bravyi-König bound for $n$-dimensional topological stabilizer codes. In this work, we extend topological Pauli stabilizer codes to a broad class of $n$-dimensional Clifford hierarchy stabilizer codes. These codes correspond to the $(n+1)$D Dijkgraaf-Witten gauge theories with non-Abelian topological order. We construct transversal non-Clifford gates through automorphism symmetries represented by cup products. In 2D, we obtain the first transversal non-Clifford logical gates including T and CS for Clifford stabilizer codes, using the automorphism of the twisted $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$ gauge theory (equivalent to $\mathbb{D}_4$ topological order). We also combine it with the just-in-time decoder to fault-tolerantly prepare the logical T magic state in $O(d)$ rounds via code switching. In 3D, we construct a transversal logical $\sqrt{\text{T}}$ gate in a non-Clifford stabilizer code at the third level of the Clifford hierarchy, located on a tetrahedron corresponding to a twisted $\mathbb{Z}_2^4$ gauge theory. Due to the potential single-shot code-switching properties of these codes, one could achieve the 4th level of Clifford hierarchy with an $O(d^3)$ space-time overhead, avoiding the tradeoff observed in 2D. We propose a conjecture extending the Bravyi-König bound to Clifford hierarchy stabilizer codes, with our explicit constructions providing an upper bound of spatial dimension $(N-1)$ for achieving the logical gates in the $N^\text{th}$-level of Clifford hierarchy.</p>

            <h2>Zero-Noise Extrapolation via Cyclic Permutations of Quantum Circuit Layouts</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zahar Sayapin, Daniil Rabinovich, Nikita Korolev, Kirill Lakhmanskiy</p>
            <p>Increasing the utility of currently available Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices requires developing efficient methods to mitigate hardware errors, taking into account the constraints of these devices such as medium number of qubits and limited connectivity between them. In this work we propose a novel Cyclic Layout Permutations based Zero Noise Extrapolation (CLP-ZNE) protocol for such a task. The method leverages the inherent non-uniformity of gate errors in NISQ hardware and exploits symmetries of quantum circuits with one-dimensional connectivity to extrapolate the expectation value, averaged over cyclic circuit layout permutations, to the level of zero noise. In contrast to the previous layout permutation based approaches, for $n$ qubit circuit CLP-ZNE requires measurements of only $O(n)$ different circuit layouts to reconstruct the noiseless expected value. When benchmarked against noise channels modeling the IBM Torino quantum computer, the method reduces a typical expectation value error by an order of magnitude, depending on the protocol specifications. By employing a noise model derived from real hardware specifications, including both depolarizing and $T_1/T_2$ relaxation processes, these results give evidence for the applicability of CLP-ZNE to present-day NISQ processors.</p>

            <h2>Classical shadows for sample-efficient measurements of gauge-invariant observables</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jacob Bringewatt, Henry Froland, Andreas Elben, Niklas Mueller</p>
            <p>Classical shadows provide a versatile framework for estimating many properties of quantum states from repeated, randomly chosen measurements without requiring full quantum state tomography. When prior information is available, such as knowledge of symmetries of states and operators, this knowledge can be exploited to significantly improve sample efficiency. In this work, we develop three classical shadow protocols tailored to systems with local (or gauge) symmetries to enable efficient prediction of gauge-invariant observables in lattice gauge theory models which are currently at the forefront of quantum simulation efforts. For such models, our approaches can offer exponential improvements in sample complexity over symmetry-agnostic methods, albeit at the cost of increased circuit complexity. We demonstrate these trade-offs using a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory, where a dual formulation enables a rigorous analysis of resource requirements, including both circuit depth and sample complexity.</p>

            <p>We develop a framework for extracting non-polynomial analytic functions of density matrices in randomized measurement experiments by a method of analytical continuation. A central advantage of this approach, dubbed stabilized analytic continuation (SAC), is its robustness to statistical noise arising from finite repetitions of a quantum experiment, making it well-suited to realistic quantum hardware. As a demonstration, we use SAC to estimate the von Neumann entanglement entropy of a numerically simulated quenched Néel state from Rényi entropies estimated via the randomized measurement protocol. We then apply the method to experimental Rényi data from a trapped-ion quantum simulator, extracting subsystem von Neumann entropies at different evolution times. Finally, we briefly note that the SAC framework is readily generalizable to obtain other nonlinear diagnostics, such as the logarithmic negativity and Rényi relative entropies.</p>

            <h2>Correlation Self-Testing of Quantum Theory against Generalised Probabilistic Theories with Restricted Relabelling Symmetry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kuntal Sengupta, Mirjam Weilenmann, Roger Colbeck</p>
            <p>Correlation self-testing of quantum theory involves identifying a task or set of tasks whose optimal performance can be achieved only by theories that can realise the same set of correlations as quantum theory in every causal structure. Following this approach, previous work has ruled out various classes of generalised probabilistic theories whose joint state spaces have a certain regularity in the sense of a (discrete) rotation symmetry of the bipartite state spaces. Here we consider theories whose bipartite state spaces lack this regularity. We form them by taking the convex hull of all the local states and a finite number of non-local states. We show that a criterion of compositional consistency is needed in such theories: for a measurement effect to be valid, there must exist at least one measurement that it is part of. This goes beyond previous consistency criteria and corresponds to a strengthening of the no-restriction hypothesis. We show that quantum theory outperforms these theories in a task called the adaptive CHSH game, which shows that they can be ruled out experimentally. We further show a connection between compositional consistency and Tsirelson's bound.</p>

            <h2>Motional entanglement in low-energy collisions near shape resonances</h2>

            <p>Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen discussed their paradox in terms of measuring the positions or momenta of two particles. These can become entangled upon scattering, but how much entanglement can be created in this process? Here we address this question with fully coherent calculations of bipartite scattering in three-dimensional space, quantifying entanglement by the inverse of the single particle purity. We show that the standard plane-wave description of scattering fails to capture the entanglement properties, due to the essential role of quantum uncertainty in the initial state. For a more realistic description of a scattering setup and narrow initial momentum dispersion, we find the entanglement to scale linearly with the scattering cross section, including strong enhancement close to shape resonances. We discuss how the generation of motional entanglement can be detected in experiments. Our results open the way to probing and eventually using entanglement in quantum collisions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qi Ding, Shoumik Chowdhury, Agustin Di Paolo, Réouven Assouly, Alan V. Oppenheim, Jeffrey A. Grover, William D. Oliver</p>
            <p>Achieving high-fidelity single- and two-qubit gates is essential for executing arbitrary digital quantum algorithms and for building error-corrected quantum computers. We propose a theoretical framework for implementing quantum gates using frequency- and amplitude-modulated microwave control, which extends conventional amplitude modulation by introducing frequency modulation as an additional degree of control. Our approach operates on fixed-frequency qubits, converting the need for qubit frequency tunability into drive frequency modulation. Using Floquet theory, we analyze and design these drives for optimal fidelity within specified criteria. Our framework spans adiabatic to nonadiabatic gates within the Floquet framework, ensuring broad applicability across gate types and control schemes. Using typical transmon qubit parameters in numerical simulations, we demonstrate a universal gate set-including the X, Hadamard, phase, and CZ gates-with control error well below 0.1% and gate times of 25-40 ns for single-qubit operations and 125-135 ns for two-qubit operations. Furthermore, we show an always-on CZ gate tailored for driven qubits, which has gate times of 80-90 ns.</p>

            <p>Induced-coherence interferometry, first introduced in the Zou-Wang-Mandel (ZWM) setup, enables retrieval of object information from the interference pattern of light that never interacted with the object. This scheme relies on two identically correlated photon pairs and the absence of "which-way" information about the photons illuminating the object to induce coherence in their companions. In previous studies, the effect of thermal background on the ZWM interferometer was considered; here we explicitly include background noise and analyze the interference visibility in both low- and high-gain regimes, revealing how thermal photons introduce an incoherent offset that lowers the observed interference contrast. We show that the visibility can be restored either by optimal attenuation or by extending the geometry to a three-SPDC configuration. Furthermore, we demonstrate that introducing heralded detection removes the detrimental effect of thermal background noise, restoring high-contrast interference fringes.</p>

            <p>Molecular spin systems are promising candidates for quantum information processing and nanoscale sensing, yet their characterization at room temperature remains challenging due to fast spin decoherence. In this work, we use $T_1$ relaxometry of shallow nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond to probe the electron spin ensemble of a polycrystalline copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) thin film. In addition to unequivocally identifying the NV-CuPc interaction thanks to its hyperfine spectrum, we further extract key parameters of the CuPc spin ensemble, including its correlation time and local lattice orientation, that cannot be measured in bulk electron resonance experiments. The analysis of our experimental results confirms that electron-electron interactions dominate the decoherence dynamics of CuPc at room temperature. Additionally, we demonstrate that the CuPc-enhanced NV relaxometry can serve as a robust method to estimate the NV depth with $\sim1$~nm precision. Our results establish NV centers as powerful probes for molecular spin systems, providing insights into molecular qubits, spin bath engineering, and hybrid quantum materials, and offering a potential pathway toward their applications such as molecular-scale quantum processors and spin-based quantum networks.</p>

            <p>We investigate the quantum properties of superpositions of oppositely squeezed states, which can be regarded as Schrodinger cat states. Compared with conventional coherent-state cat states, these states exhibit distinct photon-number structures and enhanced nonclassical features. We analyze their Wigner function and quantify the entanglement generated when they are injected into a 50:50 beam splitter. For small squeezing parameters, the resulting two-mode states possess higher entanglement than pure two-mode squeezed vacuum states. We also propose a linear-optical heralding scheme that approximates this superposition of oppositely squeezed states without requiring strong Kerr nonlinearities. Our results indicate that such states are promising resources for continuous-variable quantum information processing, particularly in regimes where high non-Gaussianity and strong entanglement are desirable.</p>

            <p>In this manuscript, we analyze the mechanism of the superradiant phase transition in the anisotropic Rabi model under the classical oscillator limit using the pattern picture. By expanding the anisotropic Rabi model Hamiltonian in operator space, we obtained three patterns, and we find that the phase transition arises from the competition between patterns. The difficulty in achieving the classical oscillator limit motivates our investigation into the quantum phase transition within a parametrically-driven Jaynes-Cummings model. This parametrically-driven Jaynes-Cummings model can reproduce the dynamics of a ultrastrong-coupling anisotropic Rabi model in a squeezed-light frame. According to the eigenenergies and eigenstates of the normal and superradiant phases of this equivalent anisotropic Rabi model, we find that the excitation energy of the normal phase and the superradiant phase vanishes at the critical point. The photon number becomes infinite beyond the critical point. These results indicate that the system undergoes a superradiant phase transition at the critical point.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Harsh Sharma, Sampriti Saha, A. S. Majumdar, Manik Banik, Himadri Shekhar Dhar</p>
            <p>Quantifying multipartite entanglement in quantum many-body systems and hybrid quantum computing architectures is a fundamental yet challenging task. In recent years, thermodynamic quantities such as the maximum extractable work from an isolated system (the ergotropy) have allowed for entanglement measures that are operationally more accessible. However, these measures can be restrictive when applied to systems governed by Hamiltonians with strong collective or interparticle interactions. Motivated by advances in quantum simulators, we propose a framework that circumvents these restrictions by evaluating global and local ergotropy either through controlled quenching of interactions or by measuring suitable local observables only. We show that this formalism allows us to correctly estimate genuine multipartite entanglement in both stationary and time-evolved states of systems with strong interactions, including parametrized quantum states simulated on a quantum circuit with varying circuit depth and noise. We demonstrate its applicability to realistic physical models, namely, the Tavis-Cummings model, the three-level Dicke model, and the transverse-field Ising model, highlighting its potential as a versatile tool for characterizing entanglement in near-term quantum simulators.</p>

            <p>Achieving strong coupling between excitons of colloidal semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) and localized surface plasmon polaritons (LSPs) is critical for advanced room-temperature quantum emitter and sensing applications. A key challenge is to have precise control of the emitters position with respect to an individual plasmonic nanostructure. Here, we present room temperature strong coupling between QDs and a single gold nano-bipyramid (BPs). The selection of the bipyramid plasmonic nanocavity offers access to a single hotspot with a very small mode volume. The localization of QDs at a single hotspot is achieved via plasmon-triggered two-photon polymerization. This technique exploits the enhanced electric field at the BP tip to selectively polymerize a photosensitive QD-containing formulation. Room-temperature scattering spectra of a 3-QD-BP system reveal Rabi splitting of 349.3 meV and a coupling strength of 175.68 meV. The with distinct anti-crossing behavior is confirmed by simulations. This approach simplifies QD integration for strong coupling systems compared to previous methods. These results indicate a scalable platform for solid-state quantum technologies with colloidal QDs, enabling explora-tion of exciton-plasmon interactions and further advance-ment of applications in quantum optics and quantum sensing under ambient conditions.</p>

            <p>Chiral discrimination of enantiomeric biomolecules is vital in chemistry, biology, and medicine. Conventional methods, relying on circularly polarized light, face weak chiroptical signals and potential photodamage. Despite extensive efforts to improve sensitivity under low-photon exposure, classical chiral probes remain fundamentally bounded by the shot-noise limit due to quantum fluctuations. To beat these limitations, we demonstrate quantum-elevated chiral discrimination using continuous-variable polarization-entangled states as moderate-photon-flux, high-sensitivity, quantum-noise-squeezed chiral probes. We achieve a 5 dB improvement beyond the SNL in distinguishing L- and D-amino acids in liquid phase. This non-destructive, biocompatible protocol enables high-sensitivity chiral analysis, with broad implications for drug development, biochemical research, environmental monitoring, and asymmetric synthesis.</p>

Such continuous monitoring may trap the measured quantum system in a decoherence-free subspace, a fraction of the available state space that is isolated from the surroundings, and thus plays an important role in quantum information science. We analytically determine the first-passage time distribution, whose form neither depends on the system Hamiltonian nor on the measurement operator, and is therefore universal. These results provide a general framework to investigate the first-passage statistics of diffusive quantum trajectories.</p>

            <p>Error mitigation is essential for the practical implementation of quantum algorithms on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. This work explores and extends Clifford Data Regression (CDR) to mitigate noise in quantum chemistry simulations using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). Using the H$_4$ molecule with the tiled Unitary Product State (tUPS) ansatz, we perform noisy simulations with the ibm torino noise model to investigate in detail the effect of various hyperparameters in CDR on the error mitigation quality. Building on these insights, two improvements to the CDR framework are proposed. The first, Energy Sampling (ES), improves performance by selecting only the lowest-energy training circuits for regression, thereby further biasing the sample energies toward the target state. The second, Non-Clifford Extrapolation (NCE), enhances the regression model by including the number of non-Clifford parameters as an additional input, enabling the model to learn how the noisy-ideal mapping evolves as the circuit approaches the optimal one. Our numerical results demonstrate that both strategies outperform the original CDR.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hyunwoo Choi, Jisang Seo, Weng C. Chew, Dong-Yeop Na</p>
            <p>In this work, we present a numerical framework for modeling single photon emission from a two level system in open and dissipative systems beyond the Markovian approximation. The method can be readily integrated into standard computational electromagnetic (CEM) solvers such as finite difference time domain (FDTD) and finite element method (FEM). We numerically verify the completeness of boundary and medium assisted modes in the modified Langevin noise formalism by reconstructing the imaginary part of the dyadic Greens function through modal expansion in three dimensions. This reconstruction enables a first principles description of atom field interaction via the multi mode Jaynes Cummings model in open and dissipative environments. Within the single excitation manifold, we show that the memory kernel of a two level system is determined by the imaginary part of the Greens function, implying that radiative modes alone govern the relevant dynamics. The proposed framework thus provides a Greens function based approach for describing atomic population and single photon dynamics, directly compatible with Maxwell solvers. We then present concrete strategies for implementing our method in both FDTD and FEM frameworks, demonstrating its practical applicability. We further verify numerical results for a lossy Lorentz Drude type mirror, including both the case of a TLS near a finite sized metallic mirror and that of a TLS centered in a Fabry Perot cavity. This work establishes a rigorous foundation for incorporating quantum emitter dynamics into computational electromagnetics, thereby extending classical solvers toward quantum light matter interactions.</p>

Similarly to him, we investigate photon emission by ensembles of indistinguishable atoms. In contrast to him, however, we leverage symmetry-based selection rules to suppress emission of single photons by single atoms. A steady state is therefore only reached following a spontaneous transition into a collective symmetry-broken state of atoms and photonic modes. The novel non-Markovian, non-perturbative method applied allows us to observe a large quantum state of light form and exhibit drastically non-classical statistics once the system undergoes a symmetry-breaking transition.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiangjun Tan, Zhanning Wang</p>
            <p>We propose a phase-coherent, narrowband magnetometer for searching couplings between axions or axion-like particles (ALPs) and electron spins, using gate-defined silicon quantum-dot spin qubits. With repeated Ramsey echo sequences and dispersive readout, the qubit precession response can be tracked with sub-Hz spectral resolution. The accessible axion mass window is determined using a series of filtering protocols that take into account sensing noise, including readout errors and $1/f$ noise. We demonstrate clear evidence of sidereal modulation of the signal due to Earth's rotation, while Earth's orbital motion produces an annual amplitude envelope that generates sidebands at fixed frequency spacing $\pm \Omega_\oplus$ around the sidereal component. For axion masses between $1$-$10~\mu{\rm eV}$, the proposed method covers axion-electron coupling strengths $g_{ae}$ ranging from $10^{-14}$ to $10^{-10}$. Including both daily and annual modulation patterns in the likelihood analysis enhances the rejection of stationary or instrumental noise. Our results indicate that spin-qubit magnetometry can achieve sensitivities approaching those suggested by astrophysical considerations, providing a complementary, laboratory-based probe of axion-electron interactions. Although we focus on silicon spin-qubit architectures, the approach is broadly applicable to spin-based quantum sensors.</p>

The classical resource is fragile, decaying linearly with misalignment, whereas the quantum resource is robust, decaying only quadratically.

            <p>Cryptography depends on truly unpredictable numbers, but physical sources emit biased or correlated bits. Quantum mechanics enables the amplification of imperfect randomness into nearly perfect randomness, but prior demonstrations have required physically co-located, loophole-free Bell tests, constraining the feasibility of remote operation. Here we realize certified randomness amplification across a network by dynamically probing large, entangled quantum states on Quantinuum's 98-qubit Helios trapped-ion quantum processor. Our protocol is secure even if the remote device acts maliciously or is compromised by an intercepting adversary, provided the samples are generated quickly enough to preclude classical simulation of the quantum circuits. We stream quantum gates in real time to the quantum processor, maintain quantum state coherence for $\approx 0.9$ seconds, and then reveal the measurement bases to the quantum processor only milliseconds before measurement. This limits the time for classical spoofing to 30 ms and constrains the location of hypothetical adversaries to a $4{,}500$ km radius. We achieve a fidelity of 0.586 on random circuits with 64 qubits and 276 two-qubit gates, enabling the amplification of realistic imperfect randomness with a low entropy rate into nearly perfect randomness.</p>

            <h2>Frequency shifts as a reflection of ground state squeezing and entanglement in two coupled harmonic oscillators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Safoura Mirkhalaf, Helmut Ritsch, Karol Gietka</p>
            <p>It is often argued that two coupled quantum harmonic oscillators, even when cooled to their ground state, display no inherently quantum features beyond quantized energy levels. Here, we challenge this view by showing that their classical observables can encode genuinely quantum features. In particular, we demonstrate that the characteristic frequency shifts observed in such systems act as a signature of non-classical correlations and ground-state entanglement at zero temperature, specifically two-mode squeezing between the uncoupled modes. From a complementary perspective, these two effects -- frequency shifts and squeezing -- represent the same underlying phenomenon expressed in different mode bases. What appears as a spectral renormalization in one description manifests as entanglement in another. These shifts therefore can serve as an entanglement witness accessible via standard frequency measurements. Furthermore, we show that this underlying squeezing, although not directly measurable, can be exploited to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio in precision frequency measurements of individual oscillators without requiring squeezed quantum noise. Our results uncover a new route to quantum-enhanced sensing within systems traditionally regarded as classical, offering fresh insight into how signatures of quantumness persist across the quantum-to-classical boundary.</p>

            <p>Large classical datasets are often processed in the streaming model, with data arriving one item at a time. In this model, quantum algorithms have been shown to offer an unconditional exponential advantage in space. However, experimentally implementing such streaming algorithms requires qubits that remain coherent while interacting with an external data stream. In this work, we realize such a data-streaming model using Quantinuum Helios trapped-ion quantum computer with long-lived qubits that communicate with an external server. We implement a quantum pair sketch, which is the primitive underlying many quantum streaming algorithms, and use it to solve Hidden Matching, a problem known to exhibit a theoretical exponential quantum advantage in space. Furthermore, we compile the quantum streaming algorithm to fault-tolerant quantum architectures based on surface and bivariate bicycle codes and show that the quantum space advantage persists even with the overheads of fault-tolerance.</p>

            <h2>A Transferable Machine Learning Approach to Predict Quantum Circuit Parameters for Electronic Structure Problems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Davide Bincoletto, Korbinian Stein, Jonas Motyl, Jakob S. Kottmann</p>
            <p>The individual optimization of quantum circuit parameters is currently one of the main practical bottlenecks in variational quantum eigensolvers for electronic systems. To this end, several machine learning approaches have been proposed to mitigate the problem. However, such method predominantly aims at training and predicting parameters tailored to individual molecules: either a specific structure, or several structures of the same molecule with varying bond lengths. This work explores machine learning based modeling strategies to include transferability between different molecules. We use a well investigated quantum circuit design and apply it to model properties of hydrogenic systems where we show parameter prediction that is systematically transferable to instances significantly larger than the training instances.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Miguel Tierz</p>
            <p>We derive universal, experiment ready analytic laws for the breathing (monopole) mode of harmonically trapped Fermi gases. Within a fixed hyperangular channel $s>0$, contact-weighted products of associated Laguerre polynomials reduce to an elementary gamma ratio, yielding: (i) a level resolved fractional breathing mode shift with scaling $\delta\omega/(2\omega)\propto Q^{-1}$, where $Q\equiv 2q+s+1$, with $q$ the radial quantum number; (ii) a first order quantum anomaly correction involving exactly two intermediate states, producing a $Q^{-2}$ falloff of the leaked monopole strength with an explicit prefactor; and (iii) a closed form finite temperature average exhibiting a low-$T$ plateau and a $1/T$ high-$T$ tail. We also obtain a mixed anomaly\nobreakdash-quartic correction for weak anharmonicity. All expressions become parameter free after a single per-channel calibration of the Tan contact $\lambda_s$ at $q=0$.</p>

            <h2>Enhancing Federated Learning Privacy with QUBO</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andras Ferenczi, Sutapa Samanta, Dagen Wang, Todd Hodges</p>
            <p>Federated learning (FL) is a widely used method for training machine learning (ML) models in a scalable way while preserving privacy (i.e., without centralizing raw data). Prior research shows that the risk of exposing sensitive data increases cumulatively as the number of iterations where a client's updates are included in the aggregated model increase. Attackers can launch membership inference attacks (MIA; deciding whether a sample or client participated), property inference attacks (PIA; inferring attributes of a client's data), and model inversion attacks (MI; reconstructing inputs), thereby inferring client-specific attributes and, in some cases, reconstructing inputs. In this paper, we mitigate risk by substantially reducing per client exposure using a quantum computing-inspired quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formulation that selects a small subset of client updates most relevant for each training round. In this work, we focus on two threat vectors: (i) information leakage by clients during training and (ii) adversaries who can query or obtain the global model. We assume a trusted central server and do not model server compromise. This method also assumes that the server has access to a validation/test set with global data distribution. Experiments on the MNIST dataset with 300 clients in 20 rounds showed a 95.2% per-round and 49% cumulative privacy exposure reduction, with 147 clients' updates never being used during training while maintaining in general the full-aggregation accuracy or even better. The method proved to be efficient at lower scale and more complex model as well. A CINIC-10 dataset-based experiment with 30 clients resulted in 82% per-round privacy improvement and 33% cumulative privacy.</p>

            <p>The quantum error correction threshold is closely related to the Nishimori physics of random statistical models. We extend quantum information measures such as coherent information beyond the Nishimori line and establish them as sharp indicators of phase transitions. We derive exact inequalities for several generalized measures, demonstrating that each attains its extremum along the Nishimori line. Using a fermionic transfer matrix method, we compute these quantities in the 2d $\pm J$ random-bond Ising model-corresponding to a surface code under bit-flip noise-on system sizes up to $512$ and over $10^7$ disorder realizations. All critical points extracted from statistical and information-theoretic indicators coincide with high precision at $p_c=0.1092212(4)$, with the coherent information exhibiting the smallest finite-size effects. We further analyze the domain-wall free energy distribution and confirm its scale invariance at the multicritical point.</p>

We show, in analogy to global existence results for first order ODEs, that global existence and uniqueness still hold true if the local terms grow at most linearly in space. Moreover, we obtain Lieb-Robinson bounds with exponential light cones for the generated dynamics. For the proof, we mainly assume Lieb-Robinson bounds with linear light cones for dynamics generated by uniformly bounded local terms. These are known to hold for example if the local terms are exponentially localized.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ephraim Gau, Zhongyuan Liu, Henric Krawczynski, Chong Zu</p>
            <p>We introduce a focal-plane detector for advancing the energy and angular resolutions of current X-ray telescopes. The architecture integrates a metallic magnetic microcalorimeter (MMC) array of paramagnetic absorber pads with a thin layer of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond for simultaneous optical readout. An impinging X-ray photon induces a temperature transient in an absorber pad, kept at ~35 mK. This time- and temperature-dependent magnetic field transient is then optically imaged by diamond NV centers, kept at 4 K and positioned directly below the pad. For a 10 $\mu$m absorber length used with a 12 m focal length telescope, our design yields an optimal angular resolution of ~0.17 arcseconds and energy resolution of ~0.70 eV. Our NV-MMC design improves upon current transition-edge sensors (TES) or MMCs read-out by superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUID) by enabling simultaneous optical readout of the entire MMC array. Because no additional cryogenic multiplexing electronics are required, our approach scales naturally to larger and finer arrays, supporting finer angular resolutions and wider fields of view.</p>

            <p>Molecular spin qubits are promising candidates for quantum technologies, but their performance is limited by decoherence arising from diverse mechanisms. The complexity of the environment makes it challenging to identify the main source of noise and target it for mitigation. Here we present a systematic experimental and theoretical framework for analyzing the mechanisms of transverse relaxation in copper(II) phthalocyanine (CuPc) diluted into diamagnetic phthalocyanine hosts. Using pulsed EPR spectroscopy together with first-principles cluster correlation expansion simulations, we quantitatively separate the contributions from hyperfine-coupled nuclear spins, spin--lattice relaxation, and electron--electron dipolar interactions. Our detailed modeling shows that both strongly and weakly coupled nuclei contribute negligibly to $T_2$, while longitudinal dipolar interactions with electronic spins, through instantaneous and spectral diffusion, constitute the main decoherence channel even at moderate spin densities. This conclusion is validated by direct comparison between simulated spin-echo dynamics and experimental data. By providing a robust modeling and experimental approach, our work identifies favorable values of the electron spin density for quantum applications, and provides a transferable methodology for predicting ensemble coherence times. These insights will guide the design and optimization of molecular spin qubits for scalable quantum devices.</p>

            <p>We investigate the mean-field scattering dynamics of a quasi-one-dimensional Bose--Einstein condensate interacting with a Rosen--Morse potential. For specific potential and nonlinearity parameters, we derive analytically exact, degenerate scattering states (doubly or triply degenerate) exhibiting perfect transmission. Using the Bogoliubov--de Gennes approach, we analyze the stability of these reflectionless degenerate states, demonstrating that only one solution within each degenerate manifold is dynamically stable. Furthermore, we study a configuration with spatially localized nonlinearity, identifying an exact reflectionless state under specific conditions. Numerical analysis shows that this state marks the system's transition from monostability to bistability as the incident wave amplitude increases. Our work establishes an analytic framework for these multistable transmission phenomena, directly relevant to coherent matter-wave transport in ultracold atomic systems and optical propagation in engineered photonic lattices.</p>

            <p>We propose a quantum error correction-like noise mitigation protocol for enhancing the sensitivity of wave-like dark matter searches with quantum sensors. Our protocol uses multiple sensors to mitigate the noise affecting each sensor individually, allowing for the suppression of excitation noise that is parallel to the dark matter signal. We demonstrate that our protocol can improve the sensitivity to dark matter signals by a factor of $\sqrt{N}$, where $N$ is the number of sensors used. Furthermore, we find that our protocol achieves the same performance as the standard quantum limit by the ideal measurement, which is impossible to achieve due to the unknown phase of the dark matter field. Our work can be widely applied to various types of signals with unknown phases, and has the potential to enhance the sensitivity of quantum sensors such as arrays of resonant cavities.</p>

            <p>Precise control over rotational angular momentum is at the heart of recent advances in quantum chemistry, quantum simulation, and quantum computation with ultracold bialkali molecules. Each rotational state comprises a rich manifold of hyperfine states arising from combinations of rotation and nuclear spins; this often yields hundreds of transitions available between a given pair of rotational states, and the efficient navigation of this complex space is a current challenge for experiments. Here, we describe a general approach based on a simple heuristic and graph theory to quickly identify optimal sets of states in ultracold bialkali molecules. We explain how to find pathways through the many available transitions to prepare the molecule in a specific state with maximum speed for any desired fidelity. We then examine networks of states where multiple couplings are present at the same time. As example applications, we first identify a closed loop of four states in the RbCs molecule where there is minimal population leakage out of the loop during simultaneous microwave coupling; we then extend the optimisation procedure to account for decoherence induced by magnetic-field noise and obtain an optimal set of 3 states for quantum computation applications.</p>

            <p>We derive a repulsive, charge-dipole-like interaction for a Dirac particle in a rotating frame, arising from a geometric $U(1)$ gauge symmetry associated with the Berry phase. The Lagrangian of this system includes a non-inertial correction due to centrifugal field coupling. By imposing gauge symmetry and treating it as a full gauge theory, the Lagrangian is extended to include Berry connection and curvature terms. Upon integrating out the geometric gauge field, the effective action is obtained. This leads to the emergence of a repulsive, long-range effective interaction in the Lagrangian. Explicitly, in the non-inertial frame of the observer, the geometric gauge invariance effectively leads to a repulsive Coulomb-interaction in momentum space. In real space, the inertial repulsion manifests in a $1/\vert r\vert^{2}$ potential, which is symmetric about the origin of rotation and mirrors charge-dipole interaction.</p>

A continuous similarity transformation is applied in momentum space to derive an effective Hamiltonian that conserves the number of magnon excitations.

In particular, we focus on the altermagnetic spin splitting of the magnon bands and the size of the roton minimum. We further map out divergencies of the continuous similarity transformation for different types of generators, which signal either the breakdown of the Néel-ordered phase or the presence of significant magnon decay.</p>

Second, we propose a symmetry-adapted, even-tempered formalism specifically designed for molecular systems. It requires only primitive S-subshell Gaussian-type orbitals and uses two parameters to characterize all exponent coefficients. In the case of the diatomic hydrogen molecule, the basis set generated by this formalism produces a dissociation curve more consistent with cc-pV5Z than cc-pVTZ at the size of aug-cc-pVDZ. Finally, we test our even-tempered formalism against several types of tetra-atomic hydrogen molecules for ground-state computation and point out its current limitations and potential improvements.</p>

            <p>The use of macroscopic coherent quantum states at room temperature is crucial in modern quantum technologies. In light of recent experiments demonstrating high-temperature superfluorescence in hybrid perovskite thin films, in this work we investigate the stability of the superradiant state concerning exciton-phonon interactions. We focused on a quasi-2D Wannier exciton interacting with longitudinal optical (LO) phonons in polar crystals, as well as with acoustic phonons. Our study leads to the derivation of nonlinear equations in the coordinate space that govern the exciton wavefunction's coefficient in the single-exciton basis for the lowest exciton state, which translates to the complex-valued polarization. The resulting equations take the form of a 2D nonlocal nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation. We perform a linear stability analysis of the plane wave solutions for the equations in question, which allows us to establish stability criteria. This analysis is particularly important for evaluating the stability of the superradiant state in the considered quasi-2D structures, as the superradiant state represents a specific case of the plane wave solution. Our findings indicate that, when the exciton interacts with LO phonons, a plane wave solution is modulationally stable, provided that the square of its amplitude does not exceed a critical intensity value defined by the exciton-LO phonon interaction parameters. Furthermore, interactions between the exciton and acoustic phonons reduce the intensity of modulationally stable waves compared to the case without such interactions. Our analytical results are corroborated by numerical calculations. We also numerically solve the 2D nonlocal NLS equation in the polar coordinates and obtain its fundamental soliton solution, which is stable.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate a method for super-resolving signals encoded as finite mixtures of bosonic modes using collective measurements that exploit permutation symmetry. Specifically, we use multiple copies of the state $\rho$ of the finite mixture to extract an estimate for the purity of $\rho$ via a spectrum measurement, the weak Schur-sampling measurement. Depending on the outcome we then further fine-grain the measurement to optimally extract an estimate of the relative intensity between the two incoherent mixtures. Our protocol furnishes simultaneous estimates for both the relative intensity and the separation of incoherent signals saturating the multi-parameter Cramér-Rao bound, and is robust against misalignment errors. We also provide viable experimental avenues for implementing such collective measurements in different set-ups.</p>

            <p>High-dimensional entanglement provides unique ways of transcending the limitations of current approaches in quantum information processing, quantum communications based on qubits. The generation of time-frequency qudit states offer significantly increased quantum capacities while keeping the number of photons constant, but pose significant challenges regarding the possible measurements for certification of entanglement. Here, we develop a new scheme and experimentally demonstrate the certification of 24-dimensional entanglement and a 9-dimensional quantum steering. We then subject our photon-pairs to dispersion conditions equivalent to the transmission through 600-km of fiber and still certify 21-dimensional entanglement. Furthermore, we use a steering inequality to prove 7-dimensional entanglement in a semi-device independent manner, proving that large chromatic dispersion is not an obstacle in distributing and certifying high-dimensional entanglement and quantum steering. Our approach, leveraging intrinsic large-alphabet nature of telecom-band photons, enables scalable, commercially viable, and field-deployable entangled and steerable quantum sources, providing a pathway towards fully scalable quantum information processer and high-dimensional quantum communication networks.</p>

            <p>Phase estimation is a major mission in quantum metrology, especially in quantum interferometry. A full phase estimation scheme usually includes the optimal probe state and measurement. For the finite-dimensional states in Fock basis, the N00N state ceases to be optimal when the average particle number is fixed yet not equal to the Fock dimension (Fock number of the highest occupied Fock state of one mode), and what is the true optimal finite-dimensional probe state in this case is still undiscovered. Hereby we present several theorems to answer this question and provide a complete optimal scheme to realize the ultimate precision limit in practice. These optimal finite-dimensional probe states reveal an important fact that the Fock dimension could be treated as a metrological resource, and the given scheme is particularly useful in scenarios where weak light or limited particle number is demanded.</p>

            <h2>Multi-qubit DC gates over an inhomogeneous array of quantum dots</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiaan Qi, Zhi-Hai Liu, Hongqi Xu</p>
            <p>The prospect of large-scale quantum computation with an integrated chip of spin qubits is imminent as technology improves. This invites us to think beyond the traditional 2-qubit-gate framework and consider a naturally supported ``instruction set'' of multi-qubit gates. In this work, we systematically study such a family of multi-qubit gates implementable over an array of quantum dots by DC evolution. A useful representation of the computational Hamiltonian is proposed for a dot-array with strong spin-orbit coupling effects, distinctive $g$-factor tensors and varying interdot couplings. Adopting a perturbative treatment, we model a multi-qubit DC gate by the first-order dynamics in the qubit frame and develop a detailed formalism for decomposing the resulting gate, estimating and optimizing the coherent gate errors with appropriate local phase shifts for arbitrary array connectivity. Examples of such multi-qubit gates and their applications in quantum error correction and quantum algorithms are also explored, demonstrating their potential advantage in accelerating complex tasks and reducing overall errors.</p>

            <p>Hybrid languages like the quantum intermediate representation (QIR) are essential for programming systems that mix quantum and conventional computing models, while execution of these programs is often deferred to a system-specific implementation. Here, we develop the QIR Execution Engine (QIR-EE) for parsing, interpreting, and executing QIR across multiple hardware platforms. QIR-EE uses LLVM to execute hybrid instructions specifying quantum programs and, by design, presents extension points that support customized runtime and hardware environments. We demonstrate an implementation that uses the XACC quantum hardware-accelerator library to dispatch prototypical quantum programs on different commercial quantum platforms and numerical simulators, and we validate execution of QIR-EE on IonQ, Quantinuum, and IBM hardware. Our results highlight the efficiency of hybrid executable architectures for handling mixed instructions, managing mixed data, and integrating with quantum computing frameworks to realize cross-platform execution.</p>

            <h2>Contraction of Private Quantum Channels and Private Quantum Hypothesis Testing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Theshani Nuradha, Mark M. Wilde</p>
            <p>A quantum generalized divergence by definition satisfies the data-processing inequality; as such, the relative decrease in such a divergence under the action of a quantum channel is at most one. This relative decrease is formally known as the contraction coefficient of the channel and the divergence. Interestingly, there exist combinations of channels and divergences for which the contraction coefficient is strictly less than one. Furthermore, understanding the contraction coefficient is fundamental for the study of statistical tasks under privacy constraints. To this end, here we establish upper bounds on contraction coefficients for the hockey-stick divergence under privacy constraints, where privacy is quantified with respect to the quantum local differential privacy (QLDP) framework, and we fully characterize the contraction coefficient for the trace distance under privacy constraints. With the machinery developed, we also determine an upper bound on the contraction of both the Bures distance and quantum relative entropy relative to the normalized trace distance, under QLDP constraints. Next, we apply our findings to establish bounds on the sample complexity of quantum hypothesis testing under privacy constraints. Furthermore, we study various scenarios in which the sample complexity bounds are tight, while providing order-optimal quantum channels that achieve those bounds. Lastly, we show how private quantum channels provide fairness and Holevo information stability in quantum learning settings.</p>

            <p>Finding molecular ground states and energies with variational quantum eigensolvers is central to chemistry applications on quantum computers. Physically motivated ansätze based on excitation operators respect physical symmetries, but existing quantum-aware optimizers, such as Rotosolve, have been limited to simpler operator types. To fill this gap, we introduce ExcitationSolve, a fast quantum-aware optimizer that is globally-informed, gradient-free, and hyperparameter-free. ExcitationSolve extends these optimizers to parameterized unitaries with generators $G$ of the form $G^3=G$ exhibited by excitation operators in approaches such as unitary coupled cluster. ExcitationSolve determines the global optimum along each variational parameter using the same quantum resources that gradient-based optimizers require for one update step. We provide optimization strategies for both fixed and adaptive variational ansätze, along with generalizations for simultaneously selecting and optimizing multiple excitations. On molecular ground state energy benchmarks, ExcitationSolve outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers by converging faster, achieving chemical accuracy for equilibrium geometries in a single parameter sweep, yielding shallower adaptive ansätze and remaining robust to real hardware noise. By uniting physical insight with efficient optimization, ExcitationSolve paves the way for scalable quantum chemistry calculations.</p>

            <p>Whilst the complexity of acquiring knowledge of a quantum state has been extensively studied in the fields of quantum tomography and quantum learning, a physical understanding of its operational role and cost in quantum thermodynamics is lacking. Knowledge is central to thermodynamics, as exemplified by Maxwell's demon thought experiment, where a demonic agent is able to extract paradoxical amounts of work -- reconciled by the thermodynamic costs of acquiring this knowledge. In this work, we address this gap by extending unitary models of measurement to incorporate the resources available to an agent. We view an agent's knowledge of a quantum state as their ability to reconstruct it unitarily given access to states with partial knowledge of the true state. In our model, an agent correlates an unknown $d$-dimensional system, with copies of a $k$-dimensional probe ($k\leq d$), which are then used to unitarily reconstruct an estimate state in $d$-dimensional memories. We find that this framework is a unitary representation of coarse-grained POVMs. As an application, we investigate the role of knowledge in an extended Szilard Engine scenario.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michal Sedlák, Robert Stárek, Nikola Horová, Michal Mičuda, Jaromir Fiurášek, Alessandro Bisio</p>
            <p>We address the fundamental task of converting $n$ uses of an unknown unitary transformation into a quantum state (i.e., storage) and later retrieval of the transformation. Specifically, we consider the case where the unknown unitary is selected with equal prior probability from two options. First, we prove that the optimal storage strategy involves the sequential application of the $n$ uses of the unknown unitary, and it produces the optimal state for discrimination between the two possible unitaries. Next, we show that incoherent "measure-and-prepare" retrieval achieves the maximum fidelity between the retrieved operation and the original (qubit) unitary. We then identify the retrieval strategy that maximizes the probability of successfully and perfectly retrieving the unknown transformation. In the regime in which the fidelity between the two possible unitaries is large the probability of success scales as $ P_{succ} = 1 - \mathcal{O}(n^{-2} ) $, which is a quadratic improvement with respect to the case in which the unitaries are drawn from the entire unitary group $U(d)$ with uniform prior probability. Finally, we present an optical experiment for this approach and assess the storage and retrieval quality using quantum tomography of states and processes. The results are discussed in relation to non-optimal measure-and-prepare strategy, highlighting the advantages of our protocol.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jungeng Zhou, Jiahao Huang, Jinye Wei, Chengyin Han, Chaohong Lee</p>
            <p>Entanglement-enhanced quantum sensors encounter a fundamental trade-off: while entanglement improves precision to the Heisenberg limit, it restricts dynamic range. To address this trade-off, we present a credible-interval-based adaptive Bayesian quantum frequency estimation protocol for Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)-state-based atomic clocks. Our method optimally integrates prior knowledge with new measurements and determines the interrogation time by correlating it with the period of the likelihood function, based on Bayesian credible intervals. Our protocol can be implemented using either individual or cascaded GHZ states, thereby extending the dynamic range without compromising Heisenberg-limited sensitivity. In parallel with the cascaded-GHZ-state protocol using fixed interrogation times, the dynamic range can be extended through an interferometry sequence that employs individual GHZ states with variable interrogation times. Furthermore, by varying the interrogation times, the dynamic range of the cascaded-GHZ-state protocol can be further extended. Crucially, our protocol enables dual Heisenberg-limited precision scaling $\propto 1/(Nt)$ in both particle number $N$ and total interrogation time $t$, surpassing the hybrid scaling $\propto 1/{(N\sqrt {t}})$ of the conventional cascaded-GHZ-state protocol. While offering a wider dynamic range, the protocol is more stable against noise and more robust to dephasing than existing adaptive schemes. Beyond atomic clocks, our approach establishes a general framework for developing entanglement-enhanced quantum sensors that simultaneously achieve both high precision and broad dynamic range.</p>

            <p>The quantum chromodynamics (QCD) phase diagram, which reveals the state of strongly interacting matter at different temperatures and densities, is key to answering open questions in physics, ranging from the behavior of particles in neutron stars to the conditions of the early universe. However, classical simulations of QCD face significant computational barriers, such as the sign problem at finite matter densities. Quantum computing offers a promising solution to overcome these challenges. Here, we take an important step toward exploring the QCD phase diagram with quantum devices by preparing thermal states in one-dimensional non-Abelian gauge theories. We experimentally simulate the thermal states of SU(2) and SU(3) gauge theories at finite densities on a trapped-ion quantum computer using a variational method. This is achieved by introducing two features: Firstly, we add motional ancillae to the existing qubit register to efficiently prepare thermal probability distributions. Secondly, we introduce charge-singlet measurements to enforce color-neutrality constraints. This work marks the first lattice gauge theory quantum simulation of QCD at finite density and temperature for two and three colors, laying the foundation to explore QCD phenomena on quantum platforms.</p>

            <p>Quantum state tomography, the task of learning an unknown quantum state, is a fundamental problem in quantum information. In standard settings, the complexity of this problem depends significantly on the type of quantum state that one is trying to learn, with pure states being substantially easier to learn than general mixed states. A natural question is whether this separation holds for any quantum state learning setting. In this work, we consider the online learning framework and prove the surprising result that learning pure states in this setting is as hard as learning mixed states. More specifically, we show that both classes share almost the same sequential fat-shattering dimension, leading to identical regret scaling. We also generalize previous results on full quantum state tomography in the online setting to (i) the $\epsilon$-realizable setting and (ii) learning the density matrix only partially, using smoothed analysis.</p>

            <p>In 2024, Kliuchnikov and Schönnenbeck showed a connection between the Barnes Wall lattices, stabilizer states and Clifford operations. In this work, we study their results and relate them to the problem of lower bounding stabilizer ranks. We show the first quantitative lower bound on stabilizer fidelity as a function of stabilizer ranks, which reproduces the linear-by-log lower bound for $\chi_{\delta}({|{H}\rangle^{ \otimes n}})$, i.e, on the approximate stabilizer rank of $|H\rangle^{\otimes n}$. In fact, we show that the lower bound holds even when the fidelity between the approximation and ${|H\rangle}^{\otimes n}$ is exponentially small, which is currently the best lower bound in this regime. Next, we define a new magic monotone for pure states, the Barnes Wall norm, and its corresponding approximate variant. We upper bound these monotones by the $CS$-count of state preparation, and also by the stabilizer ranks. In particular, the upper bound given by the $CS$-count is tight, in the sense that we exhibit states that achieve the bound. Apart from these results, we give a Fidelity Amplification algorithm, which provides a trade-off between approximation error and the stabilizer rank. As a corollary, it gives us a way to compose approximate stabilizer decompositions into approximate decompositions of their tensor products. Finally, we provide an alternate, elementary proof of the existence and density of product states with maximal stabilizer ranks, which was first proven by Lovitz and Steffan (2022), where they used results from algebraic geometry.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andy Chia, Wai-Keong Mok, Leong-Chuan Kwek, Changsuk Noh</p>
            <p>Several important dynamical systems are in $\mathbb{R}^2$, defined by the pair of differential equations $(x',y')=(f(x,y),g(x,y))$. A question of fundamental importance is how such systems might behave quantum mechanically. In developing quantum theory, Dirac and others realized that classical Hamiltonian systems can be mapped to their quantum counterparts via canonical quantization. The resulting quantum dynamics is always physical, characterized by completely-positive and trace-preserving evolutions in the Schrödinger picture. However, whether non-Hamiltonian systems can be quantized systematically while respecting the same physical requirements has remained a long-standing problem. Here we resolve this question when $f(x,y)$ and $g(x,y)$ are arbitrary polynomials. By leveraging open-systems theory, we prove constructively that every polynomial system admits a physical generator of time evolution in the form of a Lindbladian. We call our method cascade quantization, and demonstrate its power by analyzing several paradigmatic examples of nonlinear dynamics such as bifurcations, noise-activated spiking, and Liénard systems. In effect, our method can quantize any classical system whose $f(x,y)$ and $g(x,y)$ are analytic with arbitrary precision. More importantly, cascade quantization is exact. This means restrictive system properties usually assumed in the literature to facilitate quantization, such as weak nonlinearity, rotational symmetry, or semiclassical dynamics, can all be dispensed with by cascade quantization. We also highlight the advantages of cascade quantization over existing proposals, by weighing it against examples from the variational paradigm using Lagrangians, as well as non-variational approaches.</p>

Here we present and experimentally demonstrate an efficient encoding scheme based on chains of Rydberg-blockaded atoms, which we call quantum wires, to natively embed maximum weighted independent set (MWIS) and quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems on a neutral atom architecture. For graphs with quasi-unit-disk connectivity, in which only a few long-range edges are required, our approach requires a significantly lower overhead in the number of ancilla qubits than previous proposals, facilitating the implementation on currently available hardware. To demonstrate the approach, we perform weighted-graph annealing on a programmable atom array using local light shifts to encode problem-specific weights across graphs of varying sizes. This approach successfully identifies the solutions to the original MWIS and QUBO graph instances. Our work expands the operational toolkit of near-term neutral atom arrays, enhancing their potential for scalable quantum optimization.</p>

            <p>We show that generic gapped quantum many-body states which respect an anomalous finite higher-form symmetry have an exponentially small overlap with any short-range entangled (SRE) state. Hence, anomalies of higher-form symmetries enforce $intrinsic$ long-range entanglement, which is in contrast with anomalies of ordinary (0-form) symmetries which are compatible with symmetric SRE states (specifically, symmetric cat states). As an application, we show that the anomalies of strong higher-form symmetries provide a diagnostic for mixed-state topological order in $d \geq 2$ spatial dimensions. We also identify a new (3+1)D intrinsic mixed-state topological order that does not obey remote-detectability by local decoherence of the (3+1)D Toric Code with fermionic loop excitations. This breakdown of remote detectability, as encoded in anomalies of strong higher-form symmetries, provides a partial characterization of intrinsically mixed-state topological order.</p>

            <p>Correlations between energy levels can help distinguish whether a many-body system is of integrable or chaotic nature. The study of short-range and long-range spectral correlations generally involves quantities which are very different, unless one uses the $k$-th nearest neighbor ($k$NN) level spacing distributions. For nearest-neighbor (NN) spectral spacings, the distribution in random matrices is well captured by the Wigner surmise. This well-known approximation, derived exactly for a 2$\times$2 matrix, is simple and satisfactorily describes the NN spacings of larger matrices. There have been attempts in the literature to generalize Wigner's surmise to further away neighbors. However, as we show, the current proposal in the literature fails to accurately capture numerical data. Using the known variance of the distributions from random matrix theory, we propose a corrected surmise for the $k$NN spectral distributions. This surmise better characterizes spectral correlations while retaining the simplicity of Wigner's surmise. We test the predictions against numerical results and show that the corrected surmise is systematically more accurate at capturing data from random matrices. Using the XXZ spin chain with random on-site disorder, we illustrate how these results can be used as a refined probe of many-body quantum chaos for both short- and long-range spectral correlations.</p>

            <p>Collision models (CMs) describe an open system interacting in sequence with elements of an environment, termed ancillas. They have been established as a useful tool for analyzing non-Markovian open quantum dynamics based on the ability to control the environmental memory through simple feedback mechanisms. In this work, we investigate how ancilla-ancilla entanglement can serve as a mechanism for controlling the non-Markovianity of an open system, focusing on an operational approach to generating correlations within the environment. To this end, we first demonstrate that the open dynamics of CMs with sequentially generated correlations between groups of ancillas can be mapped onto a composite CM, where the memory part of the environment is incorporated into an enlarged Markovian system. We then apply this framework to an all-qubit CM, and show that non-Markovian behavior emerges only when the next incoming pair of ancillas are entangled prior to colliding with the system. On the other hand, when system-ancilla collisions precede ancilla-ancilla entanglement, we find the open dynamics to always be Markovian. Our findings highlight how certain qualitative features of inter-ancilla correlations can strongly influence the onset of system non-Markovianity.</p>

Our approach efficiently constructs block-encodings of (persistent) Laplacians, enabling estimation via stochastic rank methods with complexity polylogarithmic in the number of simplices across both sparse and dense regimes. Unlike prior spectral algorithms that suffer when Betti numbers are small, we introduce homology tracking and property testing techniques achieving exponential speedups under natural sparsity and structure assumptions. We also formulate homology triviality and equivalence testing as property testing problems, giving nearly linear-time quantum algorithms when the boundary rank is large. A cohomological formulation further yields rank-independent testing and polylog-time manipulation of $r$-cocycles via block-encoded projections. These results open a new direction in quantum topological data analysis and demonstrate provable quantum advantages in computing topological invariants.</p>

Here, we demonstrate an optical QRC platform based on deterministically generated multimode squeezed states, exploiting both spectral and temporal multiplexing in a fully continuous-variable (CV) setting, and enabling controlled fading memory. Data is encoded via programmable phase shaping of the pump in an optical parametric process and retrieved through mode-selective homodyne detection. Real-time memory is achieved through feedback using electro-optic phase modulation, while long-term dependencies are achieved via spatial multiplexing. This architecture with minimal post-processing performs nonlinear temporal tasks, including parity checking and chaotic signal forecasting, with results corroborated by a high-fidelity Digital Twin. We show that leveraging the entangled multimode structure significantly enhances the expressivity and memory capacity of the quantum reservoir.

            <p>Modular quantum architectures have emerged as a promising approach for scaling quantum computing systems by connecting multiple Quantum Processing Units (QPUs). However, this approach introduces significant challenges due to costly inter-core operations between chips and quantum state transfers, which contribute to noise and quantum decoherence. This paper presents QARMA, a novel Qubit mapping using Attention-based deep Reinforcement learning (DRL) for Modular quantum Architectures, along with its extension QARMA-R that incorporates dynamic qubit reuse capabilities. Our approach combines an attention-based mechanism with Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to learn optimal qubit allocation, routing, and reuse strategies that minimize inter-core communications. We introduce two key innovations: (1) a transformer-based encoder that captures both the global circuit structure and local qubit interactions and (2) a dynamic qubit reuse compilation mechanism that leverages mid-circuit measurement and reset operations to reduce inter-operation and qubit requirements. Our experimental results show significant improvements over state-of-the-art approaches. Compared to highly-optimized Qiskit with modular architecture configuration, QARMA-R reduces inter-core communications by up to 100% (on average 86%), while QARMA maintains 15-40% improvement for larger circuits without reuse. Against traditional modular qubit mapping, our approach achieves 97-100% reduction in inter-core operation. The proposed methods advance quantum circuit compilation techniques and enable the execution of more extensive quantum algorithms on resource-constrained modular quantum systems, contributing to the growing body of research on scalable quantum computing architectures.</p>

We provide a theoretical analysis based on statistical learning and neural tangent kernel theory, establishing explicit risk bounds and demonstrating improved expressivity and trainability compared to purely quantum or existing hybrid approaches. These theoretical insights demonstrate exponential improvements in representation capacity relative to quantum circuit depth and the number of qubits, providing clear computational advantages over standalone quantum circuits and existing hybrid quantum architectures. Empirical results on diverse datasets, including quantum-dot classification and genomic sequence analysis, show that VQC-MLPNet achieves high accuracy and robustness under realistic noise models, outperforming classical and quantum baselines while using significantly fewer trainable parameters.</p>

            <h2>Constant-Factor Improvements in Quantum Algorithms for Linear Differential Equations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthew Pocrnic, Peter D. Johnson, Amara Katabarwa, Nathan Wiebe</p>
            <p>Finding the solution to linear ordinary differential equations of the form $\partial_t u(t) = -A(t)u(t)$ has been a promising theoretical avenue for \textit{asymptotic} quantum speedups. However, despite the improvements to existing quantum differential equation solvers over the years, little is known about \textit{constant factor} costs of such quantum algorithms. This makes it challenging to assess the prospects for using these algorithms in practice. In this work, we prove constant factor bounds for a promising new quantum differential equation solver, the linear combination of Hamiltonian simulation (LCHS) algorithm. Our bounds are formulated as the number of queries to a unitary $U_A$ that block encodes the generator $A$. In doing so, we make several algorithmic improvements such as tighter truncation and discretization bounds on the LCHS kernel integral, a more efficient quantum compilation scheme for the SELECT operator in LCHS, as well as use of a constant-factor bound for oblivious amplitude amplification, which may be of general interest. To the best of our knowledge, our new formulae improve over previous state of the art by at least two orders of magnitude, where the speedup can be far greater if state preparation has a significant cost. Accordingly, for any previous resource estimates of time-independent linear differential equations for the most general case whereby the dynamics are not \textit{fast-forwardable}, these findings provide a 100-200x reduction in runtime costs. This analysis contributes towards establishing more promising applications for quantum computing.</p>

            <h2>Perfect quantum state transfer through a chaotic spin chain via many-body scars</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shane Dooley, Luke Johnston, Patrick Gormley, Beth Campbell</p>
            <p>Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) offer a mechanism for weak ergodicity breaking, enabling non-thermal dynamics to persist in a chaotic many-body system. While most studies of QMBS focus on anomalous eigenstate properties or long-lived revivals of local observables, their potential for quantum information processing remains largely unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate that \emph{perfect quantum state transfer} can be achieved in a strongly interacting, quantum chaotic spin chain by exploiting a sparse set of QMBS eigenstates embedded within an otherwise thermal spectrum. These results show that QMBS in chaotic many-body systems may be harnessed for information transport tasks typically associated with integrable models.</p>

            <h2>Neural Importance Resampling: A Practical Sampling Strategy for Neural Quantum States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eimantas Ledinauskas, Egidijus Anisimovas</p>
            <p>Neural quantum states (NQS) have emerged as powerful tools for simulating many-body quantum systems, but their practical use is often hindered by limitations of current sampling techniques. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods suffer from slow mixing and require manual tuning, while autoregressive NQS impose restrictive architectural constraints that complicate the enforcement of symmetries and the construction of determinant-based multi-state wave functions. In this work, we introduce Neural Importance Resampling (NIR), a new sampling algorithm that combines importance resampling with a separately trained autoregressive proposal network. This approach enables efficient and unbiased sampling without constraining the NQS architecture. We demonstrate that NIR supports stable and scalable training, including for multi-state NQS, and mitigates issues faced by MCMC and autoregressive approaches. Numerical experiments on the 2D transverse-field Ising and $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg models show that NIR outperforms MCMC in challenging regimes and yields results competitive with state of the art methods. Our results establish NIR as a robust alternative for sampling in variational NQS algorithms.</p>

            <p>Variational Quantum Computing (VQC) faces fundamental scalability barriers, primarily due to the presence of barren plateaus and its sensitivity to quantum noise. To address these challenges, we introduce TensorHyper-VQC, a novel tensor-train (TT)-guided hypernetwork framework that significantly improves the robustness and scalability of VQC. Our framework fully delegates the generation of quantum circuit parameters to a classical TT network, effectively decoupling optimization from quantum hardware. This innovative parameterization mitigates gradient vanishing, enhances noise resilience through structured low-rank representations, and facilitates efficient gradient propagation. Grounded in Neural Tangent Kernel and statistical learning theory, our rigorous theoretical analyses establish strong guarantees on approximation capability, optimization stability, and generalization performance. Extensive empirical results across quantum dot classification, Max-Cut optimization, and molecular quantum simulation tasks demonstrate that TensorHyper-VQC consistently achieves superior performance and robust noise tolerance, including hardware-level validation on a 156-qubit IBM Heron processor. These results position TensorHyper-VQC as a scalable and noise-resilient framework for advancing practical quantum machine learning on near-term devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ian T. Abrahams</p>
            <p>Strong excitonic coupling and photon antibunching (AB) have been observed together in Venus yellow fluorescent protein dimers and currently lack a cohesive theoretical explanation. In 2019, Kim et al. demonstrated Davydov splitting in circular dichroism spectra, revealing strong J-like coupling, while antibunched fluorescence emission was confirmed by combined antibunching--fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (AB/FCS fingerprinting). To investigate the implications of this coexistence, Venus yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) dimer population dynamics are modeled within a Lindblad master equation framework, testing its ability to cope with typical, data-informed, Venus YFP dimer time and energy values. Simulations predict multiple-femtosecond (fs) decoherence, yielding bright/dark state mixtures consistent with antibunched fluorescence emission at room temperature. Thus, excitonic coupling and photon AB in Venus YFP dimers are reconciled without invoking long-lived quantum coherence. However, clear violations of several Lindblad approximation validity conditions appear imminent, calling for careful modifications to choices of standard system and bath definitions and parameter values.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nhat A. Nghiem</p>
            <p>Topological data analysis (TDA) has become an attractive area for the application of quantum computing. Recent advances have uncovered many interesting connections between the two fields. On one hand, complexity theoretic results show that estimating Betti numbers, a central task in TDA, is NP hard, indicating that a generic quantum speedup is unlikely. On the other hand, several recent studies have explored structured, less generic settings and demonstrated that quantum algorithms can still achieve significant speedups under certain conditions. To date, most of these efforts have focused on Betti numbers, which are topological invariants capturing the intrinsic connectivity and holes in a dataset. However, there is another important feature of topological spaces: torsion. Torsion represents a distinct component of homology that can reveal richer structural information. In this work, we introduce a quantum algorithm for torsion detection, that is, determining whether a given simplicial complex contains torsion. Our algorithm, assisted by a low complexity classical procedure, can succeed with high probability and potentially offer exponential speedup over the classical counterpart.</p>

            <p>Quantum computing has made remarkable strides in recent years, as demonstrated by quantum supremacy experiments and the realization of high-fidelity, fault-tolerant gates. However, a major obstacle persists: practical real-world applications remain scarce, largely due to the inefficiency of loading classical data into quantum processors. Here, we propose an alternative strategy that shifts the focus from classical data encoding to directly processing quantum data. We target quantum metrology, a practical quantum technology whose precision is often constrained by realistic noise. We develop an experimentally feasible scheme in which a quantum computer optimizes information acquired from quantum metrology, thereby enhancing performance in noisy quantum metrology tasks and overcoming the classical-data-loading bottleneck. We demonstrate this approach through experimental implementation with nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond and numerical simulations using models of distributed superconducting quantum processors. Our results show that this method improves the accuracy of sensing estimates and significantly boosts sensitivity, as quantified by the quantum Fisher information, thus offering a new pathway to harness near-term quantum computers for realistic quantum metrology.</p>

            <h2>A Deficiency-Based Framework for the Operational Interpretation of Quantum Resources with Applications</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sunho Kim, Chunhe Xiong, Junde Wu</p>
            <p>A fundamental challenge in quantum resource theory lies in establishing operational interpretations by quantifying the distinct advantages that quantum resources provide over classical resources in specific physical tasks. However, conventional quantum resource theories have inherent limitations in characterizing operational advantages for certain quantum tasks. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework that defines the resource deficiency of a given state relative to the set of maximal resource states in physical tasks. This extension not only broadens the scope of quantum resource theories and provides more comprehensive operational interpretations, but also delivers crucial insights for classifying and interpreting mixed resource states -- specifically those with inactive resource properties in certain tasks -- that have remained uncharacterized in conventional quantum resource theories. Moreover, we further demonstrate that the proposed geometric measure satisfies the framework's requirements for both quantum coherence and entanglement, while also demonstrating its ability to characterize the operational disadvantage of arbitrary states compared to maximal resource states in subchannel discrimination tasks under specific conditions.</p>

            <p>In this work, we study a hybrid quantum system composed of a quantum battery and a coherence-driven charger interacting with a Quantum Autonomous Thermal Machine (QATM). The QATM, made of two qubits, each coupled to Markovian bosonic thermal reservoirs at different temperatures, acts as a structured environment that mediates energy and coherence transfer between the charger and the battery. By applying a coherent driving field on the charger, we investigate the coherence injection effect on the dynamics, including non-Markovianity, power of charging, coherence storage, and ergotropy. We show that the QATM effectively filters the decoherence induced by the thermal baths and induces non-Markovian memory effects due to correlation backflow. Our results demonstrate that coherence driving enhances the battery's ergotropy; coherence driving raises the maximum ergotropy by approximately 40% compared to the case without coherence driving, and the power of charging by preserving the internal energy of the charger and facilitating coherent energy transfer.</p>

The measured speed was found to disagree with the standard guiding equation of Bohmian mechanics, which we regard as a challenge to that framework. In the present work, we provide a more detailed account of this issue. In particular, we argue that agreement or disagreement between standard quantum mechanics and Bohmian mechanics on quantities such as particle velocity, speed, tunnelling, and dwell times depends solely on the choice of guiding equation. If this choice is made based on observable spatio-temporal transformation behaviour of the particle density, the two theories agree on these phenomena.</p>

            <p>We study the generative quantum eigensolver (GQE)~\cite{nakaji2024generative}, which trains a classical generative model to produce quantum circuits with desired properties such as describing molecular ground states. We introduce two methods to improve GQE. First, we identify a limitation of direct preference optimization (DPO) when used as the loss function in GQE, and propose Persistent-DPO (P-DPO) as a solution to this limitation. Second, as a method to improve the online learning during the training phase of GQE, we introduce a hybrid approach that combines online and offline learning. Using a transformer decoder implementation of GQE, we evaluate our methods through ground state search experiments on the $\mathrm{BeH_2^{}}$ molecule and observe that P-DPO achieves lower energies than DPO. The hybrid approach further improves convergence and final energy values, particularly with P-DPO. A method for imposing upper constraints on the occurrences of specific gates is also presented, which serves to enhance the applicability of GQE.</p>

            <p>We study multiparty entanglement near measurement induced phase transitions (MIPTs), which arise in ensembles of local quantum circuits built with unitaries and measurements. In contrast to equilibrium quantum critical transitions, where entanglement is short-ranged, MIPTs possess long-range k-party genuine multiparty entanglement (GME) characterized by an infinite hierarchy of entanglement exponents for k>=2. First, we represent the average spread of entanglement with "entanglement clusters," and use them to conjecture general exponent relations: 1) classical dominance, 2) monotonicity, 3) subadditivity. We then introduce measure-weighted graphs to construct such clusters in general circuits. Second, we obtain the exact entanglement exponents for a 1d MIPT in a measurement-only circuit that maps to percolation by exploiting non-unitary conformal field theory. The exponents, which we numerically verify, obey the inequalities. We also extend the construction to a 2d MIPT that maps to classical 3d percolation, and numerically find the first entanglement exponents. Our results provide a firm ground to understand the multiparty entanglement of MIPTs, and more general ensembles of quantum circuits.</p>

This sharply contrasts the quantum unique label cover problem, which can be decided efficiently by a result of Kempe, Regev, and Toner (FOCS'08).

Additionally, we show that the quantum oracularized smooth label cover problem is RE-hard. Our second result fits with the alternative quantum unique games conjecture recently proposed by Mousavi and Spirig (ITCS'25) on the RE-hardness of the quantum oracularized unique label cover problem. Our proof techniques include a quantum version of Feige's reduction from 3SAT to 3SAT5 (STOC'96) for BCSMIP*-protocols, which may be of independent interest.</p>

            <p>We study the use of triorthogonal codes for universal fault-tolerant quantum computation and propose two methods to circumvent the Eastin-Knill theorem, which prohibits any single quantum error-correcting code from supporting both universality and a transversal gate set. We show that our methods reduce the resource overhead compared with existing fault-tolerant protocols. We develop a simple fault-tolerant implementation of the logical Hadamard gate for triorthogonal codes by exploiting the fact that they have transversal controlled-Z (CZ) gates, resulting in a circuit with reduced overhead. We also introduce a procedure for generating a symmetric Calderbank-Shor-Steane code paired with a triorthogonal code, which allows CNOT and CZ gate transversality across the pair of codes. In addition, we present logical state teleportation circuits that transfer encoded states between the two codes, allowing all logical operations to be performed transversally. Our methods can be integrated into the Steane error correction framework without incurring additional resource cost. Finally, using the 15-qubit code as an example, we demonstrate that our protocols significantly reduce the gate overhead compared with other existing methods. These results highlight the potential of combining distinct code structures to achieve low-overhead, universal fault-tolerant quantum computation.</p>

HPQEA includes three main features: a high-performance computing core, an optimized controlled-NOT gate computation strategy, and effective utilization of high-bandwidth memory. Verification and evaluation on the Alveo U280 board show that HPQEA can emulate quantum circuits with up to 30 qubits while maintaining high fidelity and low mean square error. It outperforms comparable FPGA-based systems by producing faster execution, supporting a wider range of algorithms, and requiring low hardware resources. Furthermore, it exceeds the Nvidia A100 in normalized gate speed for systems with up to 20 qubits.

            <p>Autonomous quantum machines (AQMs) execute tasks without requiring time-dependent external control. Motivations for AQMs include the restrictions imposed by classical control on quantum machines' coherence times and geometries. Most AQM work is theoretical and abstract; yet an experiment recently demonstrated AQMs' usefulness in qubit reset, crucial to quantum computing. To further reduce quantum computing's classical control, we propose realizations of (fully and partially) quantum-autonomous gates on three platforms: Rydberg atoms, trapped ions, and superconducting qubits. First, we show that a Rydberg-blockade interaction or an ultrafast transition can quantum-autonomously effect entangling gates on Rydberg atoms. One can perform $Z$ or entangling gates on trapped ions mostly quantum-autonomously, by sculpting a linear Paul trap or leveraging a ring trap. Passive lasers control these gates, as well as the Rydberg-atom gates, quantum-autonomously. Finally, circuit quantum electrodynamics can enable quantum-autonomous $Z$ and $XY$ gates on superconducting qubits. The gates can serve as building blocks for (fully or partially) quantum-autonomous circuits, which may reduce classical-control burdens.</p>

Remarkably, it has been found that GME can be activated from multiple copies of biseparable quantum states, which do not possess GME individually. Here, we experimentally demonstrate unambiguous evidence of such GME activation from two copies of a biseparable three-qubit state in a trapped-ion quantum processor.

We evaluate the framework on a 50-asset portfolio optimization problem using historical S&P 500 data, benchmarking against classical simulated annealing. Results demonstrate competitive performance, highlighting the scalability and practical potential of our method in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era.

            <p>Quantum computation with $d$-level quantum systems, also known as qudits, benefits from the possibility to use a richer computational space compared to qubits. However, for arbitrary qudit-based hardware platform the issue is that a generic qudit operation has to be decomposed into the sequence of native operations $-$ pulses that are adjusted to the transitions between two levels in a qudit. Typically, not all levels in a qudit are simply connected to each other due to specific selection rules. Moreover, the number of pulses plays a significant role, since each pulse takes a certain execution time and may introduce error. In this paper, we propose a resource-efficient algorithm to decompose single-qudit operations into the sequence of pulses that are allowed by qudit selection rules. Using the developed algorithm, the number of pulses is at most $d(d{-}1)/2$ for an arbitrary single-qudit operation. For specific operations the algorithm could produce even fewer pulses. We provide a comparison of qudit decompositions for several types of trapped ions, specifically $^{171}\text{Yb}^+$, $^{137}\text{Ba}^+$ and $^{40}\text{Ca}^+$ with different selection rules, and also decomposition for superconducting qudits.</p>

            <p>Distributed quantum computing (DQC) provides a promising route toward scalable quantum computation, where entanglement-assisted LOCC and circuit knitting represent two complementary approaches. The former deterministically realizes nonlocal operations but demands extensive entanglement resources, whereas the latter requires no entanglement yet suffers from exponential sampling overhead. Here, we propose a hybrid framework that integrates these two paradigms by performing circuit knitting assisted with a limited amount of entanglement. We establish a general theoretical formulation that yields lower bounds on the optimal sampling overhead and present a constructive protocol demonstrating that a single shared Bell pair can reduce the overhead to the asymptotic limit of standard circuit knitting without requiring classical communication. Furthermore, we extend the entanglement-assisted circuit knitting framework to the black-box setting, which can be applicable to the circuit knitting of quantum combs. This hybrid approach can be viewed as a form of hybrid classical-quantum computation, balancing the trade-off between sampling and entanglement efficiency, and enabling more resource-practical implementations of distributed quantum computing.</p>

            <p>We reframe the EPR argument through an operational lens, replacing the notion of fixed "elements of reality" with context-indexed conditional states - what's often referred to as a measurement assemblage. This move deliberately sidesteps the assumption of context-independent values for incompatible observables. Our updated version of the Reality Criterion works like this: if Alice measures observable x and obtains outcome a, then Bob's system must adopt a conditional state that ensures the corresponding outcome for that specific context. Crucially, we also assume operational completeness - a condition that quantum mechanics satisfies when we're dealing with quantum-reachable assemblages. Now, in any theory where one party cannot signal to the other (so-called one-sided no-signaling theories), perfect predictions do support drawing context-indexed inferences. But - and this is key - they don't legitimize assigning fixed values across all contexts. We rigorously demonstrate this distinction. To ground the argument, we offer examples: the qubit singlet scenario using Pauli settings and CJWR thresholds, a continuous-variable case based on the Reid criteria, and a counterexample in the spirit of the PR box, which highlights the boundaries of what quantum theory can actually reach.</p>

            <h2>Operator growth and black hole formation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Felix M. Haehl, Ying Zhao</p>
            <p>When two particles collide in an asymptotically AdS spacetime with high enough energy and small enough impact parameter, they can form a black hole. Motivated by dual quantum circuit considerations, we propose a threshold condition for black hole formation. Intuitively the condition can be understood as the onset of overlap of the butterfly cones describing the ballistic spread of the effect of the perturbations on the boundary systems. We verify the correctness of the condition in three bulk dimensions. We describe a six-point correlation function that can diagnose this condition and compute it in two-dimensional CFTs using eikonal resummation.</p>

            <h2>Mean-field theory of 1+1D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory with matter</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matjaž Kebrič, Ulrich Schollwöck, Fabian Grusdt</p>
            <p>Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) provide valuable insights into problems in strongly correlated many-body systems. Confinement which arises when matter is coupled to gauge fields is just one of the open problems, where LGT formalism can explain the underlying mechanism. However, coupling gauge fields to dynamical charges complicates the theoretical and experimental treatment of the problem. Developing a simplified mean-field theory is thus one of the ways to gain new insights into these complicated systems. Here we develop a mean-field theory of a paradigmatic 1+1D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory with superconducting pairing term, the gauged Kitaev chain, by decoupling charge and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fields while enforcing the Gauss law on the mean-field level. We first determine the phase diagram of the original model in the context of confinement, which allows us to identify the symmetry-protected topological transition in the Kitaev chain as a confinement transition. We then compute the phase diagram of the effective mean-field theory, which correctly captures the main features of the original LGT. This is furthermore confirmed by the Green's function results and a direct comparison of the ground state energy. This simple LGT can be implemented in state-of-the art cold atom experiments. We thus also consider string-length histograms and the electric field polarization, which are easily accessible quantities in experimental setups and show that they reliably capture the various phases.</p>

            <h2>Quantised helicity in optical media</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Neel Mackinnon, Jörg B. Götte, Stephen M. Barnett, Niclas Westerberg</p>
            <p>We present a new approach to the definition of optical helicity in a medium. Our approach resolves the problem that duality transformations which simultaneously combine $\mathbf{E}$ with $\mathbf{H}$ and $\mathbf{D}$ with $\mathbf{B}$ are incompatible with linear constitutive relations. We find that the helicity density in a medium, as the conserved quantity associated with duality transforms, must contain an explicit contribution associated with the polarisation and magnetisation of the matter, and that it can be expressed naturally in terms of the elementary polarised excitations of the system. In media for which the helicity is conserved, each circular excitation carries a well-defined helicity. However, in a medium for which the helicity is not conserved, we find that the time-varying helicity can be viewed in terms of oscillations between different helicity eigenstates, analogous to neutrino oscillations. Here we explicitly study the helicity in homogeneous and lossless media but we believe that, differently to other choices, this helicity is readily generalisable to media that may be inhomogeneous, lossy, chiral or nonreciprocal.</p>

            <h2>Direct and mediated dipole-dipole interactions in a reconfigurable array of optical traps</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mian Wu, Nan Li, Han Cai, Cheng Liu, Huizhu Hu</p>
            <p>Optically levitated nanoparticles in vacuum experience both electrostatic and light-induced dipole-dipole interactions, offering a versatile platform to explore mesoscopic entanglement and many-body dynamics. A significant challenge in optical trap arrays is to achieve site-resolved, point-to-point tunability: adjusting the laser parameters of a single trap typically induces global cross-talk to neighboring sites, hindering independent control. Inspired by tunable couplers in superconducting circuits, we implement an ancillary nanoparticle that functions as a coupler between two target nanoparticles. Within a reconfigurable three-particle array, we demonstrate broad tunability of the direct dipole-dipole interaction by controlling the phase and position of the traps. In addition, we observe spectral signatures consistent with mediated interactions between the target particles via the ancillary one, manifested as mode participation beyond the uncoupled response. Our results establish a practical route to tailored, site-resolved control in multi-particle optical trap arrays, expanding the optical-binding toolbox and opening opportunities for programmable oscillator networks relevant to macroscopic quantum mechanics and precision sensing.</p>

            <h2>Beyond-mean-field phases of rotating dipolar condensates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paolo Molignini</p>
            <p>Rotating dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates exhibit rich physics due to the interplay of long-range interactions and rotation, leading to unconventional vortex structures and strongly correlated phases. While most studies rely on mean-field approaches, these fail to capture quantum correlations that become significant at high rotation speeds and strong interactions. In this study, we go beyond the mean-field description by employing a numerically exact multiconfigurational approach to study finite-sized dipolar condensates. We reveal novel vortex structures, rotating cluster states, and strong fragmentation effects, demonstrating that beyond-mean-field correlations remain prominent even in larger systems. By quantifying deviations from mean-field theory, we provide a predictive framework for analyzing experiments and exploring emergent quantum phases, with implications for both the fundamental theory of ultracold gases and the quantum simulation of correlated superfluid systems like in neutron stars.</p>

            <h2>Torsion-Driven Nonlinearity in Spinless Quantum Mechanics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomoi Koide, Armin van de Venn</p>
            <p>We investigate the previously unexplored quantum dynamics of non-relativistic, spinless particles propagating in curved spaces with torsion. Our findings demonstrate that while torsion has been predominantly associated with spin, it can also influence the quantum behavior of spinless particles by inducing a logarithmic nonlinearity in the Schroedinger equation through quantum fluctuations, even in flat space. To facilitate quantization in curved spaces, we introduce a novel stochastic variational method. Unlike canonical quantization, this approach is naturally suited to general coordinate systems, with quantum fluctuations arising from a noise term in the stochastic process that is directly influenced by torsion. By requiring consistency with quantum dynamics, we ultimately derive an upper bound on the magnitude of torsion. Our results reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism by which torsion, as predicted in certain extensions of general relativity, can influence quantum systems, with potential implications for early-universe physics and dark matter or energy models.</p>

            <p>We present GSCDB137, a rigorously curated benchmark library of 137 data sets (8377 entries) covering main-group and transition-metal reaction energies and barrier heights, (intramolecular) non-covalent interactions, dipole moments, polarizabilities, electric-field response energies, and vibrational frequencies. Legacy data from GMTKN55 and MGCDB84 have been updated to today's best reference values; redundant, spin-contaminated, or low-quality points were removed, and many new, property-focused sets were added. Testing 29 popular density functional approximations (DFAs) confirms the expected Jacob's-ladder hierarchy overall but also reveals notable exceptions: functional performance for frequencies and electric-field properties correlates poorly with that for other ground-state energetics. {\omega}B97M-V and {\omega}B97X-V are the most balanced hybrid meta-GGA and hybrid GGA, respectively; B97M-V and revPBE-D4 lead the meta-GGA and GGA classes. Double hybrids lower mean errors by about 25 % versus the best hybrids but demand careful frozen-core, basis-set, and multi-reference treatment.

            <h2>A new characterization of the holographic entropy cone</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guglielmo Grimaldi, Matthew Headrick, Veronika E. Hubeny</p>
            <p>Entanglement entropies computed using the holographic Ryu-Takayanagi formula are known to obey an infinite set of linear inequalities, which define the so-called RT entropy cone. The general structure of this cone, or equivalently the set of all valid inequalities, is unknown. It is also unknown whether those same inequalities are also obeyed by entropies computed using the covariant Hubeny-Rangamani-Takayanagi formula, although significant evidence has accumulated that they are. Using Markov states, we develop a test of this conjecture in a heretofore unexplored regime. The test reduces to checking that a given inequality obeys a certain majorization property, which is easy to evaluate. We find that the RT inequalities pass this test and, surprisingly, only RT inequalities do so. Our results not only provide strong new evidence that the HRT and RT cones coincide, but also offer a completely new characterization of that cone.</p>

            <p>This thesis explores experimental and theoretical approaches to dark matter detection, from gas-based detectors to quantum sensors, tackling the challenge of identifying dark matter, which makes up 27% of the Universe's energy. It reviews astrophysical and cosmological evidence, highlights the Standard Model's limitations, and motivates searches for WIMPs, axions, and dark photons through direct, indirect, and collider-based strategies. The experimental work includes the Micromegas-based TREX-DM experiment for low-mass WIMPs, with studies of argon and neon-based gas mixtures, detector design, shielding, readout, and background suppression. GEM integration boosted gain by up to 45. A UV LED-based internal calibration system was developed for compact, low-background operation, while pressure-dependent gain studies optimized future low-background TPCs. The thesis also advances axion and dark photon searches via haloscopes and introduces the DarkQuantum prototype, a superconducting qubit coupled to microwave cavities for single-photon detection. This system enabled the most stringent exclusion limit on massive dark photon interactions at 5.051 GHz, demonstrating the feasibility of quantum-enhanced detectors. Overall, the work bridges classical and quantum detection techniques, advancing WIMP searches and pioneering compact quantum sensors for axion and dark photon detection, laying the foundation for future high-sensitivity dark matter experiments.</p>

We further demonstrate that the (conditional) mutual information indeed decays superpolynomially in a large class of phases, including chiral phases.

            <p>Fermionic many-body systems provide an unrivaled arena to investigate how interactions drive the emergence of collective quantum behavior, such as macroscopic coherence and superfluidity. Central to these phenomena is the formation of Cooper pairs, correlated states of two fermions that behave as composite bosons and condense below a critical temperature. However, unlike elementary bosons, these pairs retain their internal structure set by underlying fermionic correlations, essential for understanding superfluid properties throughout the so-called Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) to Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) crossover-- a cornerstone of strongly correlated fermionic matter. Here, we harness a sonic analog of the optical Sagnac effect to disclose the composite nature of fermionic condensates across the BEC-BCS crossover. We realize an in-situ loop interferometer by coherently exciting two counter-propagating long-wavelength phonons of an annular fermionic superfluid with tuneable interparticle interactions. The frequency degeneracy between clock- and anticlock-wise sound modes is lifted upon controllably injecting a quantized supercurrent in the superfluid ring, resulting in a measurable Doppler shift that enables us to probe the elementary quantum of circulation and the angular momentum carried by each particle in the fermionic fluid. Our observations directly reveal that the superflow circulation is quantized in terms of $h/2m$, where $m$ is the mass of the constituents, in striking contrast to bosonic condensates where $h/m$ is the relevant circulation quantum. Further, by operating our interferometer at tunable temperature, we measure the thermal depletion of the superfluid in the unitary Fermi gas, demonstrating phonon interferometry as a powerful technique for probing fundamental properties of strongly-correlated quantum systems.</p>

We introduce a simple and versatile method for creating and certifying entanglement and many-body Bell correlations. This method relies on a single qubit interacting with an $N$-qubit system. We demonstrate that: (i) such pairwise interaction is sufficient to induce many-body quantum correlations, and (ii) the qubit can serve as a probe to extract all information about these correlations. Thus, single-qubit measurements reveal multi-partite entanglement and $N$-body Bell correlations, enabling the rapid and efficient certification of non-classicality in complex systems.</p>

            <p>The Fermi-Hubbard model is the starting point for the simulation of many strongly correlated materials, including high-temperature superconductors, whose modelling is a key motivation for the construction of quantum simulation and computing devices. However, the detection of superconducting pairing correlations has so far remained out of reach, both because of their off-diagonal character-which makes them inaccessible to local density measurements-and because of the difficulty of preparing superconducting states. Here, we report measurement of significant pairing correlations in three different regimes of Fermi-Hubbard models simulated on Quantinuumś Helios trapped-ion quantum computer. Specifically, we measure non-equilibrium pairing induced by an electromagnetic field in the half-filled square lattice model, d-wave pairing in an approximate ground state of the checkerboard Hubbard model at $1/6$-doping, and s-wave pairing in a bilayer model relevant to nickelate superconductors. These results show that a quantum computer can reliably create and probe physically relevant states with superconducting pairing correlations, opening a path to the exploration of superconductivity with quantum computers.</p>

            <p>We develop and solve a Dicke superradiant model with two or more competing collective decay channels of tunable rates. Recent work analyzed stationary properties of multichannel Dicke superradiance using hydrodynamic mean-field approximations as shown by Mok et al. [Phys. Rev. Res. 7, L022015 (2025)]. We extend this with a symbolic quantum-trajectory method, providing a simple route to analytic solutions. For two channels, the behavior of the stationary ground-state distribution resembles a first-order phase transition at the point where the channel-rate ratio is equal to unity. For $d$ competing channels, we obtain scaling laws for the superradiant peak time and intensity. These results unify and extend single-channel Dicke dynamics to multilevel emitters and provide a compact tool for cavity and waveguide experiments, where permutation-symmetric reservoirs engineer multiple collective decay paths.</p>

            <p>Quantum emitters coupled to nanophotonic structures are an excellent platform for controllable single-photon scattering. The tunable light-matter interaction enables the construction of a single-photon switch -- a device that can route a single photon from an input port to a selected output port. Such single-photon switching devices can be integrated into reconfigurable photonic circuits to actively control the photon propagation direction in a quantum network. Ideally, a single-photon switch should be fast, efficient, scalable, compatible with existing technology, and should preserve the routed photon states with high fidelity. In this review, we focus on theoretical proposals and experimental demonstrations of single-photon switches based on quantum emitters coupled to solid-state nanostructures, including waveguide and cavity architectures. We also present the theoretical methods that are commonly used to model single-photon scattering in waveguide-based systems by applying them to the elementary system of a two-level emitter coupled to a waveguide. This review brings together key theoretical techniques from quantum optics, their applications to controllable single-photon transport, and the experimental realization of single-photon switching devices across different physical platforms, including semiconductor quantum dots, neutral atoms, superconducting qubits, and color centers.</p>

            <p>Proton tunneling across hydrogen bonds is a fundamental quantum effect with implications for spectroscopy, catalysis, and biomolecular stability. While state-of-the-art instanton and path-integral methods provide accurate multidimensional tunneling splittings, simplified one-dimensional models remain valuable as conceptual and benchmarking tools. Here we develop a wavefunction-based framework for tunneling splittings using a Cornell-type double-well potential and apply it as a benchmark for hydrogen-bond tunneling. Analytical WKB estimates and numerical finite-difference solutions are compared across a range of barrier parameters, showing consistent agreement. As a test case, we map the formic acid dimer (FAD) barrier onto a quartic double-well model parameterized to reproduce the reported barrier height of $V_b \\approx 2848~\\text{cm}^{-1}$. The resulting tunneling splitting of about $0.037~\\text{cm}^{-1}$ matches the reduced-dimensional calculations of Qu and Bowman. The close agreement between numerical and semiclassical results highlights the pedagogical and diagnostic value of one-dimensional models, while comparison with molecular benchmarks clarifies their limitations relative to full multidimensional quantum treatments.</p>

At zero temperature, we find the asymmetry exhibits logarithmic growth with system size. At finite temperature, we show that it is parametrically more sensitive to chiral symmetry-breaking than the corresponding local order parameter: while the chiral condensate decays exponentially, the asymmetry decreases only logarithmically. This establishes the entanglement asymmetry as a promising tool to probe (finite-temperature) phase transitions in gauge theories.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michael Ridley, Eliahu Cohen, Christian Flindt, Riku Tuovinen</p>
            <p>The clock speed of topological quantum computers based on Majorana zero mode (MZM)-supporting nanoscale devices is determined by the time taken for electrons to traverse the device. We employ the time-dependent Landauer-B{ü}ttiker transport theory for current cross-lead correlations in a superconducting nanowire junction hosting MZMs. From the time-dependent quantum noise, we are able to extract traversal times for electrons crossing the system. After demonstrating a linear scaling of traversal times with nanowire length, we present a heuristic formula for the traversal times which accurately captures their behaviour. We then connect our framework to a proposed experimental verification of this discriminant between spurious and genuine MZMs utilizing time-resolved transport measurements.</p>

            <h2>Federated Quantum Kernel Learning for Anomaly Detection in Multivariate IoT Time-Series</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kuan-Cheng Chen, Samuel Yen-Chi Chen, Chen-Yu Liu, Kin K. Leung</p>
            <p>The rapid growth of industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) systems has created new challenges for anomaly detection in high-dimensional, multivariate time-series, where privacy, scalability, and communication efficiency are critical. Classical federated learning approaches mitigate privacy concerns by enabling decentralized training, but they often struggle with highly non-linear decision boundaries and imbalanced anomaly distributions. To address this gap, we propose a Federated Quantum Kernel Learning (FQKL) framework that integrates quantum feature maps with federated aggregation to enable distributed, privacy-preserving anomaly detection across heterogeneous IoT networks. In our design, quantum edge nodes locally compute compressed kernel statistics using parameterized quantum circuits and share only these summaries with a central server, which constructs a global Gram matrix and trains a decision function (e.g., Fed-QSVM). Experimental results on synthetic IIoT benchmarks demonstrate that FQKL achieves superior generalization in capturing complex temporal correlations compared to classical federated baselines, while significantly reducing communication overhead. This work highlights the promise of quantum kernels in federated settings, advancing the path toward scalable, robust, and quantum-enhanced intelligence for next-generation IoT infrastructures.</p>

            <p>When particles move through a crystal or optical lattice, their motion can sometimes become frozen by strong external forces -- yet collective motion may still emerge through subtle many-body effects. In this work, we explore such constrained dynamics by realizing a dipole-conserving Bose-Hubbard model, where single atoms are immobile but pairs of particles can move cooperatively while preserving the system's center of mass, i.e. the overall dipole moment of the particle distribution. Starting from a one-dimensional chain of ultracold bosonic atoms in an optical lattice, we generate localized dipole excitations consisting of a hole and a doublon using site-resolved optical potentials and characterize their quantum walks and scattering dynamics. Our study provides a bottom-up investigation of a Hamiltonian with kinetic constraints, and paves the way for exploring low-energy phases of fractonic matter in existing experimental platforms.</p>

            <h2>Unlocking n-alk-1-ynes Conformers: Quantum "Trigger Finger" versus "Stiff Joint" Conformations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ioan Bâldea</p>
            <p>Molecular conformation in n-alk-1-ynes (CnA) is conventionally simplified to an all-planar structure. We report a comprehensive quantum chemical analysis revealing two near-isoenergetic rotamers at the acetylenic terminus: planar (C$_s$) and skewed (C$_1$). The high, symmetric rotational energy barrier ($\approx 150$\,meV) arises from unique steric relief near the $\mathrm{sp}$ center coupled with electronic stabilization of C$_1$. This creates a unique kinetic profile: a Quantum ``Trigger Finger'' ($\alpha$ rotation) that enforces an $\approx 50\%:\,50\%$ $\mathrm{C}_s/\mathrm{C}_1$ ensemble, sharply contrasting with the thermodynamically biased ``Stiff Joint'' ($\delta$ rotation) of the alkyl chain. This structural degeneracy necessitates ensemble averaging for spectroscopic data interpretation, while the slow interconversion permits kinetic trapping and intentional conformer enrichment during synthesis and molecular junction fabrication. Our work redefines the alkyne anchor, providing a blueprint for accurate interpretation of spectroscopic data and achieving conformational control in molecular electronics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Domenico Giuliano, Reinhold Egger, Bidyut Dey, Andrea Nava</p>
            <p>We study the quantum relaxation dynamics for a lattice version of the one-dimensional (1D) $N$-flavor Gross-Neveu (GN) model after a Hamiltonian parameter quench. Allowing for a system-reservoir coupling $\gamma$, we numerically describe the system dynamics through a time-dependent self-consistent Lindblad master equation. For a closed ($\gamma=0$) finite-size system subjected to an interaction parameter quench, the order parameter dynamics exhibits oscillations and revivals. In the thermodynamic limit, our results imply that the order parameter reaches its post-quench stationary value in accordance with the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). However, time-dependent finite-momentum correlation matrix elements equilibrate only if $\gamma>0$. Our findings highlight subtle yet important aspects of the post-quench relaxation dynamics of quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <p>Fermionic many-body systems provide an unrivaled arena to investigate how interactions drive the emergence of collective quantum behavior, such as macroscopic coherence and superfluidity. Central to these phenomena is the formation of Cooper pairs, correlated states of two fermions that behave as composite bosons and condense below a critical temperature. However, unlike elementary bosons, these pairs retain their internal structure set by underlying fermionic correlations, essential for understanding superfluid properties throughout the so-called Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) to Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) crossover-- a cornerstone of strongly correlated fermionic matter. Here, we harness a sonic analog of the optical Sagnac effect to disclose the composite nature of fermionic condensates across the BEC-BCS crossover. We realize an in-situ loop interferometer by coherently exciting two counter-propagating long-wavelength phonons of an annular fermionic superfluid with tuneable interparticle interactions. The frequency degeneracy between clock- and anticlock-wise sound modes is lifted upon controllably injecting a quantized supercurrent in the superfluid ring, resulting in a measurable Doppler shift that enables us to probe the elementary quantum of circulation and the angular momentum carried by each particle in the fermionic fluid. Our observations directly reveal that the superflow circulation is quantized in terms of $h/2m$, where $m$ is the mass of the constituents, in striking contrast to bosonic condensates where $h/m$ is the relevant circulation quantum. Further, by operating our interferometer at tunable temperature, we measure the thermal depletion of the superfluid in the unitary Fermi gas, demonstrating phonon interferometry as a powerful technique for probing fundamental properties of strongly-correlated quantum systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arnab Ghosh, Patrick Brosseau, Dmitry N. Dirin, Maksym V. Kovalenko, Patanjali Kambhampati</p>
            <p>Superfluorescence, the cooperative burst of spontaneous emission from an ensemble of dipoles, arises when microscopic oscillators spontaneously synchronize their phases. Here we show that this process can be reversed in time within quantum materials. Coherent multidimensional spectroscopy of halide perovskite quantum dots reveals a delayed cooperative absorption burst, the mirror image of superfluorescent emission, driven by transient polaron fields that phase-lock unit-cell dipoles within 100 fs. The effect scales systematically with quantum-dot size and halide composition, reaching near-unity coherence fidelity even at 300 K. A microscopic exciton-polaron model reproduces the buildup and decay of the coherent state, identifying lattice polarons as the mediators of synchronization. These results demonstrate that many-body temporal coherence can self-organize and persist at room temperature, opening routes toward engineered collective optical states and superabsorbing quantum devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matteo D'Anna, Jannes Nys, Juan Carrasquilla</p>
            <p>The study of real-time dynamics of fermions remains one of the last frontiers beyond the reach of classical simulations and is key to our understanding of quantum behavior in chemistry and materials, with implications for quantum technology. Here we introduce a Heisenberg-picture algorithm that propagates observables expressed in a Majorana-string basis using a truncation scheme that preserves Trotter accuracy and aims at maintaining computational efficiency. The framework is exact for quadratic Hamiltonians--remaining restricted to a fixed low-weight sector determined by the physical observable--admits variational initial states, and can be extended to interacting regimes via systematically controlled truncations. We benchmark our approach on one- and two-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard quenches, comparing against tensor network methods (MPS and fPEPS) and recent experimental data. The method achieves high accuracy on timescales comparable to state-of-the-art variational techniques and experiments, demonstrating that controlled Majorana-string truncation is a practical tool for simulating two-dimensional fermionic dynamics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sabee Grewal, Vishnu Iyer, William Kretschmer, Daniel Liang</p>
            <p>We give a pair of algorithms that efficiently learn a quantum state prepared by Clifford gates and $O(\log n)$ non-Clifford gates. Specifically, for an $n$-qubit state $|\psi\rangle$ prepared with at most $t$ non-Clifford gates, our algorithms use $\mathsf{poly}(n,2^t,1/\varepsilon)$ time and copies of $|\psi\rangle$ to learn $|\psi\rangle$ to trace distance at most $\varepsilon$. The first algorithm for this task is more efficient, but requires entangled measurements across two copies of $|\psi\rangle$. The second algorithm uses only single-copy measurements at the cost of polynomial factors in runtime and sample complexity. Our algorithms more generally learn any state with sufficiently large stabilizer dimension, where a quantum state has stabilizer dimension $k$ if it is stabilized by an abelian group of $2^k$ Pauli operators. We also develop an efficient property testing algorithm for stabilizer dimension, which may be of independent interest.</p>

            <p>In this work we explore how different types of resources are distributed among the states generated by quantum random circuits (QRC). We focus on multipartite non-locality, but we also analyze quantum correlations by appealing to different entanglement and non-classicality measures. We analyze the violation of Mermin and Svetlichny inequalities in order to get a glance at the distribution of nonlocality and genuine multipartite nonlocality. Next, we compare universal vs non-universal sets of gates, to gain insight into the problem of explaining quantum advantage. By comparing the results obtained with ideal (noiseless) vs noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, we lay the basis of a certification protocol, which aims to quantify how robust is the resources distribution among the states that a given device can generate. We have implemented our non-locality-based benchmark on actual quantum processors with different architectures, in order to assess up to which point they are capable of reproducing the ideal results.</p>

            <p>We analyze the existence and degeneracies of quantum exceptional, diabolical, and hybrid points in simple bosonic systems - comprising up to six modes with damping and/or amplification - under two complementary scenarios to those described in arXiv:2405.01666: (i) nonconventional PT-symmetric dynamics confined to a subspace of the full Liouville space, and (ii) systems featuring unidirectional coupling.} The system dynamics described by quadratic non-Hermitian Hamiltonians is governed by the Heisenberg-Langevin equations. Conditions for the observation of inherited quantum hybrid points with up to sixth-order exceptional and second-order diabolical degeneracies are revealed, though relevant only for short-time dynamics. This raises the question of whether higher-order inherited singularities exist in bosonic systems under general conditions. Nevertheless, for short times, unidirectional coupling of various types enables the concatenation of simple bosonic systems with second- and third-order exceptional degeneracies such that arbitrarily high exceptional degeneracies are reached. Methods for numerical identifying the quantum exceptional and hybrid points together with their degeneracies are addressed. Following arXiv:2405.01666 rich dynamics of second-order field-operator moments is analyzed from the point of view of the presence of exceptional and diabolical points and their degeneracies.</p>

            <p>WiFi-based indoor localization is essential for asset tracking, healthcare monitoring, and smart buildings. However, existing systems face challenges such as data variability, environmental noise, and difficulty detecting floor and building levels, compounded by limited labeled data and high received signal strength (RSS) collection costs. This paper introduces quantum stochastic contrast learning (QSCL), a novel framework grounded in rigorous theoretical foundations. We present four theorems and one lemma that establish the probabilistic augmentation, diversity enhancement, relationship preservation, and resilience of QSCL under quantum noise, supported by formal proofs. Leveraging these foundations, QSCL utilizes quantum computing (QC) to generate strong data augmentations with stochastic perturbations, enhancing data diversity, while classical weak augmentations provide subtle variations for robust feature learning. We propose a spatial temporal adaptive attention (STAA) encoder that integrates convolutional layers with adaptive attention mechanisms to capture spatial and temporal dependencies in sequential data. Furthermore, a bidirectional contrastive loss function is introduced to capture forward and reverse relationships between augmented views, ensuring robust representations. Comprehensive evaluations on the UJIIndoorLoc and UTSIndoorLoc datasets validate QSCL, demonstrating superior performance with reduced labeled data and resilience to quantum noise such as bit-flip, dephasing, and measurement noise. The proposed framework significantly improves localization accuracy, floor and building detection, and generalizability in challenging indoor environments.</p>

            <p>A diffusion probabilistic model (DPM) is a generative model renowned for its ability to produce high-quality outputs in tasks such as image and audio generation. However, training DPMs on large, high-dimensional datasets such as high-resolution images or audio incurs significant computational, energy, and hardware costs. In this work, we introduce efficient quantum algorithms for implementing DPMs through various quantum ODE solvers. These algorithms highlight the potential of quantum Carleman linearization for diverse mathematical structures, leveraging state-of-the-art quantum linear system solvers (QLSS) or linear combination of Hamiltonian simulations (LCHS). Specifically, we focus on two approaches: DPM-solver-$k$ which employs exact $k$-th order derivatives to compute a polynomial approximation of $\epsilon_\theta(x_\lambda,\lambda)$; and UniPC which uses finite difference of $\epsilon_\theta(x_\lambda,\lambda)$ at different points $(x_{s_m}, \lambda_{s_m})$ to approximate higher-order derivatives. As such, this work represents one of the most direct and pragmatic applications of quantum algorithms to large-scale machine learning models, presumably taking substantial steps towards demonstrating the practical utility of quantum computing.</p>

The resulting family of effective Hamiltonians reproduces the well-known Floquet-Magnus expansion, now enhanced with explicit error bounds that quantify the distance between the exact and approximate dynamics at each order, even in cases where the Floquet-Magnus series fails to converge. We apply the method to the semiclassical Rabi model and provide explicit error bounds for both the Bloch-Siegert Hamiltonian and its third-order refinement. Our analysis shows that, while the rotating-wave approximation more accurately captures the true dynamics than the Bloch-Siegert Hamiltonian in most regimes, the third-order approximation ultimately outperforms both.</p>

            <p>Advancements in Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computing are steadily pushing these systems toward outperforming classical supercomputers on specific, well-defined computational tasks. In this work, we explore and control quantum chaos in NISQ systems using discrete-time quantum walks (DTQW) on cyclic graphs. To efficiently implement quantum walks on NISQ hardware, we employ the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) to diagonalize the conditional shift operator, optimizing circuit depth and fidelity. We experimentally realize the transition from quantum chaos to order via DTQW dynamics on both odd and even cyclic graphs, specifically 3- and 4-cycle graphs, using the counterintuitive Parrondo's paradox strategy across three different NISQ devices. While the 4-cycle graphs exhibit high-fidelity quantum evolution, the 3-cycle implementation shows significant fidelity improvement when augmented with dynamical decoupling pulses. Our results demonstrate a practical approach to probing and harnessing controlled chaotic dynamics on real quantum hardware, laying the groundwork for future quantum algorithms and cryptographic protocols based on quantum walks.</p>

Since the finite target gate set cannot exactly implement any given operator, approximation is often necessary. Model counting, or #SAT, has recently been demonstrated as a promising new approach for tackling core problems in quantum circuit analysis. In this work, we show for the first time that the universal quantum circuit synthesis problem can be reduced to maximum model counting. We formulate a #SAT encoding for exact and approximate depth-optimal quantum circuit synthesis into the Clifford+T gate set. We evaluate our method with an open-source implementation that uses the maximum model counter d4Max as a backend. For this purpose, we extended d4Max with support for complex and negative weights to represent amplitudes. Experimental results show that existing classical tools have potential for the quantum circuit synthesis problem.</p>

            <p>The accurate theoretical description of materials with strongly correlated electrons is a formidable challenge in condensed matter physics and computational chemistry. Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT) is a successful approach that predicts behaviors of such systems by incorporating some of the correlated behavior using an impurity model, but it is limited by the need to calculate the impurity Green's function. This work proposes a framework for DMFT calculations on quantum computers, focusing on near-term applications. It leverages the structure of the impurity problem, combining a low-rank Gaussian subspace representation of the ground state and a compressed, short-depth quantum circuit that joins state preparation with time evolution to compute Green's functions. We demonstrate the convergence of the DMFT algorithm using the Gaussian subspace in a noise-free setting, and show the hardware viability of circuit compression by extracting the impurity Green's function on IBM quantum processors for a single impurity coupled to three bath orbitals (8 qubits, 1 ancilla). We discuss potential paths toward realizing this quantum computing use case in materials science.</p>

            <p>For various optimization problems, the classical time to solution is super-polynomial and intractable to solve with classical bit-based computing hardware to date. Digital and quantum annealers have the potential to identify near-optimal solutions for such optimization problems using a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem formulation. This work benchmarks two use cases to evaluate the utility of QUBO solvers for combinatorial optimization problems, in order to determine if a QUBO formulation and annealing-based algorithms have an advantage over classical mixed-integer programming (MIP) and constraint programming (CP) solvers. Various QUBO and solver metrics such as problem mapping, quantitative interconnectivity, penalty structure, solver minimum cost (obtained optimal value) and solver time to solution have been applied to evaluate different QUBO problems. Constrained and unconstrained QUBO solvers are compared including the Fujitsu digital annealer (DA), various D-Wave hybrid quantum annealing solvers (QA, HQA), and the classical MIP/CP solvers HiGHS, Gurobi, SCIP, and CP-SAT. The two industrially relevant use cases are reaction network pathway analysis and mRNA codon selection. For reaction pathway analysis, classical MIP/CP solvers (especially Gurobi and CP-SAT) are observed to solve the problem to optimality in reasonable time frames. For mRNA codon selection, Gurobi outperformed all other solvers in time to solution for all problem sizes, followed by CP-SAT and the D-Wave Nonlinear (NL) HQA solver.</p>

For the first task, we address the feature selection challenge of the German Credit Dataset by formulating it as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, which is solved using quantum annealing to identify the optimal feature subset. Experimental results show that the resulting credit scoring model maintains high classification precision despite using a minimal number of features. For the second task, we focus on classifying handwritten digits 3 and 6 in the MNIST dataset using Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs). Through meticulous data preprocessing (downsampling, binarization), quantum encoding (FRQI and compressed FRQI), and the design of QNN architectures (CRADL and CRAML), we demonstrate that QNNs can effectively handle high-dimensional image data.

            <p>Recent developments in quantum light engineering have enabled the use of infrared bright squeezed vacuum (BSV) femtosecond pulses in highly nonlinear optics, particularly strong field physics and high-harmonic generation. However, theoretical studies were focused on the microscopic interaction with a single atom, neglecting the crucial macroscopic aspect of light propagation through the media. This raises a key question: How does BSV propagates in strongly light-driven nonlinear media and how this affects the generation of non-linear optical signals? We address this question by introducing a fully quantized framework that accounts for the propagation in gas media. We find that atomic ionization caused by strong BSV fluctuations and the associated infrared photon losses introduce decoherence effects that can substantially limit the propagation length in the medium, reduce the harmonic yield, and decrease the number of emitted harmonics at high intensities. However, these effects are not detrimental. We identify conditions under which propagation-induced decoherence is minimized while the generated harmonics remain clearly detectable--an issue of particular importance for future studies exploring the connection between strong-field physics and quantum optics. Our results lay the foundation for future studies of BSV in strong-field physics, nonlinear optics, and ultrafast science, and establish a basis for exploring its propagation through all states of matter in a fully quantized framework.</p>

The CAFQA (Clifford Ansatz For Quantum Accuracy) protocol runs a discrete search through a classically simulatable subset of the entire state space to find a desirable initialization. Prior work has evaluated CAFQA applied to the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), a VQA that computes grounds states of a Hamiltonian. Motivated by CAFQA's success, we propose Excited-CAFQA initialization for Variational Quantum Deflation (VQD), a quantum algorithm that extends VQE by allowing the computation of excited states. VQD recursively computes excited states, by constraining the kth state to be orthogonal to the previous k-1 computed energy states via a penalty term appended to the standard VQE cost function. Just as with VQE, the VQD cost function can be efficiently computed classically for the states considered in the discrete CAFQA search, allowing for the discrete CAFQA optimizer to find good initial parameters for each energy level computation. Preliminary evaluation shows that Excited-CAFQA achieves 90 to 99+% accuracy across a variety of bond lengths and excited states for H2 and HeH+ molecular systems.</p>

            <h2>Tensors, entanglement, separability, and their complexity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shmuel Friedland</p>
            <p>One of the most challenging problems in quantum physics is to quantify the entanglement of $d$-partite states and their separability. We show here that these problems are best addressed using tensors. The geometric measure of entanglement of a pure state is one of most natural ways to quantify the entanglement, which is simply related to the spectral norm of a tensor state. On the other hand, the logarithm of the nuclear norm of the state and density tensors can be considered as its ``energy''. We first show that the most geometric measure entangled $d$-partite state has the minimum spectral norm and maximum nuclear norm. Second, we introduce the notion of Hermitian and density tensors, and the subspace of bi-symmetric Hermitian tensors, which correspond to Bosons. We show that separable density tensors, and strongly separable bi-symmetric density tensors are characterized by the value (equal to one) of their corresponding nuclear norms. In general, these characterizations are NP-hard to verify. Third, we show that the above quantities are computed in polynomial time when we restrict our attentions to Bosons: symmetric $d$-qubits, or more generally to symmetric $d$-qunits in $C^n$, and the corresponding bi-symmetric Hermtian density tensors, for a fixed value of $n$.</p>

By mapping the reconstruction cost function onto an Ising model, the problem can be solved using a variational eigensolver on present-day quantum hardware.

Our results highlight the potential of variational algorithms for efficient quantum state tomography, particularly for high-dimensional structured light, where classical approaches can face bottlenecks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Connor Clayton, Bruno Avritzer</p>
            <p>Modular quantum computing architectures require error correction schemes that remain effective in the presense of noisy inter-processor operations. We introduce a distributed quantum error correction framework based on approximate codes to address this challenge. Our approach enables concatenation of distinct local codes across modules while allowing logical operations composed primarily of processor-local gates. We derive a lower bound and present corresponding simulations which indicate that this nontraditional approach can provide marked advantage over existing approaches in the highly non-uniform error landscape of a distributed quantum computer. As a concrete realization, we present encoding and decoding circuits for the permutation-invariant W- state code and propose efficient methods for its preparation.

            <h2>Quantum Network-Based Prediction of Cancer Driver Genes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Patricia Marques, Andreas Wichert, Duarte Magano, Bruno Coutinho</p>
            <p>Identification of cancer driver genes is fundamental for the development of targeted therapeutic interventions. The integration of mutational profiles with protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks offers a promising avenue for their detection [ 1, 2], but scaling to large network datasets is computationally demanding. Quantum computing offers compact representations and potential complexity reductions. Motivated by the classical method of Gumpinger et al. [3], in this work we introduce a supervised quantum framework that combines mutation scores with network topology via a novel state preparation scheme, Quantum Multi-order Moment Embedding (QMME). QMME encodes low-order statistical moments over the mutation scores of a node's immediate and second-order neighbors, and encodes this information into quantum states. These are used as inputs to a kernel-based quantum binary classifier that discriminates known driver genes from others. Simulations on an empirical PPI network demonstrate competitive performance, with a 12.6% recall gain over a classical baseline. The pipeline performs explicit quantum state preparation and requires no classical training, enabling an efficient, nearly end-to-end quantum workflow. A brief complexity analysis suggests the approach could achieve a quantum speedup in network-based cancer gene prediction. This work underscores the potential of supervised quantum graph learning frameworks to advance biological discovery.</p>

            <p>We show that spin-flip probabilities emerge in the relativistic regime for scalar potentials, absent in the standard Dirac representation. We examine 1D scattering for the Dirac equation employing an alternate matrix representation introduced by the Author in an earlier study. We demonstrate that the transmission (T) and reflection (R) coefficients can depend on the chosen representation of the Clifford algebra despite the two representations being related by a unitary or non-unitary transformation. We also show that for the non-unitary case quantum interference may arise in scattering phenomena, a testable experimental signature. This representation dependence hints at hidden physics in how spinor components couple to external steps/barriers, even when the relativistic dispersion relation (E^2=p^2+m^2) is the same.</p>

            <p>Emergent quantum networks are the essential ingredient for securely connecting multiple users worldwide, extensively deployed in both fibre and free-space. An essential element is the multiplexing of entanglement to multiple users, overcoming the peer-to-peer restriction of quantum key distribution (QKD), so far successfully shown in fibre-based architectures. Here, we demonstrate a free-space quantum space division multiplexing architecture using just one entanglement source to realise a fully connected twelve-channel quantum network for seamless QKD connections between six users. The network achieves record coincidence rates exceeding $3 \times 10^{4}$ s$^{-1}$ between any pair of nodes on the network, for sifted key rate of over 400 kbps. Our approach overcomes the active switching hurdle that has hindered the free-space deployment of quantum multiplexing, is fully passive, easily scalable to more nodes and compatible with fibre-based integration, thus opening a new path to scalable and resource-efficient quantum networks that utilise free-space links.</p>

We show that scale invariance, and in turn, the duality of the power spectrum is subsequently broken at large momenta for an inflating gas, and at small momenta for a contracting gas. We thereby furnish a Planck-scale sensitive approach to analogue quantum cosmology that can readily be implemented in the quantum gas laboratory.</p>

            <h2>Probing dynamical axion quasiparticles with two-photon correlations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Boyanovsky</p>
            <p>Dynamical axion (quasi) particles are emergent collective excitations in topological magnetic insulators that break parity and time reversal invariance or in Weyl semimetals. They couple to electromagnetism via a topological Chern-Simons term, leading to their decay into two photons. We extend the Weisskopf-Wigner formulation of atomic spontaneous emission to the quantum field theory of dynamical axion quasiparticles, allowing us to obtain the quantum two-photon state emerging from axion decay in real time. This state features \emph{hyperentanglement} in momentum and polarization with a distinct polarization pattern, a consequence of the parity and time reversal breaking of the axion-photon interaction. Polarization aspects of this two-photon state are studied by introducing quantum Stokes operators. Whereas the two-photon quantum state features vanishing \emph{averages} of the degree of polarization and polarization asymmetry, there are non-trivial momentum correlations of the Stokes operators. In particular momentum correlations of the \emph{polarization asymmetry} can be obtained directly from coincident momentum and polarization resolved two photon detection. Correlations of Stokes operators are directly related to momentum and polarization resolved Hanbury-Brown Twiss second order coherences. This relationship suggests two-photon correlations as a direct probe of dynamical axion quasiparticles. Similarities and differences with parametrically down converted photons and other systems where spontaneous emission yield hyperentangled two photon states are recognized, suggesting experimental avenues similar to tests of Bell inequalities to probe dynamical axion quasiparticles with coincident two photon detection.</p>

            <p>Machine learning-assisted diagnosis shows promise, yet medical imaging datasets are often scarce, imbalanced, and constrained by privacy, making data augmentation essential. Classical generative models typically demand extensive computational and sample resources. Quantum computing offers a promising alternative, but existing quantum-based image generation methods remain limited in scale and often face barren plateaus. We present MediQ-GAN, a quantum-inspired GAN with prototype-guided skip connections and a dual-stream generator that fuses classical and quantum-inspired branches. Its variational quantum circuits inherently preserve full-rank mappings, avoid rank collapse, and are theory-guided to balance expressivity with trainability. Beyond generation quality, we provide the first latent-geometry and rank-based analysis of quantum-inspired GANs, offering theoretical insight into their performance. Across three medical imaging datasets, MediQ-GAN outperforms state-of-the-art GANs and diffusion models. While validated on IBM hardware for robustness, our contribution is hardware-agnostic, offering a scalable and data-efficient framework for medical image generation and augmentation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Suman Hazra, Urvesh Patil, Stefano Sanvito</p>
            <p>We present a machine-learning workflow for the calculation of the infrared spectrum of molecules, and more generally of other temperature-dependent electronic observables. The main idea is to use the Jacobi-Legendre cluster expansion to predict the real-space charge density of a converged density-functional-theory calculation. This gives us access to both energy and forces, and to electronic observables such as the dipole moment or the electronic gap. Thus, the same model can simultaneously drive a molecular dynamics simulation and evaluate electronic quantities along the trajectory, namely it has access to the same information of ab-initio molecular dynamics. A similar approach within the framework of machine-learning force fields would require the training of multiple models, one for the molecular dynamics and others for predicting the electronic quantities. The scheme is implemented here within the numerical framework of the PySCF code and applied to the infrared spectrum of the uracil molecule in the gas phase.</p>

            <h2>Emergence: from physics to biology, sociology, and computer science</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ross H. McKenzie</p>
            <p>Many systems involve numerous interacting parts and the whole system can have properties that the individual parts do not. I take this novelty as the defining characteristic of an emergent property. Other characteristics associated with emergence discussed include universality, order, complexity, unpredictability, irreducibility, diversity, self-organisation, discontinuities, and singularities. Emergent phenomena are widespread across physics, biology, social sciences, and computing, and are central to major scientific and societal challenges. Understanding emergence involves considering the stratification of reality across different scales (energy, time, length, complexity), each with its distinct ontology and epistemology, leading to semi-autonomous scientific disciplines. A central challenge is bridging the gap between macroscopic emergent properties and microscopic component interactions. Identifying an intermediate mesoscopic scale where new, weakly interacting entities or modular structures emerge is key. Theoretical approaches, such as effective theories (describing phenomena at a specific scale) and toy models (simplified systems for analysis), are vital. The Ising model exemplifies how toy models can elucidate emergence characteristics. Emergence is central to condensed matter physics, chaotic systems, fluid dynamics, nuclear physics, quantum gravity, neural networks, protein folding, and social segregation. An emergent perspective should influence scientific strategy by shaping research questions, methodologies, priorities, and resource allocation. An elusive goal is the design and control of emergent properties.</p>

            <p>Wave transport devices, such as amplifiers, frequency converters, and nonreciprocal devices, are essential for modern communication, signal processing, and sensing applications. Of particular interest are traveling wave setups, which offer excellent gain and bandwidth properties. So far, the conceptual design of those devices has relied on human ingenuity. This makes it difficult and time-consuming to explore the full design space under a variety of constraints and target functionalities. In our work, we present a method which automates this challenge. By optimizing the discrete and continuous parameters of periodic coupled-mode lattices, our approach identifies the simplest lattices that achieve the target transport functionality, and we apply it to discover new schemes for directional amplifiers, isolators, and frequency demultiplexers. Leveraging automated symbolic regression tools, we find closed analytical expressions that facilitate the discovery of generalizable construction rules. Moreover, we utilize important conceptual connections between the device transport properties and non-Hermitian topology. The resulting structures can be implemented on a variety of platforms, including microwave, optical, and optomechanical systems. Our approach opens the door to extensions like the artificial discovery of lattice models with desired properties in higher dimensions or with nonlinear interactions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ronak M Soni</p>
            <p>In some cases in two and three bulk dimensions without bulk local degrees of freedom, I look for area operators in a fixed boundary theory. In each case, I define an exact quantum error-correcting code (QECC) and show that it admits a central decomposition. However, the area operator that arises from this central decomposition vanishes. A non-zero area operator, however, emerges after coarse-graining. The expectation value of this operator approximates the actual entanglement entropy for a class of states that do not form a linear subspace. These non-linear constraints can be interpreted as semiclassicality conditions. The coarse-grained area operator is ambiguous, and this ambiguity can be matched with that in defining fixed-area states.</p>

            <h2>Quantum-dot single photon source performance with off-resonant pulse preparation schemes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gavin Crowder, Lora Ramunno, Stephen Hughes</p>
            <p>The preparation of photonic qubits in the excited state is an integral part of the performance of an on-demand single photon source (SPS). Conventional resonant excitation, an excellent approach to maximize the coherence and indistinguishability of the SPS, often requires polarization filtering to remove the pump signal and isolate the qubit emission, but this results in an inherent 50\% hit to the efficiency. Recent excitation schemes strategically try to exploit pulses that excite the qubit while avoiding spectral overlap to bypass this required filtering. In this work, we compare three such pumping schemes to quantify the important SPS figures-of-merit for off-resonant quantum dot schemes, using: (i) a symmetrically detuned dichromatic pulse, (ii) a notch-filtered adiabatic rapid passage (NARP) pulse, and (iii) a swing up of the quantum emitter population (SUPER) pulse. Due to large instantaneous pulse strengths, the dichromatic pulse suffers from phonon-induced dephasing which can lower the SPS performance by up to 50\%. In contrast, the NARP and SUPER pulses are shielded from phonon coupling to differing degrees but both maintain excellent SPS performance. The SUPER pulse can lose significant efficiency if there is variance in its constituent pulses' amplitude, pulse width, or frequency, while the NARP pulse, though potentially more difficult to realize in experiments, is robust against variance in the pulse preparation.</p>

            <p>We considered the transfer of continuous-variable entangled states in coupled oscillator chains embedded in a generic environment. We demonstrate high-fidelity transfer via optimal control in two configurations - a linear chain and an X-shaped chain. More specifically, we use the Krotov optimization algorithm to design control fields that achieve the desired state transfer. Under the environmental memory effects, the Krotov algorithm needs to be modified, since the dissipative terms in non-Markovian dynamics are generally governed by the time-dependent system Hamiltonian. Remarkably, we can achieve high-fidelity transfer by simply tuning the frequencies of the oscillators while keeping the coupling strength constant, even in the presence of open-system effects. For the system under consideration, we find that quantum memory effects can aid in the transfer of entanglement and show improvement over the memoryless case. In addition, it is possible to target a range of entangled states, making it unnecessary to know the parameters of the initial state beforehand.</p>

            <p>Quantum computing crucially relies on maintaining quantum coherence for the duration of a calculation. Bosonic quantum error correction protects this coherence by encoding qubits into superpositions of noise-resilient oscillator states. In the case of the Kerr-cat qubit (KCQ), these states derive their stability from being the quasi-degenerate ground states of an engineered Hamiltonian in a driven nonlinear oscillator. KCQs are experimentally compatible with on-chip architectures and high-fidelity operations, making them promising candidates for a scalable bosonic quantum processor. However, their bit-flip time must increase further to fully leverage these advantages. Here, we present direct evidence that the bit-flip time in a KCQ is limited by leakage out of the qubit manifold and experimentally mitigate this process. We coherently control the leakage population and measure it to be > 9%, twelve times higher than in the undriven system. We then cool this population back into the KCQ manifold with engineered dissipation, identify conditions under which this suppresses bit-flips, and demonstrate increased bit-flip times up to 3.6 milliseconds. By employing both Hamiltonian confinement and engineered dissipation, our experiment combines two paradigms for Schrödinger-cat qubit stabilization. Our results elucidate the interplay between these stabilization processes and indicate a path towards fully realizing the potential of these qubits for quantum error correction.</p>

            <p>Describing systems of superconducting atoms coupled to a continuum of photonic modes at multiple separated locations in a waveguide, waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED) with giant atoms has emerged as a promising platform for realizing quantum interconnect. Such systems have been reported to exhibit rich phenomena that differ from those of natural atoms. Going beyond the widely used Born-Markov and Wigner-Weisskopf approximations, we investigate the non-Markovian dynamics of one and two giant atoms interacting with a waveguide formed by an array of coupled resonators. We discover that the diverse dynamical behaviors of the giant atoms are intrinsically determined by the energy spectrum of the composite system consisting of the giant atoms and the photonic modes in the waveguide. As long as one and more bound states are present in the energy spectrum, their excited-state probabilities, respectively, tend to stable finite values and lossless Rabi-like oscillations with frequencies proportional to the differences of the bound-state eigenenergies. Our result provides an insightful guideline for suppressing the decoherence of giant atoms and facilitates the development of quantum interconnect devices using giant-atom waveguide QED.</p>

            <p>Resonant coupling of a vibration to a cavity mode has been reported to dramatically modify spontaneous Raman scattering, but subsequent studies have produced conflicting results. In this Letter, we develop a microscopic quantum framework that captures the spatial structure of polaritonic modes. In a homogeneously filled cavity, spatial overlap between polaritons and cavity resonances enforces selection rules that suppress the initially reported polaritonic Raman peaks, consistent with most experiments. In contrast, for a quasi-two-dimensional (2d) molecular layer, these rules are lifted, yielding Raman peaks at the polariton energies. Our work clarifies that the Raman response under vibrational strong coupling is determined by cavity-vibration spatial mode overlap and offers a framework for Raman studies of strongly coupled quasi-2d systems.</p>

            <p>The dynamics of local observables in a quantum many-body system can be formally described in the language of open systems. The problem is that the bath representing the complement of the local subsystem generally does not allow the common simplifications often crucial for such a framework. Leveraging tensor network calculations and optimization tools from machine learning, we extract and characterize the dynamical maps for single- and two-site subsystems embedded in an infinite quantum Ising chain after a global quench. We consider three paradigmatic regimes: integrable critical, integrable non-critical, and chaotic. For each we find the optimal time-local representation of the subsystem dynamics at different times. We explore the properties of the learned time-dependent Liouvillians and whether they can be used to forecast the long-time dynamics of local observables beyond the times accessible through direct quantum many-body numerical simulation. Our procedure naturally suggests a novel measure of non-Markovianity based on the distance between the quasi-exact dynamical map and the closest CP-divisible form and reveals that criticality leads to the closest Markovian representation at large times.</p>

            <p>Simulating the time-dynamics of quantum many-body systems was the original use of quantum computers proposed by Feynman, motivated by the critical role of quantum interactions between electrons in the properties of materials and molecules. Accurately simulating such systems remains one of the most promising applications of general-purpose digital quantum computers, in which all the parameters of the model can be programmed and any desired physical quantity output. However, performing such simulations on today's quantum computers at a scale beyond the reach of classical methods requires advances in the efficiency of simulation algorithms and error mitigation techniques. Here we demonstrate programmable digital quantum simulation of the dynamics of the 2D Fermi-Hubbard model -- one of the best-known simplified models of electrons in crystalline solids -- at a scale beyond exact classical simulation. We implement simulations of this model on lattice sizes up to $6\times 6$ using 72 qubits on Google's Willow quantum processor, across a range of physical parameters, including on-site electron-electron interaction strength and magnetic flux, and study phenomena including formation of magnetic polarons, i.e. charge carriers surrounded by local magnetic polarisation, dynamical symmetry breaking in stripe-ordered states, attraction of charge carriers on an entangled state known as a valence bond solid, and the approach to equilibrium through thermalisation. We validate our results against exact calculations in parameter regimes where these are feasible, and compare them to approximate classical simulations performed using tensor network and operator propagation methods. Our results demonstrate that programmable digital quantum simulation of many-body interacting electron models is now competitive on state-of-the-art quantum hardware.</p>

            <h2>Single-Photon-Level Atomic Frequency Comb Storage in Room Temperature Alkali Vapour</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zakary Schofield, Vanderli Laurindo Jr, Ori Ezrah Mor, Patrick M. Ledingham</p>
            <p>We have demonstrated the coherent storage and retrieval of single-photon-level light using the atomic frequency comb protocol in a room temperature rubidium vapour. Velocity-selective optical pumping is used to prepare the comb within the $F=2$ hyperfine ground state of rubidium, with the spacing between peaks coinciding with half the $F = 2 - F =3$ hyperfine splitting of the $5^2$P$_{3/2}$ excited state. Weak coherent states of average photon number $\mu_\mathrm{in} = 0.083(5)$ are stored with pre-programmed recall time of $7.5\,$ns with an efficiency of $\eta_{\textrm{AFC}} = 6.59(5)\,\%$, while two temporally distinct modes have been stored and recalled with $\eta_{\textrm{AFC}} = 2.6(1)\,\%$, allowing for time-bin qubit storage. Finally, the efficiency is observed to be independent of the input pulse polarisation, paving the way for polarisation qubit storage.</p>

            <h2>Zitterbewegung Effect and Quantum Geometry in Non-Hermitian Exciton-Polariton Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yow-Ming Robin Hu, Elena A. Ostrovskaya, Eliezer Estrecho</p>
            <p>In this work, we analytically derive a semi-classical equation of motion describing the zitterbewegung effects arising in the dynamics of wavepackets in non-Hermitian systems. In Hermitian non-relativistic quantum systems, the zitterbewegung effects can arise due to the spin precession and spin-orbit coupling. Interestingly, the spin dynamics in non-Hermitian systems are qualitatively different because of the effective nonlinear terms induced by the non-Hermitian part of the Hamiltonian. In this work, we show the effects from the non-Hermitian spin dynamics by generalising the description of zitterbewegung effects to non-Hermitian systems. We also uncover novel non-Hermitian correction to the group velocity, which can be expressed in terms of the non-Hermitian quantum metric tensor in the absence of out-of-plane effective field.</p>

            <h2>Manipulating Excitation Dynamics in Structured Waveguide Quantum Electrodynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> I Gusti Ngurah Yudi Handayana, Ya-Tang Yu, Wei-Hsuan Chung, H. H. Jen</p>
            <p>Waveguide quantum electrodynamics (wQED) has become a central platform for studying collective light-matter interactions in low-dimensional photonic environments. While conventional wQED systems rely on uniform chirality or reciprocal emitter-waveguide coupling, we propose a structured wQED framework, where the coupling directionality of each emitter can be engineered locally to control excitation transport in an atom-nanophotonic interface. For different combinations of patterned coupling directionalities of the emitters, we identify four representative configurations that exhibit distinct dynamical behaviors: centering, wave-like, leap-frog, and dispersion excitations. Spectral analysis of the effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian reveals that these dynamics originate from interferences among subradiant eigenmodes. Variance analysis further quantifies the spreading of excitation as functions of interatomic spacing and global chirality, showing tunable localization-delocalization transitions. Including nonguided losses, we find that the transport characteristics remain robust for realistic coupling efficiencies (beta >= 0.99). These results establish structured wQED as a practical route to manipulate excitation localization, coherence, and transport through programmable directionality patterns, paving the way for controllable subradiant transport and chiral quantum information routing.</p>

Here, we realize a room-temperature quantum simulator using a thin ${}^{13}\text{C}$ nuclear spin layer in diamond. Nearby nitrogen-vacancy centers enable polarization, readout, and, combined with radio-frequency fields, coherent control of the nuclear spins. We demonstrate strong, tunable interactions among the nuclear spins and use the system to investigate discrete time-crystalline order.

            <p>Quantum networks, which integrate multiple quantum computers and the channels connecting them, are crucial for distributed quantum information processing but remain inherently susceptible to channel noise. Channel purification emerges as a promising technique for suppressing noise in quantum channels without complex encoding and decoding operations, making it particularly suitable for remote quantum information transmission in optical systems. In this work, we introduce an experimental setup for efficient channel purification, harnessing the spatial and polarization properties of photons. Our design employs two Fredkin gates to enable coherent interference between independent noise channels, achieving effective noise suppression across a wide range of noise levels and types. Through application to entanglement distribution, our protocol demonstrates a superior capability to preserve entanglement against channel noise compared to conventional entanglement purification methods.</p>

            <h2>Quantum interference effects in two-photon scattering by a macroscopic lossy sphere</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. Ciattoni</p>
            <p>We investigate the quantum optical scattering of two-photon wavepackets by a macroscopic lossy sphere by means of macroscopic quantum electrodynamics in the form of modified Langevin noise formalism. The two ingoing photons with arbitrary frequency-polarization spectrum impinge onto the sphere along two different directions and, as consequence of matter losses, their scattering involves the three independent processes where two, one and zero outgoing photons survive. Non-collinearity of ingoing photons causes the existence of two different quantum paths they can follow upon scattering, this producing interference effects in the detection of the above three processes which is governed by the wavepacket spectral symmetry. By exploiting rotational invariance, we show that different classes of scattering geometries exist such that the coincidence detection of the scattered photons shows perfect constructive or destructive (Hong-Ou-Mandel) interference, both for symmetric and antisymmetric wavepackets. To assess the impact of matter dispersion/losses on quantum interference effects accompanying photons detection, we analyze the scattering of narrow band two-photon wavepackets by high-index dielectric lossy spheres. We show that classical Mie resonance peaks, due to their Fano-like traits, yield very strong constructive and destructive interference effects, occurring when the wavepacket carrier frequency matches the resonance frequency and side Fano dip frequency, respectively. In addition we consider the overall scattering probabilities of two, one and zero photons and we prove that, at the Mie resonance frequencies, they exhibit quantum interference effects which are extremely sensitive to the spectral symmetry of the input wavepacket, thus suggesting an efficient spectral technique assisted by matter losses to identify entanglement.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sricharan Raghavan-Chitra, Arghadip Koner, Joel Yuen-Zhou</p>
            <p>Classical linear optics posits that at sufficiently low intensities, light propagation in dielectric media is governed solely by their linear susceptibilities. Here, we demonstrate a departure from this paradigm in high-Q microresonators, where prolonged photon confinement enables rare quantum electrodynamical (QED) events, mediated by the quantum vacuum, to embed distinctive Raman signatures of the coupled analyte into the resonator's linear transmission spectrum despite their absence from the linear susceptibility. We further show that increasing the amount of adsorbed analyte amplifies these Raman fingerprints well above typical noise floors, rendering them experimentally accessible with state-of-the-art photonic architectures and detection schemes. This novel weak-coupling cavity-QED effect offers unique routes to harness extended photon lifetimes and constrained geometries for leveraging vacuum fluctuations in next-generation photonic technologies for chemical and biological sensing and high-precision optical spectroscopy.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement Preservation and Clauser-Horne Nonlocality in Electromagnetically Induced Transparency Quantum Memories</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Po-Han Tseng, Yong-Fan Chen</p>
            <p>Entanglement preservation in noisy quantum memories represents a long-standing conceptual challenge in quantum information science. While experiments have shown that electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) memories can store entangled photons, a rigorous theoretical demonstration of whether such memories fundamentally preserve nonlocality has remained elusive. Here we develop a unified open-system model that combines the dark-state polariton formalism with reduced density operator theory to describe the retrieved photon state under realistic ground state decoherence. The analysis reveals that decoherence inevitably transforms an initially pure Bell state into a mixed state and predicts a critical storage efficiency threshold of 89.7%. Above this threshold, the retrieved photon violates the Clauser-Horne inequality, confirming the preservation of nonlocal quantum correlations, whereas below it, nonlocality is lost. This work provides the first systematic theoretical proof that EIT quantum memories can in principle preserve entanglement and nonlocality, thereby resolving a fundamental question in the physics of quantum information storage.</p>

We then show how switching the role of data and ancilla qubits allows a pair of Floquet codes to be implemented simultaneously. We describe how to perform a logical Clifford gate to entangle a pair of Floquet codes that are implemented in this way. Finally, we show how switching between the color code and a pair of Floquet codes, via a depth-two circuit followed by mid-circuit measurement, can be used to perform syndrome extraction for the color code.</p>

            <h2>Nonlinear quantum evolution of a dissipative superconducting qubit</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Orion Lee, Qian Cao, Yogesh N. Joglekar, Kater Murch</p>
            <p>Unitary and dissipative models of quantum dynamics are linear maps on the space of states or density matrices. This linearity encodes the superposition principle, a key feature of quantum theory. However, this principle can break down in effective non-Hermitian dynamics arising from postselected quantum evolution. We theoretically characterize and experimentally investigate this breakdown in a dissipative superconducting transmon circuit. Within the circuit's three-level manifold, no-jump postselection generates an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian governing the excited two-level subspace and an anti-Hermitian nonlinearity. We prepare different initial states and use quantum state tomography to track their evolution under this effective, nonlinear Hamiltonian. By comparing the evolution of a superposition-state to a superposition of individually-evolved basis states, we test linearity and observe clear violations which we quantify across the exceptional-point (EP) degeneracy of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. We extend the analysis to density matrices, revealing a breakdown in linearity for the two-level subspace while demonstrating that linearity is preserved in the full three-level system. These results provide direct evidence of nonlinearity in non-Hermitian quantum evolution, highlighting unique features that are absent in classical non-Hermitian systems.</p>

            <h2>Heuristic Quantum Advantage with Peaked Circuits</h2>

            <p>We design and demonstrate heuristic quantum advantage with peaked circuits (HQAP circuits) on Quantinuum's System Model H2 quantum processor. Through extensive experimentation with state-of-the-art classical simulation strategies, we identify a clear gap between classical and quantum runtimes. Our largest instance involves all-to-all connectivity with 2000 two-qubit gates, which H2 can produce the target peaked bitstring directly in under 2 hours. Our extrapolations from leading classical simulation techniques such as tensor networks with belief propagation and Pauli path simulators indicate the same instance would take years on exascale systems (Frontier, Summit), suggesting a potentially exponential separation. This work marks an important milestone toward verifiable quantum advantage, as well as providing a useful benchmarking protocol for current utility-scale quantum hardware. We sketch our protocol for designing these circuits and provide extensive numerical results leading to our extrapolation estimates. Separate from our constructed HQAP circuits, we prove hardness on a decision problem involving generic peaked circuits. When both the input and output bitstrings of a peaked circuit are unknown, determining whether the circuit is peaked constitutes a QCMA-complete problem, meaning the problem remains hard even for a quantum polynomial-time machine under commonly accepted complexity assumptions. Inspired by this observation, we propose an application of the peaked circuits as a potentially quantum-safe encryption scheme~\cite{chen2016report,kumar2020post,joseph2022transitioning,dam2023survey}. We make our peaked circuits publicly available and invite the community to try additional methods to solve these circuits to see if this gap persists even with novel classical techniques.</p>

The results establish the first unified baseline of photonic machine-learning performance, revealing complementary strengths between variational, hardware-native, and hybrid approaches. This challenge also underscores the importance of open, reproducible experimentation and interdisciplinary collaboration, highlighting how shared benchmarks can accelerate progress in quantum-enhanced learning.

            <p>Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states play a central role in quantum computing and communication protocols, as a typical multipartite entanglement resource. This work introduces an efficient enumeration and simulation method for circuits that preserve and distill noisy GHZ states, significantly reducing the simulation complexity of a gate on $n$ qubits, from exponential $O(2^n)$ for standard state-vector methods or $O(n)$ for Clifford circuits, to a constant $O(1)$ for the method presented here. This method has profound implications for the design of quantum networks, where preservation and purification of entanglement with minimal resource overhead is critical. In particular, we demonstrate the use of the new method in an optimization procedure enabled by the fast simulation, that discovers GHZ distillation circuits far outperforming the state of the art. Fine-tuning to arbitrary noise models is possible as well. We also show that the method naturally extends to graph states that are local Clifford equivalent to GHZ states.</p>

            <p>Displacement sensing is a fundamental task in metrology. However, the development of quantum-enhanced sensors that fully utilize the available degrees of freedom in many-body quantum systems remains an outstanding challenge. We propose novel many-body displacement sensing schemes that use spin-dependent squeezed (SDS) states -- hybrid spin-boson states whose bosonic squeezed quadrature is conditioned on an auxiliary spin. We prove that SDS states are \emph{optimal}, i.e. their quantum Cramér-Rao bound saturates the Heisenberg limit. We propose explicit measurement sequences that can be readily implemented in systems such as trapped ions. We also introduce a scalable state-preparation protocol and numerically demonstrate the preparation of $8.7$~dB of spin-dependent squeezing $15$ times faster than the standard approach using second-order sidebands in trapped ions. The potential applications of our sensing protocols range from measuring single-photon scattering to searches for dark matter.</p>

            <p>We study the emergence of quantum memory effects in a spin-boson system at finite temperature driven by an external time-periodic force. Quantifying memory effects by the trace-distance based measure for non-Markovianity and performing numerical simulations employing the hierarchical equations of motion approach, we find a pronounced peak structure when plotting the non-Markovianity measure as a function of the driving amplitude. This distinctive feature is interpreted using Floquet theory and the Floquet-Lindblad master equation, associating the peaks with the degeneracies of the quasienergy spectrum which lead to a strong enhancement of the relaxation times of the system. These results suggest strategies for the efficient control of non-Markovianity in open quantum systems by periodic driving.</p>

Using numerical simulations, we quantify the degradation in performance due to disorder and identify single-qubit rotations, two-qubit entangling gates, and quantum information transport as particularly susceptible. To address this challenge, we rely on pulse optimization schemes, and, in particular, on the GRAPE (Gradient Ascent Pulse Engineering) algorithm. Our results demonstrate that, even for realistic levels of disorder, optimized pulse sequences can achieve high-fidelity operations, exceeding 99.9% for the three quantum operations, restoring reliable universal quantum logic and robust information flow. These findings highlight pulse optimization as a powerful strategy to enhance the resilience to disorder of solid-state globally-driven quantum computing platforms.</p>

            <p>The active stabilization of polarization channels is a task of growing importance as quantum networks move to deployed demonstrations over existing fiber infrastructure. However, the uniquely strict requirements for high-fidelity qubit transmission complicate the extent to which classical solutions may apply to future quantum networks, particularly in terms of recognizing noise sources present in low-flux, nonunitary channels. Here we introduce a novel in situ benchmarking approach that augments a classical polarization tracking system, limited to unitary correction, with simultaneously transmitted quantum light for ancilla-assisted process tomography of the full quantum map. Implemented in a local-area quantum network, our method uses the reconstructed map both to validate the classical compensation and to expose noise sources it fails to capture. A sliding measurement window that continuously updates the estimated quantum process further increases sensitivity to rapid channel fluctuations. Our results should unlock new opportunities for in situ channel characterization in quantum-classical coexistence networks.</p>

By explicitly retaining the quantum coherence of the coupled electron-phonon-photon dynamics, our model describes a two-stage buildup of entanglement - first between signal and idler photons and subsequently between idler photons mediated by material coherence. This coherent light-matter interaction imprints the internal dynamics of the medium onto the interferometer output, yielding phase-sensitive interference that enables indirect readout of terahertz-band signal modes via near-infrared detection. The results reveal a route toward entanglement-assisted terahertz sensing and establish a general framework for treating nonlinear quantum media as active components in interferometric architectures.</p>

A traditional $\pi/2$-pulse Raman beam is employed to render a small momentum transfer at the initial state.

The final information will be detected from the transmission spectrum of a probe light to obviate the measurement of florescence signal. An effective amplification of the order of $10^3$ about the momentum offset is achieved in our simulation employing $Cs$ atoms with current experimental condition. Our proposal offers a cost-effective, high-accuracy measurement and readout strategy for LPAI. Furthermore, the strategy makes the physical setup much simpler and more compact offering new direction towards portable sensitive LPAI.</p>

Efficiently recycling these states to extract entanglement resources such as genuine multipartite entanglement or Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pairs is essential for optimizing network performance. Here, we develop a tripartite entanglement distillation scheme using an eight-photon quantum platform, demonstrating entanglement superactivation phenomena which are unique to multipartite systems. We successfully generate a three-photon genuinely entangled state from two bi-separable states via local operations and classical communication, demonstrating superactivation of genuine multipartite entanglement. Furthermore, we extend our scheme to generate a three-photon state capable of extracting an Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pair from two initial states lacking this capability, revealing a previously unobserved entanglement superactivation phenomenon.

Through mean-field analysis and numerical simulations based on the open-system discrete truncated Wigner approximation, we demonstrate that Rydberg excitations exhibit predator-prey cycles on microsecond timescales. We show that quantum coherence drives spontaneous symmetry breaking, while long-range interactions stabilize global oscillations against quantum-noise-induced desynchronization.

            <p>Simulation of the time-dynamics of fermionic many-body systems has long been predicted to be one of the key applications of quantum computers. Such simulations -- for which classical methods are often inaccurate -- are critical to advancing our knowledge and understanding of quantum chemistry and materials, underpinning a wide range of fields, from biochemistry to clean-energy technologies and chemical synthesis. However, the performance of all previous digital quantum simulations has been matched by classical methods, and it has thus far remained unclear whether near-term, intermediate-scale quantum hardware could offer any computational advantage in this area. Here, we implement an efficient quantum simulation algorithm on Quantinuum's System Model H2 trapped-ion quantum computer for the time dynamics of a 56-qubit system that is too complex for exact classical simulation. We focus on the periodic spinful 2D Fermi-Hubbard model and present evidence of spin-charge separation, where the elementary electron's charge and spin decouple. In the limited cases where ground truth is available through exact classical simulation, we find that it agrees with the results we obtain from the quantum device. Employing long-range Wilson operators to study deconfinement of the effective gauge field between spinons and the effective potential between charge carriers, we find behaviour that differs from predictions made by classical tensor network methods. Our results herald the use of quantum computing for simulating strongly correlated electronic systems beyond the capacity of classical computing.</p>

            <p>Twin-Field Quantum Key Distribution (TF-QKD) has emerged as a potential protocol for long distance secure communication, overcoming the rate-distance limitations of conventional quantum key distribution without requiring trusted repeaters. By having two parties transmit phase encoded weak coherent pulses (WCP) to an untrusted central node, the TF-QKD exploits single-photon interference to achieve secret key rates scaling as square-root of channel length, enabling quantum-secured communication over unprecedented distances. This survey provides a comprehensive survey of TF-QKD, covering the original protocol, its fundamental principles, and key-rate derivation. We discuss major TF-QKD variants, including Phase-Matching QKD and Sending-or-Not-Sending QKD, with various improved versions. We compare their performance, implementation trade-offs, protocol-specific vulnerabilities, and countermeasures. The survey summarizes security proofs ranging from asymptotic decoy-state analyses to finite-key composable frameworks, experimental milestones, technological enablers, and practical deployment challenges. Finally, we outline open problems in the field and present a roadmap for integrating TF-QKD into scalable quantum networks, underscoring its central role in the future quantum internet.</p>

            <p>Quantum key distribution is a key application of quantum mechanics, shaping the future of privacy and secure communications. Many protocols require single photons, often approximated by strongly attenuated laser pulses. Here, we harness the emission of a quantum dot embedded in a micropillar and explore a hybrid approach where the information is encoded on a mixture of single photons and laser pulses. We derive a phenomenological analysis of the configuration where both sources of light are mixed incoherently to perform the BB84 protocol, showing nearly perfect matching between theory and experiment. This provides a flexible technology compensating limited collected brightnesses of single-photon sources as well as a thorough investigation of single-photon statistics advantage scenarios over Poisson-distributed statistics. Explicitly, our model highlights an efficiency threshold for unconditional advantage of single photons over laser along with insights on the interplay between single-photon purity and collected brightness in the performances of BB84.</p>

            <p>Quantum batteries (QBs) exploit collective quantum resources to surpass the limits of classical energy storage and power delivery. We analyze $N$-qubit cavity-coupled QBs governed by Dicke and Tavis--Cummings models under Gaussian driving and open-system dynamics. Finite-size scaling laws $\mathcal{O}(N)\!\sim\!N^{\alpha}$ demonstrate an optimal region of relaxation and dephasing where coherent driving stabilizes entanglement entropy growth for thermodynamic observables (maximum energy $E_{\mathrm{max}}$, charging time $\tau$, and maximum power $\bar{P}_{\mathrm{max}}$) and for qubit and cavity entanglement entropies. The Dicke model exhibits entropy-suppressed extensive behavior, while the Tavis--Cummings model achieves super-extensive scaling with $\alpha_{E_{\mathrm{max}}}\!\in\![1.08,1.26]$, $\alpha_{\tau}\!\approx\!-0.49$, $\alpha_{\bar{P}_{\mathrm{max}}}\!\in\![1.57,1.73]$, supported by qubit-cavity entanglement. We demonstrate that dissipation can act as a stabilizer source, yielding scaling benchmarks that are relevant to several experimental platforms. Our findings connect entanglement, dissipation-enhanced scaling laws and superabsorption, outlining a pathway towards scalable quantum batteries offering practical quantum advantage.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shaojun Wu, Shan Jin, Abolfazl Bayat, Xiaoting Wang</p>
            <p>Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) face an inherent trade-off between expressivity and trainability: deeper circuits can represent richer states but suffer from noise accumulation and barren plateaus, while shallow circuits remain trainable and implementable but lack expressive power. Here, we propose a general framework to address this challenge by enhancing the VQA performance with a specially designed input state constructed using a linear combination technique. This approach systematically modified the set of states reachable by the original circuit, enhancing accuracy while preserving efficiency. We provide a rigorous proof that such framework increases the expressive capacity of any given VQA ansatz, and demonstrate its broad applicability across different ansatz families. As applications, we apply the method to ground-state preparation of the transverse-field Ising, cluster-Ising, and Fermi-Hubbard models, achieving consistently higher accuracy under the same gate budget compared with standard VQAs. These results highlight input-state design as a powerful complement to circuit design in realizing VQAs that are both expressive and trainable.</p>

            <p>We present a practical design framework for high-fidelity quantum control in coupled Kerr-nonlinear oscillators, directly addressing the challenge of spectral crowding. We show that systematic spectral degeneracies, which hinder selective addressing, are a direct consequence of rational Kerr-nonlinearity ratios ($K_1/K_2$). Our solution is a universal architectural principle: engineer this ratio to be a complex rational value, approximating an incommensurate number to systematically eliminate parasitic resonances. Using a Magnus expansion, we derive a complete effective Hamiltonian, including all Stark-shift corrections, to accurately target transitions. We numerically validate this framework by demonstrating protocols for the deterministic synthesis of NOON states, and high-photon-number Fock states (e.g., $n=4$), achieving ideal fidelities exceeding $\mathcal{F}>99.9\%$. The protocols are shown to be robust against environmental decay and thermal effects. This work provides an architectural blueprint for bosonic processors in circuit QED and establishes foundational principles that could inform future designs of multi-mode quantum systems.</p>

            <p>A synchronously pumped optical parametric oscillator (SPOPO) operating at 93 MHz is used to generate squeezed states at 1035 nm. The system features a counter-propagating beam at the same wavelength as the quantum state, which simultaneously actively stabilizes the cavity and, after transmission, acts as the local oscillator for homodyne detection. By deriving the local oscillator directly from the SPOPO cavity, the setup establishes an intrinsically excellent spatial mode overlap and high interference visibility, forming a distinctive self-referenced architecture. Two spatial light modulators enable precise spectral shaping of both the pump and the local oscillator in amplitude and phase, allowing investigation of the spectral properties of the generated states. The versatility of the setup further allows exploration of different SPOPO configurations, including regimes with varied finesse and escape efficiency. Representative measurements, including homodyne traces and squeezing levels as functions of pump power and local oscillator bandwidth, demonstrate the performance of the system. Theoretical simulations based on a multimode singular-value-decomposition model reproduce well the measured dependence of squeezing on pump power and LO bandwidth, confirming the accuracy of the description and the robustness of the setup. Measured squeezing levels up to -3.3 dB are achieved, corresponding to -5.7 dB at SPOPO output, evidencing the robustness and versatility of this platform for stable pulsed squeezed-light generation and advanced quantum optical applications.</p>

We evaluate the robustness of our scheme against additional noise sources, including decoherence and beamsplitter infidelity, through theoretical analysis and numerical simulations. In practice, the key requirements, namely high-Q superconducting radio-frequency cavities that support long integration times, high-fidelity microwave beamsplitters, and universal cavity control, are already available on current experimental platforms, making the protocol experimentally feasible.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shozab Qasim, Jason Pollack</p>
            <p>Quantum error correction, thermalization, and quantum chaos are fundamental aspects of quantum many-body physics that have each developed largely independently, despite their deep conceptual overlap. In this work, we establish a precise link between all three in systems that satisfy the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) and exhibit a well-defined hierarchy of time scales between dissipation and scrambling. Building on the ETH matrix ansatz and the structure of the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC), we show that the chaos bound directly constrains the error of an approximate quantum error-correcting code. This establishes a quantitative relation between information scrambling, thermalization, and correctability. Furthermore, we derive bounds on dynamical fluctuations around the infinite-time average and on fluctuation-dissipation relations, expressed in terms of both the code error and the Lyapunov exponent. Our results reveal how the limits of quantum chaos constrain information preservation in thermalizing quantum systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lin Htoo Zaw, Jiajie Guo, Qiongyi He, Shuheng Liu, Matteo Fadel</p>
            <p>Many existing genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) witnesses for continuous-variable (CV) quantum systems typically rely on quadrature measurements, which is challenging to implement in platforms where the CV degrees of freedom can be indirectly accessed only through qubit readouts. In this work, we propose methods to implement GME witnesses through phase-space measurements in state-of-the-art experimental platforms, leveraging controlled Gaussian unitaries readily available in qubit-CV architectures. Based on two theoretical results showing that sufficient Wigner negativity can certify GME, we present five concrete implementation schemes using controlled parity, displacement, and beamsplitter operations. Our witnesses can detect paradigmatic GME states like the Dicke and multipartite $N00N$ states, which include the W states as a special case, and GHZ-type entangled cat states. We analyze the performance of these witnesses under realistic noise conditions and finite measurement resolution, showing their robustness to experimental imperfections. Crucially, our implementations require exponentially fewer measurement settings than full tomography, with one scheme requiring only a single measurement on auxiliary modes. The methods are readily applicable to circuit/cavity quantum electrodynamics, circuit quantum acoustodynamics, as well as trapped ions and atoms systems, where such dichotomic phase-space measurements are already routinely performed as native readouts.</p>

            <p>Distributed quantum computing (DQC) provides a promising route toward scalable quantum computation, where entanglement-assisted LOCC and circuit knitting represent two complementary approaches. The former deterministically realizes nonlocal operations but demands extensive entanglement resources, whereas the latter requires no entanglement yet suffers from exponential sampling overhead. Here, we propose a hybrid framework that integrates these two paradigms by performing circuit knitting assisted with a limited amount of entanglement. We establish a general theoretical formulation that yields lower bounds on the optimal sampling overhead and present a constructive protocol demonstrating that a single shared Bell pair can reduce the overhead to the asymptotic limit of standard circuit knitting without requiring classical communication. This hybrid approach enhances both sampling and entanglement efficiency, enabling more resource-practical implementations of distributed quantum computation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruicheng Bao, Chaoqun Du, Zhiyu Cao, Zhonghuai Hou</p>
            <p>We establish a general lower bound for the entropy production rate (EPR) based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence and the Logarithmic-Sobolev constant that characterizes the time-scale of relaxation. This bound can be considered as an enhanced second law of thermodynamics. When applied to thermal relaxation, it reveals a universal trade-off relation between the dissipation rate and the intrinsic relaxation timescale. From this relation, a thermodynamic upper bound on the relaxation time between two given states emerges, acting as an inverse speed limit over the entire time region. We also obtain a quantum version of this upper bound, which is always tighter than its classical counterpart, incorporating an additional term due to decoherence. Remarkably, we further demonstrate that the trade-off relation remains valid for any generally non-Markovian coarse-grained relaxation dynamics, highlighting its significant applications in thermodynamic inference. This trade-off relation is a new tool in inferring EPRs in molecular dynamics simulations and practical experiments.</p>

            <p>We quantize punctured plane, $X=\mathbb{R}^2-\{0\}$, employing Isham's group theoretic quantization procedure. After sketching out a brief review of group theoretic quantization procedure, we apply the quantization scheme to the phase space, $M=X \times \R^2$, corresponding to the punctured plane, $X$. Particularly, we find the canonical Lie group, $\mathscr{G}$, corresponding to the phase space, $M=X \times \R^2$, to be $\mathscr{G} = \R^2 \rtimes (SO(2)\times \R^+)$. We establish an algebra homomorphism between the Lie algebra corresponding to the canonical group, $\mathscr{G} = \R^2 \rtimes (SO(2)\times \R^+)$, and the smooth functions, $f\in C^{\infty}(M)$, in the phase space, $M=X \times \R^2$. Making use of this homomorphism and unitary representation of the canonical group, $\mathscr{G} = \R^2 \rtimes (SO(2)\times \R^+)$, we deduce a quantization map that maps a subspace of classical observables, $f\in C^{\infty}(M)$, to self-adjoint operators on the Hilbert space, $\mathscr{H}$, which is the space of all square integrable functions on $X=\mathbb{R}^2-\{0\}$ with respect to the measure $\dd \mu = \dd \phi\dd\rho/(2\pi\rho)$.</p>

            <p>We study quantum quench dynamics in (1+1)-dimensional critical systems, starting from thermal pure states called crosscap states, and evolving them under spatially inhomogeneous Hamiltonians. The spatial inhomogeneity is introduced through a deformation of the Hamiltonian, expressed as linear combinations of the generators of the $SL^{(q)}(2,\mathbb{R})$ subalgebra of the Virasoro algebra. We analyze the free massless Dirac fermion theory and holographic conformal field theory as prototypical examples of integrable and non-integrable dynamics. Consistent with general expectations, "Möbius-type" deformations lead to thermalization in the non-integrable case, and to periodic revivals in the integrable one. In contrast, "sine-square-type" and "displacement-type" deformations prevent both thermalization and scrambling, instead producing late-time, graph-like entanglement patterns. These patterns emerge from the interplay between the deformed Hamiltonian and the crosscap initial state and appear to be universal: they are determined solely by the deformation profile while remaining largely insensitive to microscopic details. Finally, we perform a holographic calculation in three-dimensional gravity using AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, which reproduces the main features of our (1+1)-dimensional study.</p>

            <p>Zero Added Loss Multiplexing (ZALM) offers broadband, per channel heralded EPR pairs, with a rich parameter space that allows its performance to be tailored for specific applications. We present a modular ZALM simulator that demonstrates how design choices affect output rate and fidelity.

Physics based models capture Hong Ou Mandel (HOM) visibility, insertion loss, detector efficiency, gate errors, and attenuation. Using this tool, we map trade offs among fidelity, link distance, and entangled pairs per use, and show how SPDC bandwidth and DWDM grid spacing steer performance. Using the default configuration settings, average fidelity emains constant at 0.8 but the ebit rate decreases from 0.0175 at the source to 0.0 at 50 km; narrowing the SPDC degeneracy bandwidth increases the ebit rate significantly without affecting fidelity. The simulator enables codesign of source, filtering, and feedforward settings for specific quantum memories and integrates as a building block for end to end quantum network studies.</p>

This task can be viewed as a language generation task that bridges natural language, human knowledge, and programming logic. However, it remains underexplored in domains that require interaction with hardware devices, such as quantum programming, where human coders write Python code that is executed on a quantum computer. To address this gap, we introduce QCoder Benchmark, an evaluation framework that assesses LLMs on quantum programming with feedback from simulated hardware devices. Our benchmark offers two key features. First, it supports evaluation using a quantum simulator environment beyond conventional Python execution, allowing feedback of domain-specific metrics such as circuit depth, execution time, and error classification, which can be used to guide better generation. Second, it incorporates human-written code submissions collected from real programming contests, enabling both quantitative comparisons and qualitative analyses of LLM outputs against human-written codes. Our experiments reveal that even advanced models like GPT-4o achieve only around 18.97% accuracy, highlighting the difficulty of the benchmark. In contrast, reasoning-based models such as o3 reach up to 78% accuracy, outperforming averaged success rates of human-written codes (39.98%).

            <p>We investigate the Josephson effect in a two-dimensional superconducting system with a smoothly and periodically varying order parameter. The order parameter is modulated along one direction while remaining uniform in the perpendicular direction, leading to a spatially periodic superconducting phase. We show that the periodicity of the order parameter determines the winding number of the eigenfunctions, which serves as a topological characterization of the system. The winding number is calculated analytically and visualized through the trajectory of the corresponding three-dimensional Bloch vector. By solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation, we obtain both plane-wave solutions describing bulk states and exponentially localized solutions that correspond to edge modes. The analytic bulk-edge connection is employed to identify the conditions under which the edge states emerge from the bulk spectrum. We find that the winding numbers depend on the boundary conditions, which differ between the plane-wave and exponential solutions. These results establish a direct connection between the spatial modulation of the order parameter, the topological structure of the eigenstates, and the emergence of edge modes in periodically modulated Josephson systems.</p>

In contrast to the standard situation involving no S-O coupling, the system exhibits long-ranged Casimir forces both in two and three dimensions ($d=2$ and $d=3$). We identify the relevant scaling variable involving the ratio $D/\nu$ of the separation between the confining walls $D$ and the S-O coupling magnitude $\nu$. We derive and discuss the corresponding scaling functions for the Casimir energy. In all the considered cases the resulting Casimir force is attractive and the S-O coupling $\nu$ has impact on its magnitude. In $d=3$ the exponent governing the decay of the Casimir force becomes modified by the presence of the S-O coupling, and its value depends on the orientation of the confining walls relative to the plane defined by the Rashba coupling. In $d=2$ the obtained Casimir force displays singular behavior in the limit of vanishing $\nu$</p>

We formulate our results as a mathematical theorem and work out two examples showing how they can be applied to stochastic Floquet dynamics under coarse-grained and quantum collisional models.</p>

            <p>The spin-boson (SB) model is a standard prototype for quantum dissipation, which we generalize in this work, to explore the dissipative effects on a one-dimensional spin-orbit (SO) coupled particle in the presence of a sub-ohmic bath. We analyze this model by extending the well-known variational polaron approach, revealing a localization transition accompanied by an intriguing change in the spectrum, for which the doubly degenerate minima evolves to a single minimum at zero momentum as the system-bath coupling increases. For translational invariant system with conserved momentum, a continuous magnetization transition occurs, whereas the ground state changes discontinuously. We further investigate the transition of the ground state in the presence of harmonic confinement, which effectively models a quantum dot-like nanostructure under the influence of the environment. In both the scenarios, the entanglement entropy of the spin-sector can serve as a marker for these transitions. Interestingly, for the trapped system, a cat-like superposition state corresponds to maximum entanglement entropy below the transition, highlighting the relevance of the present model for studying the effect of decoherence on intra-particle entanglement in the context of quantum information processing.</p>

            <p>Instanton theory has arisen as a practical tool for calculating tunneling splittings in molecular systems. Un- fortunately, the original formulation of instanton theory fundamentally breaks down when trying to calculate the level splitting in asymmetric double wells, as there is no imaginary-time periodic orbit connecting the two non-degenerate minima. We have therefore developed a new formulation of instanton theory based on a projected flux correlation function that is applicable to these asymmetric systems. Comparison with exact quantum-mechanical results in one- and two-dimensional models demonstrates that it has a reasonably high accuracy, similar to that reported for instanton theory in the symmetric case. The theory is then applied to study tunneling between non-degenerate minima in the biomolecule $\alpha$-fenchol, for which we find good agree- ment with experiment. Finally, we use the connection to instanton rate theory, which is also derived from flux correlation functions, to discuss the often misunderstood relationship between tunneling splittings and reaction rate constants.</p>

            <h2>Wavefront Curvature and Transverse Atomic Motion in Time-Resolved Atom Interferometry: Impact and Mitigation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Noam Mouelle, Jeremiah Mitchell, Valerie Gibson, Ulrich Schneider</p>
            <p>Time-resolved atom interferometry, as employed in applications such as gravitational wave detection and searches for ultra-light dark matter, requires precise control over systematic effects. In this work, we investigate phase noise arising from shot-to-shot fluctuations in the atoms' transverse motion in the presence of the wavefront curvature of the interferometer beam, and analyse its dependence on the laser-beam geometry in long-baseline, large-momentum-transfer atom interferometers. We use a semi-classical framework to derive analytical expressions for the effective phase perturbation in position-averaged measurements and validate them using Monte Carlo simulations. Applied to 100-m and 1-km atom gradiometers representative of next-generation experiments, the model shows that configurations maximizing pulse efficiency also amplify curvature-induced phase noise, requiring micron-level control of the atom cloud's centre-of-mass position and sub-micron-per-second control of its centre-of-mass velocity to achieve sub-$10^{-5}$ rad phase stability. Alternative beam geometries can suppress this noise by up to two orders of magnitude, but at the cost of reduced pulse efficiency. To address this limitation, we propose a mitigation strategy based on position-resolved phase-shift readout, which empirically learns and corrects the wavefront-induced bias from measurable quantities such as the phase-shift gradient and final cloud position. This approach restores high-sensitivity operation in the maximum-pulse-efficiency configuration without detailed beam characterisation, providing a practical route towards next-generation, time-resolved atom interferometers operating at the $10^{-5}$ rad noise level.</p>

            <p>We study wavepackets that propagate across (a) topological interfaces in quantum spin systems exhibiting non-invertible symmetries and (b) duality defects coupling dual theories. We demonstrate that the transmission is always perfect, and that a particle traversing the interface is converted into a nonlocal string-like excitation. We give a systematic way of constructing such a defect by identifying its Hilbert space with the virtual bond dimension of the matrix product operator representing defect lines. Our work both gives an operational meaning to topological interfaces, and provides a lattice analogue of recent results solving the monopole paradox in quantum field theory.</p>

            <h2>Non-Heisenbergian quantum mechanics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> MohammadJavad Kazemi, Ghadir Jafari</p>
            <p>Relaxing the postulates of an axiomatic theory is a natural way to find more general theories, and historically, the discovery of non-Euclidean geometry is a famous example of this procedure. Here, we use this way to extend quantum mechanics by ignoring the heart of Heisenberg's quantum mechanics -- We do not assume the existence of a position operator that satisfies the Heisenberg commutation relation, $[\hat x,\hat p]=i\hbar$. The remaining axioms of quantum theory, besides Galilean symmetry, lead to a more general quantum theory with a free parameter $l_0$ of length dimension, such that as $l_0 \to 0$ the theory reduces to standard quantum theory. Perhaps surprisingly, this non-Heisenberg quantum theory, without a priori assumption of the non-commutation relation, leads to a modified Heisenberg uncertainty relation, $\Delta x \Delta p\geq \sqrt{\hbar^2/4+l_0^2(\Delta p)^2}$, which ensures the existence of a minimal position uncertainty, $l_0$, as expected from various quantum gravity studies. By comparing the results of this framework with some observed data, which includes the first longitudinal normal modes of the bar gravitational wave detector AURIGA and the $1S-2S$ transition in the hydrogen atom, we obtain upper bounds on the $l_0$.</p>

            <h2>Imposing Constraints on Driver Hamiltonians and Mixing Operators: From Theory to Practical Implementation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hannes Leipold, Federico M. Spedalieri, Stuart Hadfield, Eleanor Rieffel</p>
            <p>Driver Hamiltonians and Mixing Operators that satisfy constraints is an important part of ansatz construction for many quantum algorithms. In this manuscript, we give general algebraic expressions for finding Hamiltonian terms and analogously unitary primitives, that satisfy constraint embeddings and use these to give complexity characterizations of the related problems. Finding operators that enforce classical constraints is proven to be NP-Complete in the general case; we also give an algorithmic procedure with worse-case polynomial runtime to find any operators with a constant locality bound - a useful result since many constraints imposed admit local operators to enforce them in practice. We then give algorithmic procedures to turn these algebraic primitives into Hamiltonian drivers and unitary mixers that can be used for Constrained Quantum Annealing (CQA) and Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA) constructions by tackling practical problems related to finding an appropriate set of reduced generators and defining corresponding drivers and mixers accordingly. We apply these concepts to the construction of ansaetze for 1-in-3 SAT instances. We consider the ordinary x-mixer QAOA, a novel QAOA approach based on the maximally disjoint subset, and a QAOA approach based on the disjoint subset as well as higher order constraint satisfaction terms. We empirically benchmark these approaches on instances sized between $ 12 $ and $ 22 $, showing the best relative performance for the tailored ansaetze and that exponential curve fits on the results are consistent with a quadratic speedup by utilizing alternative ansaetze to the X-mixer. We provide general algorithmic prescriptions for finding driver or mixing terms that satisfy embedded constraints that can be utilized to probe quantum speedups for constraints problems with linear, quadratic, or even higher order polynomial constraints.</p>

            <p>Rapid progress in quantum technology has transformed quantum computing and quantum information science from theoretical possibilities into tangible engineering challenges. Breakthroughs in quantum algorithms, quantum simulations, and quantum error correction are bringing useful quantum computation closer to fruition. These remarkable achievements have been facilitated by advances in quantum characterization, verification, and validation (QCVV). QCVV methods and protocols enable scientists and engineers to scrutinize, understand, and enhance the performance of quantum information-processing devices. In this tutorial, we review the fundamental principles underpinning QCVV, and introduce a diverse array of QCVV tools used by quantum researchers. We define and explain QCVV's core models and concepts -- quantum states, measurements, and processes -- and illustrate how these building blocks are leveraged to examine a target system or operation. We survey and introduce protocols ranging from simple qubit characterization to advanced benchmarking methods. Along the way, we provide illustrated examples and detailed descriptions of the protocols, highlight the advantages and disadvantages of each, and discuss their potential scalability to future large-scale quantum computers.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrew Vlasic, Payal Solanki, Anh Pham</p>
            <p>This manuscript introduces a computationally efficient method to calculate the nonlinearity of a quantum feature map, as well as a method for determining whether a quantum feature map will have a high concentration of quantum states. The technique analyzes quantum operators, through an extension of the functions of von Neumann entropy and state-transition pseudo-entropy, by deriving a method to extract the entropy of an operator. The technique is denoted as operator pseudo-entropy, is rigorously derived, and is generally complex valued; as with state-transition pseudo-entropy, complex values contain a lot of information about entanglement or nonlinearity. The characteristics of a class of quantum feature maps are rigorously shown. The operator pseudo-entropy is illuminated through experiments and compared with von Neumann entropy and state-transition pseudo-entropy. We end the manuscript with open questions and potential directions for further research.</p>

            <p>In quantum computing, Trotter estimates are critical for enabling efficient simulation of quantum systems and quantum dynamics, help implement complex quantum algorithms, and provide a systematic way to control approximate errors.

We solve an open problem in our earlier paper on the existence of second-order Trotter formula error estimation in Jordan-Banach algebras. To illustrate our work, we apply our formula to simulate Trotter-factorized spins, and show improvements in the approximations. Our approach demonstrates the adaptability of Trotter product formulas and estimates to non-associative settings, which offers new insights into the applications of Jordan algebra theory to operator dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Quantum transistors for heat flux in and out of working substance parts: harmonic vs transmon and Kerr environs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Deepika Bhargava, Paranjoy Chaki, Aparajita Bhattacharyya, Ujjwal Sen</p>
            <p>Quantum thermal transistors have been widely studied in the context of three-qubit systems, where each qubit interacts separately with a Markovian harmonic bath. Markovianity is an assumption that is imposed on a system if the environment loses its memory within short while, while non-Markovianity is a general feature, inherently present in a large fraction of realistic scenarios. Instead of Markovian environments, here we propose a transistor in which the interaction between the working substance and an environment comprising of an infinite chain of qutrits is based on periodic collisions. We refer to the device as a working-substance thermal transistor, since the model focuses on heat currents flowing in and out of each individual qubit of the working substance to and from different parts of the system and environment. We find that the transistor effect prevails in this apparatus and we depict how the amplification of heat currents depends on the temperature of the modulating environment, the system-environment coupling strength and the interaction time. We further show that there exists a non-zero amplification even if one of the environments, that is not the modulating one, is detached from the system. Additionally, the environment, being comprised of three-level systems, allows us to consider the effects of frail perturbations in the energy-spacings of the qutrit, leading to a non-linearity in the environment. We consider non-linearities that are either of transmon- or of Kerr-type. We find parameter ranges where there is a significant amplification for both transmon- and Kerr-type non-linearities in the environment. Finally, we detect the non-Markovianity induced in the system from a non-monotonic behavior of the amplification observed with respect to time, and quantify it using the distinguishability-based measure of non-Markovianity.</p>

            <p>We present a class of linear correlation witnesses that detects bound entanglement within a three-party prepare-and-measure scenario with four-dimensional quantum messages. We relate the detection power of our witnesses for two-ququart Bloch-product-diagonal states to that of the computable cross norm-realignment (CCNR) criterion. Several bound entangled states in four or even higher dimensions, including those which are useful in metrology, can exceed the separable bound computed by reliable iterative methods. In particular, we show that a prominent two-ququart bound entangled state with a positive partial transpose (PPT) can be mixed with up to $40\%$ isotropic noise and still be detected as entangled by our prepare-and-measure witness. Furthermore, our witnesses appear to be experimentally practical, requiring only the use of qubit rotations on Alice's and Bob's sides and product qubit measurements with binary outcomes on Charlie's side.</p>

            <p>We report the observation of unconventional transport phenomena in a spin-1 model that supports a tower of quantum many-body scars, and we discuss their properties uncovering their peculiar nature. In quantum many-body systems, the late-time dynamics of local observables are typically governed by conserved operators with local densities, such as energy and magnetization. In the model under investigation, however, there is an additional dynamical symmetry restricted to the subspace of the Hilbert space spanned by the quantum many-body scars. The latter significantly slows the decay of autocorrelation functions of certain coherent states of quantum many-body scars and is responsible for the unconventional form of transport that we detect numerically. We show that excited states with energy close to that of the quantum many-body scars play a crucial role in sustaining the transport. Finally, we propose a generalized eigenstate thermalization hypothesis to describe specific properties of states with energy close to the scars.</p>

            <p>Quantum-chemical simulations are essential for predicting energies of chemical reactions. Accurately solving the many-body Schrödinger equation for reagent and product states of most relevant chemical process is, however, unfeasible. Quantum computing offers a pathway for predicting energies of correlated electronic systems with localized interactions. Here, we apply a quantum embedding approach for investigating oxygen reduction reactions at the electrode surface in Lithium batteries, a representative example of energetic analysis in localized chemical reactions. We employ an Active Space Selection method based on Density Difference Analysis for identifying the orbitals involved in the reaction. Leveraging the Local Unitary Cluster Jastrow ansatz for state preparation, the active-space orbitals are then processed on a quantum computer. As quantum algorithms, we use Sample-based Quantum Diagonalization, SQD, and its extended version, Ext-SQD, which integrates electronic excitations into the quantum-selected electronic configuration subspace. The largest configurations are represented by quantum circuits mapped onto 80 qubits of an IBM Heron R2 quantum processing unit. For up to 12 orbitals, we are able to benchmark the quantum-computed reaction energies against results obtained with Complete Active Space Configuration Interaction. For benchmarking results in active spaces as large as 32 orbitals, we resort to Heat-Bath Configuration Interaction and Coupled Cluster Singles and Doubles calculations, respectively. At 27 orbitals, the Ext-SQD results exhibit prediction accuracy improvements with regard to the standard, quantum-chemical reference methods that remain computationally feasible at that scale. The results indicate the potential of sample-based quantum diagonalization for performing high-accuracy reaction modeling in chemistry and materials science.</p>

            <p>Quantum entanglement, in the form of spin squeezing, is known to improve the sensitivity of atomic instruments to static or slowly-varying quantities. Sensing transient events presents a distinct challenge, requires different analysis methods, and has not been shown to benefit from entanglement in practically-important scenarios such as spin-precession magnetometry (SPM). Here we adapt estimation control techniques introduced in [PRX Quantum 6, 030331 (2025)] to the experimental setting of SPM and analogous techniques. We demonstrate that real-time tracking of fluctuating fields benefits from measurement-induced spin squeezing and that quantum limits dictated by decoherence are within reach of today's experiments. We illustrate this quantum advantage by single-shot tracking, within the coherence time of a spin-precession magnetometer, of a magnetocardiography signal overlain with broadband noise.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) materials hosting color centers and spin defects are emerging as key platforms for quantum technologies. However, the impact of reduced dimensionality on the spin-lattice relaxation time ($T_1$) of embedded defect spins -- critical for quantum applications -- remains largely unexplored. In this study, we present a systematic first-principles investigation of the negatively charged boron-vacancy (V$_{\text{B}}^-$) defect in monolayer boron nitride (BN), as well as in AA$^\prime$-stacked hexagonal BN (hBN) and ABC-stacked rhombohedral BN (rBN). Our results reveal that the $T_1$ times of V$_{\text{B}}^-$ in monolayer BN and hBN are nearly identical at room temperature. Surprisingly, despite the symmetry reduction in rBN opening additional spin relaxation channels, V$_{\text{B}}^-$ exhibits a longer $T_1$ compared to hBN. We attribute this effect to the stiffer out-of-plane phonon modes in rBN, which activate spin-phonon relaxation at reduced strength. These findings suggest that V$_{\text{B}}^-$ in rBN offers enhanced spin coherence properties, making it a promising candidate for quantum technology applications.</p>

            <p>High-energy particle collisions can convert energy into matter through the inelastic production of new particles. Quantum computers are an ideal platform for simulating the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of collisions and the formation of subsequent many-particle states. In this work, evidence for inelastic particle production is observed in one-dimensional Ising field theory using IBM's quantum computers. The scattering experiment is performed on 104 qubits of ibm_marrakesh and uses up to 5,589 two-qubit gates to access the post-collision dynamics. An outgoing heavy particle produced in the collision is identified from the skewness of the measured energy density. Integral to this computation is a new quantum algorithm for preparing the initial state (wavepackets) of a quantum field theory scattering simulation. This method efficiently prepares wavepackets by extending recent protocols for creating W states with mid-circuit measurement and feedforward. The required circuit depth is independent of wavepacket size and spatial dimension, representing a superexponential improvement over previous methods. Our wavepacket preparation algorithm can be applied to a wide range of lattice models and is demonstrated in one-dimensional Ising field theory, scalar field theory, the Schwinger model and two-dimensional Ising field theory.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenqi Tong, H. Alaeian, F. Robicheaux</p>
            <p>We study the steady-state behavior of the open Dicke model, which describes the collective interaction of $N$ spin-$1/2$ particles with a lossy, quantized cavity mode and exhibits a superradiant phase transition above a critical light-matter coupling. While the standard model conserves total spin, Kirton and Keeling \cite{PhysRevLett.118.123602} demonstrated that even infinitesimal homogeneous local dephasing destroys this phase transition, and that local atomic decay can restore it. We analyze this interplay using degenerate perturbation theory across subspaces of fixed total spin, $S$. For coupling strengths above the threshold, there exists a critical spin value $S_c$ such that the superradiant phase transition occurs only for $S>S_c$. The perturbative approach captures how weak dephasing and decay induce mixing between different $S$-subspaces, yielding a steady-state spin distribution whose width scales as $1/\sqrt{N}$. This framework requires only the first and second moments and can be implemented via different methods that can yield these two moments (for example, the 2nd-cumulant approach), circumventing the need for full density matrix calculations. These results bridge the quantum Rabi model and Dicke physics, elucidate the roles of dephasing and decay in collective quantum effects, and apply broadly to open quantum systems with degenerate steady states.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rizwan Abbas, Ali Raza Mirza, Adam Zaman Chaudhry</p>
            <p>Quantum sensors allow us to measure weak oscillating fields with incredible precision. One common approach is to use the time evolution of a single two-level system (or a qubit) in conjunction with applied control pulses to measure the oscillating field. For high-frequency fields, the time interval required between the applied pulses decreases, meaning that errors due to the finite width of the pulses can become important. This paper presents an alternative scheme that does not rely on applying pulses with short time intervals. Our scheme uses two interacting qubits. In the presence of an oscillating field, the interaction strength changes. The oscillating field can be estimated by measuring the change in this interaction strength. We quantify the precision of this estimate by calculating the Fisher information. We show the effect of noise on our scheme and discuss how control pulses can be applied to mitigate the impact of noise. Importantly, the time interval between these pulses need not be very short.</p>

            <p>In quantum logic spectroscopy, internal transitions of trapped ions and molecules can be probed by measuring the motional displacement caused by an applied light field of variable frequency. This provides a solution to ``needle in a haystack'' problems, such as the search for narrow clock transitions in highly charged ions, recently discussed by S. Chen et al. (Phys. Rev. Applied 22, 054059). The main bottleneck is the search speed over a frequency bandwitdh, which can be increased by enhancing the sensitivity of displacement detection. In this work, we explore two complementary improvements: the use of squeezed motional states and optimal statistical postprocessing of data using a hypothesis testing framework. We demonstrate that each method independently provides a substantial boost to search speed. Their combination effectively mitigates state preparation and measurement errors, improving the search speed by an order of magnitude and fully leveraging the quantum enhancement offered by squeezing.</p>

            <p>The quantum or quantum field theory concept of a complex wave function is useful for understanding the information transport in classical statistical generalized Ising models. We relate complex conjugation to the discrete transformations charge conjugation ($C$), parity ($P$) and time reversal ($T$). A subclass of generalized Ising models are probabilistic cellular automata (PCA) with deterministic updating and probabilistic initial conditions. Simple two-dimensional PCA correspond to discretized quantum field theories for Majorana--Weyl, Weyl or Dirac fermions. Momentum and energy are conserved statistical observables. For PCA describing free massless fermions we investigate the vacuum and field operators for particle excitations. For the correlation function one finds the Lorentz-invariant Feynman propagator of quantum field theory. Furthermore, these automata admit probabilistic boundary conditions that correspond to thermal equilibrium with the quantum Fermi--Dirac distribution. PCA with updating sequences of propagation and interaction steps can realize a rich variety of discrete quantum field theories for fermions with interactions. For information theory the quantum formalism for PCA sheds new light on deterministic computing or signal processing with probabilistic input.</p>

In its quantum extension -- quantum reservoir computing (QRC) -- these principles are applied to quantum systems, whose rich dynamics broadens the landscape of information processing. In classical RC, optimal performance is typically achieved at the ``edge of chaos," the boundary between order and chaos. Here, we identify its quantum many-body counterpart using the QRC implemented on the celebrated Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. Our analysis reveals substantial performance enhancements near two distinct characteristic ``edges": a temporal boundary defined by the Thouless time, beyond which system dynamics is described by random matrix theory, and a parametric boundary governing the transition from integrable to chaotic regimes. These findings establish the ``edge of many-body quantum chaos" as a design guideline for QRC.</p>

            <p>We study the variational optimization of entangled probe states for quantum sensing tasks involving the estimation of a structured linear function of local phase parameters. Specifically, we consider scenarios where each qubit in a spin-1/2 array accumulates a phase phi_i = alpha_i * theta, with a known weight vector alpha, reducing the task to single-parameter estimation of theta. Using parameterized quantum circuits composed of dipolar-interacting gates and global rotations, we optimize probe states with respect to the Classical Fisher Information (CFI) using a gradient-free evolutionary strategy. We benchmark the optimized circuits for two relevant cases: (i) uniform encoding, where all qubits contribute equally to the phase function, and (ii) a custom encoding where a central qubit dominates the weight vector. In both cases, the optimized probe states approach the respective entanglement-enhanced (EE) limits dictated by the encoding structure.

            <p>We study algorithmic error mitigation via Richardson-style extrapolation for quantum simulations of open quantum systems modelled by the Lindblad equation. Focusing on two specific first-order quantum algorithms, we perform a backward-error analysis to obtain a step-size expansion of the density operator with explicit coefficient bounds. These bounds supply the necessary smoothness for analyzing Richardson extrapolation, allowing us to bound both the deterministic bias and the shot-noise variance that arise in post-processing. For a Lindblad dynamics with generator bounded by $l$, our main theorem shows that an $n=\Omega (\log(1/\varepsilon))$-point extrapolator reduces the maximum circuit depth needed for accuracy $\varepsilon$ from polynomial $\mathcal{O} ((lT)^{2}/\varepsilon)$ to polylogarithmic $\mathcal{O} ((lT)^{2} \log l \log^2(1/\varepsilon))$ scaling, an exponential improvement in~$1/\varepsilon$, while keeping sampling complexity to the standard $1/\varepsilon^2$ level, thus extending such results for Hamiltonian simulations to Lindblad simulations. Several numerical experiments illustrate the practical viability of the method.</p>

            <h2>Generation of Quantum Entanglement in Autonomous Thermal Machines: Effects of Non-Markovianity, Hilbert Space Structure, and Quantum Coherence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Achraf Khoudiri, Khadija El Anouz, Abderrahim El Allati</p>
            <p>We present a theoretical investigation of entanglement generation in an external quantum system via interaction with a quantum autonomous thermal machine (QATM) under non-Markovian dynamics. The QATM, composed of two qubits each coupled to independent thermal reservoirs, interacts with an external system of two additional qubits. By analyzing the Hilbert space structure, energy level configurations, and temperature gradients, we define a common interaction between the QATM qubits and the external system qubits, which allows the definition of two thermodynamic cycles (A and B) governed by virtual temperatures and energy-conserving transitions. We demonstrate that the QATM can act as a structured reservoir capable of inducing non-Markovian memory effects, as highlighted by negative entropy production rates. Using mutual information and concurrence, we show that entanglement is generated only under cycle A, which is associated with stronger non-Markovian behavior and higher coherence correlations. Our results demonstrate that temperature differences, Hilbert space structure, and coherence serve as quantum resources for controlling and enhancing entanglement in quantum thermodynamic settings, with parameters consistent with experimental superconducting qubit platforms.</p>

            <p>We derive the quantum potential directly from the material derivative of the osmotic velocity and formulate a two-fluid model that reproduces the Madelung equations. Interactions between the fluids are included but remain secondary. The framework is generalized to incorporate electromagnetic fields, yielding self-consistent description of both the Schrodinger and Klein-Gordon equations. Extenstion to the relativistic Klein-Gordon case demonstrates the model's flexibility and applicability to spinless relativistic quantum systems. This approach unifies hydrodynamic, kinematic, and electromagnetic perspectives, providing a clear physical interpretation of quantum potentials and forces and offering a versatile platform for modeling complex quantum systems in both non-relativistic and relativistic regimes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ilyoung Jung, Frank G. Schroer, Philip Richerme</p>
            <p>Laser-driven operations are a common approach for engineering one- and two-qubit gates in trapped-ion arrays. Measuring key parameters of these lasers, such as beam sizes, intensities, and polarizations, is central to predicting and optimizing gate speeds and stability. Unfortunately, it is challenging to accurately measure these properties at the ion location within an ultra-high vacuum chamber. Here, we demonstrate how the ions themselves may be used as sensors to directly characterize the laser beams needed for quantum gate operations. Making use of the four-photon Stark Shift effect in $^{171}$Yb$^+$ ions, we measure the profiles, alignments, and polarizations of the lasers driving counter-propagating Raman transitions. We then show that optimizing the parameters of each laser individually leads to higher-speed Raman-driven gates with smaller susceptibility to errors. Our approach demonstrates the capability of trapped ions to probe their local environments and to provide useful feedback for improving system performance.</p>

            <h2>Correcting quantum errors using a classical code and one additional qubit</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tenzan Araki, Joseph F. Goodwin, Zhenyu Cai</p>
            <p>Classical error-correcting codes are powerful but incompatible with quantum noise, which includes both bit-flips and phase-flips. We introduce Hadamard-based Virtual Error Correction (H-VEC), a protocol that empowers any classical bit-flip code to correct arbitrary Pauli noise with the addition of only a single ancilla qubit and two layers of controlled-Hadamard gates. Through classical post-processing, H-VEC virtually filters the error channel, projecting the noise into pure Y-type errors that are subsequently corrected using the classical code's native decoding algorithm. We demonstrate this by applying H-VEC to the classical repetition code. Under a code-capacity noise model, the resulting protocol not only provides full quantum protection but also achieves an exponentially stronger error suppression (in distance) than the original classical code. The improvements over the surface code are even more pronounced, while using far fewer qubits, simpler checks, and straightforward decoding. There are some limitations to the technique, most notably that H-VEC introduces a sampling overhead due to its post-processing nature. Nonetheless, it represents a fundamentally novel hybrid quantum error correction and mitigation framework that redefines the trade-offs between physical hardware requirements and classical processing for error suppression.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sujay Mondal, Siddhartha Dutta, Abhijit Bandyopadhyay</p>
            <p>Classical simulation of open quantum system dynamics remains challenging due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space, the need to accurately capture dissipation and decoherence, and the added complexity of memory effects in the non-Markovian regime. We develop an efficient algorithm for simulating both Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics in large one-dimensional quantum systems. Extending the Tensor Jump Method, which combines TDVP-based tensor-network evolution with a Suzuki-Trotter decomposition of stochastic trajectories, our approach incorporates time-dependent decay rates-treating positive rates as time-inhomogeneous Markovian processes and negative rates via the Influence Martingale formalism to unravel time-local non-Markovian dynamics. This resource-efficient framework enables scalable simulations of open-system dynamics in the non-Markovian regime, as demonstrated for a one-dimensional transverse-field Ising chain comprising up to 100 spin qubits.</p>

            <p>Scaling quantum computers from a few qubits to large numbers remains one of the critical challenges in realizing practical quantum advantage. Multi-core quantum architectures have emerged as a promising solution, enabling scalability through distributed quantum processing units (QPUs) interconnected via classical and quantum links. However, the bottleneck of wired connections persists, as densely packed wired interconnects, both vertically across temperature stages and horizontally within the same layer, introduce spatial constraints, power dissipation, and latency, which could hinder performance as the number of QPUs increases. To overcome these limitations, this work proposes a cryo-compatible on-chip differential dipole antenna operating at 28 GHz to enable short-range wireless communication within a quantum computer cryostat. Temperature-dependent material properties are incorporated to accurately capture antenna behavior at 4 K. Moreover, by embedding the antenna in a realistic cryostat structure, we evaluate the feasibility of antenna operation within the cryogenic environment. The proposed antenna achieves a reflection coefficient of -20.8 dB in free space and -18.38 dB within the cryostat, demonstrating efficient impedance matching.</p>

            <p>Monogamy of entanglement, which limits how entanglement can be shared among multiple parties, is a fundamental feature underpinning the privacy of quantum communication. In this work, we introduce a novel operational framework to quantify the unshareability or unextendibility of entanglement via a virtual state-extension task. The virtual extension cost is defined as the minimum simulation cost of a randomized protocol that reproduces the marginals of a $k$-extension. For the important family of isotropic states, we derive an exact closed-form expression for this cost. Our central result establishes a tight connection: the virtual extension cost of a maximally entangled state equals the optimal simulation cost of universal virtual quantum broadcasting. Using the algebra of partially transposed permutation matrices, we obtain an analytical formula and construct an explicit quantum circuit for the optimal broadcasting protocol, thereby resolving an open question in quantum broadcasting. We further relate the virtual extension cost to the absolute robustness of unextendibility, providing it with a clear operational meaning, and show that the virtual extension cost is an entanglement measure that bounds distillable entanglement and connects to logarithmic negativity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shailendra K. Saxena, Sudipta Bera, Tatyana Bendikov, Israel Pecht, Mordechai Sheves, David Cahen</p>
            <p>The integration of functional proteins into solid-state electronic devices remains a central challenge in molecular bioelectronics due to the fragile nature of protein structures and their complex charge-transport behaviour. Here, we present a robust crosswire evaporated top-contact device based on bacteriorhodopsin (bR) single bilayers (SBL), configured as Au/Cys/bR(SBL)/eC/Au (simplified as Au/bR/eC). The evaporated carbon (eC) top electrode forms a conformal, non-invasive contact that suppresses filament formation and ensures electrical integrity across the cross-wire intersecting area (about 200 micron^2). Structural and spectroscopic analyses confirm that the solid-state bR films maintain the native absorption spectrum and have functional photocycle activity after electrode deposition, implying that their native conformation is not significantly affected. Remarkably, electron transport (ETp) through the 9 nm bR-SBL junctions is temperature-independent within 300 K - 10 K, excluding thermally activated hopping, while the length is incompatible with coherent tunneling. Under green illumination, the junctions exhibit a reversible, photo-induced current enhancement (Jgreen/Jdark = 2), ascribed to light-driven conformational changes rather than direct photoexcitation. The Au/bR/eC architecture thus establishes a thermally non-activated, conformationally mediated transport mechanism via a stable, cryo-compatible solid-state protein junction. This work provides a scalable platform for integrating light-responsive biomolecules into future bio-optoelectronic and neuromorphic devices.</p>

            <h2>Scaling up the transcorrelated density matrix renormalization group</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benjamin Corbett, Akimasa Miyake</p>
            <p>Explicitly correlated methods, such as the transcorrelated method which shifts a Jastrow or Gutzwiller correlator from the wave function to the Hamiltonian, are designed for high-accuracy calculations of electronic structures, but their application to larger systems has been hampered by the computational cost. We develop improved techniques for the transcorrelated density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), in which the ground state of the transcorrelated Hamiltonian is represented as a matrix product state (MPS), and demonstrate large-scale calculations of the ground-state energy of the two-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model. Our developments stem from three technical inventions: (i) constructing matrix product operators (MPO) of transcorrelated Hamiltonians with low bond dimension and high sparsity, (ii) exploiting the entanglement structure of the ground states to increase the accuracy of the MPS representation, and (iii) optimizing the non-linear parameter of the Gutzwiller correlator to mitigate the non-variational nature of the transcorrelated method. We examine systems of size up to $12 \times 12$ lattice sites, four times larger than previous transcorrelated DMRG studies, and demonstrate that transcorrelated DMRG yields significant improvements over standard non-transcorrelated DMRG for equivalent computational effort. Transcorrelated DMRG reduces the error of the ground state energy by $3\times$-$17 \times$, with the smallest improvement seen for a small system at half-filling and the largest improvement in a dilute closed-shell system.</p>

            <p>We explore the finite-density phase diagram of the single-flavour Gross-Neveu-Wilson (GNW) model using matrix product state (MPS) simulations. At zero temperature and along the symmetry line of the phase diagram, we find a sequence of inhomogeneous ground states that arise through a real-space version of the mechanism of Hilbert-space fragmentation. For weak interactions, doping the symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase of the GNW model leads to localized charges or holes at periodic arrangements of immobile topological defects separating the fragmented subchains: a topological crystal. Increasing the interactions, we observe a transition into a parity-broken phase with a pseudoscalar condensate displaying a modulated periodic pattern. This soliton lattice is a sequence of topological charges corresponding to anti-kinks, which also bind the doped fermions at their respective centers. Out of this symmetry line, we show that quasi-spiral profiles appear with a characteristic wavevector set by the density $k = 2{\pi}{\rho}$, providing non-perturbative evidence for chiral spirals beyond the large-N limit. These results demonstrate that various exotic inhomogeneous phases can arise in lattice field theories, and motivate the use of quantum simulators to confirm such QCD-inspired phenomena in future experiments.</p>

            <p>Thermoelectricity is generally understood as a classical effect emerging from energy-dependent transport asymmetries. Here we uncover a purely quantum mechanism, where a superconducting S-I-S' tunnel junction in thermal equilibrium develops a nonlinear bipolar thermoelectric response owing to the dynamical Coulomb blockade and the emission-absorption imbalance of a cold electromagnetic bath. Two representative environments are analysed, revealing Seebeck coefficients up to 100 $\mu$V/K for realistic junction parameters. Because the response directly reflects the spectral properties of the surrounding environment, our results suggest that bipolar quantum thermoelectricity could provide a new route for spectroscopic sensing of electromagnetic modes and for designing low-temperature thermoelectric devices with environmentally engineered performance.</p>

            <p>To evaluate a quantum circuit on a quantum processor, one must find a mapping from circuit qubits to processor qubits and plan the instruction execution while satisfying the processor's constraints. This is known as the qubit mapping and routing (QMR) problem. High-quality QMR solutions are key to maximizing the utility of scarce quantum resources and minimizing the probability of logical errors affecting computation. The challenge is that the landscape of quantum processors is incredibly diverse and fast-evolving. Given this diversity, dozens of papers have addressed the QMR problem for different qubit hardware, connectivity constraints, and quantum error correction schemes by a developing a new algorithm for a particular context. We present an alternative approach: automatically generating qubit mapping and routing compilers for arbitrary quantum processors. Though each QMR problem is different, we identify a common core structure-device state machine-that we use to formulate an abstract QMR problem. Our formulation naturally leads to a compact domain-specific language for specifying QMR problems and a powerful parametric algorithm that can be instantiated for any QMR specification. Our thorough evaluation on case studies of important QMR problems shows that generated compilers are competitive with handwritten, specialized compilers in terms of runtime and solution quality.</p>

            <p>The dynamical evolution of neutrino flavor in supernovae can be modeled by an all-to-all spin Hamiltonian with random couplings. Simulating such two-local Hamiltonian dynamics remains a major challenge, as methods with controllable accuracy require circuit depths that increase at least linearly with system size, exceeding the capabilities of current quantum devices. The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis predicts that these systems should thermalize, a behavior confirmed in small-scale classical simulations. In this work, we investigate flavor thermalization in much larger systems using random quantum circuits as an empirical tool to emulate the non-local dynamics, and demonstrate that the thermal behavior can be reproduced using a depth independent of the system size. By simulating dynamics of over one hundred qubits, we find that the thermalization time grows approximately as the square root of the system size, consistent with predictions from semi-classical methods. Beyond this specific result, our study illustrates that near-term quantum devices are useful tools to test and validate empirical classical methods. It also highlights a new application of random circuits in physics, providing insight into complex many-body dynamics that are classically intractable.</p>

This model unifies concepts from quantum Brownian motion and polaron physics, providing a general platform to study phase-mediated dissipation and decoherence beyond the linear-response regime. Despite its nonlinear system-bath coupling, the Gaussian nature of the environment allows a nonperturbative and non-Markovian treatment of PCL model within the algebra of dissipative quasiparticles. We obtain an exact closed-form equation of motion for the reduced density operator, and numerical simulations reveal distinctive dynamical behaviors that deviate markedly from those predicted by the conventional Caldeira-Leggett model.</p>

By providing an efficient light-matter interface within a compact architecture, they serve as highly efficient quantum nodes with strong potential for scalable quantum network.

These challenges significantly hinder the practical implementation of ion trap systems integrated with micro-cavities. To overcome these limitations, we present the design and fabrication of metal-shielded micro-cavity mirrors, enabling the stable realization of ion trap systems integrated with micro cavities. Using this method, we constructed a needle ion trap integrated with fiber Fabry-Perot cavity and successfully achieved stable trapping of a single ion within the cavity. The measured ion heating rate was reduced by more than an order of magnitude compared with unshielded configurations.

This leads to mode-mode spectral subsplittings, where collectivity arises not only from the atom number but also from the ability to tune modes of different cavities independently. Our results establish spatially engineered atomic ensembles as a pathway to selective photon transfer between modes and precise control of many-body complexity.</p>

Optomechanically induced transparency (OMIT) can be utilized to sense the gravitational interactions between test masses and source masses. Specifically, the relative variation in the height of the OMIT peak, expressed as $|1 + re^{i\phi}|^2 - 1$, where $r$ represents the ratio of the amplitude of the gravitational driving force to the radiation pressure force of the probe tone, and $\phi$ denotes their phase difference, can reach up to 2.3\% under plausible experimental conditions. This work may facilitate cavity-optomechanical probing of gravitational coupling between milligram-scale mechanical oscillators, a mass regime where quantum and gravitational effects converge.</p>

            <h2>Quantum-group-invariant $D^{(2)}_{n+1}$ models: Bethe ansatz and finite-size spectrum</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Holger Frahm, Sascha Gehrmann, Rafael I. Nepomechie, Ana L. Retore</p>
            <p>We consider the quantum integrable spin chain models associated with the Jimbo R-matrix based on the quantum affine algebra $D^{(2)}_{n+1}$, subject to quantum-group-invariant boundary conditions parameterized by two discrete variables $p=0,\dots, n$ and $\varepsilon = 0, 1$. We develop the analytical Bethe ansatz for the previously unexplored case $\varepsilon = 1$ with any $n$, and use it to investigate the effects of different boundary conditions on the finite-size spectrum of the quantum spin chain based on the rank-$2$ algebra $D^{(2)}_3$. Previous work on this model with periodic boundary conditions has shown that it is critical for the range of anisotropy parameters $0<\gamma<\pi/4$, where its scaling limit is described by a non-compact CFT with continuous degrees of freedom related to two copies of the 2D black hole sigma model. The scaling limit of the model with quantum-group-invariant boundary conditions depends on the parameter $\varepsilon$: similarly as in the rank-$1$ $D^{(2)}_2$ chain, we find that the symmetry of the lattice model is spontaneously broken, and the spectrum of conformal weights has both discrete and continuous components, for $\varepsilon=1$. For $p=1$, the latter coincides with that of the $D^{(2)}_2$ chain, which should correspond to a non-compact brane related to one black hole CFT in the presence of boundaries. For $\varepsilon=0$, the spectrum of conformal weights is purely discrete.</p>

            <h2>Dynamic RIS-Assisted THz Quantum Networks: Joint Optimization of Entanglement Generation and Fidelity under Channel Impairments</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shakil Ahmed</p>
            <p>Quantum networks (QNs) supported by terahertz (THz) wireless links present a transformative alternative to fiber-based infrastructures, particularly in mobile and infrastructure-scarce environments. However, signal attenuation, molecular absorption, and severe propagation losses in THz channels pose significant challenges to reliable quantum state transmission and entanglement distribution. To overcome these limitations, we propose a dynamic reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted wireless QN architecture that leverages adaptive RIS elements capable of switching between active and passive modes based on the incident signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). These dynamic RIS elements enhance beamforming control over amplitude and phase, enabling robust redirection and compensation for THz-specific impairments. We develop a detailed analytical model that incorporates key physical layer phenomena in THz quantum links, including path loss, fading, thermal noise, and alignment variations. A secure optimization framework is formulated to jointly determine RIS placement and entanglement generation rate (EGR) allocation, while satisfying fidelity, security, and fairness constraints under diverse quality of service (QoS) demands. The model also includes an exploration of side-channel vulnerabilities arising from dynamic RIS switching patterns. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed architecture yields up to 87\% fidelity enhancement and 65\% fairness improvement compared to static RIS baselines, while maintaining robustness under realistic THz channel conditions. These results underscore the promise of dynamic RIS technology in enabling scalable and adaptive quantum communications over wireless THz links.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Mechanics of Stochastic Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yurang (Randy)Kuang</p>
            <p>We develop a fundamental framework for the quantum mechanics of stochastic systems (QMSS), showing that classical discrete stochastic processes emerge naturally as perturbations of the quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO). By constructing exact perturbation potentials that transform QHO eigenstates into stochastic representations, we demonstrate that canonical probability distributions, including Binomial, Negative Binomial, and Poisson, arise from specific modifications of the harmonic potential. Each stochastic system is governed by a Count Operator (N), with probabilities determined by squared amplitudes in a Born-rule-like manner. The framework introduces a complete operator algebra for moment generation and information-theoretic analysis, together with modular projection operators (R_M) that enable finite-dimensional approximations supported by rigorous uniform convergence theorems. This mathematical structure underpins True Uniform Random Number Generation (TURNG) [Kuang, Sci. Rep., 2025], eliminating the need for external whitening processes. Beyond randomness generation, the QMSS framework enables quantum probability engineering: the physical realization of classical distributions through designed quantum perturbations. These results demonstrate that stochastic systems are inherently quantum-mechanical in structure, bridging quantum dynamics, statistical physics, and experimental probability realization.</p>

            <h2>Anti-concentration is (almost) all you need</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Markus Heinrich, Jonas Haferkamp, Ingo Roth, Jonas Helsen</p>
            <p>Until very recently, it was generally believed that the (approximate) 2-design property is strictly stronger than anti-concentration of random quantum circuits, mainly because it was shown that the latter anti-concentrate in logarithmic depth, while the former generally need linear depth circuits. This belief was disproven by recent results which show that so-called relative-error approximate unitary designs can in fact be generated in logarithmic depth, implying anti-concentration. Their result does however not apply to ordinary local random circuits, a gap which we close in this paper, at least for 2-designs. More precisely, we show that anti-concentration of local random quantum circuits already implies that they form relative-error approximate state 2-designs, making them equivalent properties for these ensembles. Our result holds more generally for any random circuit which is invariant under local (single-qubit) unitaries, independent of the architecture.</p>

            <h2>Apparent Universal Behavior in Second Moments of Random Quantum Circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Belkin, James Allen, Bryan K. Clark</p>
            <p>Just how fast does the brickwork circuit form an approximate 2-design? Is there any difference between anticoncentration and being a 2-design? Does geometry matter? How deep a circuit will I need in practice? We tell you everything you always wanted to know about second moments of random quantum circuits, but were too afraid to compute. Our answers generally take the form of numerical results for up to 50 qubits. Our first contribution is a strategy to determine explicitly the optimal experiment which distinguishes any given ensemble from the Haar measure. With this formula and some computational tricks, we are able to compute $t = 2$ multiplicative errors exactly out to modest system sizes. As expected, we see that most families of circuits form $\epsilon$-approximate $2$-designs in depth proportional to $\log n$. For the 1D brickwork, we work out the leading-order constants explicitly. For graphs, we find some exceptions which are much slower, proving that they require at least $\Omega(n^2)$ gates. This answers a question asked by ref. 1 in the negative. We explain these exceptional architectures in terms of connectedness. Based on this intuition we conjecture universal upper and lower bounds for graph-sampled circuit ensembles. For many architectures, the optimal experiment which determines the multiplicative error corresponds exactly to the collision probability (i.e. anticoncentration). However, we find that the star graph anticoncentrates much faster than it forms an $\epsilon$-approximate $2$-design. Finally, we show that one needs only ten to twenty layers to construct an approximate $2$-design for realistic parameter ranges. This is a large constant-factor improvement over previous constructions. The parallel complete-graph architecture is not quite the fastest scrambler, partially resolving a question raised by ref. 2.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Himanshu Badhani, Dhanuja G S, Siddhartha Das</p>
            <p>We introduce the resource-theoretic free energy of a quantum channel as the maximal work extractable from the channel as its output equilibrates to a thermal state and its reference system remains locally intact. It is proportional to the relative entropy between the given channel and the absolutely thermal channel. It attains a clear operational meaning as twice the asymptotic rates of athermality distillation and formation under Gibbs preserving superchannels, which map one absolutely thermal channel to another for a given bath, thereby revealing the asymptotic reversibility of the resource theory of athermality for quantum channels. Consequently, we establish that the optimal extractable work in converting one channel to another through the asymptotic athermality distillation and formation tasks equals the difference in their free energies. We call this optimal work the thermodynamic work capacity of channel conversion. Quantum information processing and computing fundamentally concern the manipulation and transformation of quantum channels, which encompass quantum states, their transformations, and measurements. A quantitative characterization of the optimal thermodynamic work gain or expenditure in quantum information processing constitutes a key step toward formulating thermodynamics of quantum processes.</p>

            <p>Harnessing topological effects offers a promising route to protect quantum states of light from imperfections, potentially enabling more robust platforms for quantum information processing. This capability is particularly relevant for active photonic circuits that generate quantum light directly on-chip. Here, we explore topological effects on photon-pair generation via spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) in nonlinear waveguide arrays, both theoretically and experimentally. A systematic comparison of homogeneous, trivial, and topological Su-Schrieffer-Heeger arrays reveals that only the topological configuration preserves a stable SPDC resonance spectrum under disorder in the tunnel couplings, with fluctuations in the resonance position reduced by more than one order of magnitude. An analytical model supports our experimental observations by linking this robustness to the band-structure properties of the interacting modes. These findings establish quadratic nonlinear waveguide arrays as a promising platform to explore the interplay of nonlinearity, topology, and disorder in quantum photonic circuits.</p>

            <p>Theoretical studies and experiments in the last six years have revealed the potential for novel behaviours and functionalities in device physics through the synthetic engineering of negatively-curved spaces. For instance, recent developments in hyperbolic band theory have unveiled the emergence of higher-dimensional eigenstates -- features fundamentally absent in conventional Euclidean systems. At the same time, superconducting quantum circuits have emerged as a leading platform for quantum analogue emulations and digital simulations in scalable architectures. Here, we introduce a scalable superconducting circuit framework for the analogue quantum emulation of tight-binding models on hyperbolic and kagome-like lattices. Using this approach, we experimentally realize three distinct lattices, including, for the first time to our knowledge, a hyperbolic lattice whose unit cell resides on a genus-3 Riemann surface. Our method encodes the hyperbolic metric directly into capacitive couplings between high-quality superconducting resonators, enabling tenable reproduction of spectral and localization properties while overcoming major scalability and spectral resolution limitations of previous designs. These results set the stage for large-scale experimental studies of hyperbolic materials in condensed matter physics and lay the groundwork for realizing hyperbolic quantum processors, with potential implications for both fundamental physics and quantum computing</p>

We investigate the T centre, a telecommunications-band emitter in silicon, and find a strong isotope dependence of its excited-state lifetime. In particular, the lifetime of the deuterium T centre is over five times longer than the common protium variant. Through explicit first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that this dramatic difference is due to a reduction in the carbon-hydrogen local vibrational mode energy, which suppresses non-radiative decay. Our results imply that the deuterium T centre approaches unit quantum efficiency, enabling more efficient single-photon sources, quantum memories, and entanglement generation.</p>

In this work, we extend the concept of Clifford transformations to fermionic systems.

Wang</p>
            <p>Periodically driven quantum many-body systems exhibit a wide variety of exotic nonequilibrium phenomena and provide a promising pathway for quantum applications. A fundamental challenge for stabilizing and harnessing these highly entangled states of matter is system heating by energy absorption from the drive. Here, we propose and demonstrate a disorder-free mechanism, dubbed Fock space prethermalization (FSP), to suppress heating. This mechanism divides the Fock-space network into linearly many sparse sub-networks, thereby prolonging the thermalization timescale even for initial states at high energy densities. Using 72 superconducting qubits, we observe an FSP-based time-crystalline order that persists over 120 cycles for generic initial Fock states. The underlying kinetic constraint of approximately conserved domain wall (DW) numbers is identified by measuring site-resolved correlators. Further, we perform finite-size scaling analysis for DW and Fock-space dynamics by varying system sizes, which reveals size-independent regimes for FSP-thermalization crossover and links the dynamical behaviors to the eigenstructure of the Floquet unitary. Our work establishes FSP as a robust mechanism for breaking ergodicity, and paves the way for exploring novel nonequilibrium quantum matter and its applications.</p>

            <p>High-fidelity qubit readout is a fundamental requirement for practical quantum computing systems. In this work, we investigate methods to enhance the measurement fidelity of flux qubits via a quantum flux parametron-mediated readout scheme. Through theoretical modeling and numerical simulations, we analyze the impact of different measurement bases on fidelity in single-qubit and coupled two-qubit systems. For single-qubit systems, we show that energy bases consistently outperform flux bases in achieving higher fidelity. In coupled two-qubit systems, we explore two measurement models: sequential and simultaneous measurements, both aimed at reading out a single target qubit. Our results indicate that the highest fidelity can be achieved either by performing sequential measurement in a dressed basis over a longer duration or by conducting simultaneous measurement in a bare basis over a shorter duration. Importantly, the sequential measurement model consistently yields more robust and higher fidelity readouts compared to the simultaneous approach. These findings quantify achievable fidelities and provide valuable guidance for optimizing measurement protocols in emerging quantum computing architectures.</p>

            <p>The Unruh effect predicts that an accelerated observer perceives the Minkowski vacuum as a thermal bath, but its direct observation requires extreme accelerations beyond current experimental reach. Foundational theory [Olson & Ralph, Phys. Rev.

Here, we report a proof-of-principle demonstration of the timelike Unruh effect in a quantum system of trapped ion, where a two-level spin serves as the detector and is temporally coupled to the ambient field encoded in the ion's vibrational motion. Specifically, we study both excitation and emission dynamics of the detector moving along a spacetime trajectory in the future/past light cone, and demonstrate the thermal response of the detector to the Minkowski vacuum that resembles the Unruh effect.

We then present the exact threshold under a realistic noise model that combines independent single-qubit errors with correlated errors between nearest-neighbor data qubits. Our method is applicable for any ratio of nearest-neighbor correlated errors to i.i.d. errors. We investigate the error correction threshold of surface codes and we present analytical constraints giving exact value of error threshold. This means that our error threshold is both upper bound and achievable and hence on the one hand the existing numerical threshold values can all be improved to our threshold value, on the other hand, our threshold value is highest achievable value in principle.</p>

As a demonstration, we target the challenge of generating samples from ideal and noisy QAOA circuits with up to 476 qubits, incorporating both depolarizing and amplitude damping noise models.

            <p>The catalytic extension of a discrete two-stroke engine employs a cyclic auxiliary system - the catalyst - that remains decoupled from the baths and performs no work, yet enhances power and efficiency beyond the corresponding non-catalytic counterpart. Theoretical models of discrete engines are relatively easy to analyze but remain challenging for experimental implementation due to the required control over individual strokes. In contrast, externally driven engines that are simultaneously coupled to both heat baths - the so-called continuous engines - are more experimentally feasible. Here, we establish an equivalence between discrete and continuous machines, both with and without a catalyst, by mapping the discrete unitary processes and thermalization steps onto an interaction Hamiltonian and a Markovian model of dissipation. As a result, by replacing probability flows with probability currents, we construct an analogous continuous machine corresponding to previously demonstrated catalytic schemes that generalize Otto engines. We illustrate this mapping for the simplest catalytic extension of the Otto engine, demonstrating catalytic enhancement in the continuous regime.</p>

We systematically studied the SB and the cross-correlation function, or equivalently, the signal-to-background ratio. The results in this study provide an answer applicable to all types of HSP sources. The answer relies on a newly defined quantity, the quality factor, which reveals how a HSP source approaches the ideal noise-free one. Furthermore, employing the HSP source based on hot atomic vapor, we achieved an SB of (7.0$\pm$0.3)$\times10^5$ pairs/s/MHz and a quality factor of 0.68$\pm$0.02 under the single-photon criterion.

Such a situation requires us to compare between two "patches" on the real line instead of two numbers.

The extent can however be universally determined by utilizing the concept of percentiles of the probability distribution of the corresponding estimator. As an application, we introduce the concept of finite-precision cooling in a generic quantum system.

            <h2>Quantum Combinatorial Reasoning for Large Language Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Carlos Flores-Garrigos, Gaurav Dev, Michael Falkenthal, Alejandro Gomez Cadavid, Anton Simen, Shubham Kumar, Enrique Solano, Narendra N. Hegade</p>
            <p>We design and implement a quantum combinatorial reasoning framework for large language models (QCR-LLM), integrating a real quantum computer in the hybrid workflow. QCR-LLM reformulates reasoning aggregation as a higher-order unconstrained binary optimization (HUBO) problem. In this sense, reasoning fragments are represented as binary variables and their interactions encode statistical relevance, logical coherence, and semantic redundancy. We tackle the resulting high-order optimization problem both classically, via simulated annealing, and quantumly through the bias-field digitized counterdiabatic quantum optimizer (BF-DCQO) executed on IBM's superconducting digital quantum processors. Experiments on BIG-Bench Extra Hard (BBEH) benchmarks demonstrate that our QCR-LLM consistently improves reasoning accuracy across multiple LLM backbones, surpassing reasoning-native systems such as o3-high and DeepSeek R1 by up to $+9\,$pp. Despite requiring multiple reasoning samples per query, our QCR-LLM remains approximately five times more energy-efficient than o3-high, owing to the low per-token energy footprint of its GPT-4o backbone. These results constitute the first experimental evidence of quantum-assisted reasoning, showing that hybrid quantum-classical optimization can efficiently enhance reasoning coherence, interpretability, and sustainability in large-scale language models. We have opened the doors to the emergence of quantum intelligence, where harder prompts require quantum optimizers at quantum-advantage level.</p>

            <p>Quantum networks rely on both quantum and classical channels for coordinated operation. Current architectures employ entanglement distribution and key exchange over quantum channels but often assume that classical communication is sufficiently secure. In practice, classical channels protected by traditional cryptography remain vulnerable to quantum adversaries, since large-scale quantum computers could break widely used public-key schemes and reduce the effective security of symmetric cryptography. This perspective presents a quantum-resistant network architecture that secures classical communication with post-quantum cryptographic techniques while supporting entanglement-based communication over quantum channels. Beyond cryptographic protection, the framework incorporates continuous monitoring of both quantum and classical layers, together with orchestration across heterogeneous infrastructures, to ensure end-to-end security. Collectively, these mechanisms provide a pathway toward scalable, robust, and secure quantum networks that remain dependable against both classical and quantum-era threats.</p>

            <h2>A No-Go Theorem for Shaping Quantum Resources</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samuel Alperin</p>
            <p>The ability to independently control higher-order statistical moments of continuous-variable quantum states would allow the direct ``shaping'' of non-Gaussian resources, with wide implications for quantum communication, computation, and metrology. Here we prove that such control is fundamentally impossible under any smooth Hamiltonian dynamics. Within the full infinite-dimensional algebra of Hamiltonian vector fields on phase space, the quadratic (symplectic) subalgebra $\mathfrak{sp}(2N,\mathbb R)$ -- and, in the single-mode case, its $\mathrm{SU}(1,1)$ representation -- is the unique hierarchy-preserving structure: only quadratic generators produce differential operators that terminate at second order and thereby decouple first and second moments from higher cumulants. Any smooth non-quadratic Hamiltonian introduces third- and higher-order derivatives in the phase-space generator, enforcing a universal coupling between the Gaussian and non-Gaussian sectors. This \emph{rigidity of the moment hierarchy} generalizes the Gaussian no-go theorems and identifies the analytic boundary between symplectic (Clifford) dynamics and the non-simulable regime beyond the Gottesman--Knill limit.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yutaka Hirano, Riki Toshio, Tomohiro Itogawa, Keisuke Fujii</p>
            <p>Magic state distillation plays a crucial role in fault-tolerant quantum computation and represents a major bottleneck. In contrast to traditional logical-level distillation, physical-level distillation offers significant overhead reduction by enabling direct implementation with physical gates. Magic state cultivation is a state-of-the-art physical-level distillation protocol that is compatible with the square-grid connectivity and yields high-fidelity magic states. However, it relies on the complex grafted code, which incurs substantial spacetime overhead and complicates practical implementation. In this work, we propose an efficient cultivation-based protocol compatible with the square-grid connectivity. We reduce the spatial overhead by avoiding the grafted code and further reduce the average spacetime overhead by utilizing code expansion and enabling early rejection. Numerical simulations show that, with a color code distance of 3 and a physical error probability of $10^{-3}$, our protocol achieves a logical error probability for the resulting magic state comparable to that of magic state cultivation ($\approx 3 \times 10^{-6}$), while requiring about half the spacetime overhead. Our work provides an efficient and simple distillation protocol suitable for megaquop use cases and early fault-tolerant devices.</p>

            <p>A key challenge for quantum computers is the efficient preparation of many-body entangled states across many qubits. In this work, we demonstrate the preparation of matrix product states (MPS) using a renormalization-group(RG)-based quantum algorithm on superconducting quantum hardware. Compared to sequential generation, it has been shown that the RG-based protocol asymptotically prepares short-range correlated MPS with an exponentially shallower circuit depth (when scaling system size), but it is not yet clear for which system sizes it starts to convey an advantage. We thus apply this algorithm to prepare a class of MPS exhibiting a phase transition between a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) and a trivial phase for systems of up to 80 qubits. We find that the reduced depth of the RG-based circuits makes them more resilient to noise, and that they generally outperform the sequential circuits for large systems, as we showcase by measuring string-order-like local expectation values and energy densities. We thus demonstrate that the RG-based protocol enables large-scale preparation of MPS and, in particular, SPT-ordered states beyond the fixed point.</p>

            <p>The construction of parent Hamiltonians that possess a given state as their ground state is a well-studied problem. In this work, we generalize this notion by considering simple quantum states and examining the local Hamiltonians that have these states as exact this http URL states often correspond to Quantum Many-Body Scars (QMBS) of their respective parent this http URL by earlier works on Hamiltonians with QMBS, in this work we formalize the differences between three distinct types of parent Hamiltonians, which differ in their decompositions into strictly local terms with the same eigenstates. We illustrate this classification using the $W$ state as the primary example, for which we rigorously derive the complete set of local parent Hamiltonians, which also allows us to establish general results such as the existence of asymptotic QMBS, and distinct dynamical signatures associated with the different parent Hamiltonian types. Finally, we derive more general results on the parent Hamiltonian types that allow us to obtain some immediate results for simple quantum states such as product states, where only a single type exists, and for short-range-entangled states, for which we identify constraints on the admissible types. Altogether, our work opens the door to classifying the rich structures and dynamical properties of parent Hamiltonians that arise from the interplay between locality and QMBS.</p>

With a Green functions relevant to generic optical resonators these $nonlocal$ $maps$ emulate the basic spatiotemporal phenomena as spatial solitons, vortex eigenmodes breathing via relaxation oscillations mediated by noise, vortex-vortex and vortex-antivortex lattices with periodic location of vortex cores.

            <p>A paradigmatic model, the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory exhibits confinement mediated by the gauge field that binds pairs of particles into mesons, drawing connections to quantum chromodynamics. In the absence of any additional attractive interactions between particles, mesons are not known to bind in this model. Here, we show that resonant pair-production terms give rise to an additional repulsive binding mechanism that forms a stable ``hadron'' bound state of two mesons. A high-energy state, the hadron is stabilized by being off-resonantly coupled to a continuum. We study the dynamical formation of this bound state starting from local excitations. We use matrix product state techniques based on the time-evolving block decimation algorithm to perform our numerical simulations and analyze the effect of model parameters on hadron formation. Furthermore, we derive an effective model that explains its formation. Our findings are amenable to experimental observation on modern quantum hardware from superconducting qubits to trapped ions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yitao Feng, Yu-An Chen, Po-Shen Hsin, Ryohei Kobayashi</p>
            <p>An internal symmetry in a lattice model is said to be onsiteable if it can be disentangled into an onsite action by introducing ancillas and conjugating with a finite-depth circuit. A standard lore holds that onsiteability is equivalent to being anomaly-free, which is indeed valid for finite 0-form symmetries in (1+1)D. However, for higher-form symmetries, these notions become inequivalent: a symmetry may be onsite while still anomalous. In this work, we clarify the conditions for onsiteability of higher-form symmetries by proposing an equivalence between onsiteability and the possibility of $higher$ gauging. For a finite 1-form symmetry in (2+1)D, we show that the symmetry is onsiteable if and only if its 't Hooft anomaly satisfies a specific algebraic condition that ensures the symmetry can be 1-gauged. We further demonstrate that onsiteable 1-form symmetry in (2+1)D can always be brought into transversal Pauli operators by ancillas and circuit conjugation. In generic dimensions, we derive necessary conditions for onsiteability using lattice 't Hooft anomaly of higher-form symmetry, and conjecture a general equivalence between onsiteability and possibility of higher gauging on lattices.</p>

            <p>At a generic volume- to area-law entanglement transition in a many-body system, quantum chaos is arrested. We argue that this tends to imply the vanishing of a certain "mass" term in the field theory of the measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT) for monitored, interacting fermions. To explore this idea, we consider the MIPT with no conserved quantities that describes 1D monitored, interacting Majorana fermions in class DIII. We conjecture that the MIPT is the noninteracting DIII one in this case; the volume-law phase arises through the dangerously irrelevant mass. We propose numerical tests of our conjecture and analytically identify a candidate noninteracting critical point.</p>

            <p>We study one dimensional quantum spin chains whose nearest neighbor interactions are random matrices that square to one. By employing free probability theory, we establish a mapping from the many-body quantum dynamics of energy density in the original chain to a single-particle hopping dynamics when the local Hilbert space dimension is large. The hopping occurs on the Cayley graph of an infinite Coxeter reflection group. Adjacency matrices on large finite clusters of this Cayley graph can be constructed numerically by leveraging the automatic structure of the group. The density of states and two-point functions of the local energy density are approximately computed and consistent with the physics of a generic local Hamiltonian: Gaussian density of states and thermalization of energy density. We then ask what happens to the physics if we modify the group on which the hopping dynamics occurs, and conjecture that adding braid relations into the group leads to integrability. Our results put into contact ideas in free probability theory, quantum mechanics of hyperbolic lattices, and the physics of both generic and integrable Hamiltonian dynamics.</p>

            <p>We propose an operator generalization of the Li-Haldane conjecture regarding the entanglement Hamiltonian of a disk in a 2+1D chiral gapped groundstate. The logic applies to regions with sharp corners, from which we derive several universal properties regarding corner entanglement. These universal properties follow from a set of locally-checkable conditions on the wavefunction. We also define a quantity $(\mathfrak{c}_{\text{tot}})_{\text{min}}$ that reflects the robustness of corner entanglement contributions, and show that it provides an obstruction to a gapped boundary. One reward from our analysis is that we can construct a local gapped Hamiltonian within the same chiral gapped phase from a given wavefunction; we conjecture that it is closer to the low-energy renormalization group fixed point than the original parent Hamiltonian. Our analysis of corner entanglement reveals the emergence of a universal conformal geometry encoded in the entanglement structure of bulk regions of chiral gapped states that is not visible in topological field theory.</p>

Our analysis focuses on entanglement and magic, two complementary indicators of non-classicality in quantum states. We show that while unpolarized and longitudinally polarized beams yield unentangled separable outcomes, transverse beam polarization enables the generation of entangled and non-stabilizer states. This result holds for both elastic and deep inelastic electron-proton scattering in QED. In the deep inelastic regime, the degree of quantum correlation is governed by the transversity parton distribution functions, providing a novel perspective on spin dynamics within QCD. These results establish the EIC as a promising environment for generating entangled and non-stabilizer states in high-energy physics, and they highlight opportunities for future lepton-hadron colliders to extend such studies into new kinematic domains.</p>

            <p>We study superselection sectors in two-dimensional quantum spin systems with an on-site action of a compact abelian group $G$. Naaijkens and Ogata (2022) arXiv:2102.07707 showed that for states quasi-equivalent to a product state, the superselection structure is trivial, reflecting the absence of long-range entanglement. We consider a symmetry-compatible refinement of this setting, in which both the superselection criterion and the notion of equivalence between representations are required to respect the $G$-action. Under this stricter notion of equivalence, the sector structure for a $G$-equivariant product representation becomes nontrivial: the $G$-equivariant superselection sectors are classified by elements of the Pontryagin dual $\widehat{G}$. This shows that even in phases without long-range entanglement, imposing symmetry compatibility can lead to nontrivial sector structure.</p>

We then model the confining contribution to 1S - 2S heavy meson mass gaps as a 1+1D absolute linear potential and look at the correspondence of the Airy function zeros. In doing so, we predicted the confining contribution to the mass gap of heavy mesons with a good accuracy when compared to calculations performed in the light front. Furthermore, we used these Airy function solutions to model the quantum states of a neutron under Earth's gravity. We show that the measured heights of a neutron can be modeled by the zeros of the Airy function, and compare to experimental data and predictions utilizing the WKB approximation.</p>

            <p>We investigate the quantum statistical properties of the confining string connecting a static fermion-antifermion pair in the massive Schwinger model. By analyzing the reduced density matrix of the subsystem located in between the fermion and antifermion, we demonstrate that as the interfermion separation approaches the string-breaking distance, the overlap between the microscopic density matrix and an effective thermal density matrix exhibits a pronounced, narrow peak, approaching unity at the onset of string breaking. This behavior reveals that the confining flux tube evolves toward a genuinely thermal state as the separation between the charges grows, even in the absence of an external heat bath. In other words, one cannot tell whether a reduced state of the subsystem arises from a surrounding heat bath or from entanglement with the rest of the system. The entanglement spectrum near the critical string-breaking distance exhibits a rapid transition from the dominance of a single state describing the confining electric string towards a strongly entangled state containing virtual fermion-antifermion pairs. Our findings establish a quantitative link between confinement, entanglement, and emergent thermality, and suggest that string breaking corresponds to a microscopic thermalization transition within the flux tube.</p>

            <p>We introduce a framework uniting algorithmic randomness with exchangeable credences to address foundational questions in philosophy of probability and philosophy of science. To demonstrate its power, we show how one might use the framework to derive the Principal Principle -- the norm that rational credence should match known objective chance -- without circularity. The derivation brings together de Finetti's exchangeability, Martin-Löf randomness, Lewis's and Skyrms's chance-credence norms, and statistical constraining laws (arXiv:2303.01411). Laws that constrain histories to algorithmically random sequences naturally pair with exchangeable credences encoding inductive symmetries. Using the de Finetti representation theorem, we show that this pairing directly entails the Principal Principle of this framework. We extend the proof to partial exchangeability and provide finite-history bounds that vanish in the infinite limit. The Principal Principle thus emerges as a mathematical consequence of the alignment between nomological constraints and inductive learning. This reveals how algorithmic randomness and exchangeability can illuminate foundational questions about chance, frequency, and rational belief.</p>

            <p>We present a unified, SI-consistent framework to constrain minimal SME coefficients $a_\mu$ and $b_\mu$ using magnetically confined two-dimensional electron systems under a uniform magnetic field. Working in the nonrelativistic (Schrödinger--Pauli) limit with effective mass, we derive the radial problem for cylindrical geometries and identify how spatial components ($\mathbf a,\mathbf b$) reshape the effective potential, via $1/r$ and $r$ terms or spin-selective offsets, while scalar components ($a_0,b_0$) act through a global energy shift and a spin-momentum coupling. Phenomenological upper bounds follow from requiring LV-induced shifts to lie below typical spectroscopic resolutions: $|a_0|\lesssim\delta E$, $|b_z|\lesssim\delta E/\hbar$, and compact expressions for $|a_\varphi|$ and $|b_0|$ that expose their dependence on device scales ($r_0$, $B_0$, $\mu$, $m$). Dimensional analysis clarifies that, in this regime, spatial $a_i$ carry momentum dimension and $b_i$ carry inverse-time/length dimensions, ensuring gauge-independent, unit-consistent reporting. Finite-difference eigenvalue calculations validate the scaling laws and illustrate spectral signatures across realistic parameter sets. The results show that scalar sectors (notably $a_0$) are tightly constrained by state-of-the-art $\mu$eV-resolution probes, while spatial and axial sectors benefit from spin- and $m$-resolved spectroscopy and geometric leverage, providing a reproducible pathway to test Lorentz symmetry in condensed-matter platforms.</p>

In contrast to the low-energy singlet state governed by the Pauli principle and the S-wave dominance, this second maximally entangled state is directly shaped by tensor forces beyond leading-order chiral effective field theory, providing a distinct quantum-information signature for realistic nuclear forces.

            <p>Supersolidity in a dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), which is the coexistence of crystalline density modulation and global phase coherence, emerges from the interplay of contact interactions, long-range dipole-dipole forces, and quantum fluctuations. Although realized experimentally, stabilizing this phase at zero temperature often requires high peak densities. Here we chart the finite-temperature phase behavior of a harmonically trapped dipolar BEC using an extended mean-field framework that incorporates both quantum (Lee-Huang-Yang) and thermal fluctuation effects. We find that finite temperature can act constructively: it shifts the supersolid phase boundary toward larger scattering lengths, lowers the density threshold for the onset of supersolidity, and broadens the stability window of modulated phases. Real-time simulations reveal temperature-driven pathways (crystallization upon heating and melting upon cooling) demonstrating the dynamical accessibility and path dependence of supersolid order. Moreover, moderate thermal fluctuations stabilize single-droplet states that are unstable at zero temperature, expanding the experimentally accessible parameter space. These results identify temperature as a key control parameter for engineering and stabilizing supersolid phases, offering realistic routes for their observation and control in dipolar quantum gases.</p>

The resulting exciton bound by photon exchange, recently demonstrated experimentally, exhibits a binding energy that can be continuously tuned by varying the cavity frequency. We show that polariton-polariton interactions, originating from both Coulomb interactions and Pauli blocking, can be dramatically enhanced by reducing the exciton binding energy, thereby increasing the effective Bohr radius along the growth direction. This regime is reminiscent of Rydberg atoms, where weak binding leads to strong quantum interactions. Our predictions indicate that this physics can give rise to giant quantum optical nonlinearities in the mid and far infrared, a spectral region that remains largely unexplored in quantum optics and offers exciting opportunities for both fundamental studies and applications.</p>

            <p>We prove that the semiclassical Einstein equations emerge directly from quantum information theory. Using modular theory, we establish that the relative entropy between the vacuum state and coherent excitations of a scalar quantum field on a bifurcate Killing horizon is given by the energy flux across the horizon. Under the assumption of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy-area formula, this energy flux is proportional to a variation in the surface area of the horizon cross section. The semiclassical Einstein equations follow automatically from this identification. Our approach provides a rigorous quantum field theoretic generalization of Jacobson's thermodynamic derivation of Einstein's equations, replacing classical thermodynamic entropy with the well-defined quantum relative (Araki-Uhlmann) entropy. This suggests that quantum information plays a fundamental role in what is seen as a zeroth order approximation of a theory of quantum gravity, namely quantum field theory in curved spacetimes.</p>

We present the operating concept and architecture of an in-situ sensing solution based on the dynamics of a levitated nanoparticle (levitodynamics). It can detect and measure impacts of individual particles in rarefied media. Dubbed `LEVITAS', our sensor consists of a dispenser of dielectric nanoparticles and optical trapping of a single nanoparticle in the focus of a laser beam. The trapped nanoparticle constitutes a harmonic oscillator at frequencies in the kilohertz range whose position can be tracked at the standard quantum limit by interferometric detection of the laser photons it scatters. Here, we simulate microcanonical impacts on the nanoparticle and show that the density, velocity, temperature, and composition of the surrounding medium can be estimated accurately. We illustrate the performance of LEVITAS in circumstances ranging from low Earth orbit out to exospheric distances, across which individual impacts can be detected at favourable rates. Furthermore, LEVITAS may be employed to accurately measure highly rarefied neutral distributions within vastly different areas of momentum space.

            <p>We develop a preconditioned nonlinear conjugate-gradient solver for ground states of binary dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates within the extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation including Lee-Huang-Yang corrections. The optimization is carried out on the product-of-spheres normalization manifold and combines a manifold-preserving analytic line search, derived from a second-order energy expansion and validated along the exact normalized path, with complementary Fourier-space kinetic and real-space diagonal (Hessian-inspired) preconditioners. The method enforces monotonic energy descent and exhibits robust convergence across droplet, stripe, and supersolid regimes while retaining spectrally accurate discretizations and FFT-based evaluation of the dipolar term. In head-to-head benchmarks against imaginary-time evolution on matched grids and tolerances, the solver reduces iteration counts by one to two orders of magnitude and overall time-to-solution, and it typically attains slightly lower energies, indicating improved resilience to metastability. We reproduce representative textures and droplet-stability windows reported for dipolar mixtures. These results establish a reliable and efficient tool for large-scale parameter scans and phase-boundary mapping, and for quantitatively linking numerically obtained metastable branches to experimentally accessible states.</p>

            <p>For any element $g$ of compact reductive group $G$ we investigate the asymptotic behavior of its normalized irreducible character in the high-dimension limit, $\frac{\chi_\lambda(g)}{d_\lambda}$. We show that when $G$ is simple the limit vanishes besides identity element. For semisimple groups one gets the same results under the additional assumption that dimensions of irreducible representations of all simple components are going to infinity.

In the case of finite-dimensional non-commutative probability spaces, we obtain a complete classification of such fields.

Crucially, our classification extends naturally to non-faithful states that are not pure, thus generalizing Petz and Sudar's radial extension.</p>

            <h2>Accelerated relaxation and Mpemba-like effect for operators in open quantum systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pitambar Bagui, Arijit Chatterjee, Bijay Kumar Agarwalla</p>
            <p>Quantum Mpemba effect occurs when a quantum system, residing far away from the steady state, relaxes faster than a relatively nearer state. We look for the presence of this highly counterintuitive effect in the relaxation dynamics of the operators within the open quantum system setting. Since the operators evolve under a non-trace preserving map, the trace distance of an operator is not a monotonically decaying function of time, unlike its quantum state counterpart. Consequently, the trace distance can not serve as a reliable measure for detecting the Mpemba effect in operator dynamics. We circumvent this problem by defining a \textit{dressed} distance between operators that decays monotonically with time, enabling a generalized framework to explore the Mpemba-like effect for operators. Applying the formalism to various open quantum system settings, we find that, interestingly, in the single qubit case, only accelerated relaxation of operators is possible, while genuine Mpemba-like effects emerge in higher-dimensional systems such as qutrits and beyond. Furthermore, we demonstrate the existence of Mpemba-like effects in nonlocal, non-equilibrium operators, such as current, in a double-quantum-dot setup. Our results, besides offering fundamental insight about the occurrence of the Mpemba-like effect under non-trace preserving dynamics, open avenues for new experimental studies where quicker relaxation of observables could be of significant interest.</p>

These transitions are spin forbidden, resulting in narrow linewidths, and feature near-diagonal Franck-Condon factors. We develop a model of the hyperfine and Zeeman structure that includes coupling between the $0^+$ and $0^-$ components of $\mathrm{b}^3\Pi_0$. We fit the spectra to obtain rotational and hyperfine coupling constants. We measure transition dipole moments associated with specific transitions by directly observing Rabi oscillations as a function of a resonant laser pulse duration. Using resonant $\pi$ pulses, we prepare molecules in the electronically excited state and directly measure the spontaneous emission rate.</p>

            <p>We investigate long-range resonances in quasiperiodic many-body localized (MBL) systems. Focusing on the Heisenberg chain in a deterministic Aubry-André potential, we complement standard diagnostics by analyzing the structure of long-distance pairwise correlations at high energy. Contrary to the expectation that the ergodic-MBL transition in quasiperiodic systems should be sharper due to the absence of Griffiths regions, we uncover a broad unconventional regime at strong quasiperiodic potential, characterized by fat-tailed distributions of longitudinal correlations at long distance. This reveals the presence of atypical eigenstates with strong long-range correlations in a regime where standard diagnostics indicate stable MBL. We further identify these anomalous eigenstates as quasi-degenerate pairs of resonant cat states, which exhibit entanglement at long distance. These findings advance the understanding of quasiperiodic MBL and identify density-correlation measurements in ultracold atomic systems as a probe of long-range resonances.</p>

            <p>The measurement postulate of quantum theory stands in conflict with the laws of thermodynamics and has evoked debate regarding what actually constitutes a measurement. With the help of modern quantum statistical mechanics, we take the first step in formalising the hypothesis that quantum measurements are driven by the natural tendency of closed systems to maximize entropy, a notion that we call the Measurement-Equilibration Hypothesis. In this paradigm, we investigate how classical measurement outcomes can emerge within a purely unitary framework, and find that: (i) the interactions used in standard measurement models fail to spontaneously encode information classically and (ii) while ideal projective measurements are impossible, one can (for a given form of Hamiltonian) approximate them exponentially well as more physical systems are collected together into an ``observer'' system. We thus lay the groundwork for self-contained models of quantum measurement, proposing improvements to our simple scheme.</p>

            <p>In recent years, achieving verifiable quantum advantage on a NISQ device has emerged as an important open problem in quantum information. The sampling-based quantum advantages are not known to have efficient verification methods. This paper investigates the verification of quantum advantage from a cryptographic perspective. We establish a strong connection between the verifiability of quantum advantage and cryptographic and complexity primitives, including efficiently samplable, statistically far but computationally indistinguishable pairs of (mixed) quantum states ($\mathsf{EFI}$), pseudorandom states ($\mathsf{PRS}$), and variants of minimum circuit size problems ($\mathsf{MCSP}$). Specifically, we prove that a) a sampling-based quantum advantage is either verifiable or can be used to build $\mathsf{EFI}$ and even $\mathsf{PRS}$ and b) polynomial-time algorithms for a variant of $\mathsf{MCSP}$ would imply efficient verification of quantum advantages. Our work shows that the quest for verifiable quantum advantages may lead to applications of quantum cryptography, and the construction of quantum primitives can provide new insights into the verifiability of quantum advantages.</p>

            <p>Cavity optomechanics, providing an inherently nonlinear interaction between photons and phonons, have shown enomerous potential in generating macroscopic quantum entanglement. Here we propose to realize diverse bipartite and tripartite entanglement in cavity-magnon optomechanics. By introducing magnons to standard cavity optomechanics, not only tunable optomechanical entanglement and magnon-magnon entanglement can be achieved, but also flexible tripartite entanglement including magnon-photon-phonon entanglement, magnon-magnon-photon and -phonon entanglement can be generated. Moreover, optimal bipartite and tripartite entanglement can be achieved by tuning parameters. We further show that all entanglement can be enhanced via engineering the magnon-photon coupling, and is proven to be robust against the bath temperature within the survival temperature. Besides, we find that the optomechanical entanglement can be protected or restored by bad magnons with large decay rate, while other entanglement is severely reduced. The results indicate that our proposal provides a novel avenue to explore and control tunable macroscopic quantum effects in hybrid cavity-magnon optomechanics.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we introduce the gauge-fixed QLDPC surgery scheme, an improved logical measurement scheme based on the construction of Cohen et al. (Sci. Adv. 8, eabn1717). Our scheme leverages expansion properties of the Tanner graph to substantially reduce the space overhead of QLDPC surgery. In certain cases, we only require $\Theta(w)$ ancilla qubits to fault-tolerantly measure a weight $w$ logical operator. We provide rigorous analysis for the code distance and fault distance of our schemes, and present a modular decoding algorithm that achieves maximal fault-distance. We further introduce a bridge system to facilitate fault-tolerant joint measurements of logical operators. Augmented by this bridge construction, our scheme can be used to connect different families of QLDPC codes into one universal architecture. Applying our toolbox, we show how to perform all logical Clifford gates on the [[144,12,12]] bivariate bicycle code. Our scheme adds 103 ancilla qubits into the connectivity graph, and one of the twelve logical qubits is used as an ancilla for gate synthesis. Logical measurements are combined with the automorphism gates studied by Bravyi et al. (Nature 627, 778-782) to implement 288 Pauli product measurements. We demonstrate the practicality of our scheme through circuit-level noise simulations, leveraging our proposed modular decoder that combines BPOSD with matching.</p>

            <h2>Out of the Loop: Structural Approximation of Optimisation Landscapes and non-Iterative Quantum Optimisation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tom Krüger, Wolfgang Mauerer</p>
            <p>The Quantum Approximate Optimisation Algorithm (QAOA) is a widely studied quantum-classical iterative heuristic for combinatorial optimisation. While QAOA targets problems in complexity class NP, the classical optimisation procedure required in every iteration is itself known to be \NP-hard. Still, advantage over classical approaches is suspected for certain scenarios, but nature and origin of its computational power are not yet satisfactorily understood. By introducing means of efficiently and accurately approximating the QAOA optimisation landscape from solution space structures, we derive a new algorithmic variant of unit-depth QAOA for two-level Hamiltonians (including all problems in NP): Instead of performing an iterative quantum-classical computation for each input instance, our non-iterative method is based on a quantum circuit that is instance-independent, but problem-specific. It matches or outperforms unit-depth QAOA for key combinatorial problems, despite reduced computational effort. Our approach is based on proving a long-standing conjecture regarding instance-independent structures in QAOA. By ensuring generality, we link existing empirical observations on QAOA parameter clustering to established approaches in theoretical computer science, and provide a sound foundation for understanding the link between structural properties of solution spaces and quantum optimisation.</p>

            <p>Simulating the dynamics of open quantum systems is a crucial task in quantum computing, offering wide-ranging applications but remaining computationally challenging. In this paper, we propose two quantum algorithms for simulating the dynamics of open quantum systems governed by Lindbladians. We introduce a new approximation channel for short-time evolution, inspired by the quantum trajectory method, which underpins the efficiency of our algorithms. The first algorithm achieves a gate complexity independent of the number of jump operators, $m$, marking a significant improvement in efficiency. The second algorithm achieves near-optimal dependence on the evolution time $t$ and precision $\epsilon$ and introduces only an additional $\tilde{O}(m)$ factor, which strictly improves upon state-of-the-art gate-based quantum algorithm that has an $\tilde O(m^2)$ factor. The improvement stems from the integration of the new approximation channel with a novel structured linear combination of unitaries method. In both our algorithms, the reduction of dependence on $m$ significantly enhances the efficiency of simulating practical dissipative processes characterized by a large number of jump operators.</p>

            <p>Symmetry of non-Hermitian matrices underpins many physical phenomena. In particular, chaotic open quantum systems exhibit universal bulk spectral correlations classified on the basis of time-reversal symmetry$^{\dagger}$ (TRS$^{\dagger}$), coinciding with those of non-Hermitian random matrices in the same symmetry class. Here, we analytically study the spectral correlations of non-Hermitian random matrices in the presence of TRS$^{\dagger}$ with signs $+1$ and $-1$, corresponding to symmetry classes AI$^{\dagger}$ and AII$^{\dagger}$, respectively. Using the fermionic replica non-linear sigma model approach, we derive $n$-fold integral expressions for the $n$th moment of the one-point and two-point characteristic polynomials. Performing the replica limit $n\to 0$, we qualitatively reproduce the density of states and level-level correlations of non-Hermitian random matrices with TRS$^{\dagger}$.</p>

Devising an interferometric algorithm allows us to introduce and measure a bulk topological invariant to probe the dynamical transmutation of anyons for system sizes up to 58 qubits.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pegah Mohammadipour, Xiantao Li</p>
            <p>Zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE) is a widely used quantum error mitigation technique that artificially amplifies circuit noise and then extrapolates the results to the noise-free circuit. A common ZNE approach is Richardson extrapolation, which relies on polynomial interpolation. Despite its simplicity, efficient implementations of Richardson extrapolation face several challenges, including approximation errors from the non-polynomial behavior of noise channels, overfitting due to polynomial interpolation, and exponentially amplified measurement noise. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of these challenges, presenting bias and variance bounds that quantify approximation errors. Additionally, for any precision $\varepsilon$, our results offer an estimate of the necessary sample complexity. We further extend the analysis to polynomial least squares-based extrapolation, which mitigates measurement noise and avoids overfitting. Finally, we propose a strategy for simultaneously mitigating circuit and algorithmic errors in the Trotter-Suzuki algorithm by jointly scaling the time step size and the noise level. This strategy provides a practical tool to enhance the reliability of near-term quantum computations. We support our theoretical findings with numerical experiments.</p>

            <p>Demonstrating how long-range entangled states are born from product states has gained much attention, which is not only important for quantum technology but also provides an unconventional tool in characterizing and classifying exotic phases of matter. In this paper, we introduce a unified and efficient framework of quantum circuits (i.e., a series of local unitary transformations), termed the \emph{Seed-Entangler-Enriched Sequential Quantum Circuit} (SEESQC) to construct long-range entangled states (i.e., code states) in code space of topological error-correcting codes. Specifically, we apply SEESQC to construct code states of Tetra-Digit models -- a broad class of long-range entangled stabilizer codes indexed by a four-digit parameter. These models are not rare but encompass Toric Codes across arbitrary dimensions and subsume the X-cube fracton code as special cases. Featuring a hierarchical structure of generalized entanglement renormalization group, many Tetra-Digit models host spatially extended excitations (e.g., loops, membranes, and exotic non-manifold objects) with constrained mobility and deformability, and exhibit system-size-dependent ground state degeneracies that scale exponentially with a polynomial in linear sizes. In this work, we begin with graphical and algebraic demonstration of quantum circuits for computational basis states, before generalizing to broader cases. Central to this framework is a key ingredient termed the \emph{seed-entangler} acting on a small number of qubits termed \textit{seeds}, enabling a systematic scheme to achieve arbitrary code states. Remarkably, the number of available seeds equals the number of logical qubits for the constructed examples, which leaves plenty of room for future investigation in theoretical physics, mathematics and quantum information science.

In Bayesian inference, loss of information results in the retrodiction for the initial state becoming increasingly influenced by the choice of reference prior. In this paper, we import this latter perspective into physics, by quantifying the irreversibility of any process with its Bayesian subjectivity -- that is, the sensitivity of its retrodiction to one's prior. From this perspective, we review analytical and numerical results that highlight both intuitive and subtle insights that this measure sheds on irreversible processes.</p>

            <p>Quantum simulation is a promising way toward practical quantum advantage, but noise in current quantum hardware poses a significant obstacle. We prove that not only the physical error but also the algorithmic error in a single Trotter step decreases exponentially with the circuit depth. This theoretical finding is validated by our numerical results over various Hamiltonians, initial states, and noise channels. Furthermore, we derive the optimal number of Trotter steps and the noise requirement to guarantee total simulation precision. To explicitly show the requirements for robust quantum simulation, we plot a phase diagram of the accumulated error in terms of circuit depth and noise rate. At last, we demonstrate that our improved error analysis leads to significant resourcesaving for fault-tolerant Trotter circuits. By addressing these aspects, this work provides fresh and systematic insight on the practical quantum advantage through quantum simulation.</p>

            <p>We introduce an extension of the time-dependent variational Monte Carlo (tVMC) method that adaptively controls the expressivity of the variational quantum state during the simulation of the dynamics. This adaptive tVMC (atVMC) approach is specifically designed to enhance numerical stability when overparameterized variational ansätze lead to ill-conditioned equations of motion. Building on the concept of the local-in-time error (LITE), a measure of the deviation between variational and exact evolution, we introduce a procedure to quantify each parameter's contribution to reducing the LITE, using only quantities already computed in standard tVMC simulations. These relevance estimates guide the selective evolution of only the most significant parameters at each time step, while maintaining a prescribed level of accuracy. We benchmark the algorithm on quantum quenches in the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model using both spin-Jastrow and restricted Boltzmann machine wave functions, with an emphasis on overparameterized regimes. The adaptive scheme significantly improves numerical stability and reduces the need for strong regularization, enabling reliable simulations with highly expressive variational ansätze.</p>

We expose the appearance of exceptional points on such two-dimensional subspaces, together with quantum phase transitions marking the transition from real to complex eigenvalues. We also compute the spin-boson entanglement entropy on each invariant subspace to show that the two phases can be distinguished by their distinct entanglement-entropy profiles.</p>

            <p>Quantum sensors based on spin-defect relaxation have become powerful tools for detecting faint magnetic signals, yet their operation has remained largely confined to low magnetic fields and gigahertz frequencies. Extending such sensors into high-field ($> 0.3$ T) and sub-terahertz regimes would enable quantum metrology across a wide range of electromagnetic phenomena and scientific applications, but has proven challenging. Here, we demonstrate that negatively charged boron vacancies ($\mathrm{V_B^-}$) in two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride can function as relaxation-based quantum sensors operating up to 0.2 terahertz. Their uniform spin-orientation and persistent spin-contrast at high fields enable direct measurement of intrinsic spin relaxation across previously unexplored temperature and frequency regimes. We also reveal a crossover in relaxation behavior \textemdash initially decreasing at low fields before rising at higher fields \textemdash consistent with the emergence of single-phonon-induced resonant noise that becomes significant at sub-terahertz frequencies. These results establish $\mathrm{V_B^-}$ centers as a versatile platform for quantum sensing in the sub-terahertz, high-field regime.</p>

            <h2>Intrinsic Heralding and Optimal Decoders for Non-Abelian Topological Order</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dian Jing, Pablo Sala, Liang Jiang, Ruben Verresen</p>
            <p>Topological order (TO) provides a natural platform for storing and manipulating quantum information. However, its stability to noise has only been systematically understood for Abelian TOs. In this work, we exploit the non-deterministic fusion of non-Abelian anyons to inform active error correction and design decoders where the fusion products, instead of flag qubits, herald the noise. This intrinsic heralding enhances thresholds over those of Abelian counterparts when noise is dominated by a single non-Abelian anyon type. Furthermore, we use Bayesian inference to obtain a statistical mechanics model for fixed-point non-Abelian TOs with perfect measurements under any noise model, which yields the optimal threshold conditioned on measuring anyon syndromes. We numerically illustrate these results for $D_4 \cong \mathbb Z_4 \rtimes \mathbb Z_2$ TO. In particular, for non-Abelian charge noise and perfect syndrome measurement, we find a conditioned optimal threshold $p_c=0.218(1)$, whereas an intrinsically heralded minimal-weight perfect-matching (MWPM) decoder already gives $p_c=0.20842(2)$, outperforming standard MWPM with $p_c = 0.15860(1)$. Our work highlights how non-Abelian properties can enhance stability, rather than reduce it, and discusses potential generalizations for achieving fault tolerance.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement dynamics of monitored non-interacting fermions on Graphic-Processing-Units</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bo Fan, Can Yin, Antonio M. García-García</p>
            <p>The description of the entanglement dynamics of monitored non-interacting fermions, including the existence of measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPT), is a challenging problem with conflicting results in the literature. The mapping of the problem onto a non-linear sigma model (NLSM) indicates that relatively large lattice sizes are required to determine the nature of the entanglement entropy (EE) in the thermodynamics limit. Here we address this problem numerically for monitored non-interacting fermions with $U(1)$ symmetry. The use of Graphic-Processing-Unit (GPU) techniques, even with outdated hardware, makes possible to reach much larger lattice sizes ($L = 16384$ and $160\times160$ in one (1d) and two (2d) dimensions respectively) than in previous studies which enables us to characterize quantitatively the entanglement dynamics. In 1d, we show that in order to confirm the absence of a MIPT, for both projective and homodyne measurements, predicted by the NLSM it is necessary to reach $L \sim 10000$. In 2d, also as predicted by the NLSM, we observe for both protocols a MIPT at finite monitoring rate characterized by a scale invariant mutual information. The critical monitoring strength depends on the protocol while the critical exponent $\nu \approx 1.3$ governing the approach to the MIPT is similar in both cases. These features are not correctly predicted by the NLSM. Our results paves the way for a fully quantitative description of the entanglement dynamics of monitoring quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>A Modular, Adaptive, and Scalable Quantum Factoring Algorithm</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alok Shukla, Prakash Vedula</p>
            <p>Shor's algorithm for integer factorization offers an exponential speedup over classical methods but remains impractical on Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware due to the need for many coherent qubits and very deep circuits. Building on our recent work on adaptive and windowed phase-estimation methods, we have developed a modular, windowed formulation of Shor's algorithm that mitigates these limitations by restructuring phase estimation into shallow, independent circuit blocks that can be executed sequentially or in parallel, followed by lightweight classical postprocessing. This approach allows for a reduction in the size of the phase (or counting) register from a large number of qubits down to a small, fixed block size of only a few qubits (for example, three or four phase qubits were sufficient for the computational examples considered in this work), while leaving the work register requirement unchanged. The independence of the blocks allows for parallel execution and makes the approach more compatible with near-term hardware than the standard Shor's formulation. An additional feature of the framework is the overlap mechanism, which introduces redundancy between blocks and enables robust reconstruction of phase information, though zero-overlap configurations can also succeed in certain regimes. Numerical simulations verify the correctness of the modular formulation while also showing substantial reductions in counting qubits per block.</p>

            <p>We develop a framework based on the Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability distribution to quantify the contribution of coherence to work extraction during generic, cyclic quantum evolutions. In particular, we focus on ``anomalous processes'', counterintuitive scenarios in which, due to the negativity of the quasiprobability distribution, work can be extracted even when individual processes are associated with energy gain. Applying this framework to qubits undergoing sequences of single- and two-qubit gate operations, we identify specific conditions under which such anomalous work exchanges occur. Furthermore, we analyze the quasiprobabilistic structure of deep quantum circuits and establish a compositional relation linking the work statistics of full circuits to those of their constituent gates. Our work highlights the role of coherence in the thermodynamics of quantum computation and provides a foundation for systematically studying potential thermodynamic relevance of specific quantum circuits.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guo-Qiang Zhang, Si-Yan Lin, Wei Feng, Lijiong Shen, Yi-Hao Kang, Wei Xiong</p>
            <p>Recently, proposals for realizing a nonreciprocal superradiant quantum phase transition (SQPT) have been put forward, based on either nonreciprocal interactions between two spin ensembles or the Sagnac-Fizeau shift in a spinning cavity. However, experimental implementation of such a nonreciprocal SQPT remains challenging. This motivates the search for new mechanisms capable of producing a nonreciprocal SQPT. Here, we propose an alternative approach to realize a nonreciprocal SQPT, induced by the magnon Kerr effect (MKE), in a cavity magnonic system, where magnons in a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere are coupled to cavity photons. The MKE coefficient is positive ($K>0$) when the bias magnetic field is aligned along the crystallographic axis [100], but negative ($K<0$) when aligned along the axis [110]. We show that the steady-state phase diagram for $K > 0$ differs markedly from that for $K < 0$. This contrast is the origin of the nonreciprocal SQPT. By further studying the steady-state magnon occupation and its fluctuations versus the parametric drive strength, we demonstrate that the SQPT becomes nonreciprocal, characterized by distinct critical thresholds for $K > 0$ and $K < 0$. Moreover, we introduce a bidirectional contrast ratio to quantify this nonreciprocal behavior. Our work provides a new mechanism for realizing the nonreciprocal SQPT, with potential applications in designing nonreciprocal quantum devices.</p>

            <h2>Quantum capacity amplification via privacy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peixue Wu, Yunkai Wang</p>
            <p>We investigate superadditivity of quantum capacity through private channels whose Choi-Jamiolkowski operators are private states. This perspective links the security structure of private states to quantum capacity and clarifies the role of the shield system: information encoded in the shield system that would otherwise leak to the environment can be recycled when paired with an assisting channel, thereby boosting capacity. Our main contributions are threefold: Firstly, we develop a general framework that provides a sufficient condition for capacity amplification, which is formulated in terms of the assisting channel's Holevo information. As examples, we give explicit, dimension and parameter dependent amplification thresholds for erasure and depolarizing channels. Secondly, assuming the Spin alignment conjecture, we derive a single-letter expression for the quantum capacity of a family of private channels that are neither degradable, anti-degradable, nor PPT; as an application, we construct channels with vanishing quantum capacity yet unbounded private capacity. Thirdly, we further analyze approximate private channels: we give an alternative proof of superactivation that extends its validity to a broader parameter regime, and, by combining amplification bounds with continuity estimates, we establish a metric separation showing that channels exhibiting capacity amplification have nonzero diamond distance from the set of anti-degradable channels, indicating that existing approximate (anti-)degradability bounds are not tight. We also revisit the computability of the regularized quantum capacity and modestly suggest that this fundamental question still remains open.</p>

            <p>Routing is the task of permuting qubits in such a way that quantum operations can be parallelized maximally, given constraints on the hardware geometry. When simulating fermions in the Jordan-Wigner encoding with qubits, a one-dimensional nearest-neighbor-connected geometry is effectively imposed on the system, independently of the underlying hardware, which means that naively, an $O(N)$ depth routing overhead is incurred. Recently, Maskara et al. [arXiv:2509.08898] demonstrated that this routing overhead can be reduced to $O(\log N)$ by decomposing general fermion routing into $O(\log N)$ interleave permutations of depth $O(1)$, using $\Theta(N)$ ancillary qubits and employing measurements and feedforward. Here, we exhibit an alternative construction that achieves the same asymptotic performance. We also generalize the result in two ways. Firstly, we show that fermion routing can be performed in depth $O(\log^2 N)$ \emph{without} ancillas, measurements, or feedforward. Secondly, we construct efficient mappings with $O(\log^2 N)$ depth between all product-preserving ternary tree fermionic encodings, thereby showing that fermion routing in any such encoding can be done efficiently. While these results assume all-to-all connectivity, they also imply upper bounds for fermion routing in devices with limited connectivity by multiplying the fermion routing depth by the worst-case qubit routing depth.</p>

            <h2>Efficient Post-Selection for General Quantum LDPC Codes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seok-Hyung Lee, Lucas English, Stephen D. Bartlett</p>
            <p>Post-selection strategies that discard low-confidence computational results can significantly improve the effective fidelity of quantum error correction at the cost of reduced acceptance rates, which can be particularly useful for offline resource state generation. Prior work has primarily relied on the "logical gap" metric with the minimum-weight perfect matching decoder, but this approach faces fundamental limitations including computational overhead that scales exponentially with the number of logical qubits and poor generalizability to arbitrary codes beyond surface codes. We develop post-selection strategies based on computationally efficient heuristic confidence metrics that leverage error cluster statistics (specifically, aggregated cluster sizes and log-likelihood ratios) from clustering-based decoders, which are applicable to arbitrary quantum low-density parity check (QLDPC) codes. We validate our method through extensive numerical simulations on surface codes, bivariate bicycle codes, and hypergraph product codes, demonstrating orders of magnitude reductions in logical error rates with moderate abort rates. For instance, applying our strategy to the [[144, 12, 12]] bivariate bicycle code achieves approximately three orders of magnitude reduction in the logical error rate with an abort rate of only 1% (19%) at a physical error rate of 0.1% (0.3%). Additionally, we integrate our approach with the sliding-window framework for real-time decoding, featuring early mid-circuit abort decisions that eliminate unnecessary overheads. Notably, its performance matches or even surpasses the original strategy for global decoding, while exhibiting favorable scaling in the number of rounds. Our approach provides a practical foundation for efficient post-selection in fault-tolerant quantum computing with QLDPC codes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mao Lin</p>
            <p>The minimum weight matching (MWM) and maximum likelihood decoding (MLD) are two widely used and distinct decoding strategies for quantum error correction. For a given syndrome, the MWM decoder finds the most probable physical error corresponding to the MWM of the decoding graph, whereas MLD aims to find the most probable logical error. Although MLD is the optimal error correction strategy, it is typically more computationally expensive compared to the MWM decoder. In this work, we introduce an algorithm that approximates MLD with $K$ MWMs from the decoding graph. Taking the surface code subject to graphlike errors as an example, we show that it is possible to efficiently find the first $K$ MWMs by systematically modifying the original decoding graph followed by finding the MWMs of the modified graphs. For the case where the $X$ and $Z$ errors are correlated, despite the MWM of the decoding hypergraph cannot be found efficiently, we present a heuristic approach to approximate the MLD by finding the $K$ MWMs in the $X$ and $Z$ subgraphs. We benchmark the efficacy of our algorithm for the surface code subject to graphlike errors, the surface-square Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code and surface-hexagonal GKP code subject to the Gaussian random displacement errors, showing that the fidelity approaches that of the exact MLD (for the first two cases) or the tensor-network decoder (for the last case) as $K$ increases.</p>

            <p>Compilation and optimization of quantum circuits are critical components in the execution of algorithms on quantum computers. These components must successfully balance two competing priorities: minimizing the number of expensive resources, such as two-qubit gates or arbitrary angle single-qubit rotations, and minimizing the approximation error of the compiled circuit to the ideal target unitary describing the quantum algorithm. We develop a practical workflow for managing and optimizing this tradeoff, which enables quantum circuit compilation and optimization at scales of hundreds of qubits. Our workflow is able to tackle circuits at such large scales while providing rigorous guarantees on circuit output error by leveraging circuit partitioning and the notion of averaging over circuit ensembles. We demonstrate our workflow on several benchmark algorithmic circuits acting on up to 380 qubits, and show that it can simultaneously achieve substantial reductions in resource-intensive gates and control output errors, offering a practical and scalable strategy for both near-term and fault-tolerant quantum computing.</p>

            <p>Object detection and range finding using a weak light source is vulnerable to jamming and spoofing attacks by an intruder. Quantum illumination with nonsimultaneous, phase-insensitive coincidence measurements can provide jamming resilience compared to identical measurements for classical illumination. We extend an experimentally-feasible object detection and range finding quantum illumination-based protocol to include spoofing resilience. This approach allows the system to be characterised by its experimental parameters and quantum states, rather than just its detector data. Therefore we can scope the parameter-space which provides some spoofing resilience without relying upon the prohibitive method of acquiring detector data for all combinations of the experimental parameters. We demonstrate that in certain regimes the intruder has an optimal relative detection basis angle to minimise the induced error. We also show that there are spoofing-vulnerable regimes where excessive background noise prevents any induced error, while it is still possible to perform object detection, i.e. our detectors have not been fully blinded. The sensing protocol which we describe can allow for the recognition of intrusion and the possible detection of our trustworthy return signal. Our results reinforce that quantum illumination is advantageous for spoofing resilience compared to a classical illumination-based protocol.</p>

Here, we present a fully integrated and mechanically robust fiber-based endoscopic sensor with a tip diameter of $1.25 \mathrm{mm}$. On its tip, a direct laser writing process is used to fixate a diamond containing NV centers above the fiber's core inside a polymer structure. Additionally, a metallic direct laser-written antenna structure next to the fiber facet allows efficient microwave manipulation of NV center spins. The sensor achieves a shot-noise-limited magnetic-field sensitivity of $5.9 \mathrm{nT}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ using a $15 \mathrm{\mu m}$-sized microdiamond at a microwave power of $50 \mathrm{mW}$ and optical power of $2.15 \mathrm{mW}$. Using lock-in techniques, we measure a sensitivity of $51.8 \mathrm{nT}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-fiber concept that enables, in combination with a direct laser-written structure, independent guiding of excitation and fluorescence light and thus reduces background autofluorescence. Moreover, controlled guiding of excitation light to the diamond while avoiding sample illumination may enable operation in light-sensitive environments such as biological tissue. While the demonstrated sensitivity is achieved using a single-fiber configuration, the dual-fiber approach provides a path towards integrating smaller diamonds, where autofluorescence would otherwise limit performance. We demonstrate the capability of vector magnetic field measurements in a magnetic field as used in state-of-the-art ultracold quantum gas experiments, opening a potential field in which high resolution and high sensitivity are necessary.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jan Mandrysch, Miguel Navascués</p>
            <p>The Fewster-Verch (FV) framework provides a local and covariant approach for defining measurements in quantum field theory (QFT). Within this framework, a probe QFT represents the measurement device, which, after interacting with the target QFT, undergoes an arbitrary local measurement. Remarkably, the FV framework is free from Sorkin-like causal paradoxes and robust enough to enable quantum state tomography. However, two open issues remain. First, it is unclear if the FV framework allows conducting arbitrary local measurements. Second, if the probe field is interpreted as physical and the FV framework as fundamental, then one must demand the probe measurement to be itself implementable within the framework. That would involve a new probe, which should also be subject to an FV measurement, and so on. It is unknown if there exist non-trivial FV measurements for which such an ``FV-Heisenberg cut" can be moved arbitrarily far away. In this work, we advance the first problem by proving that Gaussian-modulated measurements of locally smeared fields fit within the FV framework. We solve the second problem by showing that any such measurement admits a movable FV-Heisenberg cut. As a technical byproduct, we establish that state transformations induced by finite-rank perturbations of the classical phase space underlying a linear scalar field preserve the Hadamard property.</p>

However, for the elementary problem of the thermodynamics of an ensemble of bosons populating a two-level system despite its conceptual simplicity experimental realizations are scarce. Using an optical dye microcavity platform, we thermalize photons in a two-mode system with tunable chemical potential, demonstrating N bosons populating a two-level system coupled to a heat bath. Under pulsed excitation, Josephson oscillations between the two quantum states demonstrate the possibility for coherent manipulation. In contrast, under stationary conditions the thermalization of the two-mode system is observed. As the energetic splitting between eigenstates is two orders of magnitude smaller than thermal energy, at low occupations an almost equal distribution of the modes occupation is observed, as expected from Boltzmann statistics. For larger occupation, we observe efficient population of the ground state and saturation of the upper level at high filling, expected from quantum statistics. Our experiment holds promise for state preparation in quantum technologies as well as for quantum thermodynamics studies.</p>

            <p>For strongly correlated quantum systems, fundamental questions about the formation and stability of Floquet-Bloch sidebands (FBs) upon periodic driving remain unresolved. Here, we investigate the impact of electron-electron interactions and perturbations in the coherence of the driving on the lifetime of FBs by directly computing time-dependent single-particle spectral functions using exact diagonalization (ED) and matrix product states (MPS). We study interacting metallic and correlated insulating phases in a chain of correlated spinless fermions. At high-frequency driving we obtain clearly separated, long-lived FBs of the full many-body excitation continuum. However, if there is significant overlap of the features, which is more probable in the low-frequency regime, the interactions lead to strong heating, which results in a significant loss of quantum coherence and of the FBs. Similar suppression of FBs is obtained in the presence of noise. The emerging picture is further elucidated by the behavior of real-space single-particle propagators, of the energy gain, and of the momentum distribution function, which is related to a quantum Fisher information that is directly accessible by spectroscopic measurements.</p>

We demonstrate that, under appropriate conditions, AQMBS states can be obtained as low-lying gapless excited states of a parent Hamiltonian, which has a QMBS state as its ground state. Furthermore, our formalism reveals a connection between QMBS and supersymmetric (SUSY) quantum mechanics. The QMBS state can be interpreted as a SUSY-unbroken ground state.</p>

We show, using analytic arguments combined with numerical checks, that this relative entropy can be very well approximated by an entropy difference, affording a significant computational advantage.

In doing this, we obtain a simple probe of the relaxation dynamics of closed many-body systems and use it to re-examine the quantum Mpemba effect, wherein states can relax faster if they are initially further from equilibrium. We reproduce earlier instances of the effect related to symmetry restoration as well as uncover new cases in the absence of such symmetries. For integrable models, we obtain the criteria for this to occur using the quasiparticle picture. Lastly, we show that, in models obeying the entanglement membrane picture, the quantum Mpemba effect cannot occur for a large class of initial states.</p>

            <p>We examine the effective field theory (EFT) of maximal chaos through the lens of Krylov complexity and the Universal Operator Growth Hypothesis. We test the relationship between two measures of quantum chaos: out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs) and Krylov complexity. In the EFT, a shift symmetry of the hydrodynamic modes enforces the maximal Lyapunov exponent in OTOCs, $\lambda_L = 2\pi T$, while simultaneously constraining thermal two-point autocorrelators. We solve these constraints on the autocorrelator, and calculate the Lanczos coefficients and Krylov exponents for several examples, finding both $\lambda_K = \lambda_L$ and $\lambda_K = \lambda_L/2$. This demonstrates that, within the EFT, the shift symmetry alone is insufficient to enforce maximal Krylov exponents even when the Lyapunov exponent is maximal. In particular, this result suggests a tension with the conjectured bound $\lambda_L \leq \lambda_K \leq 2\pi T$. Finally, we identify autocorrelator solutions whose power spectra closely resemble the so-called thermal product formula seen in holographic systems.</p>

            <p>We prove a coordinate- and foliation-independent Heisenberg-type lower bound for quantum states strictly localized in geodesic balls of radius $r$ on spacelike hypersurfaces of arbitrary spacetimes (with matter and a cosmological constant). The estimate depends only on the induced Riemannian geometry of the slice; it is independent of the lapse, shift, and extrinsic curvature, and controls the canonical momentum variance/uncertainty $\sigma_p$ by the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of the Laplace-Beltrami operator (Theorem). On weakly mean-convex balls we obtain the universal product inequality $\sigma_p r \ge \hbar/2$. Under the same assumption, a vector-field Barta-type argument improves this universal floor to the scale-invariant bound $\sigma_p r \ge \pi\hbar/2$, which provides a universal, foliation-independent floor. Any further sharpening of the constant requires eigenvalue-comparison results or other curvature-sensitive methods.</p>

            <h2>On the invariants of finite groups arising in a topological quantum field theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christopher A. Schroeder, Hung P. Tong-Viet</p>
            <p>In this paper, we investigate structural properties of finite groups that are detected by certain group invariants arising from Dijkgraaf--Witten theory, a topological quantum field theory, in one space and one time dimension. In this setting, each finite group $G$ determines a family of numerical invariants associated with closed orientable surfaces, expressed in terms of the degrees of the complex irreducible characters of $G$. These invariants can be viewed as natural extensions of the commuting probability $d(G)$, which measures the likelihood that two randomly chosen elements of $G$ commute and has been extensively studied in the literature. By analyzing these higher-genus analogues, we establish new quantitative criteria relating the values of these invariants to key structural features of finite groups, such as commutativity, nilpotency, supersolvability and solvability. Our results generalize several classical theorems concerning the commuting probability, thereby linking ideas from finite group theory and topological quantum field theory.</p>

Examples of exponentially decaying potentials as well truncated potentials involving a single length-scale $a$ are considered. In certain favorable cases the exact result for the $g$-dependent $s$-wave scattering length $a_0=A_0(g) a$ can be given in terms of special functions. The poles of $A_0(g)$ at increasing positive values of $g$ correspond to the thresholds, where $s$-wave bound-states occur successively. A scattering problem, where $A_0(g)$ is solvable in terms of elementary functions, is also presented.</p>

            <h2>$\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theories: fermionic gauging, transmutation, and Kramers-Wannier dualities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lei Su</p>
            <p>We generalize the gauging of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries by inserting Majorana fermions, establishing parallel duality correspondences for bosonic and fermionic lattice systems. Using this fermionic gauging, we construct fermionic analogs of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theories dual to the transverse-field Ising model, interpretable as Majorana stabilizer codes. We demonstrate a unitary equivalence between the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory obtained by gauging the fermion parity of a free fermionic system and the conventional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory with potentially nonlocal terms on the square lattice with toroidal geometry. This equivalence is implemented by a linear-depth local unitary circuit, connecting the bosonic and fermionic toric codes through a direction-dependent anyonic transmutation. The gauge theory obtained by gauging fermion parity is further shown to be equivalent to a folded Ising chain obtained via the Jordan--Wigner transformation. We clarify the distinction between the recently proposed Kramers--Wannier dualities and those obtained by gauging the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry along a space-covering path. Our results extend naturally to higher-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theories, providing a unified framework for bosonic and fermionic dualities and offering new insights for quantum computation and simulation.</p>

            <h2>Unified Framework for Direct and Complete Characterization of an Unknown Kraus Operator and Density Matrix Using a Single Input State</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sahil, Swarup Kumar Giri, Sohail</p>
            <p>Characterization of quantum measurements and dynamical processes is typically performed using pure state preparations. However, in realistic experimental settings, the preparation of pure states is often infeasible due to noise and system constraints. In this work, we present a unified framework that enables the direct and complete characterization of an unknown Kraus operator using only a single input state. The same framework also supports the characterization of unknown observable, unitary operator, and density matrix. Remarkably, all these tasks are accomplished using a single input state, a set of projector-based unitary evolution operators, and the measurement of a single observable. Importantly, our approach imposes no constraints on the strength of the coupling between the system and a probe.</p>

            <h2>Temporal Complexity Hierarchies in Solvable Quantum Many-Body Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> He-Ran Wang, Ilya Vilkoviskiy, Dmitry A. Abanin</p>
            <p>The influence matrix (IM) provides a powerful framework for characterizing nonequilibrium quantum many-body dynamics by encoding multitime correlations into tensor-network states. Understanding how its computational complexity relates to underlying dynamics is crucial for both theoretical insight and practical utility, yet remains largely unexplored despite a few case studies. Here, we address this question for a family of brickwork quantum circuits ranging from integrable to chaotic regimes. Using tools from geometric group theory, we identify three qualitatively distinct scalings of temporal entanglement entropy, establishing a hierarchy of computational resources required for accurate tensor-network representations of the IM for these models. We further analyze the memory structure of the IM and distinguish between classical and quantum temporal correlations. In particular, for certain examples, we identify effectively classical IMs that admit an efficient Monte Carlo algorithm for computing multitime correlations. In more generic settings without an explicit classical description of the IM, we introduce an operational measure of quantum memory with an experimental protocol, and discuss examples exhibiting long-time genuinely quantum correlations. Our results establish a new connection between quantum many-body dynamics and group theory, providing fresh insights into the complexity of the IM and its intricate connection to the physical characteristics of the dynamics.</p>

            <p>This paper presents a novel formalism for the out of equilibrium dynamics of the density matrix, capable of describing highly entangled many-body interactions. The evolution of quantum states is evaluated via eigenvalue dynamics of a general Hamiltonian system, perturbed by a parametrically evolving variable $\lambda(t)$ that carries the time-dependence. This is achieved using the Pechukas-Yukawa mapping of the evolution of the energy levels governed by their initial conditions on a generalised Calogero-Sutherland model of a 1D classical gas. As such, quantum systems can be described exactly in their entirety from eigenvalue dynamics. Under this description, we provide an improved understanding of the relationship between nonequilibrium quantum phase transitions and decoherence which has significant impacts to a wide range of applications.</p>

            <h2>Effect of Stochastic Charge Noise in Si/SiGe Quantum-Dot Spin Qubits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei-en Chiu, Chia-Hsien Huang, Yi-Hsien Wu, Hsi-Sheng Goan</p>
            <p>In Si/SiGe quantum dots, the decoherence behavior of spin qubits usually comes from the non-Markovian effect of the charge noise. To improve the performance of using the coherent noise models in the decoherence simulation and tomography analysis, here we propose a spin-phonon model derived from the electric dipole spin resonance to characterize the decoherence behavior of the spin qubit in a Si/SiGe quantum dot. Utilizing a 1/f spectrum to characterize quantum noise correlation, our stochastic model can yield a more precise prediction of decoherence compared to a random coherence model. We also use gate set tomography (GST) to address the error generator and analyze the model violation coming from the non-Markovian effect. Based on the results, we attribute certain error generators of this model to the incoherence error, which avoids the scenario of using too large a coherent noise strength in the previous study to account for the experimentally observed decoherence times, and thus underestimates the gate fidelity. We also perform a gate optimization and show that our optimized control pulse can substantially reduce the error contribution of the incoherent non-Markovian 1/f charge noise. We further demonstrate that the optimized pulse against incoherent noise is more robust against coherent noise than the regular Gaussian pulse through a filter function analysis in a CPMG protocol, demonstrating the significant effectiveness of the optimized pulse.</p>

This combined approach reveals real-time energy exchange dynamics and reproduces key phenomena such as anti-crossing behavior and the suppression of ferromagnetic resonance under strong electromagnetic fields.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zheping Wu, Lingzhen Guo, Haobin Shi, Wei-Wei Zhang</p>
            <p>Bosonic codes represent a promising route toward quantum error correction in continuous-variable systems, with direct relevance to experimental platforms such as circuit QED and optomechanics. However, their preparation and stabilization remain highly challenging, requiring ultra-precise control of nonlinear interactions to create entangled superpositions, suppress decoherence, and mitigate dynamic errors. Here, we introduce a reinforcement-learning-assisted Floquet engineering approach for the autonomous preparation of bosonic codes that is general, efficient, and noise-resilient. By leveraging machine learning to optimize Floquet driving parameters, our method achieves over two orders of magnitude reduction in evolution time-requiring only about one percent of that in conventional adiabatic schemes-while maintaining high-fidelity state generation even under strong dissipative and dephasing noise. This approach not only demonstrates the power of artificial intelligence in quantum control but also establishes a scalable and experimentally feasible route toward fault-tolerant bosonic quantum computation. Beyond the specific application to bosonic code preparation, our results suggest a general paradigm for integrating machine learning and Floquet engineering to overcome decoherence challenges in next-generation quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Single-photon superradiance and subradiance in helical collectives of quantum emitters</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hamza Patwa, Philip Kurian</p>
            <p>Collective emission of light from distributions of two-level systems (TLSs) was first predicted in 1954 by Robert Dicke, who showed that when $N$ quantum emitters absorb photons, their collective radiative decay rate can be enhanced (superradiance) or suppressed (subradiance) relative to a single emitter. In this work, we derive novel analytical expressions for the collective decay rates and Lamb shifts for the interaction of a single photon with a continuous distribution of TLSs on an infinite line and an infinite helix. We compare these solutions to collectives of TLSs on a cylinder, finding limits in which the eigenvalues of structures of different dimensions are equal. We also compare our solution with arrangements where the emitter distribution is discrete rather than continuous, and when short- ($1/r^3$), intermediate- ($1/r^2$), and long-range ($1/r$) interaction terms are included. We find important differences between the discrete vector and continuous scalar emitter cases, which do not agree in the limit where discrete spacing goes to 0. The analytical solution for the helix is then used to make estimates of the maximally superradiant state, thermally averaged collective decay rate, and percentage of trapped states of quantum emitter architectures in protein fibers. Given the differences between our idealized infinite helix and the numerical model describing protein fibers, our analytical estimates show excellent agreement with the numerical results for sparse arrangements of emitters in protein fibers. Our work thus bridges the gap between different formalisms for superradiance, aids the engineering of devices which harness quantum optical effects for computing with superradiant error correction and subradiant memories, and motivates the discovery and creation of flexible platforms for quantum information processing using the intrinsic helical geometries of biomatter.</p>

            <h2>Generation and Detection of Hyperentangled Bell States at an Ultra-High Flux</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Netanel P. Yaish, Samata Gokhale, Avi Peer</p>
            <p>We demonstrate both the generation and detection of an ultra-high flux of polarization Bell states using broadband hyper-entangled bi-photons that are quantum-correlated in both polarization and time-energy. Bell states of polarization embody the most basic form of two-state entanglement, and are a key component of quantum protocols of communication and sensing. High-speed generation, processing and detection of polarization Bell-states is therefore critical for quantum technology. However, all current protocols that employ polarization entangled photons are inherently slow, primarily due to the photo-detectors (Photomultiplier tubes, avalanche photo-diodes, etc.) that can handle only $10^{6-7}$ photons/s, whereas sources may easily produce $10^{10-13}$ photons/s or more (if properly designed). We fully alleviate this detection bottleneck by resorting to physical detection of the bi-photons with nonlinear interferometry. We harness a generalized, dual polarization SU1,1 interferometer to generate, manipulate \textit{and measure} all the triplet Bell-states at a flux of $\sim\!5\times10^{11}$ photons/s, enhancing the speed of quantum processing by >5 orders of magnitude compared to standard methods.</p>

            <p>The high-rate detection of entangled photons is essential for advancing photonic quantum information processing. Although several experimental demonstrations have been reported, the achievable coincidence rates have so far remained limited. One of the main bottlenecks arises from the dead time of single-photon detectors, which constrains coincidence detection at high photon-pair generation rates. In this work, we employ 16-pixel superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) to mitigate the impact of detector dead time. Consequently, we achieve coincidence rates exceeding 3 million counts per second (Mcps) in two-photon interference and CHSH inequality experiments using 5-GHz clocked sequential time-bin entangled photon pair source. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of multi-Mcps coincidence detection of entangled photons, paving the way for high-speed entangled-photon-based quantum information processing.</p>

            <p>Motivated by recent claims, we revisit how coherent perfect absorption (CPA) influences cavity and polaritonic linewidths. Using standard input output theory and measurements on single port bare microwave cavities and cavity magnon hybrids, we find that CPA drives the on resonance reflection to zero while the spectral width remains set by the total decay rate. Apparent narrowing observed near CPA is found to be a visual artifact that does not remain upon quantitative analysis. Extending the analysis to cavity magnomechanics, we show that logarithmic plots can exhibit apparent polaromechanical normal mode splitting, whereas linear scale spectra display no true splitting. These results clarify when CPA modifies amplitudes versus spectral poles, offer practical guidance for data presentation, and indicate that CPA alone is not a route to linewidth suppression or polaromechanical mode splitting in the linear, weak-probe regime.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eugene V. Sukhorukov, Adrien Tomà</p>
            <p>We develop a unified perturbative framework for energy transport along a chiral quantum Hall (QH) edge coupled to a disordered, compressible strip. Treating the strip as a generic linear response environment characterized by its retarded susceptibility $\chi_q^R(k,\omega)$, we derive leading-order interaction corrections to both the edge heat flux and the plasmon spectrum. Two complementary regimes are analyzed: (i) a gapped, local dielectric response with finite-range coupling, which yields a universal negative $T^4$ correction to the quantized heat flux and a corresponding convex cubic term in the plasmon dispersion; and (ii) a hydrodynamic (diffusive) response with relaxation, producing a crossover from $T^4$ to $T^{3/2}$ scaling and a change of sign in the correction. The resulting backaction reduces the plasmon group velocity and can suppress the apparent thermal conductance by an amount consistent with experiment. Importantly, the total heat flux remains quantized: the apparent deficit in the plasmon contribution corresponds to an induced energy flow within the compressible strip, representing a form of heat drag between chiral and nonchiral modes. The framework thus provides a microscopic and quantitatively plausible explanation of the ``missing heat flux'' anomaly observed at QH edges and links its transport signature to the nonlinearity of the plasmon spectrum.</p>

The key idea is that the vacuum state of gravitons may not be the standard Minkowski vacuum but rather a nonclassical state imprinted with the physics of the early Universe, such as inflation. Accordingly, gravitational waves from binary systems provide a means to probe the graviton states generated in the early Universe. As a concrete example, we show that squeezed graviton states originating from inflation may be detected through the observation of gravitational waves from binary systems.</p>

            <p>Quantum entanglement is a fundamental feature of quantum mechanics, yet certain entangled states that are unsteerable can be classically simulated in steering scenarios, making them unable to exhibit quantum steering. Despite their significance, a systematic comparison of such entangled states has not been explored. In this work, we quantify the resource content of unsteerable quantum states in terms of the amount of shared randomness required to simulate the assemblages they generate in the steering scenario. We rigorously demonstrate that the simulation cost is unbounded even for certain unsteerable two-qubit states. Moreover, the simulation cost of entangled two-qubit states is always strictly larger than that for any separable state. A significant portion of our results rests on the relationship between the simulation cost of two-qubit Werner states and that of noisy spin measurements. Using noisy spin measurements as our central example, we also investigate the minimum number of outcomes a parent measurement requires to simulate a given set of compatible measurements. Although certain continuous measurement families admit a finite-outcome parent measurement, we identify scenarios where the simulation cost is unbounded. Our results establish previously unknown lower bounds and upper bounds on the shared randomness simulation cost, supported by connections between the simulation cost of noisy spin measurements and various geometric inequalities, including ones from the zonotope approximation problem in Banach space theory.</p>

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to well-established models, including the Axial Next Nearest Neighbour Interaction (ANNNI) model, a cluster state model, and a chain of Rydberg atoms. By analyzing observable decompositions into eigen-projectors and finite-size scaling, our method successfully identifies order parameters and characterizes quantum phase transitions with high precision.

            <p>In pursuit of large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computation, quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes have been established as promising candidates for low-overhead memory when compared to conventional approaches based on surface codes. Performing fault-tolerant logical computation on QLDPC memory, however, has been a long standing challenge in theory and in practice. In this work, we propose a new primitive, which we call an $\textit{extractor system}$, that can augment any QLDPC memory into a computational block well-suited for Pauli-based computation. In particular, any logical Pauli operator supported on the memory can be fault-tolerantly measured in one logical cycle, consisting of $O(d)$ physical syndrome measurement cycles, without rearranging qubit connectivity. We further propose a fixed-connectivity, LDPC architecture built by connecting many extractor-augmented computational (EAC) blocks with bridge systems. When combined with any user-defined source of high fidelity $|T\rangle$ states, our architecture can implement universal quantum circuits via parallel logical measurements, such that all single-block Clifford gates are compiled away. The size of an extractor on an $n$ qubit code is $\tilde{O}(n)$, where the precise overhead has immense room for practical optimizations.</p>

            <h2>PT symmetry and the square well potential: Antilinear symmetry rather than Hermiticity in scattering processes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Philip D. Mannheim</p>
            <p>While a Hamiltonian with a real potential acts as a Hermitian operator when it operates on bound states, it produces resonances with complex energies in a scattering experiment. The scattering states are not square integrable, being instead delta function normalized. This lack of square integrability breaks the connection between Hermiticity and real eigenvalues, to thus allow for real bound state sector eigenvalues and complex scattering sector eigenvalues. When written as contour integrals delta functions take support in the complex plane, with the scattering amplitude taking support in the complex energy plane too. However, the scattering amplitude is $CPT$ symmetric (or $PT$ symmetric if $C$ is conserved), regardless of whether or not states are square integrable. For resonance scattering this antilinear symmetry requires the presence of a complex conjugate pair of energies, one to describe the excitation of the resonance and the other to describe its decay, with it being their interplay that enforces probability conservation. Each complex pair of energy eigenvalues corresponds to only one observable resonance not two, to thus modify the standard pure decaying complex energy pole discussion of resonances. We show that the non-relativistic square-well problem with a real potential possesses $PT$ symmetry in both the bound and scattering sectors, with there being complex conjugate pairs of energy eigenvalues in the scattering sector. Despite this there is just the same number of observable resonances as in the pure decaying sector. We show that the square-well scattering threshold branch point is an exceptional point (a characteristic of antilinear symmetry) at which the Hamiltonian becomes of non-diagonalizable, and thus non-Hermitian, Jordan-block form. The square-well potential thus provides an explicit realization of how antlinearity is more general than Hermiticity.</p>

For spins on an arbitrary graph, we construct a Lindbladian that maps to a non-Hermitian model of free Majorana fermions hopping on the graph with a background classical $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field. We show, analytically and numerically, that the steady states and relaxation dynamics are qualitatively independent of the choice of the underlying graph, in stark contrast to the Hamiltonian case. We also show that the exponentially many steady states provide a concrete example of mixed-state topological order, in the sense of strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking of a one-form symmetry. While encoding only classical information, the steady states still exhibit long-range quantum correlations. Afterward, we examine the relaxation processes toward the steady state by numerically computing decay rates, which we generically find to be finite, even in the dissipationless limit. However, we identify symmetry sectors where fermion-parity conservation is enhanced to fermion-number conservation, where we can analytically bound the decay rates and prove that they vanish in the limits of both infinitely weak and infinitely strong dissipation. Finally, we show that while the choice of coherent dynamics is very flexible, exact solvability strongly constrains the allowed form of dissipation. Our work establishes an analytically tractable framework to explore nonequilibrium quantum phases of matter and the relaxation mechanisms toward them.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nathan Seiberg, Shu-Heng Shao, Wucheng Zhang</p>
            <p>We study a number of 1+1d lattice models with anti-unitary symmetries that simultaneously reflect space and reverse time. Some of these symmetries are anomalous, leading to Lieb-Schultz-Mattis-type constraints, thus excluding a trivially gapped phase. Examples include a mod 8 anomaly in the Majorana chain and various mod 2 anomalies in the spin chain. In some cases, there is an exact, non-anomalous lattice symmetry that flows in the continuum to CPT. In some other cases, the CPT symmetry of the continuum theory is emergent or absent. Depending on the model, the anomaly of the lattice model is matched in the continuum in different ways. In particular, it can be mapped to an emergent anomaly of an emanant symmetry.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Coherence as a Thermodynamic Resource Beyond the Classical Uncertainty Bound</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shanhe Su, Cong Fu, Ousi Pan, Shihao Xia, Fei Liu, Jincan Chen</p>
            <p>The precision of nonequilibrium thermodynamic systems is fundamentally limited, yet how quantum coherence shapes these limits remains largely unexplored. A general theoretical framework is introduced that explicitly links quantum coherence to thermodynamic uncertainty relations. By defining a coherence-sensitive measure, it is shown that quantum effects can relax the classical trade-off between the entropy production and the current fluctuations, enabling the precision beyond classical bounds. Application to a three-level quantum maser illustrates the framework in a concrete setting. These results establish quantum coherence as a genuine thermodynamic resource and provide a unified perspective connecting classical and quantum approaches to nonequilibrium thermodynamics.</p>

            <h2>Picosecond Wireless Synchronization with Entangled Photons via Grid-Based Quantum Coverage in Indoor Optical Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hossein Safi, Mohammad Taghi Dabiri, Mazen Hasna, Iman Tavakkolnia, Harald Haas</p>
            <p>In this paper, we propose a novel entanglement-assisted synchronization framework for indoor optical wireless systems based on grid-based beam steering. A central transmitter equipped with a spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) source emits time-energy entangled photon pairs, directing user photons toward spatially defined grids based on estimated user positions, while retaining reference photons for timestamping. The room is partitioned into multiple beam-aligned regions, and photon reception probability is analytically modeled using local coordinate transformations and Gaussian beam optics. To address the inherent sparsity and randomness of photon detection, we develop a robust two-stage synchronization algorithm that performs sparse bit-pattern matching and timestamp averaging to estimate timing offsets. Monte Carlo simulations are then performed to evaluate the impact of synchronization duration, grid resolution, and photon-pair generation rate on synchronization accuracy. Results show that finer grid configurations and optimal photon-pair rates significantly reduce synchronization error, achieving sub-10 ps timing accuracy within 1 ms of synchronization time. The proposed approach enables scalable, high-precision quantum synchronization in wireless indoor environments, laying the groundwork for future joint quantum communication, sensing, and positioning systems.</p>

            <h2>Hybrid Lattice Surgery: Non-Clifford Gates via Non-Abelian Surface Codes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sheng-Jie Huang, Alison Warman, Sakura Schafer-Nameki, Yanzhu Chen</p>
            <p>In universal fault-tolerant quantum computing, implementing logical non-Clifford gates often demands substantial spacetime resources for many error-correcting codes, including the high-threshold surface code. A critical mission for realizing large-scale quantum computing is to develop simple and resource-efficient implementations of logical non-Clifford gates. We propose a novel way of implementing non-Clifford operations in the standard surface code based on hybrid lattice surgery. First we generalize the standard lattice surgery to hybrid lattice surgery, where operations of rough merge and rough split happen across different topological codes. Then we apply such procedures between Abelian and non-Abelian codes and show that this can provide non-Clifford operations in the standard surface code, in the form of a magic state or a non-Clifford gate teleportation. Complementing this, we provide a continuum topological field theory description of this hybrid lattice surgery utilizing interfaces between (2+1)d topological orders. From these considerations, we can generalize our protocol to non-Clifford gates and magic states at all finite levels of the Clifford hierarchy, as well as gates beyond the hierarchy. We also discuss protocols extending this framework to qutrits.</p>

            <h2>Local-to-Global Entanglement Dynamics by Periodically Driving Impurities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhi-Xing Lin, Abhinav Prem, Shinsei Ryu, Bastien Lapierre</p>
            <p>We study the entanglement dynamics of a one-dimensional spin chain subject to a local Floquet drive of a two-site impurity. We uncover a sharp transition in the entanglement dynamics as a function of the driving frequency. For large drive periods $T$, we observe a linear growth in entanglement entropy (EE), indicating a heating phase with volume law entanglement. Surprisingly, for driving periods below a critical value $T_\ast$, the EE grows subextensively with time, characteristic of a local quantum quench. In the non-interacting limit, we analytically trace the origin of this phenomenon to a transition in the single-particle Floquet quasi-energy spectrum. We also find that for $T>T_*$, the so-called ``average energy" operator develops non-local, rainbow-like couplings that are responsible for the rapid entanglement growth in the heating phase, but remains local for $T<T_*$. Using extensive matrix-product-state simulations, we show that the non-heating phase and the subextensive entanglement growth persist in the presence of weak interactions for numerically accessible timescales. Our results establish that local Floquet engineering can generate emergent bulk phenomena, shedding new light on energy localization and thermalization in driven many-body systems.</p>

            <h2>Fragmentation of Virtual Orbitals for Quantum Computing: Reducing Qubit Requirements through Many-Body Expansion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Federico Zahariev, Mark S. Gordon</p>
            <p>The development of quantum computing for molecular simulations is constrained by the limited number of qubits available on current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. The present work introduces the Virtual Orbital Fragmentation (FVO) method, a systematic approach that reduces qubit requirements by 40--66\% while maintaining chemical accuracy. The method partitions the virtual orbital space into chemically intuitive fragments and employs many-body expansion techniques analogous to spatial fragmentation methods. Applications to six molecular systems demonstrate that the 2-body FVO expansion achieves errors below 3 kcal/mol, while the 3-body expansion provides sub-kcal/mol accuracy. When integrated with the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and combined with the Effective Fragment Molecular Orbital (EFMO) method for multi-molecular systems, the hierarchical Q-EFMO-FVO approach achieves 96--100\% accuracy relative to full calculations. The method provides a practical pathway for quantum chemical calculations on current 50--100 qubit processors and establishes virtual orbital fragmentation as a complementary strategy to spatial fragmentation for managing quantum computational complexity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S. Palafox, M. Salado-Mejía, M. Santiago-García, R. Román-Ancheyta</p>
            <p>In the deep-strong coupling (DSC) regime, the interaction between light and matter exceeds their bare frequencies, leading to an effective decoupling. Theoretical and experimental evidence for this behavior has relied solely on measurements of local observables at equilibrium. However, such a local approach is insufficient to accurately describe energy fluxes in critical and nonequilibrium phenomena. Here, we use a two-terminal quantum junction to derive a thermodynamically consistent global master equation. We demonstrate that the associated heat current, a key nonlocal observable in any quantum thermal machine, also approaches zero in this extreme coupling scenario, underscoring the role of virtual photons in the vacuum ground state. Our results indicate that the decoupling is a more general feature of the DSC regime, with implications for quantum thermotronics.</p>

            <h2>Harnessing Intrinsic Noise for Quantum Simulation of Open Quantum Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sameer Dambal, Akira Sone, Yu Zhang</p>
            <p>Simulating open quantum systems on quantum computers presents a fundamental challenge: open quantum dynamics are intrinsically nonunitary, whereas quantum computers operate through unitary evolution. Conventional approaches overcome this mismatch by encoding nonunitary processes into unitary circuits, but such methods incur substantial overhead in both qubits and gates. Here, we propose an alternative perspective. Quantum processors are themselves open systems, inherently subject to noise. Instead of correcting all errors and then encoding nonunitary dynamics with unitary logical qubits and gates, we show how noise can be harnessed as a computational resource. We develop a noise-assisted quantum algorithm that selectively preserves physical noise to emulate nonunitary channels, enabling efficient simulation of open quantum dynamics with minimal qubit requirements. Our approach applies both to noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices and future fault-tolerant architectures. By leveraging intrinsic noise, this method circumvents the need to encode nonunitary dynamics into unitary gates and relaxes fidelity requirements on physical qubits, thereby reducing the overhead of quantum error correction. This framework reframes noise from a limitation into a resource, opening new directions for practical quantum simulation of open systems</p>

            <h2>A broadband single microwave-photon detector insensitive to the thermal noise</h2>

            <p>Thermal noise is one of the physical obstacles that constrain the achievable detection sensitivities of various detectors. Indeed, as we showed in a recent paper (PRB 111, 024501 (2025)), the usual Josephson threshold detector (JTD) operated in an equilibrium state can be utilized to implement a weak microwave signal, just approaching (but not arriving at) its energy quantum limit, even though its physical parameters have been optimized. In this letter, we further demonstrate numerically that the phase dynamics of a current-biased Josephson junction (CBJJ) can be insensitive to the always-on thermal noise if the sweep rate of the biased current is significantly high. As a consequence, the JTD can be operated alternatively in a non-equilibrium state. Based on the statistical binary detection criterion, we demonstrate how such a non-equilibrium JTD (NEJTD) can be utilized to implement the weak microwave signal, arriving at its energy quantum limit level. The dynamic range and photon-number resolvability of the proposed NEJTD are also discussed when it serves as a broadband single microwave-photon detector.</p>

            <p>Quantum clock synchronization underpins modern secure communications and critical infrastructure, yet its fundamental dependence on channel reciprocity introduces an exploitable vulnerability to asymmetric delay attacks. Current attack strategies rely on static delays, limiting their ability to target application-specific stability requirements. Here, we propose a tunable asymmetric delay attack (T-ADA) that dynamically controls delay parameters to induce manipulate synchronization accuracy. Through experimental implementation, we demonstrate how tailored attack trajectories can selectively compromise system stability across different scenarios. This work uncovers key vulnerabilities in synchronization protocols under customizable attacks and provide a foundation for developing secure and resilient quantum clock synchronization systems.</p>

            <h2>Role of inefficient measurement in realizing post-selection-based non-Hermitian qubits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Roson Nongthombam, Aman Verma, Amarendra K. Sarma</p>
            <p>Post-selecting against quantum jumps into the ground state confines the evolution of the three-level system to the excited states manifold, effectively realizing a PT-symmetric non-Hermitian qubit. In this work, by introducing post-selection efficiencies for both decay channels, the second-excited to first-excited and the first-excited to ground-state transitions, we formulate a hybrid-Liouvillian framework that captures the unmonitored dynamics of the non-Hermitian qubit. We find that the decoherence effects arising from quantum jumps within the second-excited and first-excited manifold also manifest under inefficient post-selection of the second-excited to first-excited transitions, thereby modifying the spectral properties of the Liouvillian and leading to a splitting of the exceptional points. A comparative analysis shows that the trajectory-based approach, obtained by ensemble-averaging stochastic measurement trajectories generated via the Bayesian state update rule, and the Lindblad evolution remain consistent. Our results highlight the fundamental role of measurement inefficiency in realizing post-selection-based non-Hermitian qubits and in shaping the structure of Liouvillian exceptional points. These findings provide new insights into how inefficient measurement processes influence non-Hermitian behavior in open quantum systems.</p>

We introduce adaptation strategies that extend variational quantum circuit models, traditionally limited to univariate data, toward the multivariate setting, exploring both purely quantum and hybrid quantum-classical formulations. First, we extend and benchmark several VQC-based and hybrid architectures to systematically evaluate their capacity to model cross-variable dependencies. Second, building upon these foundations, we introduce the iQTransformer, a novel quantum transformer architecture that integrates a quantum self-attention mechanism within the iTransformer framework, enabling a quantum-native representation of inter-variable relationships. Third, we provide a comprehensive empirical evaluation on both synthetic and real-world datasets, showing that quantum-based models may achieve competitive or superior forecasting accuracy with fewer trainable parameters and faster convergence than state-of-the-art classical and quantum baselines in some cases. These contributions highlight the potential of quantum-enhanced architectures as efficient and scalable tools for advancing multivariate time-series forecasting.</p>

            <p>Non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with complex eigenenergies are useful tools for describing the dynamics of open quantum systems. In particular, parity and time (\PT) symmetric Hamiltonians have generated interest due to the emergence of exceptional-point degeneracies, where both eigenenergies and eigenvectors coalesce as the energy spectrum transitions from real- to complex-valued. Because of the abrupt spectral response near exceptional points, such systems have been proposed as candidates for precision quantum sensing. In this work, we emulate a passive \PT~dimer using a two-mode, non-Hermitian system of superconducting qubits comprising one high-coherence qubit coupled to an intentionally lossy qubit via a tunable coupler. The loss is introduced by strongly coupling the qubit to a continuum of photonic modes in an open waveguide environment. Using both pulsed and continuous-wave measurements, we characterize the system dynamics near the exceptional point. We observe a behavior broadly consistent with an ideal passive \PT~dimer with some corrections due to the tunable coupler element. We extract the complex eigenenergies associated with the two modes and calculate the sensitivity as a function of the coupling strength. Confirming theoretical predictions, we observe no sensitivity enhancement near the quantum exceptional point. This study elucidates the limitations of exceptional-point systems as candidates for quantum-enhanced sensing.</p>

            <p>Since Landau's theory, polarons have been understood as quasiparticles in which charges are dressed by the lattice field, yet decades of transport and spectroscopic studies have yielded only static indirect renormalizations. Whether such dressing can dynamically reorganize electronic spectra to generate new quantum-coherent states has remained unresolved. Here we use femtosecond coherent multidimensional spectroscopy on size and composition controlled perovskite quantum dots to track polaronic field-induced dynamics in real time, revealing their consequences. We observe a delayed condensation into a confined spectrum of coherent states on 50-150 fs timescales, with couplings between these states evolving dynamically on the same timescale. The splittings are robust, exhibit anomalous linear size dependence, exceed single-particle splittings and manifest at 300 K. A Raman-constrained spin-boson Hamiltonian captures both the anomalous scaling and dynamical onset, establishing polarons as generators of coherent manifolds that enable collective quantum phenomena including superradiance, superfluorescence and superabsorption.</p>

            <p>Light scattering plays an essential role in uncovering the properties of quantum states through light-matter interactions. Here, we explore the transition from Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) to droplets in a dipolar $^{166}$Er gas by employing superradiant light scattering as both a probing and controlling tool. We observe that the efficiency of superradiant scattering exhibits a non-monotonic behavior akin to the rate of sample expansion during the transition, signaling its sensitivity to the initial quantum state, and in turn, revealing the BEC-droplet transition. Through controlled atom depletion via superradiance, we analyze the sample's expansion dynamics and aspect ratio to identify the BEC-droplet phases distinctly, supported by Gaussian variational ansatz calculations. Finally, using these two approaches, we track how the BEC-droplet transition points shift under varying magnetic field orientations. Our work opens new avenues for studying quantum states through superradiance, advancing our understanding of both the BEC-droplet crossover and its coherence properties.</p>

            <p>Coherent control of quantum emitters is essential for scalable quantum photonic technologies. The recently proposed swing-up of quantum emitter (SUPER) scheme enables the coherent preparation of excitons via off-resonant, red-detuned laser pulses, offering highly efficient single-photon generation. We present a systematic study of SUPER excitation applied to a single GaAs quantum dot in a low-Q micropillar cavity. After identifying optimal excitation conditions, we benchmark the SUPER scheme against above-band, p-shell, and two-photon biexciton excitation (TPE). Despite requiring higher excitation powers, SUPER achieves near-unity population inversion ($\sim$95 %) and high single-photon purity ($g^{(2)}=0.03$), comparable to TPE, while also yielding a shortened exciton decay time ($\sim$200 ps), indicative of direct, efficient exciton preparation. A polarization-resolved analysis reveals that, when both excitation and collection are aligned with the exciton dipole, SUPER results in a highly polarized single-photon emission exceeding resonant TPE saturation by a factor of 1.45. Under optimal excitation conditions, we also observe biexciton preparation via a distinct SUPER resonance, confirmed by unpolarized exciton emission, extended lifetime due to the biexciton-exciton cascade, and biexciton emission, constituting the first experimental demonstrations of biexciton preparation under SUPER. These findings are in good agreement with a proposed four-level theoretical model including the biexciton. We also report that, strikingly, a slight misalignment of laser polarization induces an additional SUPER resonance that selectively populates the orthogonal exciton state without altering the nominal excitation polarization. These findings establish the SUPER scheme as a versatile tool for state-selective exciton and biexciton control, with strong potential for quantum photonic applications.</p>

By applying quantum optimal control methods, we demonstrate that such a protocol emerges naturally in a variety of settings, without requiring assumptions on the form of the control fields. Examples include Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state preparation in Ising spin chains and two-dimensional Rydberg atom arrays, as well as the generation of quantum spin liquid states in frustrated Rydberg lattices. Our results highlight the broad applicability of this protocol, providing a practical framework for reliable many-body state preparation in present-day quantum platforms.</p>

            <p>Flat-band systems offer a uniquely powerful tool for quantum control in dynamics due to their characteristic feature of having a dispersionless energy band. Simulating such highly sensitive systems on current digital quantum computers is a challenging task, due to the intrinsic limitations of the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. Here we present high-fidelity digital quantum simulations of flat-band (FB) and all-bands-flat (ABF) lattices, using an advanced tensor-network-based circuit compression method. With the compressed quantum circuits, we first explore single-particle dynamics and observe two distinct behaviours: strong localization in ABF lattices and delocalization in FB lattices. By integrating FB and ABF lattices into a one-dimensional hybrid structure, we achieve controllable quantum transport, where the ABF lattice acts as a quantum switch. Extending to two-particle dynamics, we show that transport remains controllable by tuning the hopping amplitude alone, even in the presence of interactions. These results establish flat-band engineered systems as a promising pathway for scalable control of quantum transport in emerging quantum technologies, with potential applications in qubit isolation, particle trapping, and state transfer.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) dipolar atomic gases present unique opportunities for exploring novel quantum phases due to their anisotropic and long-range interactions. However, the behavior of strongly dipolar Bose gases in 2D remains unclear, especially when dipoles are tilted. Here, we demonstrate the creation and characterization of strongly dipolar 2D condensates in a quasi-2D harmonic trap with tunable dipole orientation. By investigating scale invariance properties through breathing collective mode measurements, we observe significant breaking of scale invariance when dipoles are tilted in-plane indicating the dominance of the nonlocal dipole-dipole interactions (DDIs) in this regime. Interestingly, the breaking of the scale invariant dynamics is accompanied by an increase in quantum fluctuations, as shown by comparison with mean-field and beyond mean-field theoretical studies. Our experiments also reveal that at critical tilt angles around 70°, stripe-type density modulations emerge, suggesting the presence of a roton spectrum in 2D, while the system still shows hydrodynamic nature with the phase-locking breathing behavior. This observation elucidates the many-body effect induced by DDIs in 2D, thus marking a crucial step toward realizing 2D supersolids and other exotic quantum phases.</p>

            <h2>Mind the gaps: The fraught road to quantum advantage</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jens Eisert, John Preskill</p>
            <p>Quantum computing is advancing rapidly, yet substantial gaps separate today's noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices from tomorrow's fault-tolerant application-scale (FASQ) machines. We identify four related hurdles along the road ahead: (i) from error mitigation to active error detection and correction, (ii) from rudimentary error correction to scalable fault tolerance, (iii) from early heuristics to mature, verifiable algorithms, and (iv) from exploratory simulators to credible advantage in quantum simulation. Targeting these transitions will accelerate progress toward broadly useful quantum computing.</p>

            <h2>A transmon qubit realized by exploiting the superconductor-insulator transition</h2>

            <p>Superconducting qubits are among the most promising platforms for realizing practical quantum computers. One requirement to create a quantum processor is nonlinearity, which in superconducting circuits is typically achieved by sandwiching a layer of aluminum oxide between two aluminum electrodes to form a Josephson junction. These junctions, however, face several limitations that hinder their scalability: the small superconducting gap of aluminum necessitates millikelvin operating temperatures, the material interfaces lead to dissipation, and the sandwich geometry adds unwelcome capacitance for high-frequency applications. In this work, we address all three limitations using a novel superconducting weak link based on the superconductor-insulator transition. By locally thinning a single film of niobium nitride, we exploit its thickness-driven superconductor-insulator transition to form a weak link employing only atomic layer deposition and atomic layer etching. We utilize our weak links to produce a transmon qubit, '$planaron$', with a measured anharmonicity of $\alpha/2\pi = 235$ MHz; at present, the linewidth is $\kappa/2\pi = 15 \mathrm{\: MHz}$. The high superconducting gap of niobium nitride can enable operation at elevated temperatures in future devices, and the fully planar geometry of the weak link eliminates superfluous material interfaces and capacitances. The investigation of small patches of material near the SIT can shed new light on the nature of the transition, including the role of dissipation and finite-size effects.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Nonlinear Response of Emitter Lattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Blas Durá-Azorín, Antonio I. Fernández-Domínguez, Alejandro Manjavacas</p>
            <p>We theoretically investigate the emergence of quantum nonlinearities in the optical response of lattices of two-level quantum emitters coherently driven by a laser. For subwavelength lattice periods, where the system behaves as a quantum metasurface, we find that a resonant incident plane wave can populate excitonic Bloch states with parallel wavevectors different from the incident field, including those lying outside the light cone. Closely related to resonance fluorescence, the far-field emission from the system in the strong-driving regime is dominated by a broadband background of photons spanning a wide range of frequencies and wavevectors. Moreover, we show that, for periods approaching the driving wavelength, the emitter lattice enters in a bistable regime due to the renormalization of the driving rate, in striking contrast with its classical (bosonic) analog. This bistable behavior enables the selective activation and deactivation of the optical quantum nonlinearities of the system.</p>

            <h2>Exact State Evolution and Energy Spectrum in Solvable Bosonic Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Valery Shchesnovich</p>
            <p>Solvable bosonic models provide a fundamental framework for describing light propagation in nonlinear media, including optical down-conversion processes that generate squeezed states of light and their higher-order generalizations. In quantum optics a central objective is to determine the time evolution of a given initial state. Exact analytic solution to the state-evolution problem is presented, applicable to a broad class of solvable bosonic models and arbitrary initial states. Moreover, the characteristic equation governing the energy spectrum is derived and the eigenstates are found in the form of continued fractions and as principal minors of the associated Jacobi matrix. The results provide a solid analytical framework for discussion of exactly solvable bosonic models.</p>

            <p>We second quantize the standard electromagnetic Lagrangian with a subsiduary Lorenz gauge constraint to obtain a covariant theory of the discrete excitations of the classical EM field that can properly be called photons. The longitudinal photon number is zero due to cancellation of Gupta-Bleuler like terms. Physical photons are described by a real number density whose spatial integral is unity so it can be interpreted as the probability density to find a photon at position x'. Energy density is not separated into is positive and negative frequency parts so the nonlocal frequency operator is not required.</p>

            <h2>Variational quantum simulation of many-body dissipative dynamics on a superconducting quantum processor</h2>

            <p>Open quantum systems host a wide range of intriguing phenomena, yet their simulation on well-controlled quantum devices is challenging, owing to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space and the inherently non-unitary nature of the dynamics. Here we propose and experimentally demonstrate a variational quantum algorithm capable of scalable simulation of non-unitary many-body dissipative dynamics. The algorithm builds on the framework of linear combination of Hamiltonian simulation, which converts non-unitary dynamics into a weighted sum of unitary evolutions. With the further introduction of a simplified quantum circuit for loss-function evaluation, our scheme is suitable for near-term quantum hardware, with the circuit depth independent of the simulation time. We illustrate our scheme by simulating the collective dynamics of a dissipative transverse Ising model, as well as an interacting Hatano-Nelson model, on the superconducting quantum processor Wukong. Our work underlines the capability of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices in simulating dissipative many-body dynamics and represents a step forward in exploiting their potential for solving outstanding physical problems.</p>

            <h2>Parametric Phase Modulation in Superconducting Circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhuang Ma, Xianke Li, Hongyi Shi, Ruonan Guo, Jianwen Xu, Xinsheng Tan, Yang Yu</p>
            <p>Parametric modulation is widely employed in superconducting circuits for quantum simulations and high-fidelity two-qubit gates, valued for its versatility. Conventionally, the qubit coupling strength is determined by the amplitude of the parametric flux pulse, which affects qubit parameters dramatically. In this article, we propose and implement a phase modulation scheme to tune the interaction strength via adjusting the relative phase between the parametric flux pulses applied to two coupled qubits. We characterize this modulation for sideband couplings, at both sweet and offsweet spots, achieving a broad range of coupling strengths as confirmed by both population dynamics and spectroscopy methods. This approach enables phase-controlled modulation of coupling strength, providing a promising candidate for parametrically driven quantum simulations and gate operations.</p>

            <h2>Restoring Quantum Superiority of Noisy Quantum Illumination</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei Wu, Jun-Hong An</p>
            <p>Quantum illumination uses quantum entanglement as a resource to enable higher-resolution detection of low-reflectivity targets than is possible with classical techniques. This revolutionary technology could transform modern radar. However, it is widely believed that the decoherence induced by the ubiquitous quantum noise destroys the superiority of quantum illumination, severely constraining its performance and application in our present noisy intermediate-scale quantum era. Here, we propose a method to restore the quantum superiority of the quantum illumination in the presence of quantum noises. Going beyond the widely used Born-Markov approximation, we discover that the resolution of noisy quantum illumination is highly sensitive to the energy spectrum of the composite system formed by each of the two light modes and its local quantum noise. When a bound state is present in the energy spectrum, the resolution asymptotically approaches its ideal form. Our result establishes a physical principle to preserve the quantum superiority and paves the way for the realization of high-resolution quantum illumination in noisy situations.</p>

            <p>Quantum networks and quantum repeaters represent the promising avenues for building large-scale quantum information systems, serving as foundational infrastructure for distributed quantum computing, long-distance quantum communication, and networked quantum sensing. A critical step in realizing a functional quantum network is the efficient and high-fidelity establishment of heralded entanglement between remote quantum nodes. Multiplexing offers a powerful strategy to accelerate remote entanglement distribution, particularly over long optical fibers. Here, we demonstrate the first multiplexing-enhanced heralded entanglement between two trapped-ion quantum network nodes. By multiplexing $10$ temporal photonic modes, we achieve a 4.59-fold speedup in ion-ion entanglement generation and attain an entanglement fidelity of $95.9\pm1.5\%$ over $1.2$ km of fiber. Employing a dual-type architecture, our system is readily scalable to multiple nodes, thereby establishing a key building block for future large-scale quantum networks.</p>

            <h2>Phase Transitions and Virtual Exceptional Points in Quantum Emitters Coupled to Dissipative Baths</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stefano Longhi</p>
            <p>Controlling atom-photon interactions in engineered environments is central to quantum optics and emerging quantum technologies. Non-Hermitian (NH) photonic baths, where dissipation fundamentally reshapes spectral and dynamical properties, provide versatile platforms for such control. Here we investigate the relaxation dynamics of a single two-level quantum emitter coupled to the edge of a semi-infinite dissipative bosonic lattice with uniform loss. Despite the simplicity of this bath, we uncover rich dynamical phase transitions, i.e. qualitative changes in spontaneous emission decay as system parameters are varied. In particular, we establish the existence of an optimal dissipative environment for accelerated spontaneous emission. The phase transitions are traced to spectral restructuring of the resolvent, in some cases governed by the coalescence of resonance states on the second Riemann sheet. We identify these coalescences as virtual exceptional points (EPs) of resonance origin, providing a conceptual bridge with EP physics while highlighting distinctive features of infinite-dimensional NH systems. More broadly, our results illustrate how the specific nature of dissipation -- whether uniform losses, staggered losses, or dephasing -- can profoundly impact emitter relaxation, pointing to dissipation engineering as a versatile tool for quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Circuit-based cavity magnonics in the ultrastrong and deep-strong coupling regimes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Takahiro Chiba, Ryunosuke Suzuki, Takashi Otaki, Hiroaki Matsueda</p>
            <p>We theoretically study nonperturbative strong-coupling phenomena in cavity magnonics systems in which the uniform magnetization dynamics (magnons) in a ferromagnet is coupled to the microwave magnetic field (photons) of a single LC resonator. Starting from an effective circuit model that accounts for the magnetization dynamics described by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, we show that a nontrivial frequency shift emerges in the ultrastrong and deep-strong coupling regimes, whose microscopic origin remains elusive within a purely classical framework. The circuit model is further quantized to derive a minimal quantum mechanical model for generic cavity magnonics, which corresponds to a two-mode version of the Hopfield Hamiltonian and explains the mechanism of the frequency shifts found in the {\it classical} circuit model. We also formulate the relation between the frequency shift and quantum quantities, such as the ground-state particle number, quantum fluctuations associated with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, and entanglement entropy, providing a nondestructive means to experimentally access to these quantum resources. By utilizing soft magnons in an anisotropic ferromagnet, we further demonstrate that these quantum quantities diverge at the zeros of the magnon band edges as a function of the external magnetic field. This work paves the way for cavity magnonics beyond the conventional strong coupling regime.</p>

            <h2>Hybrid Cavity-Magnon Optomechanics: Tailoring Bipartite and Tripartite Macroscopic Entanglement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qin-Geng Chen, Ming-Yue Liu, Xian-Xian Huang, Jiaojiao Chen, Wei Xiong</p>
            <p>Cavity optomechanics, providing an inherently nonlinear interaction between photons and phonons, have shown enomerous potential in generating macroscopic quantum entanglement. Here we propose to realize diverse bipartite and tripartite entanglement in cavity-magnon optomechanics. By introducing magnons to standard cavity optomechanics, not only tunable optomechanical entanglement and magnon-magnon entanglement can be achieved, but also flexible tripartite entanglement including magnon-photon-phonon entanglement, magnon-magnon-photon and -phonon entanglement can be generated. Moreover, optimal bipartite and tripartite entanglement can be achieved by tuning parameters. We further show that all entanglement can be enhanced via engineering the magnon-photon coupling, and is proven to be robust against the bath temperature within the survival temperature. Besides, we find that the optomechanical entanglement can be protected or restored by bad magnons with large decay rate, while other entanglement is severely reduced. The results indicate that our proposal provides a novel avenue to explore and control tunable macroscopic quantum effects in hybrid cavity-magnon optomechanics.</p>

            <h2>Generation of multipartite photonic entanglement using a trapped-ion quantum processing node</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marco Canteri, James Bate, Ida Mishra, Nicolai Friis, Victor Krutyanskiy, Benjamin P. Lanyon</p>
            <p>The ability to establish entanglement between the nodes of future quantum networks is essential for enabling a wide range of new applications in science and technology. A promising approach involves the use of a powerful central node capable of deterministically preparing arbitrary multipartite entangled states of its matter-based qubits and efficiently distributing these states to surrounding end nodes via flying photons. This central node, referred to as a ``factory node", serves as a hub for the production and distribution of multipartite entanglement. In this work, we demonstrate key functionalities of a factory node using a cavity-integrated trapped-ion quantum processor. Specifically, we program the system to generate genuinely multipartite entangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states of three path-switchable photons and verify them using custom-designed entanglement witnesses. These photons can, in the future, be used to establish stored multipartite entanglement between remote matter-based nodes. Our results demonstrate that the well-established techniques for the deterministic preparation of entangled states of co-trapped ion qubits can be used to prepare the same states of traveling photons, paving the way for multipartite entanglement distribution in quantum local area networks.</p>

            <h2>Integrability from a Single Conservation Law in Quantum Spin Chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akihiro Hokkyo</p>
            <p>We prove that for quantum spin chains with finite-range interactions, the existence of a specific conservation law known as the Reshetikhin condition implies the presence of infinitely many local conserved quantities, i.e., integrability. This shows that the entire hierarchy of conservation laws associated with solutions of the Yang--Baxter equation is already encoded in the lowest nontrivial conservation law. Combined with recent rigorous results on nonintegrability, our theorem strongly restricts the possibility of partially integrable systems that admit only a finite but large number of local conserved quantities. Our work establishes a rigorous foundation for the systematic identification of new integrable models and deepens the algebraic understanding of conservation-law structures in quantum spin chains.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> P. Stammer, J. Rivera-Dean, P. Tzallas, M.F. Ciappina, M. Lewenstein</p>
            <p>Intense light-matter interaction largely relies on the use of high-power light sources, creating fields comparable to, or even stronger than, the field keeping the electrons bound in atoms. Under such conditions, the interaction induces highly nonlinear processes such as high harmonic generation, in which the low-frequency photons of a driving laser field are upconverted into higher-frequency photons. These processes have enabled numerous groundbreaking advances in atomic, molecular, and optical physics, and they form the foundation of attosecond science. Until recently, however, such processes were typically described using semi-classical approximations, since the quantum properties of the light field were not required to explain the observables. This has changed in the recent past. Ongoing theoretical and experimental advances show that fully quantized descriptions of intense light-matter interactions, which explicitly incorporate the quantum nature of the light field, open new avenues for both fundamental research and technological applications at the fully quantized level. These advances emerge from the convergence of quantum optics with strong-field physics and ultrafast science. Together, they have given rise to the field of quantum optics and quantum electrodynamics of strong-field processes.</p>

            <h2>Photonic scattering in 2D waveguide QED: Quantum Goos-Hänchen shift</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yongguan Ke, Zhenzhi Peng, Muhib Ullah, Chaohong Lee</p>
            <p>Quantum emitters coupled to traveling photons in waveguides, known as waveguide quantum electrodynamics (WQED), offer a powerful platform for understanding light-matter interactions and underpinning emergent quantum technologies. While WQED has been extensively studied in one dimension, two-dimensional (2D) WQED remains largely unexplored, where novel photonic scattering phenomena unique to higher dimensions are expected. Here, we present a comprehensive scattering theory for 2D WQED based on the Green function method. We show that the mean displacement between emitted and injected photons serves as a quantum analogue of the Goos-Hänchen shift. When a photon is injected into a single off-centered port, the quantum Goos-Hänchen (QGH) shift can be enhanced in backward scattering under resonant conditions with subradiant states. When a photon is injected into the center port, there is no QGH shift due to the mirror symmetry of structure. However, for multiple-port injection with transverse momentum, the QGH shift is recovered and proportional to the derivative of phase with respect to transverse momentum. Unlike the classical Goos-Hänchen shift, these effects can be flexibly tuned by the injected photon's frequency. Our work provides a general framework for exploring and manipulating photonic scattering in complex WQED networks.</p>

            <p>Quantum correlations are interesting resources for modern quantum technologies such as quantum information processing, quantum communication, quantum teleportation, and quantum computation tasks. However, engineering these quantum states turns to be not an easy task. Here, we unveil a theoretical framework for generating and controlling quantum correlations within a double-cavity molecular optomechanical (McOM) system. Our approach leverages strong interactions between confined optical fields and collective molecular vibrations, creating a versatile environment for exploring robust quantum correlations. Our findings reveal that by judiciously optimizing the coupling strength between the cavity field and the molecular collective mode leads to significant enhancement of entanglement, quantum steering, and quantum discord. We demonstrate that cavity-cavity quantum correlations can be effectively mediated by the molecular collective mode, enabling a unique pathway for inter-cavity quantum connectivity. Moreover, the quantum entanglement generated in our McOM system exhibits robustness against thermal noise, persisting up to temperatures approaching $1000 K$. This strong resilience, qualifies molecular optomechanics as a compelling architecture for scalable, room-temperature quantum information processing and the practical realization of quantum networks. Additionally, the phase-dependent behaviour of quantum discord provides a fundamental basis for developing ultra-sensitive gas sensors, with potential applications in environmental monitoring, medical diagnostics, and industrial safety.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrew Stasiuk, Garrett Heller, Lance Berkey, Bo Xing, Paola Cappellaro</p>
            <p>Emergent hydrodynamics (EHD) bridges short-time unitarity with late-time thermodynamics, universal transport phenomena characterize the manner and speed of transport and thermalization. Typical non-integrable systems with few conserved local quantities are expected to be diffusive. In contrast, strongly disordered systems which admit phases such as many-body localization, are predicted to inhibit thermalization and thus slow dynamical transport. Disordered systems represent a uniquely poised platform to probe the quantum-to-classical transition and the emergence of irreversible thermodynamics from the underlying unitary structure. Here, we study a strongly disordered nuclear spin ensemble, using local measurements enabled by the disordered-state technique. We observe an apparent phase transition into a sub-diffusive regime, which we model as a random walk on the emergent fractal structure of a percolating network in the dipolar spin ensemble. Our novel theoretical model provides a framework for characterizing the emergence of thermalization in closed quantum systems, even in the presence of strong disorder.</p>

            <p>$W$ states are quantum correlated states possessing both bipartite and multipartite entanglement, which makes them useful for several quantum algorithms. We propose a protocol to generate these states by exploiting {\it topological ring frustration}, and implement it on a programmable Rydberg atom array up to 11 qubits, successfully generating many-body $W$ states of Rubidium atoms. Numerical simulations show promising scaling of the algorithm to tens of qubits with near-term achievable updates on the quantum machines. To validate our state preparation protocol and probe quantum entanglement, we devise a fidelity estimator that requires only two sets of measurements. To implement it, we develop a novel and efficient Bayesian state-tomography approach that takes advantage of accurate classical numerical simulations to overcome limitations in the experimental setup. Hence, a lower bound fidelity of around $77\%$ is certified for the experimentally prepared state of 11 qubits. This work provides a state-of-the-art procedure to generate high-quality quantum entangled $W$ states, demonstrating once more how principles of physics can overcome traditional barriers of computation, and be exploited for quantum advantage.</p>
