            <h2>Evolution of Entanglement Witness of Dicke State under Noise and Error Mitigation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomis Prajapati, Harsh Mehta, Shreya Banerjee, Prasanta K. Panigrahi, V. Narayanan</p>
            <p>The experimental verification of multipartite entangled states is essential for advancing quantum information processing. Entanglement witnesses (EWs) provide a widely used and experimentally accessible approach for detecting genuinely multipartite entangled states. In this work, we theoretically derive the entanglement witness for the four-qubit Dicke state and experimentally evaluate it on two distinct IBM 127-qubit Quantum Processing Units (QPUs), namely ibm\_sherbrook and ibm\_brisbane. A negative expectation value of the witness operator serves as a sufficient condition for confirming genuine multipartite entanglement. We report the maximum (negative) values of the witness achieved on these QPUs as $-0.178 \pm 0.009$ and $-0.169 \pm 0.002$, corresponding to two different state preparation protocols. Additionally, we theoretically investigate the effect of various noise channels on the genuine entanglement of a four-qubit Dicke state using the Qiskit Aer simulator. We show the behavior of the EW constructed under the assumption of Markovian and non-Markovian amplitude damping and depolarizing noises, bit-phase flip noise, and readout errors. We also investigate the effect of varying thermal relaxation time on the EW, depicting a bound on the $T_1$ time required for successful generation of a Dicke State on a superconducting QPU.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Algorithm for Apprenticeship Learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andris Ambainis, Debbie Lim</p>
            <p>Apprenticeship learning is a method commonly used to train artificial intelligence systems to perform tasks that are challenging to specify directly using traditional methods. Based on the work of Abbeel and Ng (ICML'04), we present a quantum algorithm for apprenticeship learning via inverse reinforcement learning. As an intermediate step, we give a classical approximate apprenticeship learning algorithm to demonstrate the speedup obtained by our quantum algorithm. We prove convergence guarantees on our classical approximate apprenticeship learning algorithm, which also extends to our quantum apprenticeship learning algorithm. We also show that, as compared to its classical counterpart, our quantum algorithm achieves an improvement in the per-iteration time complexity by a quadratic factor in the dimension of the feature vectors $k$ and the size of the action space $A$.</p>

            <h2>Strong squeezing and perfect one-way EPR steering in electro-optomechanical system</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qing-Min Zeng, A-Peng Liu, Qi Guo</p>
            <p>We consider a three-mode electro-optomechanical system in which a mechanical oscillator is coupled to an optical cavity and a LC circuit through radiation pressure and capacitive coupling, respectively. By controlling the two-tone driving of the optical cavity and the microwave driving of the LC circuit, the strong squeezing of both the microwave field of the LC circuit and the mechanical mode will be obtained. Moreover, by further altering the driving power of the system, the perfect one-way Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering between the optical cavity and the mechanical oscillator will be generated. The degree of the one-way EPR steering can be controlled by the driving light of the system. We also show the robustness of the squeezing and EPR steering against environmental temperature. This scheme may provide a promising platform for quantum information processing and microwave quantum communication.</p>

            <h2>Kinetic Inductance Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifiers Near the Quantum Limit: Methodology and Characterization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> L. Howe, A. Giachero, M. Vissers, P. Campana, J. Wheeler, J. Gao, J. Austermann, J. Hubmayr, A. Nucciotti, J. Ullom</p>
            <p>We present a detailed simulation and design framework for realizing traveling wave parametric amplifiers (TWPAs) using the nonlinear kinetic inductance of disordered superconductors -- in our case niobium-titanium-nitride (NbTiN). These kinetic inductance TWPAs (KITs) operate via three-wave mixing (3WM) to achieve high broadband gain and near-quantum-limited (nQL) noise. Representative fabricated devices -- realized using an inverted microstrip (IMS), dispersion-engineered, artificial transmission line -- demonstrate power gains above 25 dB, bandwidths beyond 3 GHz, and achieve ultimate system noise levels of 1.1 quanta even when operated with no magnetic shielding. These performance metrics are competitive with state-of-the-art Josephson-junction-based TWPAs but involve simpler fabrication and able to providing three orders of magnitude higher dynamic range ($IIP_1 = -68$ dBm, $IIP_3 = -55$ dBm), and high magnetic field resilience -- making KITs an attractive technology for highly multiplexed readout of quantum information and superconducting detector systems.</p>

            <h2>Robust Lindbladian Estimation for Quantum Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yinchen Liu, James R. Seddon, Tamara Kohler, Emilio Onorati, Toby S. Cubitt</p>
            <p>We revisit the problem of fitting Lindbladian models to the outputs of quantum process tomography. A sequence of prior theoretical works approached the problem by considering whether there exists a Lindbladian generator close to a matrix logarithm of the tomographically estimated transfer matrix. This technique must take into account the non-uniqueness of the matrix logarithm, so that in general multiple branches of the logarithm must be checked. In contrast, all practical demonstrations of Lindbladian fitting on real experimental data have to our knowledge eschewed logarithm search, instead adopting direct numerical optimisation or ad-hoc approaches tailored to a particular experimental realisation. In our work, we introduce algorithmic improvements to logarithm search, demonstrating that it can be applied in practice to settings relevant for current quantum computing hardware. We additionally augment the task of Lindbladian fitting with techniques from gate set tomography to improve robustness against state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors, which can otherwise obfuscate estimates of the model underlying the process of interest. We benchmark our techniques extensively using simulated tomographic data employing a range of realistic error models, before demonstrating their application to tomographic data collected from real superconducting-qubit hardware.</p>

            <h2>Fast and High Excitation Transport in Waveguide Quantum Electrodynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ya-Tang Yu, I Gusti Ngurah Yudi Handayana, Wei Chen, H. H. Jen</p>
            <p>Waveguide quantum electrodynamics (wQED) with underlying collective and long-range atom-atom interactions has led to many distinct dynamical phenomena, including modified collective radiations and intriguing quantum correlations. It stands out as a unique platform to illustrate correlated photon transport, as well as to promise applications in quantum information processing. Here we manifest a fast and high atomic excitation transport by employing two well-separated chirally-coupled atomic arrays. This enhanced waveguide-mediated transport of excitations emerges due to the dominance of spectrally isolated and right-localized right eigenstates in the system's dynamics. Contrary to the instinct of applying the cascaded systems with unidirectional couplings to expedite direct and high excitation transport, the optimal system configurations in open wQED systems demand slight or finite nonreciprocal decay channels to facilitate energy transport by exploiting waveguide-mediated couplings. We also investigate the effect of the couplings' directionality and the scaling of atom number on the transport properties. Our results showcase the wide applicability in wQED platforms and provide insights to quantum engineering and quantum information applications.</p>

            <h2>Variational Quantum Simulations of a Two-Dimensional Frustrated Transverse-Field Ising Model on a Trapped-Ion Quantum Computer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ammar Kirmani, Elijah Pelofske, Andreas Bärtschi, Stephan Eidenbenz, Jian-Xin Zhu</p>
            <p>Quantum computers are an ideal platform to study the ground state properties of strongly correlated systems due to the limitation of classical computing techniques particularly for systems exhibiting quantum phase transitions. While the error rates of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers are still high, simulating strongly correlated systems on such devices and extracting information of possible phases may be within reach. The frustrated transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) is such a system with multiple ordered magnetic phases. In this study, we simulate a two-dimensional frustrated TFIM with next-nearest-neighbor spin-exchange interactions at zero temperature. The competition between the nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic and next-nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic coupling gives rise to frustration in the system. Moreover, the presence of quantum fluctuations makes the ground-state phase profile even richer. We use the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) to compute the phases on a square lattice with periodic boundary conditions for a system of 16 sites (qubits). The trained VQE circuits are compared to exact diagonalization, allowing us to extract error measures of VQE. We focus on the ground-state phase transitions of this model, where VQE succeeds in finding the dominant magnetic phases. The optimized VQE circuits are then executed on the Quantinuum H1-1 trapped-ion quantum computer without using any error mitigation techniques. Our experiments show near perfect recovery of the magnetic phases of the frustrated model through ground-state energy, the energy derivative, and the spin correlation functions. Thus, we show that the trapped-ion quantum processor is able to achieve reliable simulations of a strongly correlated system within the limitations of the VQE approach.</p>

            <h2>Unraveling superradiance: Entanglement and mutual information in collective decay</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xin H. H. Zhang, Daniel Malz, Peter Rabl</p>
            <p>We study the collective decay of an initially inverted ensemble of two-level emitters in two distinct scenarios: when coupled to a squeezed photonic reservoir and when interacting with a one-dimensional waveguide. Using a quantum-state diffusion approach to unravel the emission process, we investigate entanglement and classical correlations along individual quantum trajectories over time. This numerical analysis shows that despite an initial build-up of entanglement and a significant amount of entanglement due to either spin squeezing or dark states at late times, the essential features of the superradiant burst are well described by averages over fully factorizable states. We explain this observation in terms of an almost complete factorization of all 2-local observables, which we identify as a generic property of superradiant decay. Based on this insight, we provide a purely classical theory for the burst in squeezed superradiance, which is both intuitive and exact for a large number of emitters. Moreover, we find that our numerical approach also performs well in the presence of subradiant states, which dominate the slow residual decay of non-uniform ensembles at late times.</p>

            <h2>Quantum simulation of scattering amplitudes and interferences in perturbative QCD</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Herschel A. Chawdhry, Mathieu Pellen, Simon Williams</p>
            <p>A flagship application of quantum computers is the simulation of other quantum systems, including quantum field theories. In this article, we show how quantum computers can be employed to naturally calculate Feynman diagrams and their interferences in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). We simulate the colour parts of the interactions directly on the quantum computer, while the kinematic parts are for now pre-computed classically. For processes where some of the external particles are identical, we find the first hints of a potential quantum advantage. We validate our techniques using simulated quantum computers. Furthermore, for toy examples we also demonstrate our algorithms on a 56-qubit trapped-ion quantum computer. The work constitutes a further key step towards a full quantum simulation of generic perturbative QCD processes.</p>

            <h2>Introduction to Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Model: A Strongly Correlated System Perspective</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rishabh Jha</p>
            <p>The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model delivers an analytically tractable framework for exotic strongly correlated phases where conventional paradigms like Landau's Fermi liquid theory collapse. This review offers a pedagogical introduction to the SYK physics, highlighting its unique capacity to model \textit{strange metals} -- systems exhibiting linear-in-temperature resistivity, Planckian dissipation, and quasiparticle breakdown. We systematically construct both Majorana and complex fermion variants, transforming them into training grounds for modern many-body physics techniques, for instance, (1) large-$N$ formulations via disorder averaging and replica symmetry, (2) Schwinger-Dyson and Kadanoff-Baym equations, (3) imaginary time Matsubara formulation, (4) real-time dynamics via Keldysh formalism, and the associated (5) non-perturbative Keldysh contour deformations. These tools lay the foundation for equilibrium thermodynamics, quantum chaos, quench dynamics, and transport in the thermodynamic limit -- all within a solvable, chaotic quantum system. Designed as a self-contained resource, the review bridges advanced technical machinery to physical insights, with computational implementations provided. Though principally treating the SYK model as a condensed matter laboratory, we also highlight its profound connection to quantum gravity -- woven throughout this work -- underscoring how this solvable chaotic fermionic model serves as a lens onto black hole thermodynamics and holographic duality.</p>

            <h2>Two-point functions and the vacuum densities in the Casimir effect for the Proca field</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. A. Saharian, H. H. Asatryan</p>
            <p>We investigate the properties of the vacuum state for the Proca field in the geometry of two parallel plates on background of (D+1)-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. The two-point functions for the vector potential and the field tensor are evaluated for higher-dimensional generalizations of the perfect magnetic conductor (PMC) and perfect electric conductor (PEC) boundary conditions. Explicit expressions are provided for the vacuum expectation values (VEVs) of the electric and magnetic field squares, field condensate, and for the VEV of the energy-momentum tensor. In the zero-mass limit the VEVs of the electric and magnetic field squares and the condensate reduce to the corresponding expressions for a massless vector field. The same is the case for the VEV of the energy-momentum tensor in the problem with PEC conditions. However, for PMC conditions the zero-mass limit for the vacuum energy-momentum tensor differs from the corresponding VEV for a massless field. This difference in the zero-mass limits is related to the different influences of the boundary conditions on the longitudinal polarization mode of a massive vector field. The PMC conditions constrain all the polarization modes including the longitudinal mode, whereas PEC conditions do not influence the longitudinal mode. The vacuum energy-momentum tensor is diagonal. The normal stress is uniformly distributed in the region between the plates and vanishes in the remaining regions. The corresponding Casimir forces are attractive for both boundary conditions.</p>

            <h2>Probabilistic Approximate Optimization: A New Variational Monte Carlo Algorithm</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abdelrahman S. Abdelrahman, Shuvro Chowdhury, Flaviano Morone, Kerem Y. Camsari</p>
            <p>We introduce a generalized \textit{Probabilistic Approximate Optimization Algorithm (PAOA)}, a classical variational Monte Carlo framework that extends and formalizes prior work by Weitz \textit{et al.}~\cite{Combes_2023}, enabling parameterized and fast sampling on present-day Ising machines and probabilistic computers. PAOA operates by iteratively modifying the couplings of a network of binary stochastic units, guided by cost evaluations from independent samples. We establish a direct correspondence between derivative-free updates and the gradient of the full $2^N \times 2^N$ Markov flow, showing that PAOA admits a principled variational formulation. Simulated annealing emerges as a limiting case under constrained parameterizations, and we implement this regime on an FPGA-based probabilistic computer with on-chip annealing to solve large 3D spin-glass problems. Benchmarking PAOA against QAOA on the canonical 26-spin Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model with matched parameters reveals superior performance for PAOA. We show that PAOA naturally extends simulated annealing by optimizing multiple temperature profiles, leading to improved performance over SA on heavy-tailed problems such as SK-Lévy.</p>

            <h2>Neural networks leverage nominally quantum and post-quantum representations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paul M. Riechers, Thomas J. Elliott, Adam S. Shai</p>
            <p>We show that deep neural networks, including transformers and RNNs, pretrained as usual on next-token prediction, intrinsically discover and represent beliefs over 'quantum' and 'post-quantum' low-dimensional generative models of their training data -- as if performing iterative Bayesian updates over the latent state of this world model during inference as they observe more context. Notably, neural nets easily find these representation whereas there is no finite classical circuit that would do the job. The corresponding geometric relationships among neural activations induced by different input sequences are found to be largely independent of neural-network architecture. Each point in this geometry corresponds to a history-induced probability density over all possible futures, and the relative displacement of these points reflects the difference in mechanism and magnitude for how these distinct pasts affect the future.</p>

            <h2>Enhanced Quantum behavior on frustrated Ising model: Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm study</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seunghan Lee, Hunpyo Lee</p>
            <p>We investigated the quantum effects of a frustrated Ising model on a two-dimensional square lattice using the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). While strong spin frustration is known to induce quantum fluctuations at low temperatures, previous classical approaches restricted to binary (up or down) spin configurations have been insufficient to fully capture the quantum contributions of frustration. In this study, we introduced a quantitative metric to evaluate the quantum effects arising from frustration and employed QAOA to differentiate between classical and quantum regimes. Notably, we found that in the weakly frustrated region, QAOA measurements rarely capture first excited states, as they are energetically well separated from the ground state. In contrast, near the quantum phase transition point, excited states appear more frequently in QAOA measurements, highlighting the increased role of quantum fluctuations.</p>

            <p>We report on an optical magnetometer enhanced by vacuum-squeezed light, employing an Mx magnetometer based on $^{87}$Rb vapor in a micrometer-scale cell (~100 $\mu$m). Using the well-established polarization self-rotation effect in a room-temperature $^{87}$Rb vapor cell, we achieve -3 dB of vacuum squeezing within the noise spectral window of 100 Hz to several MHz, corresponding to 3.5 dB squeezing when accounting for optical losses. Leveraging this level of squeezing, we demonstrate a magnetic field sensitivity of approx. 1 pT$/$$\sqrt{Hz}$. The combination of vacuum-squeezed light and micrometer-scale vapor cells paves the way for compact, low-power-consumption atomic sensors with enhanced performance.</p>

We validate our approach by calculating the second- and third-order optical responses in the Rice-Mele model and further apply it to a many-body interacting system using a tensor network method. This framework is broadly applicable to any method that can compute real-time dynamics, offering a powerful and versatile tool for investigating nonlinear responses in dynamical systems.</p>

            <p>Recently, a gauge theory of unified gravity [Rep. Prog. Phys. 88, 057802 (2025)] has been developed to extend the Standard Model to include gravity. Here we present unified gravity using the ordinary four-vector and tensor field notation of the Standard Model. The main goal of the present work is to extend the original Minkowski spacetime formulation of the theory to account for graviton-graviton interaction. This is a necessary extension for problems involving interactions between gravitational fields, for example, in the propagation of gravitational waves in external gravitational potentials. The 4xU(1) gauge invariance of unified gravity is preserved in this extension.</p>

            <h2>Mid-IR hyperspectral imaging with undetected photons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marlon Placke, Chiara Lindner, Felix Mann, Inna Kviatkovsky, Helen M. Chrzanowski, Hendrik Bartolomaeus, Frank Kühnemann, Sven Ramelow</p>
            <p>Sensing with undetected photons has become a vibrant, application-driven research domain with a special focus on the mid-infrared (mid-IR) wavelength region. Since the mid-IR contains spectral bands with highly specific and strong molecular absorbance signatures, often referred to as fingerprints, a multitude of different samples and their compositions can be detected and quantified spectroscopically. Enhancing this inherently sample alteration-free spectroscopic method with imaging capabilities leads to a powerful technique for environmental monitoring and biomedical applications that enables automated diagnostics while omitting time-consuming and non-reversible labeling steps. To evade the shortcomings of state-of-the-art instruments for mid-IR hyperspectral microscopy related to cost, complexity, power-consumption, and performance, which are associated with technological challenges for mid-IR cameras and low-noise and broadband mid-IR sources, here, we construct a proof-of-concept nonlinear interferometer in a wide-field imaging arrangement combined with high-resolution spectral acquisition by pixelwise quantum Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. For the broadband range of 2300-3100 cm$^{-1}$, covering the important CH-stretch band, we perform hyperspectral imaging that simultaneously resolves 3500 spatial modes, each with a spectral resolution of 10 cm$^{-1}$ leveraging in total around $10^5$ spatio-spectrally entangled photon modes. Our image acquisition uses a commercial, megapixel sCMOS camera, while a medium-power and compact c.w. pump laser is the only necessary light source.</p>

            <p>A three-dimensional magneto-optical trap (MOT), as an efficient method of producing cold atoms from room-temperature atomic vapor, has been widely used to develop atomic sensors. Various compact MOTs using a single laser beam have been reported, simplifying apparatuses and leading to miniaturized devices. Here, we propose single-beam MOTs based on back-to-back pyramidal and conical mirrors. In such back-to-back mirrors, a MOT trapping volume is formed by an incident laser beam, a retroreflected beam, and multiple reflections from the mirror surfaces. We present the design of back-to-back mirrors and a series of compact MOT configurations, with the potential of increasing access to the MOT and simultaneously creating multiple MOTs. We demonstrate a MOT in a back-to-back conical mirror, loading 10 million rubidium-87 atoms from background vapor and cooling the atoms to 7 {\mu}K using polarization gradients. Single-beam MOTs based on back-to-back mirrors will contribute to building compact and scalable cold-atom-based sensors.</p>

            <h2>A c-theorem for the effective central charge in the R=1 replica limit, and applications to systems with measurement-induced randomness</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rushikesh A. Patil, Andreas W. W. Ludwig</p>
            <p>We present a general theorem demonstrating non-perturbatively the decrease of the "effective central charge" $c_{\text{eff}}=(d c/dR)|_{R=1}$ under renormalization group (RG) flow in the $R\rightarrow1$ replica limit of a $R$-copy $2D$ conformal field theory (CFT) action $S_{*}$ perturbed by a replica interaction of the form $$-\mathbb{S}=-\sum_{a=1}^{R}S_{*}^{(a)}+\Delta\int d^2 x \sum_{\substack{a,b=1\\ a\neq b}}^{R}\varphi^{(a)}(x)\varphi^{(b)}(x).$$ Here $\varphi$ is a scaling field belonging to the CFT with action $S_*$ and the coupling $\Delta$ is relevant in the RG sense. We show that the infrared value of $c_{\text{eff}}$ is always $\textit{less}$ than the central charge $c$ of the unperturbed CFT $S_{*}$. We refer to this result as the "$c$-effective theorem". As an application of this theorem, we consider replica field theories in the limit of $R \to 1$ replicas of the form above, shown by Nahum and Jacobsen [arXiv:2504.01264] to describe $2D$ classical monitored systems, where measurements introduce a form of quenched randomness via Bayes' theorem. Lastly, we discuss a possible relationship of our theorem with the effective central charge $c_{\text{eff}}^{(R\rightarrow0)}=(dc/dR)|_{R=0}$ for the above replica action in the different $R\rightarrow0$ replica limit, which is of relevance to systems with generic uncorrelated impurity-type quenched disorder, as opposed to measurements.</p>

            <h2>Spin-only dynamics of the multi-species nonreciprocal Dicke model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joseph Jachinowski, Peter B. Littlewood</p>
            <p>The Hepp-Lieb-Dicke model is ubiquitous in cavity quantum electrodynamics, describing spin-cavity coupling which does not conserve excitation number. Coupling the closed spin-cavity system to an environment realizes the open Dicke model, and by tuning the structure of the environment or the system-environment coupling, interesting spin-only models can be engineered. In this work, we focus on a variation of the multi-species open Dicke model which realizes mediated nonreciprocal interactions between the spin species and, consequently, an interesting dynamical limit-cycle phase. In particular, we improve upon adiabatic elimination and, instead, employ a Redfield master equation in order to describe the effective dynamics of the spin-only system. We assess this approach at the mean-field level, comparing it both to adiabatic elimination and the full spin-cavity model, and find that the predictions are sensitive to the presence of single-particle incoherent decay. Additionally, we clarify the symmetries of the model and explore the dynamical limit-cycle phase in the case of explicit parity-time-symmetry breaking, finding a region of phase coexistence terminating at an codimension-two exceptional point. Lastly, we go beyond mean-field theory by exact numerical diagonalization of the master equation, appealing to permutation symmetry in order to increase the size of accessible systems. We find signatures of phase transitions even for small system sizes.</p>

            <h2>Heisenberg Scaling Quantum Microscopy: Experiment and Theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhe He, Yide Zhang, Xin Tong, Lei Li, Lihong V. Wang</p>
            <p>Entangled biphoton sources exhibit nonclassical characteristics and have been applied to imaging techniques such as ghost imaging, quantum holography, and quantum optical coherence tomography. The development of wide-field quantum imaging to date has been hindered by low spatial resolutions, speeds, and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs). Here, we present quantum microscopy by coincidence (QMC) with balanced pathlengths, which enables super-resolution imaging at the Heisenberg limit with substantially higher speeds and CNRs than existing wide-field quantum imaging methods. QMC benefits from a configuration with balanced pathlengths, where a pair of entangled photons traversing symmetric paths with balanced optical pathlengths in two arms behave like a single photon with half the wavelength, leading to 2-fold resolution improvement. Concurrently, QMC resists stray light up to 155 times stronger than classical signals. The low intensity and entanglement features of biphotons in QMC promise nondestructive bioimaging. QMC advances quantum imaging to the microscopic level with significant improvements in speed and CNR toward bioimaging of cancer cells.

            <h2>On the Baltimore Light RailLink into the quantum future</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Krzysztof Domino, Emery Doucet, Reece Robertson, Bartłomiej Gardas, Sebastian Deffner</p>
            <p>In the current era of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) technology, quantum devices present new avenues for addressing complex, real-world challenges including potentially NP-hard optimization problems. Acknowledging the fact that quantum methods underperform classical solvers, the primary goal of our research is to demonstrate how to leverage quantum noise as a computational resource for optimization. This work aims to showcase how the inherent noise in NISQ devices can be leveraged to solve such real-world problems effectively. Utilizing a D-Wave quantum annealer and IonQ's gate-based NISQ computers, we generate and analyze solutions for managing train traffic under stochastic disturbances. Our case study focuses on the Baltimore Light RailLink, which embodies the characteristics of both tramway and railway networks. We explore the feasibility of using NISQ technology to model the stochastic nature of disruptions in these transportation systems. Our research marks the inaugural application of both quantum computing paradigms to tramway and railway rescheduling, highlighting the potential of quantum noise as a beneficial resource in complex optimization scenarios.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Richard Jozsa, Soumik Ghosh, Sergii Strelchuk</p>
            <p>We consider the computational model of IQP circuits (in which all computational steps are $X$ basis diagonal gates), supplemented by intermediate $X$ or $Z$ basis measurements. We show that if we allow non-adaptive or adaptive $X$ basis measurements, or allow non-adaptive $Z$ basis measurements, then the computational power remains the same as that of the original IQP model; and with adaptive $Z$ basis measurements the model becomes quantum universal. Furthermore we show that the computational model having circuits of only $CZ$ gates and adaptive $X$ basis measurements, with input states that are tensor products of 1-qubit states from the set $\{ |+\rangle, |1\rangle,\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle+i|1\rangle), \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle+e^{i\pi/4}|1\rangle) \} $, is quantum universal. In contrast to the relation of IQP to PH collapse, all our results here are manifestly stable under small additive implementational errors.</p>

            <p>Our work integrates an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) with the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) to optimize ansatz parameters in place of traditional gradient-based methods. We benchmark this Evolutionary-QAOA (E-QAOA) approach on the Max-Cut problem for $d$-3 regular graphs of 4 to 26 nodes, demonstrating equal or higher accuracy and reduced variance compared to COBYLA-based QAOA, especially when using Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) for fitness evaluations. Additionally, we propose a novel distributed multi-population EA strategy, executing parallel, independent populations on two quantum processing units (QPUs) with classical communication of 'elite' solutions. Experiments on quantum simulators and IBM hardware validate the approach. We also discuss potential extensions of our method and outline promising future directions in scalable, distributed quantum optimization on hybrid quantum-classical infrastructures.</p>

            <h2>Pseudoentanglement from tensor networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zihan Cheng, Xiaozhou Feng, Matteo Ippoliti</p>
            <p>Pseudoentangled states are defined by their ability to hide their entanglement structure: they are indistinguishable from random states to any observer with polynomial resources, yet can have much less entanglement than random states. Existing constructions of pseudoentanglement based on phase- and/or subset-states are limited in the entanglement structures they can hide: e.g., the states may have low entanglement on a single cut, on all cuts at once, or on local cuts in one dimension. Here we introduce new constructions of pseudoentangled states based on (pseudo)random tensor networks that affords much more flexibility in the achievable entanglement structures. We illustrate our construction with the simplest example of a matrix product state, realizable as a staircase circuit of pseudorandom unitary gates, which exhibits pseudo-area-law scaling of entanglement in one dimension. We then generalize our construction to arbitrary tensor network structures that admit an isometric realization. A notable application of this result is the construction of pseudoentangled `holographic' states whose entanglement entropy obeys a Ryu-Takayanagi `minimum-cut' formula, answering a question posed in [Aaronson et al., arXiv:2211.00747].</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anne Matthies, Nicolas Dannenfeld, Silvia Pappalardi, Achim Rosch</p>
            <p>We systematically investigate whether classical hydrodynamic field theories can predict the long-time dynamics of many-particle quantum systems. We study both numerically and analytically the time evolution of a chain of spins (or qubits) subjected to stroboscopic dynamics. The time evolution is implemented by a sequence of local and nearest-neighbor gates that conserve the total magnetization. The long-time dynamics of such a system is believed to be describable by a hydrodynamic field theory, which, importantly, includes the effect of noise. Based on a field theoretical analysis and symmetry arguments, we map each operator in the spin model to the corresponding fields in hydrodynamics. This allows us to predict which expectation values decay exponentially and which decay with a hydrodynamic long-time tail. We illustrate these findings by studying the time evolution of all 255 Hermitian operators that can be defined on four neighboring sites. All operators not protected by hydrodynamics decay exponentially, while the others show a slow hydrodynamic decay. While most hydrodynamic power laws seem to follow the analytical predictions, we also discuss cases where there is an apparent discrepancy between analytics and the finite-size numerical data.</p>

            <p>The realization of fault-tolerant quantum computers hinges on effective quantum error correction protocols, whose performance significantly relies on the nature of the underlying noise. In this work, we directly study the structure of non-Markovian correlated errors and their impact on surface code memory performance. Specifically, we compare surface code performance under non-Markovian noise and independent circuit-level noise, while keeping marginal error rates constant. Our analysis shows that while not all temporally correlated structures are detrimental, certain structures, particularly multi-time "streaky" correlations affecting syndrome qubits and two-qubit gates, can severely degrade logical error rate scaling. Furthermore, we discuss our results in the context of recent quantum error correction experiments on physical devices. These findings underscore the importance of understanding and mitigating non-Markovian noise toward achieving practical, fault-tolerant quantum computing.</p>

Furthermore, we demonstrate that, in the particular example considered here, paths having an Abelian AC phase factor, also have an AC phase that is path-independent, whereas paths having a non-Abelian AC phase factor may have an AC phase that is path-dependent (i.e., not topological).</p>

            <p>An important challenge with the current generation of noisy, large-scale quantum computers is the question of validation. Does the hardware generate correct answers? If not, what are the errors? This issue is often combined with questions of computational advantage, but it is a fundamentally distinct issue. In current experiments, complete validation of the output statistics is generally not possible because it is exponentially hard to do so. Here, we apply phase-space simulation methods to partially verify recent experiments on Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) implementing photon-number resolving (PNR) detectors. The positive-P phase-space distribution is employed, as it uses probabilistic sampling to reduce complexity. It is \sim10^{18} times faster than direct classical simulation for experiments on 288 modes where quantum computational advantage is claimed. When combined with binning and marginalization to improve statistics, multiple validation tests are efficiently computable, of which some tests can be carried out on experimental data. We show that the data as a whole shows discrepancies with theoretical predictions for perfect squeezing. However, a small modification of the GBS parameters greatly improves agreement for some tests. We suggest that such validation tests could form the basis of feedback methods to improve GBS experiments.</p>

            <h2>Direct phase encoding in QAOA: Describing combinatorial optimization problems through binary decision variables</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Simon Garhofer, Oliver Bringmann</p>
            <p>The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and its derived variants are widely in use for approximating combinatorial optimization problem instances on gate-based Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers. Commonly, circuits required for QAOA are constructed by first reformulating a given problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem. It is then straightforward to synthesize a QAOA circuit from QUBO equations. In this work, we illustrate a more qubit-efficient circuit construction for combinatorial optimization problems by the example of the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP). Conventionally, the qubit encoding in QAOA for the TSP describes a tour using a sequence of nodes, where each node is written as a 1-hot binary vector. We propose to encode TSP tours by selecting edges included in the tour. Removing certain redundancies, the number of required qubits can be reduced by a linear factor compared to the aforementioned conventional encoding. We examined implementations of both QAOA encoding variants in terms of their approximation quality and runtime. Our experiments show that for small instances results are just as accurate using our proposed encoding, whereas the number of required classical optimizer iterations increases only slightly.</p>

            <p>Photonics represents one of the most promising approaches to large-scale quantum computation with millions of qubits and billions of gates, owing to the potential for room-temperature operation, high clock speeds, miniaturization of photonic circuits, and repeatable fabrication processes in commercial photonic foundries. We present an end-to-end architecture for fault-tolerant continuous variable (CV) quantum computation using only passive on-chip components that can produce photonic qubits above the fault tolerance threshold with probabilities above 90%, and encodes logical qubits using physical qubits sampled from a distribution around the fault tolerance threshold. By requiring only low photon number resolution, the architecture enables the use of high-bandwidth photodetectors in CV quantum computing. Simulations of our qubit generation and logical encoding processes show a Gaussian cluster squeezing threshold of 12 dB to 13 dB. Additionally, we present a novel magic state generation protocol which requires only 13 dB of cluster squeezing to produce magic states with an order of magnitude higher probability than existing approaches, opening up the path to universal fault-tolerant quantum computation at less than 13 dB of cluster squeezing.</p>

We compute the expectation value of non-stabilizerness given the Schmidt spectrum (and thus entanglement). At a first approximation, entanglement determines the average magic on the Schmidt orbit. However, there is a finer structure in the average magic distinguishing different orbits where the flatness of entanglement spectrum is involved.</p>

Our experimental results reveal that Regev's algorithm indeed outperforms Shor's algorithm for certain composite numbers in practice. However, we observed significant performance variations across different input values. Despite Regev's algorithm's theoretical asymptotic efficiency advantage, our implementation exhibited execution times longer than Shor's algorithm for small integer factorization in both quantum and classical components. These findings offer insights into the practical challenges and performance characteristics of implementing Regev's algorithm in realistic quantum computing scenarios.</p>

In the case the interactions between the quantum system and the particles do not conserve energy, the KDQ of the non-energy-preserving stochastic work is also derived. These KDQ distributions can account for non-commutativity, and return the unperturbed average values and variances for a generic interaction-time, and generic local initial states of the quantum system and environment particles. Using this nonequilibrium-physics approach, we certify the conditions under which the collision process of the model exhibits quantum traits, and we quantify the rate of energy exchanged by the quantum system by looking at the variance of the KDQ energy distributions. Finally, we propose an experimental test of our results on a superconducting quantum circuit implementing a qubit system, with microwave photons representing the environment particles.</p>

            <p>Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is one of the most promising candidates to achieve the quantum advantage in solving combinatorial optimization problems. The process of finding a good set of variational parameters in the QAOA circuit has proven to be challenging due to multiple factors, such as barren plateaus. As a result, there is growing interest in exploiting parameter transferability, where parameter sets optimized for one problem instance are transferred to another that could be more complex either to estimate the solution or to serve as a warm start for further optimization. But can we transfer parameters from one class of problems to another? Leveraging parameter sets learned from a well-studied class of problems could help navigate the less studied one, reducing optimization overhead and mitigating performance pitfalls. In this paper, we study whether pretrained QAOA parameters of MaxCut can be used as is or to warm start the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) circuits. Specifically, we design machine learning models to find good donor candidates optimized on MaxCut and apply their parameters to MIS acceptors. Our experimental results show that such parameter transfer can significantly reduce the number of optimization iterations required while achieving comparable approximation ratios.</p>

            <p>We derive a generalized quantum Langevin equation and its fluctuation-dissipation relation describing the quantum dynamics of a tagged particle interacting with a medium (environment), where both the particle and the environment are driven by an external time-dependent (e.g. oscillating) field. We specialize on the case of a charged tagged particle interacting with a bath of charged oscillators, under an external AC electric field, although the results are much more general and can be applied to any type of external time-dependent fields. We derive the corresponding quantum Langevin equation, which obeys a modified fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR) where the AC field plays an explicit role. The modified FDR is non-Markovian even if the undriven particle-bath system is Markovian without the external field. We provide an illustration of the usefulness of these results and derive a new form of the quantum Nyquist noise for the voltage fluctuations in electrical circuits under AC conditions (finite frequency), which is the most general since it also accounts for the response of the heat bath (e.g. lattice ions) to the applied AC electric field in the GHz-THz region, of relevance for 5G/6G wireless technologies. This generalized quantum fluctuation-dissipation relation for driven systems can also find other applications ranging from quantum noise in quantum optics to quantum computing with trapped ions.</p>

            <p>We study the collective decay of an initially inverted ensemble of two-level emitters in two distinct scenarios: when coupled to a squeezed photonic reservoir and when interacting with a one-dimensional waveguide. Using a quantum-state diffusion approach to unravel the emission process, we investigate entanglement and classical correlations along individual quantum trajectories over time. This numerical analysis shows that despite an initial build-up of entanglement and a significant amount of entanglement due to either spin squeezing or dark states at late times, the essential features of the superradiant burst are well described by averages over fully factorizable states. We explain this observation in terms of an almost complete factorization of all 2-local observables, which we identify as a generic property of superradiant decay. Based on this insight, we provide a purely classical theory for the burst in squeezed superradiance, which is both intuitive and exact for a large number of emitters. Moreover, we find that our numerical approach also performs well in the presence of subradiant states, which dominate the slow residual decay of non-uniform ensembles at late times.</p>

            <p>Quantum computers are an ideal platform to study the ground state properties of strongly correlated systems due to the limitation of classical computing techniques particularly for systems exhibiting quantum phase transitions. While the error rates of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers are still high, simulating strongly correlated systems on such devices and extracting information of possible phases may be within reach. The frustrated transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) is such a system with multiple ordered magnetic phases. In this study, we simulate a two-dimensional frustrated TFIM with next-nearest-neighbor spin-exchange interactions at zero temperature. The competition between the nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic and next-nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic coupling gives rise to frustration in the system. Moreover, the presence of quantum fluctuations makes the ground-state phase profile even richer. We use the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) to compute the phases on a square lattice with periodic boundary conditions for a system of 16 sites (qubits). The trained VQE circuits are compared to exact diagonalization, allowing us to extract error measures of VQE. We focus on the ground-state phase transitions of this model, where VQE succeeds in finding the dominant magnetic phases. The optimized VQE circuits are then executed on the Quantinuum H1-1 trapped-ion quantum computer without using any error mitigation techniques. Our experiments show near perfect recovery of the magnetic phases of the frustrated model through ground-state energy, the energy derivative, and the spin correlation functions. Thus, we show that the trapped-ion quantum processor is able to achieve reliable simulations of a strongly correlated system within the limitations of the VQE approach.</p>

            <p>Waveguide quantum electrodynamics (wQED) with underlying collective and long-range atom-atom interactions has led to many distinct dynamical phenomena, including modified collective radiations and intriguing quantum correlations. It stands out as a unique platform to illustrate correlated photon transport, as well as to promise applications in quantum information processing. Here we manifest a fast and high atomic excitation transport by employing two well-separated chirally-coupled atomic arrays. This enhanced waveguide-mediated transport of excitations emerges due to the dominance of spectrally isolated and right-localized right eigenstates in the system's dynamics. Contrary to the instinct of applying the cascaded systems with unidirectional couplings to expedite direct and high excitation transport, the optimal system configurations in open wQED systems demand slight or finite nonreciprocal decay channels to facilitate energy transport by exploiting waveguide-mediated couplings. We also investigate the effect of the couplings' directionality and the scaling of atom number on the transport properties. Our results showcase the wide applicability in wQED platforms and provide insights to quantum engineering and quantum information applications.</p>

            <h2>The effect of partial post-selection on quantum discrimination</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qipeng Qian, Christos N. Gagatsos</p>
            <p>The discrimination of quantum states is a central problem in quantum information science and technology. Meanwhile, partial post-selection has emerged as a valuable tool for quantum state engineering. In this work, we bring these two areas together and ask whether partial measurements can enhance the discrimination performance between two unknown and non-orthogonal pure states. Our framework is general: the two unknown states interact with the same environment-set in a pure state-via an arbitrary unitary transformation. A partial measurement is then performed on one of the output modes, modeled by an arbitrary positive operator-valued measure (POVM). We then allow classical communication to inform the unmeasured mode of the outcome of the partial measurement on the other mode, which is subsequently measured by a POVM that is optimal in the sense that the probability of error is minimized. The two POVMs act locally, but since we allow for classical communication between the two modes, we consider a scheme involving local operations and classical communication (LOCC). Under these considerations, we show that the minimum error probability, averaged over all possible post-selected branches, cannot be reduced below the minimum error probability of discriminating the original input states. In other words, prior state engineering via partial measurement does not improve the average discrimination performance. However, we also identify specific post-selection outcomes under which the conditional discrimination can achieve strictly lower error probabilities than the original optimal measurement, illustrating that while post-selection does not improve average performance, it can enable better discrimination in certain branches of the post-selected ensemble.</p>

            <p>In particle physics, axions and axion-like particles are ubiquitous. Remarkably, ultra-light axions could constitute dark matter or dark energy. Therefore, it is important to detect axions experimentally. In the presence of a magnetic field, a photon can be converted into an axion, and vice versa. Utilizing the conversion phenomenon, several methods for detecting axions have been proposed. To improve detectability, it is desirable to use quantum sensing. However, since the conversion process is usually treated as classical wave dynamics, it is unclear how to incorporate quantum effects such as entanglement. In this work, we formulate the photon-axion conversion in a quantum field theoretical manner. As a result, we succeed in evaluating the conversion probability from a photon quantum state to an axion quantum state. In particular, it turns out that squeezed coherent states can enhance the conversion probability.</p>

            <h2>Robust Control of High-dimensional Quantum Systems against Coherent and Incoherent Errors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yidian Fan, Re-Bing Wu</p>
            <p>Toward scalable quantum computing, the control of quantum systems needs to be robust against both coherent errors induced by parametric uncertainties and incoherent errors induced by environmental decoherence. This poses significant challenges for high-dimensional systems due to the computational intensity involved in the control design process. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework to improve the design efficiency. By employing the Taylor series expansion of uncertain parameters, the problem of robust control for an uncertain quantum system is reformulated as the optimal control problem of an augmented deterministic system. The Suzuki-Trotter expansion is then applied to accelerate the calculation of the system dynamics. Numerical simulations of quantum state preparation and quantum gate synthesis demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can successfully identify robust solutions in multi-qubit systems. The enhanced efficiency effectively extends the feasibility of high-order robust control for realistic high-dimensional quantum systems with multiple error sources.</p>

            <p>Violation of Bell inequalities is an essential requirement for many quantum information and communication protocols. In high-dimensional systems, Bell inequality tests face the challenge of implementing genuinely multi-outcome measurements, since the emulation of these with separate dichotomic projections opens a binarisation loophole that local hidden variable theories can exploit. Here we show that the joint spectral intensity of a two-photon entangled state contains access to the necessary multi-outcome measurements to overcome this obstacle and certify and violate a Bell inequality for high-dimensional states. This result is contrary to the belief that the joint spectral intensity is a phase-insensitive quantity and does not have sufficient information to certify entanglement or Bell-nonlocality. Using this approach, we violate the CGLMP Bell inequality up to dimension d = 8, all with negligible p-values, and for the first time close the binarisation loophole in high-dimensional Bell experiments. Guaranteeing Bell-nonlocal correlations using frequency-only measurements removes the technological hurdle of measurements in the temporal domain, thus greatly simplifying any practical implementation of future high-dimensional quantum information protocols.</p>

This construction generalizes many established transforms, by providing a adaptable set of orthonormal basis functions. Our proposed fast classical algorithm for GTT achieves an exponentially lower complexity of $O(N \log_b N)$ in comparison to a naive classical implementation that has an associated computational cost of $O(N^2)$. For quantum applications, our GTT-based algorithm, implemented in the natural spectral ordering, achieves both gate complexity and circuit depth of $O(\log_b N)$, where $N = b^n$ denotes the length of the input vector. This represents a quadratic improvement over Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), which requires $O((\log_b N)^2)$ gates and depth for $n$ qudits, and an exponential advantage over classical Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) based and Fast Walsh-Hadamard Transform (FWHT) based methods, which incur a computational cost of $O(N \log_b N)$. We explore diverse applications of GTTs in quantum computing, including quantum state compression and transmission, function encoding and quantum digital signal processing. The proposed framework provides fine-grained control of the transformation through the adjustable parameters of the base matrix $W$. This versatility allows precise shaping of each basis function while preserving their effective Walsh-type structure, thus tailoring basis representations to specific quantum data and computational tasks. Our numerical results demonstrate that GTTs enable improved performance in quantum state compression and function encoding compared to fixed transforms (such as FWHT or FFT), achieving higher fidelities with fewer retained components. We also provided novel classical and quantum digital signal filtering algorithms based on our GTT framework.</p>

            <h2>High-rate qutrit entanglement swapping with photon-number-basis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kazufumi Tanji, Hikaru Shimizu, Masahiro Takeoka</p>
            <p>Entanglement generation between distant nodes is a fundamental process in distributed quantum information processing. Qudits, high-dimensional quantum states, are promising candidates for enhancing entanglement distribution capabilities. However, the success probability of qudit entanglement distribution using Bell measurements is typically lower than that of conventional qubit-based protocols. In this paper, we propose a novel entanglement swapping protocol specifically designed for qutrits (three-dimensional quantum states). Our protocol employs photon-number encoding combined with an additional mode basis, such as polarization, effectively increasing the success probability. We show that the proposed qutrit protocol can achieve higher entanglement generation rates compared to conventional two-photon detection-based qubit protocols, especially under conditions of limited photon generation probability. Furthermore, we evaluate our protocol under realistic experimental imperfections, including photon loss and threshold detection, and show that it achieves high fidelity with probabilistic photon sources.</p>

            <p>Defining suitable quantum extensions of classical divergences often poses a challenge due to the non-commutative nature of quantum information. In this work, we propose a new approach via what we call the layer cake representation. The resulting quantum Rényi and $f$-divergences are then proven to be equivalent to those recently defined via integral representations. Nevertheless, the approach can provide several insights. We give an alternative proof of the integral representation of the relative entropy by Frenkel and prove a conjecture regarding a trace expression for the Rényi divergence. Additionally, we give applications to error exponents in hypothesis testing, a new Riemann-Stieltjes type integral representation and a variational representation.</p>

            <h2>Non-Linearities In Atomic Quantum Receivers: Harmonic And Intermodulation Distortion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luís Felipe Gonçalves, Teng Zhang, Georg Raithel, David A. Anderson</p>
            <p>Rydberg sensors offer a unique approach to radio frequency (RF) detection, leveraging the high sensitivity and quantum properties of highly-excited atomic states to achieve performance levels beyond classical technologies. Non-linear responses and distortion behavior in Rydberg atom receivers are critical to evaluating and establishing performance metrics and capabilities such as spur-free dynamic range and tolerance to unwanted interfering signals. We report here on the measurement and characterization of non-linear behavior and spurious response of a Rydberg atomic heterodyne receiver. Single-tone and two-tone testing procedures are developed and implemented for measurement of harmonic and inter-modulation distortion in Rydberg atomic receivers based on multi-photon Rydberg spectroscopy and radio-frequency heterodyne signal detection and demodulation in an atomic vapor. For a predetermined set of atomic receiver parameters and RF carrier wave in the SHF band near-resonant to a cesium Rydberg transition, we measure and characterize atomic receiver selectivity, bandwidth, roll-off, compression point (P1dB), second-order (IP2) and third-order (IP3) intercepts, and spur-free dynamic range. Receiver intermodulation distortion is characterized for the case of an interfering signal wave applied at two frequency offsets relative to the near-resonant reference local oscillator, $\Delta F/F= 10^{-4}$ at 6dB and $10^{-6}$ at 22dB single-tone bandwidths, respectively. We observe that under suitable operating conditions the atomic receiver can exhibit a suppression of harmonic and inter-modulation distortion relative to that of classical receiver mixer amplifiers. Finally, we describe how the non-linear behaviors of atomic receivers can provide unique, controllable RF signatures inaccessible by classical counterparts and propose their use to realize secure communication modalities and applications.</p>

            <h2>Optically Switchable Fluorescence Enhancement at Critical Interparticle Distances</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arda Gulucu, Emre Ozan Polat</p>
            <p>Plasmonic nanostructures provide electric field localization to be used as a fluorescence enhancement tool for the closely located fluorophores. However, metallic structures exhibit non-radiative energy transfer at close proximity, which suppresses the boost in the photoluminescence spectrum due to inhomogeneous medium. Compensation to non-radiative losses is fundamentally restricted, therefore defining the critical interparticle distances, where the fluorescence enhancement is detectable hold utmost importance for device applications. In this work, we numerically identified the critical interparticle distances of a metal nanoparticle (MNP) and quantum emitters (QEs) with angstrom resolution by analyzing the interplay between quantum yield and non-radiative decay. By engaging a collimated light application on silver nanoparticle (AgNP) placed at a critical distance, we simulated an active fluorescence enhancement switch yielding observable 7-fold increase in fluorescence intensity. The provided free space simulation includes the complete response of AgNP with retardation and higher order multi-polar effects for which the previous analytical works fall short. While the model bridges the absorption and emission spectra via corresponding Stokes shift values and presents a general approach for the interaction of QEs and MNPs in Rayleigh regime, it can be extended to Mie regime for larger QEs and can be modified for dielectric device environment.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. Pawlowski, J. Herbrych, M. Mierzejewski</p>
            <p>Local integrals of motion (LIOMs) play a key role in understanding the long-time properties of closed macroscopic systems. They were found for selected integrable systems via complex analytical calculations. The existence of LIOMs and their structure can also be studied via numerical methods, which, however, involve exact diagonalization of Hamiltonians, posing a bottleneck for such studies. We show that finding LIOMs in translationally invariant lattice models or unitary quantum circuits can be reduced to a problem for which one may numerically find an exact solution in the thermodynamic limit. We develop a simple algorithm and demonstrate its efficiency by calculating LIOMs and bounds on correlations (the Mazur bounds) for infinite integrable spin chains and unitary circuits. Finally, we demonstrate that this approach identifies slow modes in nearly integrable spin models and estimates their relaxation times.</p>

In this work, by leveraging the cutting-edge transformer-based architectures and developing highly efficient optimization algorithms, we achieve the state-of-the-art results for the doped two-dimensional (2D) Hubbard model, arguably the minimum model for high-Tc superconductivity. Interestingly, we find different attention heads in the NQS ansatz can directly encode correlations at different scales, making it capable of capturing long-range correlations and entanglements in strongly correlated systems. With these advances, we establish the half-filled stripe in the ground state of 2D Hubbard model with the next nearest neighboring hoppings, consistent with experimental observations in cuprates. Our work establishes NQS as a powerful tool for solving challenging many-fermions systems.</p>

            <p>Waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED) provides a powerful framework for engineering quantum interactions, traditionally relying on periodic photonic arrays with continuous energy bands. Here, we investigate waveguide QED in a fundamentally different environment: A one-dimensional photonic array whose hopping strengths are structured aperiodically according to the deterministic Fibonacci-Lucas substitution rule. These "Fibonacci waveguides" lack translational invariance and are characterized by a singular continuous energy spectrum and critical eigenstates, representing a deterministic intermediate between ordered and disordered systems. We demonstrate how to achieve decoherence-free, coherent interactions in this unique setting. We analyze two paradigmatic cases: (i) Giant emitters resonantly coupled to the simplest aperiodic version of a standard waveguide. For these, we show that atom photon bound states form only for specific coupling configurations dictated by the aperiodic sequence, leading to an effective atomic Hamiltonian, which itself inherits the Fibonacci structure; and (ii) emitters locally and off-resonantly coupled to the aperiodic version of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger waveguide. In this case the mediating bound states feature aperiodically modulated profiles, resulting in an effective Hamiltonian with multifractal properties. Our work establishes Fibonacci waveguides as a versatile platform, which is experimentally feasible, demonstrating that the deterministic complexity of aperiodic structures can be directly engineered into the interactions between quantum emitters.</p>

Quantum sensing and metrology is an emerging field that lies at the cross-roads of quantum physics, quantum technology, and the discipline in which the parameter estimation is to be performed. While miniaturization of devices often requires quantum mechanics to be utilized for understanding and planning of a parameter estimation, quantum-enhanced sensing is also possible that uses paradigmatic quantum characteristics like quantum coherence and quantum entanglement to go beyond the so-called standard quantum limit. The current review hopes to bring together the concepts related to quantum sensing as realized in ensemble systems, like spin ensembles, light-matter systems, and Bose-Einstein condensates, and lattice systems, like those which can be modelled by the Bose- and Fermi-Hubbard models, and quantum spin models.</p>

            <p>Efficient coupling between quantum emitters and optical cavities is essential for scalable quantum photonic technologies. Group IV vacancy centers in diamond, particularly the negatively charged tin-vacancy center, have emerged as promising candidates due to their spectral stability, high Debye-Waller factor and large orbital splitting in ground-states. Here, we demonstrate controlled couplinag of a single negatively charged tin vacancy center hosted in a nanodiamond to a fully tunable Fabry-Perot microcavity. At cryogenic temperatures, we access the weak coupling regime and observe a transition from the bad-emitter to the bad-cavity regime as the optical transition of the color center narrows. At 4 K, a Purcell factor exceeding 1.7 is measured, confirming cavity-enhanced emission. The obtained results demonstrate the potential of SnV$^{-}$ centers in nanodiamonds as a coherent single-photon source for quantum networks.</p>

            <h2>Impact of Polarization Distinguishability on Coherence in QIUP</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gaytri Arya, Paolo Bianchini, Alberto Diaspro</p>
            <p>Quantum imaging with undetected photons (QIUP) is a promising technique for non-invasive imaging, particularly at wavelengths where detectors are inefficient or unavailable. Recent studies have investigated the role of polarization in QIUP schemes. In this work, we examine whether post-generation optical elements can recover interference when the signal photons are distinguishable in polarization at the source. Specifically, we employ a Mach-Zehnder interferometer after the photon pairs are generated from two nonlinear crystals. Our results indicate that polarization distinguishability at the time of generation leads to a loss of interference that cannot be restored by post-generation optical arrangements. This highlights the fundamental importance of indistinguishability at the source for maintaining coherence in QIUP systems.</p>

            <p>We propose quasiperiodic chains with tunable mobility edge physics, as a promising platform for engineering long-range quantum entanglement. Using the generalized Aubry-André model, we show that the mobility edges play a key role in manipulating long-range indirect interactions in these systems. Near the mobility edge, critical states exhibit unexpectedly strong correlations between sites that share similar local structures, regardless of their spatial separation. Remarkably, by tuning the mobility edge across the Fermi level, one can induce both adiabatic transport and abrupt switching of entanglement between distant sites. These results highlight the potential of aperiodic structures for controlling nonlocal quantum correlations, opening new avenues for entanglement-based applications in quasiperiodic systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> You Wang, Xu Zheng, Timothy C. H. Liew, Y. D. Chong</p>
            <p>In conventional photon blockade, the occupation of a cavity mode by more than one photon is suppressed via strong optical nonlinearity. An alternative, called unconventional photon blockade, can occur under weak nonlinearity by relying on quantum interference between fine-tuned cavities. A serious limitation is the very short antibunching time window, orders of magnitude less than the cavity lifetime. We present a method to achieve photon blockade over a large time window of several cavity lifetimes, even exceeding that of conventional photon blockade, while still requiring only weak nonlinearity. This ``long-lived photon blockade'' (LLPB) occurs when the single-photon Green's function exhibits a zero at a large cavity loss rate, which is satisfied by an exemplary configuration of four coupled cavities under weak driving. Our analytical results agree well with wavefunction Monte Carlo simulations. The LLPB phenomenon may aid the development of single-photon sources utilizing materials with weak optical nonlinearities.</p>

            <p>Light-matter interactions underpin the quantum technologies from quantum information processing to quantum sensing. When the coupling strength of light-matter interactions approaches the resonance frequencies of light and matter - the ultrastrong coupling regime - antiresonant (counter-rotating) processes, in which a photon and a matter excitation are simultaneously created or annihilated, induce non-negligible ground-state quantum entanglement between light and matter. Ultrastrong coupling thus provides a robust platform for noise-tolerant quantum entanglement, essential for reliable quantum technologies. However, the diamagnetic term typically counteracts antiresonant interactions, inhibiting intriguing phenomena such as thermal equibilium superradiant phase transitions. Here, we present an on-chip platform consisting of a superconducting resonator and thin ferromagnetic films achieving ultrastrong magnon-photon coupling system (magnon polaritons) via collective magnetic-dipole interactions, significantly circumventing the diamagnetic term. We experimentally demonstrate a pronounced Bloch-Siegert shift of about 60 MHz - direct evidence of antiresonant interactions - and observe cooperative enhancement of the effective coupling strength through increasing the number of remote magnon elements coupling with one photon mode. This scalable platform facilitates exploration of exotic quantum phenomena driven by antiresonant interactions, bridging spintronics and quantum optics, and enabling noise-tolerant quantum technological applications.</p>

            <p>Neural-network quantum states (NQS) offer a powerful and expressive ansatz for representing quantum many-body wave functions. However, their training via Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) methods remains challenging. It is well known that some scenarios - such as sharply peaked wave functions emerging in quantum chemistry - lead to high-variance gradient estimators hindering the effectiveness of variational optimizations. In this work we investigate a systematic strategy to tackle those sampling issues by means of adaptively tuned importance sampling. Our approach is explicitly designed to (i) target the gradient estimator instead of the loss function, (ii) not introduce additional hyperparameters and (iii) be computationally inexpensive. We benchmarked our approach across the ground-state search of a wide variety of hamiltonians, including frustrated spin systems and ab-initio quantum chemistry. We also show systematic improvements on the infidelity minimization in the context of neural projected quantum dynamics. Overall, our approach can reduce the computational cost of vanilla VMC considerably, up to a factor of 100x when targeting highly peaked quantum chemistry wavefunctions.</p>

In this work, we show how to use an array of non-locally coupled transmon "molecules" to engineer a passive photonic controlled gate for waveguide photons. In particular, we show that a conditional elastic phase shift between counter-propagating photons arises from the interplay between direction-dependent couplings, engineered through an interplay of non local interactions and molecular binding strength; and the nonlinearity of the transmon array. We analyze the conditions under which a maximal $\pi$-phase shift -- and hence a CZ gate -- is obtained, and characterize the gate fidelity as a function of key experimental parameters, including finite transmon nonlinearities, emitter spectral inhomogeneities, and limited cooperativity. Our work opens the use of giant atoms as key elements of microwave photonic quantum computing devices.</p>

We analyze the time evolution of atom-field states and, based on this dynamic, examine how spatial curvature influences the Mandel parameter, entropy, and the behavior of the Wigner distribution function.

            <p>This study presents a theoretical investigation of magnomechanically induced transparency, Fano resonance, and slow/fast light phenomena within a hybrid optomagnomechanical system. The system consists of a mechanical membrane within a cavity and a ferrimagnetic crystal with a magnon squeezing mode that couples directly to a microwave cavity mode through magnetic dipole interaction and indirectly to an optical cavity through the crystal's deformation displacement. The optical cavity is influenced by the mechanical displacement, which is driven by magnetostrictive forces through radiation pressure. The interactions among photon, phonons, magnons, and microwave within the cavity give rise to optomechanically induced transparency (OMIT), magnomechanically induced transparency (MMIT) and magnon-induced transparency (MIT). We analyze how the presence of magnon squeezing modifies the absorption and dispersion properties of the optical spectrum. Additionally, the emergence of Fano resonance via photon-phonon coupling in the presence of the magnon squeezing is examined. By tuning the microwave-magnon interactions and the magnon squeezing parameters, we enhance slow/light effects.

            <p>Photon counting is a fundamental component in quantum optics and quantum information. However, implementing ideal photon-number-resolving (PNR) detectors remains experimentally challenging. Multiplexed PNR detection offers a scalable and practical alternative by distributing photons across multiple modes and detecting their presence using simple ON-OFF detectors, thereby enabling approximate photon-number resolution. In this work, we establish a theoretical model for such detectors and prove that the estimation error in terms of photon number moments decreases inverse proportionally to the number of detectors. Thanks to the enhanced PNR capability, multiplexed PNR detector provides an advantage in cat-state breeding protocols. Assuming a two-photon subtraction case, 7dB of squeezing, and an array of 20 detectors of efficiency 95%, our calculation predicts fidelity ~ 0.88 with a success probability ~ 3.8%, representing orders-of-magnitude improvement over previous works. Similar enhancement also extends to cat-state generation with the generalized photon number subtraction. With experimentally feasible parameters, our results suggest that megahertz-rate cat-state generation is achievable using an on-chip array of tens of ON-OFF detectors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tathagata Karmakar, Philippe Lewalle, Yipei Zhang, K. Birgitta Whaley</p>
            <p>Time-continuous quantum measurement allows for the tracking of a quantum system in real time via sequences of short, and individually weak, measurement intervals. Such measurements are necessarily invasive, imparting backaction to the system, and allowing the observer to update their state estimate based on stochastic measurement outcomes. Feedback control then involves real-time interventions by an observer, conditioned on the time-continuous measurement signal that they receive. We here consider diffusive quantum trajectories, and focus on the "noise-canceling" subset of feedback protocols that aim to minimize the degree of stochasticity in the dynamics. We derive such a class of feedback operations, showing that under the idealized assumptions of pure states, unit measurement efficiency, and zero time-delay in implementing feedback operations, perfectly noise-canceling feedback always exists. We consider the resulting noise-canceled dynamics generated by an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian; while non-Hermitian Hamiltonians from continuous monitoring generally describe rare dynamics (accessible by costly post-selection), the use of noise-canceling feedback here leads to non-Hermitian dynamics that occur deterministically. We demonstrate this via examples of entangled state preparation and stabilization. We then illustrate the potential for the application of noise-cancellation to boost success rates in magic state distillation protocols. We show that adding feedback based on noise-cancellation into a time-continuous 5-to-1 distillation protocol leads to higher probabilities of successful distillation across a range of input errors, and extends the threshold on input errors for which the protocol is effective. Our results highlight the efficacy of noise-canceling feedback-aided protocols for quantum state preparation and stabilization tasks.</p>

It successfully circumvents the decoherence in the system, and eliminates the undesired noise of spontaneous photon emission in the OPO. As a result, the amplified parametric process simultaneously reserves the coherence and quantum properties in the first OPO, and yields a -6.1 dB squeezed laser in optical domain with a narrow linewidth and high brightness.

            <h2>On-chip magnon polaritons in the ultrastrong coupling regime</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shugo Yoshii, Manuel Müller, Ryo Ohshima, Matthias Althammer, Yuichiro Ando, Hans Huebl, Masashi Shiraishi</p>
            <p>Light-matter interactions underpin the quantum technologies from quantum information processing to quantum sensing. When the coupling strength of light-matter interactions approaches the resonance frequencies of light and matter - the ultrastrong coupling regime - antiresonant (counter-rotating) processes, in which a photon and a matter excitation are simultaneously created or annihilated, induce non-negligible ground-state quantum entanglement between light and matter. Ultrastrong coupling thus provides a robust platform for noise-tolerant quantum entanglement, essential for reliable quantum technologies. However, the diamagnetic term typically counteracts antiresonant interactions, inhibiting intriguing phenomena such as thermal equibilium superradiant phase this http URL, we present an on-chip platform consisting of a superconducting resonator and thin ferromagnetic films achieving ultrastrong magnon-photon coupling system (magnon polaritons) via collective magnetic-dipole interactions, significantly circumventing the diamagnetic term. We experimentally demonstrate a pronounced Bloch-Siegert shift of about 60 MHz - direct evidence of antiresonant interactions - and observe cooperative enhancement of the effective coupling strength through increasing the number of remote magnon elements coupling with one photon mode. This scalable platform facilitates exploration of exotic quantum phenomena driven by antiresonant interactions, bridging spintronics and quantum optics, and enabling noise-tolerant quantum technological applications.</p>

            <h2>Quantum computational advantage of noisy boson sampling with partially distinguishable photons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Byeongseon Go, Changhun Oh, Hyunseok Jeong</p>
            <p>Boson sampling stands out as a promising approach toward experimental demonstration of quantum computational advantage. However, the presence of physical noise in near-term experiments hinders the realization of the quantum computational advantage with boson sampling. Since physical noise in near-term boson sampling devices is inevitable, precise characterization of the boundary of noise rates where the classical intractability of boson sampling is maintained is crucial for quantum computational advantage using near-term devices. In this work, we identify the level of partial distinguishability noise that upholds the classical intractability of boson sampling. We find that boson sampling with on average $O(\log N)$ number of distinguishable photons out of $N$ input photons maintains the equivalent complexity to the ideal boson sampling case. By providing strong complexity theoretical evidence for the classical intractability of noisy boson sampling, we expect that our findings will ultimately facilitate the demonstration of quantum computational advantage with noisy boson sampling experiments in the near future.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Codes with Addressable and Transversal Non-Clifford Gates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiyang He, Vinod Vaikuntanathan, Adam Wills, Rachel Yun Zhang</p>
            <p>The development of quantum codes with good error correction parameters and useful sets of transversal gates is a problem of major interest in quantum error-correction. Abundant prior works have studied transversal gates which are restricted to acting on all logical qubits simultaneously. In this work, we study codes that support transversal gates which induce $\textit{addressable}$ logical gates, i.e., the logical gates act on logical qubits of our choice. As we consider scaling to high-rate codes, the study and design of low-overhead, addressable logical operations presents an important problem for both theoretical and practical purposes. Our primary result is the construction of an explicit qubit code for which $\textit{any}$ triple of logical qubits across one, two, or three codeblocks can be addressed with a logical $\mathsf{CCZ}$ gate via a depth-one circuit of physical $\mathsf{CCZ}$ gates, and whose parameters are asymptotically good, up to polylogarithmic factors. The result naturally generalizes to other gates including the $\mathsf{C}^{\ell} Z$ gates for $\ell \neq 2$. Going beyond this, we develop a formalism for constructing quantum codes with $\textit{addressable and transversal}$ gates. Our framework, called $\textit{addressable orthogonality}$, encompasses the original triorthogonality framework of Bravyi and Haah (Phys. Rev. A 2012), and extends this and other frameworks to study addressable gates. We demonstrate the power of this framework with the construction of an asymptotically good qubit code for which $\textit{pre-designed}$, pairwise disjoint triples of logical qubits within a single codeblock may be addressed with a logical $\mathsf{CCZ}$ gate via a physical depth-one circuit of $\mathsf{Z}$, $\mathsf{CZ}$ and $\mathsf{CCZ}$ gates. In an appendix, we show that our framework extends to addressable and transversal $T$ gates, up to Clifford corrections.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Silvia Neri, François Damanet, Andrew J. Daley, Maria Luisa Chiofalo, Jorge Yago Malo</p>
            <p>We investigate the possibility of engineering dissipatively long-range order that is robust against heating in strongly interacting fermionic systems, relevant for atoms in cavity QED. It was previously shown [Tindall et al. this http URL. 123, 030603 (2019)] that it is possible to stabilize long-range order in a Hubbard model by exploiting a dissipative mechanism in the Lindblad limit, this latter being valid for spectrally unstructured baths. Here, we first show that this mechanism still holds when including additional spin-exchange interactions in the model, that is for the tUJ model. Moreover, by means of a Redfield approach that goes beyond the Lindblad case, we show how the stability of the engineered state depends crucially on properties of the bath spectral density and discuss the feasibility of those properties in an experiment.</p>

            <p>Among the fundamental quantum effects, quantum reflection (QR) is one of the most notable phenomena. Approximating arbitrary potentials in the Schrödinger equation as multistep potentials allows us to determine the reflection coefficient by means of a Riccati equation. We introduce a measure for the wavefunction's characteristic reflection distance and derive an analytical expression for this reflection point in an arbitrary power-law potential. We study the associated QR rate in the context of Casimir--Polder atom surface interactions, revealing its strong dependence on critical parameters such as velocity and interaction duration. As an application, we demonstrate how the matter-wave diffraction of a low-velocity metastable Argon beam impinging on a rotated grating facilitates high-precision potential analysis.</p>

            <p>Understanding multi-photon interactions in non-equilibrium quantum systems is an outstanding challenge in quantum optics. In this work, we develop an analytical and diagrammatic framework to explore three-photon interactions in atomic ensembles weakly coupled to a one-dimensional waveguide. Taking advantage of the weak coupling, we use our diagrammatic framework to perform perturbation theory and calculate the leading-order contributions to the three-photon wavefunction, which would otherwise be intractable. We then compute the outgoing photon wavefunction of a resonantly driven atomic ensemble, with photon-photon interactions truncated up to three photons. Our formulation not only captures the individual transmission of photons but also isolates the connected S-matrix elements that embody genuine photon-photon correlations. Through detailed analysis, we obtain the analytic expressions of the connected third-order correlation function and the third-order electric-field-quadrature cumulant, which reveal non-Gaussian signatures emerging from the interplay of two- and three-photon processes. We also calculate the optical depth where non-Gaussian photon states can be observed. Numerical simulations based on a cascaded master equation validate our analytical predictions on a small-scale system. These results provide a formalism to further explore non-equilibrium quantum optics in atomic ensembles and extend this to the regime of non-Gaussian photon transport.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate an experimentally feasible circuit-QED Bose-Hubbard simulator that reproduces the complex spin dynamics of Heisenberg models. Our method relies on mapping spin-1/2 systems onto bosonic states via the polynomially expanded Holstein-Primakoff (HP) transformation. The HP transformation translates the intricate behavior of spins into a representation that is compatible with bosonic devices like those in a circuit QED setup. For comparison, we also implement the Dyson-Maleev (DM) encoding for spin-1/2 and show that, in this limit, DM and HP are equivalent. We show the equivalence of the DM and the HP transformations for spin-1/2 systems. Rigorous numerical analyses confirm the effectiveness of our HP-based protocol. Specifically, we obtain the concurrence between the spin dynamics and the behavior of microwave photons within our circuit QED-based analog simulator that is designed for the Bose-Hubbard model. By utilizing the microwave photons inherent to circuit QED devices, our framework presents an accessible, scalable avenue for probing quantum spin dynamics in an experimentally viable setting.</p>

            <p>We present a quantum jump/trajectory analysis of the two-photon interference phenomenon in the context of the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect (HOME). In particular, we consider the standard setup of HOME, which consists of two-photon sources firing single photons from the opposite sides of a 50/50 beam splitter and two perfect detectors placed at the output ports to record photodetection events. For single-photon sources, we consider two special cases: (1) two excited two-level atoms and (2) two atom-cavity setups with initially present single photons in both cavities. For both cases, we report analytic results as well as quantum jump-based Monte Carlo simulations to demonstrate the signatures of these single-photon sources on the HOME under different working conditions (for example, strong- and weak-coupling regimes of cavity quantum electrodynamics). Our results may have interesting applications in linear optics quantum computing as well as in protocols that test the indistinguishability of single-photon sources.</p>

            <p>Unlike classical algorithms, where second quantization is ubiquitous, the nature of quantum computers enables both the first- and second-quantized representations to be on somewhat equal footing. While quantum algorithms of both quantizations provide advantages over classical algorithms for ground state calculation and time-evolution, they face distinct limitations and inefficiencies in addressing real-world molecular and material simulation problems. As an example, the first-quantized representation is unsuitable for calculating electron non-conserving properties, such as dynamic correlations. Conversely, the ground-state molecular orbital wavefunction efficiently prepared in the second quantization may benefit from efficient first-quantized measurement circuits. In light of this, we propose a hybrid quantization scheme for electronic simulations that employs a conversion circuit to switch efficiently between the two quantizations, achieving a gate cost of $\mathcal{O}(N\log N \log M)$ and requiring $\mathcal{O}(N \log M)$ qubits for a system of $N$ electrons and $M$ orbitals. This way, plane-wave Hamiltonian simulations can be done efficiently in the first-quantization before converting to the second quantization to apply electron non-conserving operations.

            <h2>Multi-Photon Quantum Rabi Models with Center-of-Mass Motion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sabrina Hartmann, Nicolija Momčilović, Alexander Friedrich</p>
            <p>The precise control of light-matter interaction serves as a cornerstone for diverse quantum technologies, spanning from quantum computing to advanced atom optics. Typical experiments often feature multi-mode fields and require atoms with intricate internal structures to facilitate e.g., multi-photon interactions or cooling. Moreover, the development of high-precision cold-atom sensors necessitates the use of entangled atoms. We introduce a rigorous, second-quantized framework for describing multi-$\Lambda$-atoms in a cavity, encompassing their center-of-mass motion and interaction with a two-mode electromagnetic field. A key feature of our approach is the systematic application of a Hamiltonian averaging theory to the atomic field operators, enabling the derivation of a compact and physically insightful effective Hamiltonian governing the system's time evolution. This effective Hamiltonian not only incorporates the AC-Stark and Bloch-Siegert shifts, augmented by contributions from all involved ancillary states, but also includes effects from counter-rotating terms, offering a more complete description than conventional RWA-based models. A significant finding is the emergence of a particle-particle interaction mediated by ancillary states, stemming directly from the combined quantum nature of the coupled electromagnetic field and atomic system. We illustrate the practical implications of our model through an analysis of atomic Raman diffraction, determining the time evolution for a typical initial state and demonstrating the resulting Rabi oscillations. Furthermore, our results confirm that both the atomic and optical Hong-Ou-Mandel effect can be observed within this Raman configuration, utilizing a specific two-particle input state, thereby extending the utility of Raman diffraction for quantum interference phenomena and providing a microscopic model of the effect.</p>

            <p>Resonance fluorescence of natural or artificial atoms constitutes a prime method for generating non-classical light. While most efforts have focused on producing single-photons, multi-photon emission is unavoidably present in the resonant driving of an atom. Here, we study the extent to which these processes occur: we quantify the multi-photon emission statistics in a resonantly-driven two-level artificial atom -- a semiconductor quantum dot in a micropillar cavity -- when pumped by short optical pulses. By measuring auto-correlation functions up to the fourth order, we observe up to four photons emitted after a single pumping pulse, and investigate the emission dynamics with finely resolved temporal measurements. Furthermore, we propose a method based on acquisition time gating to enhance the purity of a single-photon source while maintaining high efficiencies. Our results deepen the understanding of the photon emission processes in coherently driven atomic systems, and suggest a simple but effective technique to reduce the multi-photon components of a single-photon source.</p>

            <p>Understanding the Lie algebraic structure of a physical problem often makes it easier to find its solution. In this paper, we focus on the Lie algebra of Gaussian-conserving superoperators. We construct a Lie algebra of $n$-mode states, $\mathfrak{go}(n)$, composed of all superoperators conserving Gaussianity, and we find it isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^{2n^2+3n}\oplus_{\mathrm{S}}\mathfrak{gl}(2n,\mathbb{R})$. This allows us to solve the quadratic-order Redfield equation for any, even non-Gaussian, state. We find that the algebraic structure of Gaussian operations is the same as that of super-Poincaré algebra in three-dimensional spacetime, where the CPTP condition corresponds to the combination of causality and directionality of time flow. Additionally, we find that a bosonic density matrix satisfies both the Klein-Gordon and the Dirac equations. Finally, we expand the algebra of Gaussian superoperators even further by relaxing the CPTP condition. We find that it is isomorphic to a superconformal algebra, which represents the maximal symmetry of the field theory. This suggests a deeper connection between two seemingly unrelated fields, with the potential to transform problems from one domain into another where they may be more easily solved.</p>

            <p>In unitary circuit games, two competing parties, an "entangler" and a "disentangler", can induce an entanglement phase transition in a quantum many-body system. The transition occurs at a certain rate at which the disentangler acts. We analyze such games within the context of matchgate dynamics, which equivalently corresponds to evolutions of non-interacting fermions. We first investigate general entanglement properties of fermionic Gaussian states (FGS). We introduce a representation of FGS using a minimal matchgate circuit capable of preparing the state and derive an algorithm based on a generalized Yang-Baxter relation for updating this representation as unitary operations are applied. This representation enables us to define a natural disentangling procedure that reduces the number of gates in the circuit, thereby decreasing the entanglement contained in the system. We then explore different strategies to disentangle the systems and study the unitary circuit game in two different scenarios: with braiding gates, i.e., the intersection of Clifford gates and matchgates, and with generic matchgates. For each model, we observe qualitatively different entanglement transitions, which we characterize both numerically and analytically.</p>

These results indicate that coherent pump sources, such as lasers, are not required for SPDC-based entanglement generation.

In this context, we present the implementation of a data re-uploading scheme on a photonic integrated processor, achieving high accuracies in several image classification tasks. We thoroughly investigate the capabilities of this apparently simple model, which relies on the evolution of one-qubit states, by providing an analytical proof that our implementation is a universal classifier and an effective learner, capable of generalizing to new, unknown data. Hence, our results not only demonstrate data re-uploading in a potentially resource-efficient optical implementation but also provide new theoretical insight into this algorithm, its trainability, and generalizability properties.

Experimentally, we develop methodologies for estimating the magnetic field vector, demonstrating high precision in predicting spectral features based on the known spin Hamiltonians. We measured the optical Rabi frequency of 21 transitions among the 36 possible optical-hyperfine transitions, allowing for the construction of a 6x6 branching ratio matrix of relative transition strengths.

            <p>The doubly minimized Petz Renyi mutual information (PRMI) of order $\alpha$ is defined as the minimization of the Petz divergence of order $\alpha$ of a fixed bipartite quantum state $\rho_{AB}$ relative to any product state $\sigma_A\otimes \tau_B$. To date, no closed-form expression for this measure has been found, necessitating the development of numerical methods for its computation. In this work, we show that alternating minimization over $\sigma_A$ and $\tau_B$ asymptotically converges to the doubly minimized PRMI for any $\alpha\in (\frac{1}{2},1)\cup (1,2]$, by proving linear convergence of the objective function values with respect to the number of iterations for $\alpha\in (1,2]$ and sublinear convergence for $\alpha\in (\frac{1}{2},1)$. Previous studies have only addressed the specific case where $\rho_{AB}$ is a classical-classical state, while our results hold for any quantum state $\rho_{AB}$.</p>

            <h2>Towards a Comparative Framework for Compositional AI Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tiffany Duneau</p>
            <p>The DisCoCirc framework for natural language processing allows the construction of compositional models of text, by combining units for individual words together according to the grammatical structure of the text. The compositional nature of a model can give rise to two things: compositional generalisation -- the ability of a model to generalise outside its training distribution by learning compositional rules underpinning the entire data distribution -- and compositional interpretability -- making sense of how the model works by inspecting its modular components in isolation, as well as the processes through which these components are combined. We present these notions in a framework-agnostic way using the language of category theory, and adapt a series of tests for compositional generalisation to this setting. Applying this to the DisCoCirc framework, we consider how well a selection of models can learn to compositionally generalise. We compare both quantum circuit based models, as well as classical neural networks, on a dataset derived from one of the bAbI tasks, extended to test a series of aspects of compositionality. Both architectures score within 5% of one another on the productivity and substitutivity tasks, but differ by at least 10% for the systematicity task, and exhibit different trends on the overgeneralisation tasks. Overall, we find the neural models are more prone to overfitting the Train data. Additionally, we demonstrate how to interpret a compositional model on one of the trained models. By considering how the model components interact with one another, we explain how the model behaves.</p>

            <h2>Quasiconservation Laws and Suppressed Transport in Weakly Interacting Localized Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jessica Kaijia Jiang, Federica Maria Surace, Olexei I. Motrunich</p>
            <p>The stability of localization in the presence of interactions remains an open problem, with finite-size effects posing significant challenges to numerical studies. In this work, we investigate the perturbative stability of noninteracting localization under weak interactions, which allows us to analyze much larger system sizes. Focusing on disordered Anderson and quasiperiodic Aubry-André models in one dimension, and using the adiabatic gauge potential (AGP) at first order in perturbation theory, we compute first-order corrections to noninteracting local integrals of motion (LIOMs). We find that for at least an $O(1)$ fraction of the LIOMs, the corrections are well-controlled and converge at large system sizes, while others suffer from resonances. Additionally, we introduce and study the charge-transport capacity of this weakly interacting model. To first order, we find that the charge transport capacity remains bounded in the presence of interactions. Taken together, these results demonstrate that localization is perturbatively stable to weak interactions at first order, implying that, at the very least, localization persists for parametrically long times in the inverse interaction strength. We expect this perturbative stability to extend to all orders at sufficiently strong disorder, where the localization length is short, representing the true localized phase. Conversely, our findings suggest that the previously proposed interaction-induced avalanche instability, namely in the weakly localized regime of the Anderson and Aubry-André models, is a more subtle phenomenon arising only at higher orders in perturbation theory or through nonperturbative effects.</p>

            <h2>Can slow recombination in ordered superconductors explain the excess quasiparticle population?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eva Gurra, Douglas A. Bennett, Shannon M. Duff, Michael R. Vissers, Joel N. Ullom</p>
            <p>An excess density of quasiparticles is widely observed in superconducting films. This excess causes performance degradation in a variety of superconducting devices, including decoherence in qubits. In this Letter, we evaluate the hypothesis of [1] that the quasiparticle excess is caused by anomalously slow recombination at low quasiparticle densities due to localization in sub-gap states. We probe the density of states in aluminum and niobium films using current-voltage measurements of tunnel junctions and extract upper bounds on the energy scales of the sub-gap states and gap smearing. With these parameters, we evaluate the recombination times predicted by [1] and find that slow recombination is not predicted to occur at observed quasiparticle densities in aluminumand niobium-based superconducting devices. These results suggest that the quasiparticle excess in ordered superconductors is primarily due to non-thermal sources of quasiparticle generation and not slow recombination.</p>

            <p>We prove a Lieb-Robinson bound for lattice fermion models with polynomially decaying interactions, which can be used to show the locality of the quasi-local inverse Liouvillian. This allows us to prove automorphic equivalence and the local perturbations perturb locally (LPPL) principle for these systems. The proof of the Lieb-Robinson bound is based on the work of Else et al. (2020), and our results also apply to spin systems. We explain why some newer Lieb-Robinson bounds for long-range spin systems cannot be used to prove the locality of the quasi-local inverse Liouvillian, and in some cases may not even hold for fermionic systems.</p>

            <p>Low-noise and tunable single-photon sources are essential components of photonic quantum technologies. However, in WSe$_2$ quantum emitters, charge noise from fluctuations in their local electrostatic environment remains a major obstacle to achieving transform-limited single-photon emission and high photon indistinguishability. Here, we systematically investigate two noise mitigation strategies in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) encapsulation and electrostatic biasing. We demonstrate that hBN encapsulation alone suppresses spectral wandering (from $\sim$170 $\mu$eV to $\sim$40 $\mu$eV) and narrows emission linewidths (from $\sim$500 $\mu$eV to $\sim$150 $\mu$eV), while applied bias enables stable Stark tuning over a 280 $\mu$eV range and further linewidth narrowing down to $\sim$100 $\mu$eV reaching the resolution-limited regime. Time-resolved and second-order correlation measurements confirm stable mono-exponential decay and high single-photon purity ($g^{(2)}(0) \approx 0.01$) with no observable blinking. To quantify progress toward the transform limit, we define two figures of merit: the linewidth ratio $R = W_{\text{exp}} / W_{\text{rad}}$ and total broadening $\Delta W = W_{\text{exp}} - W_{\text{rad}}$, with both being reduced more than five-fold in optimized devices. These results provide a robust framework for developing and evaluating low-noise, tunable WSe$_2$ quantum emitters, potentially realizing electrically controllable sources of indistinguishable single-photons for future photonic quantum technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xi-Yu Chen, Lijia Jiang, Tao Yang, Jun-Hui Zheng</p>
            <p>The geometry-gauge interplay constitutes a fundamental issue in quantum physics, with profound implications spanning from quantum gravity to topological matter. Here, we investigate the dynamic effects of geometry-gauge interplay in Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) on a Haldane sphere with a magnetic monopole. We reveal an index theorem that establishes a correspondence between BEC vortices and the topology of the gauge field, enabling the construction of vortex-monopole composites. Furthermore, we derive the universal logarithmic interaction between composites, which governs the structure of the ground-state vortex lattice. By developing a kinetic theory, we predict scale-invariant vortex dynamics and an emergent duality. Both are confirmed through numerical simulations. This work first presents the dynamical coupling mechanism between spatial geometry and gauge fields, providing deep insights into superfluid systems with topological gauge structures in curved space.</p>

            <h2>An infinite family of Dunkl type superintegrable curved Hamiltonians through coalgebra symmetry: Oscillator and Kepler-Coulomb models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francisco J. Herranz, Danilo Latini</p>
            <p>This work aims to bridge the gap between Dunkl superintegrable systems and the coalgebra symmetry approach to superintegrability, and subsequently to recover known models and construct new ones. In particular, an infinite family of $N$-dimensional quasi-maximally superintegrable quantum systems with reflections, sharing the same set of $2N-3$ quantum integrals, is introduced. The result is achieved by introducing a novel differential-difference realization of $\mathfrak{sl}(2, \mathbb{R})$ and then applying the coalgebra formalism. Several well-known maximally superintegrable models with reflections appear as particular cases of this general family, among them, the celebrated Dunkl oscillator and the Dunkl-Kepler-Coulomb system. Furthermore, restricting to the case of "hidden" quantum quadratic symmetries, maximally superintegrable curved oscillator and Kepler-Coulomb Hamiltonians of Dunkl type, sharing the same underlying $\mathfrak{sl}(2, \mathbb{R})$ coalgebra symmetry, are presented. Namely, the Dunkl oscillator and the Dunkl-Kepler-Coulomb system on the $N$-sphere and hyperbolic space together with two models which can be interpreted as a one-parameter superintegrable deformation of the Dunkl oscillator and the Dunkl-Kepler-Coulomb system on non-constant curvature spaces. In addition, maximally superintegrable generalizations of these models, involving non-central potentials, are also derived on flat and curved spaces. For all specific systems, at least an additional quantum integral is explicitly provided, which is related to the Dunkl version of a (curved) Demkov-Fradkin tensor or a Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector.</p>

            <p>Quantum computers use quantum mechanical phenomena to perform conventionally intractable calculations for specific problems. Despite being universal machines, quantum computers are not expected to replace classical computers, but rather, to complement them and form hybrid systems. This makes integrating quantum computers into high performance computing (HPC) systems an increasingly relevant topic. We present a structured literature review on the integration aspect. We methodologically search literature databases and manually evaluate 107 publications. These publications are divided into seven categories that describe the state of the art in each category. After a brief quantitative analysis of the literature, this survey deals with the hardware architecture of hybrid quantum-classical systems, as well as the software stack. We observe the development of a wide range of tools enabling hybrid systems and emphasize the need for future standardization of interfaces and methods to foster synergy.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chon Man Sou, Yi Wang, Xingkai Zhang</p>
            <p>The amount of information propagated by intermediate heavy particles exhibits characteristic features in inelastic scatterings with $n\geq 3$ final particles. As the total energy increases, the entanglement entropy, between its decay products and other final particles, exhibits a universal sharp dip, suppressed by its small decay rate. This indicates an entanglement suppression from a low-energy effective theory to a channel dominated by an on-shell heavy particle. As demonstrations of these entanglement features, we study concrete models of $2\to 3$ and $2\to 4$ scatterings, which shed light on the entanglement structure beyond the area law derived for $2\to 2$ scattering. In practice, these features may be probed by suitably marginalizing the phase-space distribution of final particles.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Miloschewsky, Supartha Podder</p>
            <p>In 2004, Aaronson introduced the complexity class $\mathsf{PostBQP}$ ($\mathsf{BQP}$ with postselection) and showed that it is equal to $\mathsf{PP}$. In this paper, we define a new complexity class, $\mathsf{CorrBQP}$, a modification of $\mathsf{BQP}$ which has the power to perform correlated measurements, i.e. measurements that output the same value across a partition of registers. We show that $\mathsf{CorrBQP}$ is exactly equal to $\mathsf{BPP}^{\mathsf{PP}}$, placing it "just above" $\mathsf{PP}$. In fact, we show that other metaphysical modifications of $\mathsf{BQP}$, such as $\mathsf{CBQP}$ (i.e. $\mathsf{BQP}$ with the ability to clone arbitrary quantum states), are also equal to $\mathsf{BPP}^{\mathsf{PP}}$. Furthermore, we show that $\mathsf{CorrBQP}$ is self-low with respect to classical queries. In contrast, if it were self-low under quantum queries, the counting hierarchy ($\mathsf{CH}$) would collapse to $\mathsf{BPP}^{\mathsf{PP}}$. Finally, we introduce a variant of rational degree that lower-bounds the query complexity of $\mathsf{BPP}^{\mathsf{PP}}$.</p>

            <p>Quantum scattering calculations for strongly interacting molecular systems are computationally demanding due to the large number of molecular states coupled by the anisotropy of atom - molecule interactions. We demonstrate that thermal rate coefficients for total (elastic + inelastic) atom - molecule scattering are insensitive to the interaction anisotropy of the underlying potential energy surface. In particular, we show that the rate coefficients for Rb-H$_2$ and Rb-N$_2$ scattering at room temperature can be computed to 1% accuracy with anisotropy set to zero, reducing the complexity of coupled channel quantum scattering calculations to numerical solutions of a single differential equation. Our numerical calculations and statistical analysis based on Gaussian process regression elucidate the origin and limitations of the invariance of the total scattering rate coefficients to changes in atom - molecule interaction anisotropy.</p>

We introduce a minimal theoretical model, based on multichannel quantum defect theory, that quantitatively reproduces both the wavepacket dynamics and the static spectrum.

            <p>Momentum-band topology, which transcends conventional topological band theory, unlocks new topological phases that host fascinating temporal interface states. However, direct bulk experimental evidence of such emerging band topology is still lacking due to the great challenges in resolving eigenstates and topological invariants of time-varying systems. Here, we present a comprehensive study on the momentum-band topology in a PT-symmetric Floquet lattice, where the drive-induced momentum gap can be characterized by a quantized Berry phase in the energy Brillouin zone. Experimentally, we synthesize the Floquet lattice model using an acoustic cavity-tube structure coupled to custom-designed external circuits. By reconstructing the effective Hamiltonian, we extract the system's eigenstates and provide the first bulk evidence of momentum-band topology from the perspectives of band inversion and topological invariants. This is accompanied by an unambiguous observation of time-localized interface states in real physical time, thereby providing the boundary signature of the bulk topology. Our work paves the way for further experimental studies on the burgeoning momentum-gap physics.</p>

            <p>We theoretically analyze the Photosystem II reaction center using a quantum master equation approach, where excitonic and charge-transfer rates are computed at the Redfield and Förster levels with realistic spectral densities. The focus is on ergotropy, the maximum work extractable from a quantum state without energy loss. We compute the ergotropy by constructing passive states in the thermodynamic sense. Among the electron transfer pathways, those involving charge separation between $Chl_{D1}$ and $Phe_{D1}$, as well as a route passing through three sequential charge-separated states, yield higher ergotropy, suggesting greater capacity for work extraction, akin to quantum energy capacitors. A third pathway, bypassing the $Chl_{D1},Phe_{D1}$ pair, shows significantly reduced ergotropy. These differences arise from population-induced transitions between active and passive regimes. Our findings highlight how biological systems may exploit non-equilibrium population structures to optimize energy conversion, connecting quantum thermodynamic principles to biological energy harvesting.</p>

            <p>Electrons trapped above the surface of helium provide a means to study many-body physics free from the randomness that comes from defects in other condensed-matter systems. Localizing an electron in an electrostatic quantum dot makes its energy spectrum discrete, with controlled level spacing. The lowest two states can act as charge qubit states. In this paper, we study how the coupling to the quantum field of capillary waves on helium -- ripplons -- affects electron dynamics. As we show, the coupling can be strong. This bounds the parameter range where electron-based charge qubits can be implemented. The constraint is different from the conventional relaxation time constraint. The electron-ripplon system in a dot is similar to a color center formed by an electron defect coupled to phonons in a solid. In contrast to solids, the coupling in the electron on helium system can be varied from strong to weak. This enables a qualitatively new approach to studying color center physics. We analyze the spectroscopy of the pertinent synthetic color centers in a broad range of the coupling strength</p>

            <p>Disordered quantum magnets are not only experimentally relevant, but offer efficient computational methodologies to calculate the low energy states as well as various measures of quantum correlations. Here, we present a systematic analysis of quantum entanglement in the paradigmatic random transverse-field Ising model in two dimensions, using an efficient implementation of the asymptotically exact strong disorder renormalization group method. The phase diagram is known to be governed by three distinct infinitely disordered fixed points (IDFPs) that we study here. For square subsystems, it has been recently established that quantum entanglement has a universal logarithmic correction due to the corners of the subsystem at all three IDFPs. This corner contribution has been proposed as an "entanglement susceptibility", a useful tool to locate the phase transition and to measure the correlation length critical exponent. Towards a deeper understanding, we quantify how the corner contribution depends on the shape of the subsystem. While the corner contribution remains universal, the shape-dependence is qualitatively different in each universality class, also confirmed by line segment subsystems, a special case of skeletal entanglement. Therefore, unlike in conformally invariant systems, in general different subsystem shapes are versatile probes to unveil new universal information on the phase transitions in disordered quantum systems.</p>

            <p>We compute the entropy-per-particle, $S/N$, produced by the decoherence of a coherent state interacting with an environment, using an analytical open quantum system approach. The coherent state considered is characterized by occupation numbers borrowed from the glasma fields produced in the early stages of high-energy nuclear collisions. The environment is modeled as the vacuum, and decoherence arises from the interaction of the state with vacuum fluctuations. We describe the system-environment interaction via a phase-damping model, which represents continuous measurements on the system without altering its energy or particle number. Starting from the occupation numbers typical of the Glasma in high-energy proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus collisions, we find that the final $S/N$ after decoherence is lower than that of a two-dimensional thermal bath of ultrarelativistic gluons, except for proton-nucleus collisions at small values of $g\mu$. Our results indicate that quantum decoherence alone does not generate sufficient entropy to transform the initial coherent state into a thermalized gluon bath.</p>

            <p>This article theoretically proposes a new dual interferometer technique to accurately calibrate two laser frequencies simultaneously using four-wave mixing in an alkali metal vapor cell. The two frequency-calibrated lasers are mixed to create a beat signal at radio frequency to build a portable optical atomic clock (OAC) without an optical frequency comb (OFC). Removal of the OFC improves the portability of OAC, while the dual interferometer setup enhances the one second stability to $1.3\times 10^{-15}$, which is better than the current portable OAC. Thermal noise in the OAC is minimized by choosing the double-lambda atomic scheme with co-propagating laser fields. Using D2 transition of Rb-87, the standard quantum limited frequency sensitivity and stability of the OAC are estimated as $3.2\;\sqrt{\mbox{Hz}}$, and $1.3\times10^{-15}\sqrt{\mbox{Hz}^{-1}}$, respectively. After considering broadening effects due to $357\,$K temperature and collisions, the optimum stability of the OAC is reduced to $3.3\times10^{-15}\sqrt{\mbox{Hz}^{-1}}$ for a laser with $1\,$KHz linewidth and $0.54$ mW power at the input of the vapor cell.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> H. Schlüter, J. Schnack, J. Eckseler (Bielefeld University)</p>
            <p>The present view of modern physics on non-equilibrium dynamics is that generic systems equilibrate or thermalize under rather general conditions, even closed systems under unitary time evolution. The investigation of exceptions thus not only appears attractive, in view of quantum computing where thermalization is a threat it also seems to be necessary. Here, we present aspects of the one-magnon dynamics on the kagome lattice antiferromagnet as an example of a non-equilibrating dynamics due to flat bands. Similar to the one-dimensional delta chain localized eigenstates also called localized magnons lead to disorder-free localization and prevent the system from equilibration.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shan-Zhong Li, Linhu Li, Shi-Liang Zhu, Zhi Li</p>
            <p>We report a novel localization phenomenon that emerges in non-Hermitian and quasiperiodic coupled systems, which we dub ``Anderson-Skin (AS) dualism". The emergence of AS dualism is due to the fact that non-Hermitian topological systems provide non-trivial topological transport channels for disordered systems, causing the originally localized Anderson modes to transform into skin modes, i.e., the localized states within the point gap regions have dual characteristics of localization under periodic boundary condition (PBC) and skin effects under open boundary conditions (OBC). As an example, we analytically prove the 1D AS dualism through the transfer matrix method. Moreover, by discussing many-body interacting systems, we confirm that AS dualism is universal.</p>

            <h2>Geometry-Induced Chiral Currents in a Mesoscopic Helicoidal Quantum Well</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Edilberto O. Silva</p>
            <p>We introduce a mesoscopic quantum well whose confinement and chirality emerge solely from the intrinsic torsion of a finite helicoidal metric. This purely geometric construction requires no external gates or fields: the metric itself induces both a harmonic radial potential and a torsion-driven Zeeman term that breaks the $m \leftrightarrow -m$ degeneracy. By imposing hard-wall boundary conditions at $z = \pm L/2$, we quantize the axial motion and obtain a genuinely zero-dimensional helicoidal quantum dot. An exact analytic solution reveals an energy spectrum with chiral splitting linear in both the torsion parameter $\Omega$ and the axial quantum number $n_z$. For realistic InAs nanoroll parameters ($L = 100$ nm, $\Omega = 5\times10^{6} \mathrm{m^{-1}}$), this geometric effect results in a measurable splitting of $\sim 0.5$ meV. We propose three viable experimental platforms, ultracold atoms in optical traps, femtosecond-written photonic waveguides, and strain-engineered semiconductor nanorolls, where this torsion-induced phenomenon should be accessible with current technology.</p>

Simulations on large lattices reveal an extended region of the phase diagram where long-range magnetic order vanishes in the thermodynamic limit, while the overlap order parameter, which characterizes quantum spin glass states, remains finite. These findings, supported by a semiclassical analysis based on a large-spin expansion, provide compelling evidence that the spin glass phase is stable against quantum fluctuations, unlike the classical case where it disappears at any finite temperature.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hong Qin, Michael Q. May, Jacob Molina</p>
            <p>We present a dequantization algorithm for the Vlasov--Poisson (VP) system, termed the dequantized particle algorithm, by systematically dequantizing the underlying many-body quantum theory. Starting from the second-quantized Hamiltonian description, we derive a finite-dimensional dequantized system and show that it furnishes a structure-preserving discretization of the Schrödinger--Poisson (SP) equations. Through the Wigner or Husimi transformations, this discretization provides an efficient approximation of the VP system when quantum effects are negligible. Unlike conventional structure-preserving algorithms formulated in 6D phase space, this dequantized particle algorithm operates in 3D configuration space, potentially offering more compact and efficient representations of physical information under appropriate conditions. A numerical example of the classical nonlinear two-stream instability, simulated using merely 97 dequantized particles, demonstrates the efficiency, accuracy, and conservation properties of the algorithm and confirms its potential as a foundation for developing quantum and quantum-inspired classical algorithms for kinetic plasma dynamics.</p>

            <p>The presence of low-energy valley excitations in Si/SiGe heterostructures often causes spin qubits to fail. It is therefore important to develop robust protocols for characterizing the valley coupling. Here, we show that realistically sized samplings of valley energy distributions tend to dramatically overestimate the average valley coupling. But we find that knowledge of the valley phase, in addition to the valley splitting, can significantly improve our estimates. Motivated by this understanding, we propose a novel method to probe the valley phase landscape across the quantum well using simple $g$-factor measurements. An important calibration step in this procedure is to measure $g$ in a loop enclosing a valley vortex, where the valley phase winds by $\pm 2\pi$ around a zero of the valley splitting. This proposal establishes an important new tool for probing spin qubits, and it can be implemented in current experiments.</p>

            <p>We introduce an algorithmic framework based on tensor networks for computing fluid flows around immersed objects in curvilinear coordinates. We show that the tensor network simulations can be carried out solely using highly compressed tensor representations of the flow fields and the differential operators and discuss the numerical implementation of the tensor operations required for computing fluid flows in detail. The applicability of our method is demonstrated by applying it to the paradigm example of steady and transient flows around stationary and rotating cylinders. We find excellent quantitative agreement in comparison to finite difference simulations for Strouhal numbers, forces and velocity fields. The properties of our approach are discussed in terms of reduced order models. We estimate the memory saving and potential runtime advantages in comparison to standard finite difference simulations. We find accurate results with errors of less than 0.3% for flow-field compressions by a factor of up to 20 and differential operators compressed by factors of up to 1000 compared to sparse matrix representations. We provide strong numerical evidence that the runtime scaling advantages of the tensor network approach with system size will provide substantial resource savings when simulating larger systems. Finally, we note that, like other tensor network-based fluid flow simulations, our algorithmic framework is directly portable to a quantum computer leading to further scaling advantages.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lars Meschede, Daniel D. A. Clarke, Ortwin Hess</p>
            <p>The unprecedented pace of evolution in nanoscale architectures for cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) has posed crucial challenges for theory, where the quantum dynamics arising from the non-perturbative dressing of matter by cavity electric and magnetic fields, as well as the fundamentally non-hermitian character of the system are to be treated without significant approximation. The lossy electromagnetic resonances of photonic, plasmonic or magnonic nanostructures are described as quasinormal modes (QNMs), whose properties and interactions with quantum emitters and spin qubits are central to the understanding of dissipative nano-optics and magnetodielectric cQED. Despite recent advancements toward a fully quantum framework for QNMs, a general and universally accepted approach to QNM quantization for arbitrary linear media remains elusive. In this work, we introduce a unified theoretical framework, based on macroscopic QED and complex coordinate transformations, that achieves QNM quantization for a wide class of spatially inhomogeneous, dissipative (with possible gain components) and dispersive, linear, magnetodielectric resonators. The complex coordinate transformations effectively convert the radiative losses into non-radiative material dissipation, and via a suitable transformation that reflects all the losses of the resonator, we define creation and annihilation operators that allow the construction of modal Fock states for the joint excitations of field-dressed matter. By directly addressing the intricacies of modal loss in a fully quantum theory of magnetodielectric cQED, our approach enables the exploration of modern, quantum nano-optical experiments utilizing dielectric, plasmonic, magnetic or hybrid cQED architectures, and paves the way towards a rigorous assessment of room-temperature quantum nanophotonic technologies without recourse to ad hoc quantization schemes.</p>

            <h2>Towards a consistent Semiclassical Theory of Gravity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francisco Pipa</p>
            <p>We argue that semiclassical gravity can be rendered consistent by assuming that quantum systems only emit a gravitational field when they interact with a stable determination chain (SDCs), which are specific chains of interactions modeled via decoherence and test functions obeying a set of conditions. When systems are disconnected from SDCs, they do not emit a gravitational field. This denies the universality of gravity, while upholding a version of the equivalence principle. We argue that this theory can be tested by experiments that investigate the gravitational field emitted by isolated systems like in gravcats experiments or by investigating the gravitational interactions between entangled systems like in the (Bose-Marletto-Vedral) BMV experiment. Our theory fits into a new framework which holds that in the absence of certain conditions, quantum systems cannot emit a gravitational field. There are many possible conditions for systems to emit a gravitational field, and we will adopt a subset of them. We will show how this subset of conditions provides multiple benefits beyond rendering semiclassical gravity consistent, which includes deriving the value of the cosmological constant from first principles and providing an explanation for why the vacuum does not gravitate.</p>

            <p>Tensor networks have been successfully applied in simulation of quantum physical systems for decades. Recently, they have also been employed in classical simulation of quantum computing, in particular, random quantum circuits. This paper proposes a decision diagram style data structure, called TDD (Tensor Decision Diagram), for more principled and convenient applications of tensor networks. This new data structure provides a compact and canonical representation for quantum circuits. By exploiting circuit partition, the TDD of a quantum circuit can be computed efficiently. Furthermore, we show that the operations of tensor networks essential in their applications (e.g., addition and contraction), can also be implemented efficiently in TDDs. A proof-of-concept implementation of TDDs is presented and its efficiency is evaluated on a set of benchmark quantum circuits. It is expected that TDDs will play an important role in various design automation tasks related to quantum circuits, including but not limited to equivalence checking, error detection, synthesis, simulation, and verification.</p>

The method harnesses a physical mechanism that synchronizes Larmor precession in the two hyperfine manifolds, protecting magnetic coherence from relaxation caused by spin-exchange and other hyperfine-changing collisions. We experimentally demonstrate up to a ninefold reduction in decoherence of warm cesium vapor, achieving simultaneous protection from both spin-exchange relaxation and partial depolarization from coated cell walls. The technique substantially enhances the spin precession quality factor and maintains a stable gyromagnetic ratio independent of spin polarization, even under frequent collisions. These findings offer a pathway for mitigating dominant relaxation channels in alkali-metal-based applications and experiments, particularly in anti-relaxation-coated cells.</p>

We analyze properties of these entanglement groups and show that they imply restrictions which correspond to monogamy of entanglement. We use these groups to propose a coarse-grained classification scheme for entanglement in multi-partite quantum systems and we show that this group theory characterization of entanglement underlies several well-known quantum tasks.</p>

            <p>Autonomous quantum memories are a way to passively protect quantum information using engineered dissipation that creates an ``always-on'' decoder. We analyze Markovian autonomous decoders that can be implemented with a wide range of qubit and bosonic error-correcting codes, and derive several upper bounds and a lower bound on the logical error rate in terms of correction and noise rates. These bounds suggest that, in general, there is always a correction rate, possibly size-dependent, above which autonomous memories exhibit arbitrarily long coherence times. For any given autonomous memory, size dependence of this correction rate is difficult to rule out: we point to common scenarios where autonomous decoders that stochastically implement active error correction must operate at rates that grow with code size. For codes with a threshold, we show that it is possible to achieve faster-than-polynomial decay of the logical error rate with code size by using superlogarithmic scaling of the correction rate. We illustrate our results with several examples. One example is an exactly solvable global dissipative toric code model that can achieve an effective logical error rate that decreases exponentially with the linear lattice size, provided that the recovery rate grows proportionally with the linear lattice size.</p>

            <p>While traditionally regarded as an obstacle to quantum coherence, recent breakthroughs in quantum optics have shown that the dissipative interaction of a qubit with its environment can be leveraged to protect quantum states and synthesize many-body entanglement. Inspired by this progress, here we set the stage for the -- yet uncharted -- exploration of analogous cooperative phenomena in hybrid solid-state platforms. We develop a comprehensive formalism for the quantum many-body dynamics of an ensemble of solid-state spin defects interacting with the magnetic field fluctuations of a common solid-state reservoir. Our framework applies to any solid-state reservoir whose fluctuating spin, pseudospin, or charge degrees of freedom generate magnetic fields. To understand whether correlations induced by dissipative processes can play a relevant role in a realistic experimental setup, we apply our model to a qubit array interacting via the spin fluctuations of a ferromagnetic bath. Our results show that the low-temperature collective relaxation rates of the qubit ensemble can display clear signatures of super- and subradiance, i.e., forms of cooperative dynamics traditionally achieved in atomic ensembles. We find that the solid-state analog of these cooperative phenomena is robust against spatial disorder in the qubit ensemble and thermal fluctuations of the magnetic reservoir, providing a route for their feasibility in near-term experiments. Our work lays the foundation for a multi-qubit approach to quantum sensing of solid-state systems and the direct generation of many-body entanglement in spin-defect ensembles. Furthermore, we discuss how the tunability of solid-state reservoirs opens up novel pathways for exploring cooperative phenomena in regimes beyond the reach of conventional quantum optics setups.</p>

            <h2>Learning unitaries with quantum statistical queries</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Armando Angrisani</p>
            <p>We propose several algorithms for learning unitary operators from quantum statistical queries with respect to their Choi-Jamiolkowski state. Quantum statistical queries capture the capabilities of a learner with limited quantum resources, which receives as input only noisy estimates of expected values of measurements. Our approach leverages quantum statistical queries to estimate the Fourier mass of a unitary on a subset of Pauli strings, generalizing previous techniques developed for uniform quantum examples. Specifically, we show that the celebrated quantum Goldreich-Levin algorithm can be implemented with quantum statistical queries, whereas the prior version of the algorithm involves oracle access to the unitary and its inverse. As an application, we prove that quantum Boolean functions with constant total influence or with constant degree are efficiently learnable in our model. Moreover, we prove that $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$-juntas are efficiently learnable and constant-depth circuits are learnable query-efficiently with quantum statistical queries. On the other hand, all previous algorithms for these tasks demand significantly greater resources, such as oracle access to the unitary or direct access to the Choi-Jamiolkowski state. We also demonstrate that, despite these positive results, quantum statistical queries lead to an exponentially larger query complexity for certain tasks, compared to separable measurements to the Choi-Jamiolkowski state. In particular, we show an exponential lower bound for learning a class of phase-oracle unitaries and a double exponential lower bound for testing the unitarity of channels. Taken together, our results indicate that quantum statistical queries offer a unified framework for various unitary learning tasks, with potential applications in quantum machine learning, many-body physics and benchmarking of near-term devices.</p>

This measure exhibits a set of universal properties with its significance in quantum information science. We apply it across diverse contexts: in Fermi gases, establishing connections to mutual information and interacting conformal field theory; in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ correspondence, unveiling finer subregion-subregion duality; and in Chern insulators, distinguishing between different quantum phases, especially topological gapped state and trivial gapped state.

            <p>We define a general formulation of quantum PCPs, which captures adaptivity and multiple unentangled provers, and give a detailed construction of the quantum reduction to a local Hamiltonian with a constant promise gap. The reduction turns out to be a versatile subroutine to prove properties of quantum PCPs, allowing us to show: (i) Non-adaptive quantum PCPs can simulate adaptive quantum PCPs when the number of proof queries is constant. In fact, this can even be shown to hold when the non-adaptive quantum PCP picks the proof indices simply uniformly at random from a subset of all possible index combinations, answering an open question by Aharonov, Arad, Landau and Vazirani (STOC '09). (ii) If the $q$-local Hamiltonian problem with constant promise gap can be solved in $\mathsf{QCMA}$, then $\mathsf{QPCP}[q] \subseteq \mathsf{QCMA}$ for any $q \in O(1)$. (iii) If $\mathsf{QMA}(k)$ has a quantum PCP for any $k \leq \text{poly}(n)$, then $\mathsf{QMA}(2) = \mathsf{QMA}$, connecting two of the longest-standing open problems in quantum complexity theory. Moreover, we also show that there exist (quantum) oracles relative to which certain quantum PCP statements are false. Hence, any attempt to prove the quantum PCP conjecture requires, just as was the case for the classical PCP theorem, (quantumly) non-relativizing techniques.</p>

            <p>This paper presents a quantum algorithm for the solution of prototypical second-order linear elliptic partial differential equations discretized by $d$-linear finite elements on Cartesian grids of a bounded $d$-dimensional domain. An essential step in the construction is a BPX preconditioner, which transforms the linear system into a sufficiently well-conditioned one, making it amenable to quantum computation. We provide a constructive proof demonstrating that, for any fixed dimension, our quantum algorithm can compute suitable functionals of the solution to a given tolerance $\mathtt{tol}$ with an optimal complexity of order $\mathtt{tol}^{-1}$ up to logarithmic terms, significantly improving over existing approaches. Notably, this approach does not rely on regularity of the solution and achieves quantum advantage over classical solvers in two dimensions, whereas prior quantum methods required at least four dimensions for asymptotic benefits. We further detail the design and implementation of a quantum circuit capable of executing our algorithm, present simulator results, and report numerical experiments on current quantum hardware, confirming the feasibility of preconditioned finite element methods for near-term quantum computing.</p>

            <p>Superconducting qubits can be sensitive to abrupt energy deposits caused by cosmic rays and ambient radioactivity. While previous studies have explored correlated effects in time and space due to cosmic ray interactions, we present the first direct comparison of a transmon qubit's performance measured at two distinct sites: the above-ground SQMS facility (Fermilab, US) and the deep-underground Gran Sasso Laboratory (Italy). Despite the stark difference in radiation levels, we observe a similar average qubit relaxation time of approximately 80 microseconds at both locations. To further investigate potential radiation-induced events, we employ a fast decay detection protocol, comparing the relative rates of triggered events between the two environments. Although intrinsic noise remains the dominant source of single errors in superconducting qubits, our analysis revealed a significant excess of radiation-induced events for high-coherence transmon qubits operated above-ground. Finally, using $\gamma$-ray sources with increasing activity levels, we evaluate the qubit response in a controlled low-background environment.</p>

            <p>We investigate the sensing capacity of non-equilibrium dynamics in quantum systems exhibiting Bloch oscillations. By focusing on the resource efficiency of the probe, quantified by quantum Fisher information, we find different scaling behaviors in two different phases, namely localized and extended. Our results provide a quantitative ansatz for quantum Fisher information in terms of time, probe size, and the number of excitations. In the long-time regime, the quantum Fisher information is a quadratic function of time, touching the Heisenberg limit. The system size scaling drastically depends on the phase changing from quantum-enhanced scaling in the extended phase to size-independent behavior in the localized phase. Furthermore, increasing the number of excitations always enhances the precision of the probe, although, in the interacting systems the enhancement becomes less eminent than the non-interacting probes. This is due to the induced localization by increasing the interaction between the excitations. We show that a simple particle configuration measurement together with a maximum likelihood estimation can closely reach the ultimate precision limit in both single- and multi-particle probes.</p>

            <h2>Coherent information for CSS codes under decoherence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryotaro Niwa, Jong Yeon Lee</p>
            <p>Stabilizer codes lie at the heart of modern quantum-error-correcting codes (QECC). Of particular importance is a class called Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes, which includes many important examples such as toric codes, color codes, and fractons. Recent studies have revealed that the decoding transition for these QECCs could be intrinsically captured by calculating information-theoretic quantities from the mixed state. Here we perform a simple analytic calculation of the coherent information for general CSS codes under local incoherent Pauli errors via diagonalization of the density matrices and mapping to classical statistical mechanical (SM) models. Our result establishes a rigorous connection between the decoding transition of the quantum code and the phase transition in the random classical SM model. It is also directly confirmed for CSS codes that exact error correction is possible if and only if the maximum-likelihood (ML) decoder always succeeds in the thermodynamic limit. Thus, the fundamental threshold is saturated by the optimal decoder.</p>

            <h2>Qudit Quantum Programming with Projective Cliffords</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jennifer Paykin, Sam Winnick</p>
            <p>This paper introduces a novel abstraction for programming quantum operations, specifically projective Cliffords, as functions over the qudit Pauli group. Generalizing the idea behind Pauli tableaux, we introduce a type system and lambda calculus for projective Cliffords called LambdaPC, which captures well-formed Clifford operations via a Curry-Howard correspondence with a particular encoding of the Clifford and Pauli groups. Importantly, the language captures not just qubit operations, but qudit operations for any dimension $d$. Throughout the paper we explore what it means to program with projective Cliffords through a number of examples and a case study focusing on stabilizer error correcting codes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander Kulpe, Giulio Malavolta, Connor Paddock, Simon Schmidt, Michael Walter</p>
            <p>A cryptographic compiler introduced by Kalai et al. (STOC'23) converts any nonlocal game into an interactive protocol with a single computationally bounded prover. Although the compiler is known to be sound in the case of classical provers and complete in the quantum case, quantum soundness has so far only been established for special classes of games. In this work, we establish a quantum soundness result for all compiled two-player nonlocal games. In particular, we prove that the quantum commuting operator value of the underlying nonlocal game is an upper bound on the quantum value of the compiled game. Our result employs techniques from operator algebras in a computational and cryptographic setting to establish information-theoretic objects in the asymptotic limit of the security parameter. It further relies on a sequential characterization of quantum commuting operator correlations which may be of independent interest.</p>

            <h2>Harvesting asymmetric steering via non-identical detectors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shu-Min Wu, Rui-Di Wang, Xiao-Li Huang, Zejun Wang</p>
            <p>We investigate asymmetric steering harvesting phenomenon involving two non-identical inertial detectors with different energy gaps, which interact locally with vacuum massless scalar fields. Our study assumes that the energy gap of detector $B$ exceeds that of detector $A$. It is shown that $A\rightarrow B$ steerability is bigger that $B\rightarrow A$ steerability, implying that the observer with a small energy gap has more stronger steerability than the other one. We find that the energy gap difference can enlarge the harvesting-achievable range of $A\rightarrow B$ steering, while it can also narrow the harvesting-achievable range of $B\rightarrow A$ steering at the same time. In addition, the maximal steering asymmetry indicates the transformation between two-way steering and one-way steering in some cases, showing that $B\rightarrow A$ steering suffers ``sudden death" at the point of this parameter. These results suggest that asymmetric steering exhibits richer and more interesting properties than quantum entanglement harvested from vacuum quantum field.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we study the relationship between advice in the form of a training set and classical advice. We do this by analyzing the class $\mathsf{BPP/samp}$ and certain variants of it. Specifically, our main result demonstrates that $\mathsf{BPP/samp}$ is a proper subset of the class $\mathsf{P/poly}$, which implies that advice in the form of a training set is strictly weaker than classical advice. This result remains valid when considering quantum advice and a quantum generalization of the training set. Finally, leveraging the insights from our proofs, we identify both sufficient and necessary complexity-theoretic assumptions for the existence of concept classes that exhibit a quantum learning speed-up. We consider both the worst-case setting, where accurate results are required for all inputs, and the average-case setting.</p>

            <p>We investigate the emergence of stable subspaces in the low-temperature quantum thermal dynamics of finite spin chains. Our analysis reveals the existence of effective decoherence-free qudit subspaces, persisting for timescales exponential in $\beta$. Surprisingly, the appearance of metastable subspaces is not directly related to the entanglement structure of the ground state(s). Rather, they arise from symmetry relations in low-lying excited states. Despite their stability within a 'phase', practical realization of stable qubits is hindered by susceptibility to symmetry-breaking perturbations. This work highlights that there can be non-trivial quantum behavior in the thermal dynamics of noncommuting many body models, and opens the door to more extensive studies of self-correction in such systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Igor Ermakov, Oleg Lychkovskiy, Boris V. Fine</p>
            <p>We numerically investigate the stability of exceptional periodic classical trajectories in rather generic chaotic many-body systems and explore a possible connection between these trajectories and exceptional nonthermal quantum eigenstates known as "quantum many-body scars". The systems considered are chaotic spin chains with short-range interactions, both classical and quantum. On the classical side, the chosen periodic trajectories are such that all spins instantaneously point in the same direction, which evolves as a function of time. We find that the largest Lyapunov exponents characterising the stabillity of these trajectories have surprisingly strong and nontrivial dependencies on the interaction constants and chain lengths. In particular, we identify rather long spin chains, where the above periodic trajectories are Lyapunov-stable on many-body energy shells overwhelmingly dominated by chaotic motion. We also find that instabilities around periodic trajectories in modestly large spin chains develop into a transient nearly quasiperiodic non-ergodic regime. In some cases, the lifetime of this regime is extremely long, which we interpret as a manifestation of Arnold diffusion in the vicinity of integrable dynamics. On the quantum side, we numerically investigate the dynamics of quantum states starting with all spins initially pointing in the same direction: these are the quantum counterparts of the initial conditions for the above periodic classical trajectories. Our investigation reveals the existence of quantum many-body scars for numerically accessible finite chains of spins 3/2 and higher. The dynamic thermalisation process dominated by quantum scars is shown to exhibit a slowdown in comparison with generic thermalisation at the same energy. Finally, we identify quantum signatures of the proximity to a classical separatrix of the periodic motion.</p>

            <h2>Comparing One- and Two-way Quantum Repeater Architectures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Prateek Mantri, Kenneth Goodenough, Don Towsley</p>
            <p>Quantum repeaters are an essential building block for realizing long-distance quantum communications. However, due to the fragile nature of quantum information, these repeaters suffer from loss and operational errors. Prior works have classified repeaters into three broad categories based on their use of probabilistic or near-deterministic methods to mitigate these errors. Besides differences in classical communication times, these approaches also vary in technological complexity, with near-deterministic methods requiring more advanced technology. Recent increases in the number of available memories, and introduction of entanglement generation through multiplexing motivate a re-comparison of one-way and two-way repeater architectures. In this work, we propose a novel protocol that optimizes multiplexed elementary link generation and distillation in memory-unconstrained 'connection-oriented' two-way repeaters to boost the entanglement generation rates. We introduce a recursive formulation to derive the probability distribution of the number of Bell pairs in multiplexed two-way repeater architectures, compatible with probabilistic $n$-to-$k$ distillation protocols. We then compare the performance of this new protocol with one-way schemes in the parameter regime where one-way schemes have previously been shown to be advantageous, and find that the multiplexed two-way protocol provides better performance with lower resource and technology requirements.</p>

            <p>Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is an emerging field of research with potential applications to distributed collaborative learning, such as Split Learning (SL). SL allows resource-constrained clients to collaboratively train ML models with a server, reduce their computational overhead, and enable data privacy by avoiding raw data sharing. Although QML with SL has been studied, the problem remains open in resource-constrained environments where clients lack quantum computing capabilities. Additionally, data privacy leakage between client and server in SL poses risks of reconstruction attacks on the server side. To address these issues, we propose Hybrid Quantum Split Learning (HQSL), an application of Hybrid QML in SL. HQSL enables classical clients to train models with a hybrid quantum server and curtails reconstruction attacks. Additionally, we introduce a novel qubit-efficient data-loading technique for designing a quantum layer in HQSL, minimizing both the number of qubits and circuit depth. Evaluations on real hardware demonstrate HQSL's practicality under realistic quantum noise. Experiments on five datasets demonstrate HQSL's feasibility and ability to enhance classification performance compared to its classical models. Notably, HQSL achieves mean improvements of over 3% in both accuracy and F1-score for the Fashion-MNIST dataset, and over 1.5% in both metrics for the Speech Commands dataset. We expand these studies to include up to 100 clients, confirming HQSL's scalability. Moreover, we introduce a noise-based defense mechanism to tackle reconstruction attacks on the server side. Overall, HQSL enables classical clients to train collaboratively with a hybrid quantum server, improving model performance and resistance against reconstruction attacks.</p>

            <h2>Beating the Optimal Verification of Entangled States via Collective Strategies</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ye-Chao Liu, Jiangwei Shang</p>
            <p>In the realm of quantum information processing, the efficient characterization of entangled states poses an overwhelming challenge, rendering the traditional methods including quantum tomography unfeasible and impractical. To tackle this problem, we propose a new verification scheme using collective strategies, showcasing arbitrarily high efficiency that beats the optimal verification with global measurements. Our collective scheme can be implemented in various experimental platforms and scalable for large systems with a linear scaling on hardware requirement, and distributed operations are allowed. Notably, larger ensembles can always improve the efficiency further, but without increasing the quantum memory. More importantly, the approach consumes only a few copies of the entangled states, while ensuring the preservation of unmeasured ones, and even boosting their fidelity for any subsequent tasks. Furthermore, our protocol provides additional insight into the specific types of noise affecting the system, thereby facilitating potential targeted improvements. These advancements hold promise for a wide range of applications, offering a pathway towards more robust and efficient quantum information processing.</p>

            <p>Disorder-induced phenomena in quantum many-body systems pose significant challenges for analytical methods and numerical simulations at relevant time and system scales. To reduce the cost of disorder-sampling, we investigate quantum circuits initialized in states tunable to superpositions over all disorder configurations. In a translationally-invariant lattice gauge theory (LGT), these states can be interpreted as a superposition over gauge sectors. We observe localization in this LGT in the absence of disorder in one and two dimensions: perturbations fail to diffuse despite fully disorder-free evolution and initial states. However, Rényi entropy measurements reveal that superposition-prepared states fundamentally differ from those obtained by direct disorder sampling. Leveraging superposition, we propose an algorithm with a polynomial speedup in sampling disorder configurations, a longstanding challenge in many-body localization studies.</p>

            <p>We propose an exercise in which one attempts to deduce the formalism of quantum mechanics solely from phenomenological observations. The only assumed inputs are obtained through sequential probing of quantum systems; no presuppositions about the underlying mathematical structures are permitted. We demonstrate that it is indeed possible to derive, on this basis, a complete and fully functional formalism rooted in the structures of Hilbert spaces. However, the resulting formalism--the bi-trajectory formalism--differs significantly from the standard state-focused formulation. In Part I of the paper, we analyze the outcomes of various experiments involving sequential measurements of quantum observables. These outcomes are quantitatively described by phenomenological multi-time probability distributions, estimated from experimental data. Our first conclusion is that the theory describing these experiments must be non-classical: the measured sequences cannot be interpreted as sampling of a uni-trajectory representing the system's observable. The non-classical nature of the investigated systems manifests in a range of observed phenomena, including quantum interference, the quantum Zeno effect, and uncertainty relations between the measured observables.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessandro Falco, Giacomo De Palma</p>
            <p>We prove the multimode conditional quantum Entropy Power Inequality for bosonic quantum systems. This inequality determines the minimum conditional von Neumann entropy of the output of the most general linear mixing of bosonic quantum modes among all the input states of the modes with given conditional entropies. Bosonic quantum systems constitute the mathematical model for the electromagnetic radiation in the quantum regime, which provides the most promising platform for quantum communication and quantum key distribution. We apply our multimode conditional quantum Entropy Power Inequality to determine new lower bounds to the squashed entanglement of a large family of bosonic Gaussian states. The squashed entanglement is one of the main entanglement measures in quantum communication theory, providing the best known upper bound to the distillable key. Exploiting this result, we determine a new lower bound to the squashed entanglement of the multimode bosonic Gaussian channels that are extreme, i.e., that cannot be decomposed as a non-trivial convex combination of quantum channels. The squashed entanglement of a quantum channel provides an upper bound to its secret-key capacity, i.e., the capacity to generate a secret key shared between the sender and the receiver. Lower bounds to the squashed entanglement are notoriously hard to prove. Our results contribute to break this barrier and will stimulate further research in the field of quantum communication with bosonic quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>Classical Algorithms for Constant Approximation of the Ground State Energy of Local Hamiltonians</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> François Le Gall</p>
            <p>We construct classical algorithms computing an approximation of the ground state energy of an arbitrary $k$-local Hamiltonian acting on $n$ qubits. We first consider the setting where a good ``guiding state'' is available, which is the main setting where quantum algorithms are expected to achieve an exponential speedup over classical methods. We show that a constant approximation (i.e., an approximation with constant relative accuracy) of the ground state energy can be computed classically in $\mathrm{poly}\left(1/\chi,n\right)$ time and $\mathrm{poly}(n)$ space, where $\chi$ denotes the overlap between the guiding state and the ground state (as in prior works in dequantization, we assume sample-and-query access to the guiding state). This gives a significant improvement over the recent classical algorithm by Gharibian and Le Gall (SICOMP 2023), and matches (up a to polynomial overhead) both the time and space complexities of quantum algorithms for constant approximation of the ground state energy. We also obtain classical algorithms for higher-precision approximation. For the setting where no guided state is given (i.e., the standard version of the local Hamiltonian problem), we obtain a classical algorithm computing a constant approximation of the ground state energy in $2^{O(n)}$ time and $\mathrm{poly}(n)$ space. To our knowledge, before this work it was unknown how to classically achieve these bounds simultaneously, even for constant approximation. We also discuss complexity-theoretic aspects of our results.</p>

            <p>A distributed quantum computing network requires a quantum communication channel between spatially separated processing units. In superconducting circuits, such a channel can be implemented based on propagating microwave photons to encode and transfer quantum information between an emitter and a receiver. However, traveling microwave photons can be lost during the transmission, leading to the failure of information transfer. Heralding protocols can be used to detect such photon losses. In this work, we propose such a protocol and experimentally demonstrate a frequency-bin encoding method of microwave photonic modes using superconducting circuits. We deterministically encode the quantum information from a superconducting qubit by simultaneously emitting its information into two photonic modes at different frequencies, with a process fidelity of 90.4%. The frequency-bin-encoded photonic modes can be used, at the receiver processor, to detect the occurrence of photon loss. Our work thus provides a reliable method to implement high-fidelity quantum state transfer in a distributed quantum computing network, incorporating error detection to enhance performance and accuracy.</p>

            <p>In the circuit model of quantum computing, amplitude amplification techniques can be used to find solutions to NP-hard problems defined on $n$-bits in time $\text{poly}(n) 2^{n/2}$. In this work, we investigate whether such general statements can be made for adiabatic quantum optimization, as provable results regarding its performance are mostly unknown. Although a lower bound of $\Omega(2^{n/2})$ has existed in such a setting for over a decade, a purely adiabatic algorithm with this running time has been absent. We show that adiabatic quantum optimization using an unstructured search approach results in a running time that matches this lower bound (up to a polylogarithmic factor) for a broad class of classical local spin Hamiltonians. For this, it is necessary to bound the spectral gap throughout the adiabatic evolution and compute beforehand the position of the avoided crossing with sufficient precision so as to adapt the adiabatic schedule accordingly. However, we show that the position of the avoided crossing is approximately given by a quantity that depends on the degeneracies and inverse gaps of the problem Hamiltonian and is NP-hard to compute even within a low additive precision. Furthermore, computing it exactly (or nearly exactly) is \#P-hard. Our work indicates a possible limitation of adiabatic quantum optimization algorithms, leaving open the question of whether provable Grover-like speed-ups can be obtained for any optimization problem using this approach.</p>

In the treated examples, the electric current in a solenoid varies in time, changing its internal magnetic field and producing an external electric field, while a quantum charged particle is in a superposition state inside two Faraday cages in an interferometer. The Faraday cages cancel the electric field at their interiors, such that the particle is always subjected to null electromagnetic fields. We discuss how the AB phase difference depends on the topology of the electric and magnetic fields in spacetime in the different treated situations. In particular, we discuss interesting results when a conducting wire connects the two Faraday cages, with the AB phase depending on the wire position. We also show an amplification of the AB phase when the wire makes several turns around the solenoid, which could enable an experimental verification of the effect.</p>

            <p>One potential route toward fault-tolerant universal quantum computation is to use non-Abelian topological codes. In this work, we investigate how to achieve this goal with the quantum double model $\mathcal{D}(S_3)$ -- a specific non-Abelian topological code. By embedding each on-site Hilbert space into a qubit-qutrit pair, we give an explicit construction of the circuits for creating, moving, and locally measuring all non-trivial anyons. We also design a specialized anyon interferometer to remotely measure the total charge of well-separated anyons; this avoids fusion, which would compromise fault tolerance. These protocols enable the implementation of a universal gate set proposed by Cui et al. and active quantum error correction of the circuit-level noise during the computation process. To further reduce the error rate and facilitate error correction, we encode each physical degree of freedom of $\mathcal{D}(S_3)$ into a novel, quantum, error-correcting code, enabling fault-tolerant realization, at the logical level, of all gates in the anyon manipulation circuits. Our proposal offers a promising path to realize robust universal topological quantum computation in the NISQ era.</p>

            <p>This work introduces a self-learning protocol that incorporates measurement and feedback into variational quantum circuits for efficient quantum state preparation. By combining projective measurements with conditional feedback, the protocol learns state preparation strategies that extend beyond unitary-only methods, leveraging measurement-based shortcuts to reduce circuit depth. Using the spin-1 Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki state as a benchmark, the protocol learns high-fidelity state preparation by overcoming a family of measurement induced local minima through adjustments of parameter update frequencies and ancilla regularization. Despite these efforts, optimization remains challenging due to the highly non-convex landscapes inherent to variational circuits. The approach is extended to larger systems using translationally invariant ansätze and recurrent neural networks for feedback, demonstrating scalability. Additionally, the successful preparation of a specific AKLT state with desired edge modes highlights the potential to discover new state preparation protocols where none currently exist. These results indicate that integrating measurement and feedback into variational quantum algorithms provides a promising framework for quantum state preparation.</p>

            <p>We investigate the inseparability of states generated by superposition of a multipartite pure entangled state with a product state. In particular, we identify specific multipartite entangled states that will always produce inseparability after superposition with an arbitrary completely product state. Thus, these entangled states are unconditionally superposition-robust, and we refer to this phenomenon as ``unconditional inseparability of superposition" in multipartite quantum systems. In this way, we complete the picture of unconditional inseparability of superposition which was introduced earlier for bipartite systems. We also characterize the superposition of a multipartite pure entangled state with a pure bi-separable state. However, the present analysis allows us to obtain a more general result, viz., there exists at least one pure entangled state in any multipartite Hilbert space such that its superposition with an arbitrary completely product state always yields an entangled state. On the other hand, for any bipartite pure entangled state, if at least one of the subsystems is a qubit, then it is always possible to find a suitable product state such that the superposition of the entangled state and the product state produces a product state. In this way, we find a feature of multipartite quantum systems which is in sharp contrast with that of bipartite ones. We then show how unconditional inseparability of superposition can be useful in exhibiting an indistinguishability property within the local unambiguous state discrimination problem.</p>

We use these lattice state designs to construct a continuous variable shadow tomography protocol, derive sample complexity bounds for both global- and local GKP shadows under reasonable physical assumptions, and provide the physical gadgets needed to implement this protocol.</p>

            <h2>Cylindrically confined $H$ atom in magnetic field: variational cut-off factor</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. N. Mendoza Tavera, H. Olivares-Pilón, M. Rodríguez-Arcos, A. M. Escobar-Ruiz</p>
            <p>In the present study, we consider the hydrogen atom confined within an impenetrable infinite cylindrical cavity of radius $\rho_{0}$ in the presence of a constant magnetic field ${\bf B} = B\,\hat{\bf z}$ oriented along the main cylinder's axis. In the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, anchoring the nucleus to the geometric center of the cylinder, a physically meaningful 3-parametric trial function is used to determine the ground state energy $E$ of the system. This trial function incorporates the exact symmetries and key limiting behaviors of the problem explicitly. In particular, it does not treat the Coulomb potential nor the magnetic interaction as a \textit{perturbation}. The novel inclusion of a variational cut-off factor $\big(1 - \big(\frac{\rho}{\rho_0}\big)^\nu\big)$, $\nu \geq 1$, appears to represent a significant improvement compared to the non-variational cut-off factors commonly employed in the literature. The dependence of the total energy $E=E(\rho_0,\,B)$ and the binding energy $E_b=E_b(\rho_0,\,B)$ on the cavity radius $\rho_0 \in [0.8,\,5] \,$a.u. and the magnetic field strength $B\in [0.0,\,1.0]\,$a.u. is presented in detail. The expectation values $\langle \rho \rangle$ and $\langle|z| \rangle$, and the Shannon entropy in position space are computed to provide additional insights into the system's localization. A brief discussion is provided comparing the 2D and 3D cases as well.</p>

            <h2>Nonlocal characteristics and argand diagram of two-qubit gates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Karthick Selvan, S. Balakrishnan</p>
            <p>Nonlocal characteristics of a two-qubit gate are determined by its nonlocal part. The squared eigenvalues of the nonlocal part of a two-qubit gate exist on the unit circle in the complex plane. We show that two sets of chords, the chords connecting the squared eigenvalues with each other and those connecting a squared eigenvalue with the complex conjugate of others in the unit circle, can be used to describe the nonlocal characteristics of two-qubit gates. Lengths of both sets of chords are proportional to the amount of entanglement contained in certain pure states. The entangling power of a two-qubit gate can be expressed in terms of the squared lengths of the first set of chords. Similarly, we show that the gate typicality of a two-qubit gate can be expressed in terms of the squared lengths of the second set of chords and the linear entropy of a two-qubit gate can be expressed using the squared lengths of both sets of chords. Perfect entanglers are known to transform some product states into maximally entangled states. The convex hull of the squared eigenvalues of the nonlocal part of perfect entanglers contain the zero. We analyse the simplices containing the zero in the convex hull of the squared eigenvalues of the nonlocal part of perfect entanglers to construct a pair of orthonormal product states that can be transformed into maximally entangled states by the nonlocal part of perfect entanglers and divide the region of perfect entanglers in the Weyl chamber into three tetrahedral regions and eight bounding planes based on the uniqueness of the simplices containing the zero.</p>

            <h2>Correlations and Krylov spread for a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian: Ising chain with a complex-valued transverse magnetic field</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> E. Medina-Guerra, I. V. Gornyi, Yuval Gefen</p>
            <p>Krylov complexity measures the spread of an evolved state in a natural basis, induced by the generator of the dynamics and the initial state. Here, we study the spread in Hilbert space of the state of an Ising chain subject to a complex-valued transverse magnetic field, initialized in a trivial product state with all spins pointing down. We demonstrate that Krylov spread reveals structural features of many-body systems that remain hidden in correlation functions that are traditionally employed to determine the phase diagram. When the imaginary part of the spectrum of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian is gapped, the system state asymptotically approaches the non-Hermitian Bogoliubov vacuum for this Hamiltonian. We find that the spread of this evolution unravels three different dynamical phases based on how the spread reaches its infinite-time value. Furthermore, we establish a connection between the Krylov spread and the static correlation function for the z-components of spins in the underlying non-Hermitian Bogoliubov vacuum, providing a full analytical characterization of correlations across the phase diagram. Specifically, for a gapped imaginary spectrum in a finite magnetic field, we find that the correlation function exhibits an oscillatory behavior that decays exponentially in space. Conversely, for a gapless imaginary spectrum, the correlation function displays an oscillatory behavior with an amplitude that decays algebraically in space; the underlying power law depends on the manifestation of two exceptional points within this phase.</p>

            <p>A scheme for implementing quantum batteries in a realizable and controllable platform based on a trapped ion chain driven by a mechanical oscillator is proposed. The effects of the hopping interaction between the two-level ions and the coupling interaction between the ions and the external mechanical oscillator on the charging process of the battery are investigated. The importance of the counter-rotating wave terms in the system's Hamiltonian, which are often ignored, is analyzed, and it is found that the charging energy and the ergotropy of the battery are dramatically affected by the counter-rotating wave terms. The quantum phase transition of the two-level system is restrained by the counter-rotating wave terms due to the destruction of the quantum coherence. Lastly, the power-law dependence of the charging process on the distance between the ions is discussed. Our theoretical analysis provides a solid foundation for the development of a practical quantum battery.</p>

            <p>This paper investigates the complex nonlinear dynamics of an optomechanical system featuring an optical cavity coupled to two mechanical resonators interconnected by a phase-dependent interaction. We specifically explore the role of this phase-dependent phonon hopping as a mechanism for generating synthetic gauge fields without relying on gain-loss or PT-symmetric elements, offering a potentially more robust approach to manipulate mechanical energy transfer. By deriving the semiclassical dynamical equations, we map out the system's behavior across different parameter regimes. Our findings reveal a rich spectrum of dynamics, including bistability (coexistence of two steady states) and the emergence of complex attractors such as self-excited oscillations, hidden attractors, and chaos. We demonstrate how controlling system parameters, particularly the mechanical coupling phase and optical drive, allows for tunability between these distinct dynamical states. The presence of tunable bistability and sensitive chaotic regimes offers significant potential for practical applications. Specifically, we discuss how these controlled dynamics could be leveraged for state-switching in optical information processing and for enhancing sensitivity in advanced sensor technologies through chaos-based mechanisms. This work deepens our understanding of how synthetic gauge fields, generated via phase-dependent interactions, can sculpt the nonlinear dynamics of optomechanical systems, providing a pathway toward designing robust and tunable devices for signal processing, communication, and sensing.</p>

            <p>We identify a \emph{universal functional form} that governs anticoncentration in random quantum circuits-one that holds across diverse circuit architectures and depths, and crucially remains valid even at finite system sizes and shallow depth. We support this claim through analytical results for ensembles of random tensor-network states and random-phase models. This compact, universal expression for the output bitstring probability distribution is fully characterized by just two fitting parameters, as validated through extensive numerical simulations. Our findings underscore the pivotal role of finite-size and finite-depth effects in shaping anticoncentration and introduce a practical framework for benchmarking quantum devices using shallow circuits, thereby enabling validation of systems significantly larger than previously accessible.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Avadhut V. Purohit, Udaysinh T. Bhosale</p>
            <p>We study the double kicked top (DKT), which is an extension of the standard quantum kicked top (QKT) model. The model allows us to study the transition from time-reversal symmetric to broken time-reversal symmetric dynamics. Our transformation in the kick strength parameter space $(k, k') \to (k_r, k_\theta)$ reveals interesting features. The transformed kicked strength parameter $k_r$ drives a higher growth of chaos and is equivalent to the standard QKT, whereas the other transformed kicked strength parameter $k_\theta$ leads to a weaker growth. We discuss the fixed points, their stability, and verify results obtained by computing the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE) and the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy (KSE). We exactly solve 2- to 4-qubit versions of DKT by obtaining its eigenvalues, eigenvectors and the entanglement dynamics. Furthermore, we find the criteria for periodicity of the entanglement dynamics. We investigate measures of quantum correlations from two perspectives: the deep quantum and the semi-classical regime. Signatures of phase-space structure are numerically shown in the long-time averages of the quantum correlations. Our model can be realised experimentally as an extension of the standard QKT.</p>

            <h2>A Useful Metric for the NISQ Era: Qubit Error Probability and Its Role in Zero Noise Extrapolation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nahual Sobrino, Unai Aseginolaza, Joaquim Jornet-Somoza, Juan Borge</p>
            <p>Accurate assessment and management of errors is indispensable for extracting useful results from noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. In this work, we propose the qubit error probability (QEP), a device specific metric that combines relaxation, dephasing, gate, and measurement contributions into a single per qubit figure of merit computable before execution. Leveraging QEP as the control variable, we revisit zero noise extrapolation (ZNE) by adding pairs of controlled native two-qubit gates on all connected qubit pairs to generate circuits with successively larger mean QEP; the zero error limit is then approximated by a linear regression of the measured observable against those values. Benchmarking on IBM Quantum Heron processors, we apply QEP guided ZNE to first order Trotterized simulations of the two dimensional transverse field Ising model, chosen as a representative interacting many body system, involving up to 68 qubits and 15 Trotter steps. In regimes where the raw circuits exhibit a finite mean QEP, the method suppresses observable errors beyond those attainable with circuit depth scaled ZNE, while requiring only three noise scaled evaluations and no additional classical post processing. These results demonstrate that QEP serves as a transparent and efficient error metric, and that its integration into ZNE provides a practical route to reliability gains on current superconducting hardware, without the resource costs associated with full quantum error correction.</p>

            <p>$\alpha$-Tantalum ($\alpha$-Ta) is an emerging material for superconducting qubit fabrication due to the low microwave loss of its stable native oxide. However, hydrogen absorption during fabrication, particularly when removing the native oxide, can degrade performance by increasing microwave loss. In this work, we demonstrate that hydrogen can enter $\alpha$-Ta thin films when exposed to 10 vol% hydrofluoric acid for 3 minutes or longer, leading to an increase in power-independent ohmic loss in high-Q resonators at millikelvin temperatures. Reduced resonator performance is likely caused by the formation of non-superconducting tantalum hydride (TaH$_x$) precipitates. We further show that annealing at 500°C in ultra-high vacuum (10$^{-8}$ Torr) for one hour fully removes hydrogen and restores the resonators' intrinsic quality factors to ~4 million at the single-photon level. These findings identify a previously unreported loss mechanism in $\alpha$-Ta and offer a pathway to reverse hydrogen-induced degradation in quantum devices based on Ta and, by extension also Nb, enabling more robust fabrication processes for superconducting qubits.</p>

            <p>Quantum computers offer a promising route to tackling problems that are classically intractable such as in prime-factorization, solving large-scale linear algebra and simulating complex quantum systems, but potentially require fault-tolerant quantum hardware. On the other hand, variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are a promising approach for leveraging near-term quantum computers to solve complex problems. However, there remain major challenges in their trainability and resource costs on quantum hardware. Here we address these challenges by adopting Hardware Efficient and dynamical LIe algebra supported Ansatz (HELIA), and propose two training methods that combine an existing classical-enhanced g-sim method and the quantum-based Parameter-Shift Rule (PSR). Our improvement comes from distributing the resources required for gradient estimation and training to both classical and quantum hardware. We numerically evaluate our approach for ground-state estimation of 6 to 18-qubit Hamiltonians using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and quantum phase classification for up to 12-qubit Hamiltonians using quantum neural networks. For VQE, our method achieves higher accuracy and success rates, with an average reduction in quantum hardware calls of up to 60% compared to purely quantum-based PSR. For classification, we observe test accuracy improvements of up to 2.8%. We also numerically demonstrate the capability of HELIA in mitigating barren plateaus, paving the way for training large-scale quantum models.</p>

            <p>Quantum state tomography (QST) is a crucial tool for characterizing quantum states. However, QST becomes impractical for reconstructing multi-qubit density matrices since data sets and computational costs grow exponentially with qubit number. In this Letter, we introduce selective and efficient QST (SEEQST), an approach for efficiently estimating multiple selected elements of an arbitrary $N$-qubit density matrix. We show that any $N$-qubit density matrix can be partitioned into $2^N$ subsets, each containing $2^N$ elements. With SEEQST, any such subset can be accurately estimated from just two experiments with only single-qubit measurements. The complexity for estimating any subset remains constant regardless of Hilbert-space dimension, so SEEQST can find the full density matrix using $2^{N+1} - 1$ experiments, where standard methods would use $3^N$ experiments. We provide a circuit decomposition for the SEEQST experiments, demonstrating that their maximum circuit depth scales logarithmically with $N$ assuming all-to-all connectivity.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ian George, Christoph Hirche, Theshani Nuradha, Mark M. Wilde</p>
            <p>In classical information theory, the Doeblin coefficient of a classical channel provides an efficiently computable upper bound on the total-variation contraction coefficient of the channel, leading to what is known as a strong data-processing inequality. Here, we investigate quantum Doeblin coefficients as a generalization of the classical concept. In particular, we define various new quantum Doeblin coefficients, one of which has several desirable properties, including concatenation and multiplicativity, in addition to being efficiently computable. We also develop various interpretations of two of the quantum Doeblin coefficients, including representations as minimal singlet fractions, exclusion values, reverse max-mutual and oveloH informations, reverse robustnesses, and hypothesis testing reverse mutual and oveloH informations. Our interpretations of quantum Doeblin coefficients as either entanglement-assisted or unassisted exclusion values are particularly appealing, indicating that they are proportional to the best possible error probabilities one could achieve in state-exclusion tasks by making use of the channel. We also outline various applications of quantum Doeblin coefficients, ranging from limitations on quantum machine learning algorithms that use parameterized quantum circuits (noise-induced barren plateaus), on error mitigation protocols, on the sample complexity of noisy quantum hypothesis testing, and on mixing, distinguishability, and decoupling times of time-varying channels. All of these applications make use of the fact that quantum Doeblin coefficients appear in upper bounds on various trace-distance contraction coefficients of a channel. Furthermore, in all of these applications, our analysis using Doeblin coefficients provides improvements of various kinds over contributions from prior literature, both in terms of generality and being efficiently computable.</p>

            <p>Executing quantum logic in cryogenic quantum computers requires a continuous energy supply from room-temperature control electronics. This dependence on external energy sources creates scalability limitations due to control channel density and heat dissipation. Here, we propose quantum batteries (QBs) as intrinsic quantum energy sources for quantum computation, enabling the thermodynamic limit of zero dissipation for unitary gates. Unlike classical power sources, QBs maintain quantum coherence with their load,a property that, while theoretically studied, remains unexploited in practical quantum technologies. We demonstrate that a bosonic Fock state QB can supply the energy required for arbitrary unitary gates, regardless of the circuit's depth, via quantum field recycling while facilitating a universal gate set controlled by a single parameter per qubit: its resonant frequency. The relative detuning of each qubit from the QB's resonant frequency gives rise to qualitatively two gate types, off-resonance and around-resonance. The former facilitates dispersive gates which allow multi-qubit parity probing while the latter enables energy exchange between the QB and the qubits, driving both population transfer and entanglement generation. This mechanism utilizes the all-to-all connectivity of the shared-resonator architecture to go beyond the standard single- and two-qubit native gates of current platforms with gate timescales of few pi/g, where g is the qubit-resonator coupling. The resultant speed-up includes also superextensive gates between symmetric Dicke states, characteristic of QB systems. By eliminating the individual drive lines, this approach significantly reduces wiring overhead, potentially quadrupling the number of qubits integrated within cryogenic systems and offering a scalable architecture for quantum computing.</p>

We test this approach on a Rydberg ladder system and achieve a mean absolute error of $3.6 \times 10^{-3}$ when evaluating within the training range on a dataset with entropy values ranging from 0 to 1.9. The model achieves a mean absolute percentage error of 1.44\% and outperforms MI-based bounds. When tested beyond the training range, the model maintains reasonable accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fine-tuning the model with small datasets significantly improves performance on data outside the original training range.</p>

We construct a universal and complete theoretical model for nonclassical stabilization, and propose a novel bright squeezed light generation scheme with assistance of a hybrid noise stabilization technology.

Meanwhile, the technical noise suppression magnitude is further improved by 9 dB, which creates the prerequisite conditions for preparing a broadband bright squeezed light. Finally, a -5.5 dB bright squeezed light with a power of 1 mW and a squeezing bandwidth among kHz to MHz band was generated. The experimental results agree well with the theoretical one. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first demonstration of a milliwatt-order bright squeezed light across the kHz frequency band. The demonstration sheds light on potential applications of bright squeezed light in quantum metrology and might enable new concepts in the future.</p>

            <p>Although high-threshold and low-overhead quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes, such as bivariate bicycle (BB) codes, can reduce the physical-qubit cost by an order of magnitude compared to the Kitaev toric code, their torus layout remains difficult for physical implementation. In this work, we introduce the first systematic procedure to convert BB codes into fully planar, open-boundary qLDPC codes, preserving their performance. We present planar code families with logical dimensions $k=6\sim13$, e.g., $[[78, 6, 6]]$, $[[107, 7, 7]]$, $[[268, 8, 12]]$, $[[405, 9, 15]]$, $[[348, 10, 13]]$, $[[450, 11, 15]]$, $[[386, 12, 12]]$, $[[362, 13, 11]]$, all with geometrically local weight-6 stabilizers. Allowing weight-8 stabilizers produces a $[[282,12,14]]$ code, exhibiting an efficiency metric ($kd^2/n$) an order of magnitude higher than the surface code. The construction combines boundary anyon condensation with the ``lattice grafting'' optimization, yielding high-performance qLDPC codes natively compatible with planar hardware architectures. It also uncovers Sierpinski-type fractal logical operators whose distance scales with the fractal area on finite lattices. These planar qLDPC codes provide an implementable route to resource-efficient, high-threshold fault tolerance and a flexible framework for future code design on realistic two-dimensional hardware.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaoyang Wang, Yuexin Su, Tongyang Li</p>
            <p>Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are promising to demonstrate the advantage of near-term quantum computing over classical computing in practical applications, such as the maximum cut (MaxCut) problem. However, current VQAs such as the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) have lower performance guarantees compared to the best-known classical algorithm, and suffer from hard optimization processes due to the barren plateau problem. We propose a light-cone VQA by choosing an optimal gate sequence of the standard VQAs, which enables a significant improvement in solution accuracy while avoiding the barren plateau problem. Specifically, we prove that the light-cone VQA with one round achieves an approximation ratio of 0.7926 for the MaxCut problem in the worst case of $3$-regular graphs, which is higher than that of the 3-round QAOA, and can be further improved to 0.8333 by an angle-relaxation procedure. Finally, our numerical results indicate an exponential speed-up in finding the exact solution using the light-cone VQA compared with the classical algorithm. Using IBM's quantum devices, we demonstrate that the single-round light-cone VQA exceeds the known classical hardness threshold in both 72- and 148-qubit demonstrations, whereas $p$-round $\text{QAOA}$ with $p=1,2,3$ does not in the latter one.

            <p>The $n$-time correlation function is pivotal for establishing connections between theoretical predictions and experimental observations of a quantum system. Conventional methods for computing $n$-time correlation functions on quantum computers, such as the Hadamard test, generally require an ancilla qubit that controls the entire system -- an approach that poses challenges for digital quantum devices with limited qubit connectivity, as well as for analog quantum platforms lacking controlled operations. Here, we introduce a method to compute $n$-time correlation functions using only unitary evolutions on the system of interest, thereby eliminating the need for ancillas and the control operations. This approach substantially relaxes hardware connectivity requirements for digital processors and enables more practical measurements of $n$-time correlation functions on analog platforms. We demonstrate our protocol on IBM quantum hardware up to 12 qubits to measure the single-particle spectrum of the Schwinger model and the out-of-time-order correlator in the transverse-field Ising model. In the demonstration, we further introduce an error mitigation procedure based on signal processing that integrates signal filtering and correlation analysis, and successfully reproduces the noiseless simulation results from the noisy hardware.

            <p>Gottesman-Knill theorem states that computations on stabilizer circuits can be simulated on a classical computer, conventional simulation algorithms extensively use linear algebra over bit strings. For instance, given a non-adaptive stabilizer circuit, the problem of computing the probability of a given outcome (strong simulation) is known to be log-space reducible to solving the system of linear equations over Boolean variables, which is commonly done by Gaussian elimination. This note aims to make the connection between stabilizer circuits and Boolean linear algebra even more explicit. To do this, we extend the stabilizer tableau formalism to include stabilizer tableau descriptions of arbitrary stabilizer operations (Clifford channels). Finding the tableau corresponding to the composition of two channels becomes a linear algebra problem. Any stabilizer circuit rewrites to a diagram with stabilizer tableaux on vertices, contracting an edge means to take the composition of channels, to compute the result of the circuit means to fully contract the diagram. Thus, simulating stabilizer circuits reduces to a sequence of Gaussian eliminations. This approach gives a new perspective on explaining the work of stabilizer tableau methods (reproducing the asymptotics) and creates opportunity for exploring various tensor-contraction techniques in stabilizer simulation.</p>

            <p>We study the computational complexity of estimating the quantum $\ell_{\alpha}$ distance ${\mathrm{T}_\alpha}(\rho_0,\rho_1)$, defined via the Schatten $\alpha$-norm $\|A\|_{\alpha} = \mathrm{tr}(|A|^{\alpha})^{1/\alpha}$, given $\operatorname{poly}(n)$-size state-preparation circuits of $n$-qubit quantum states $\rho_0$ and $\rho_1$. This quantity serves as a lower bound on the trace distance for $\alpha > 1$. For any constant $\alpha > 1$, we develop an efficient rank-independent quantum estimator for ${\mathrm{T}_\alpha}(\rho_0,\rho_1)$ with time complexity $\operatorname{poly}(n)$, achieving an exponential speedup over the prior best results of $\exp(n)$ due to Wang, Guan, Liu, Zhang, and Ying (TIT 2024). Our improvement leverages efficiently computable uniform polynomial approximations of signed positive power functions within quantum singular value transformation, thereby eliminating the dependence on the rank of the quantum states. Our quantum algorithm reveals a dichotomy in the computational complexity of the Quantum State Distinguishability Problem with Schatten $\alpha$-norm (QSD$_{\alpha}$), which involves deciding whether ${\mathrm{T}_\alpha}(\rho_0,\rho_1)$ is at least $2/5$ or at most $1/5$. This dichotomy arises between the cases of constant $\alpha > 1$ and $\alpha=1$: - For any $1+\Omega(1) \leq \alpha \leq O(1)$, QSD$_{\alpha}$ is $\mathsf{BQP}$-complete. - For any $1 \leq \alpha \leq 1+\frac{1}{n}$, QSD$_{\alpha}$ is $\mathsf{QSZK}$-complete, implying that no efficient quantum estimator for $\mathrm{T}_\alpha(\rho_0,\rho_1)$ exists unless $\mathsf{BQP} = \mathsf{QSZK}$. The hardness results follow from reductions based on new rank-dependent inequalities for the quantum $\ell_{\alpha}$ distance with $1\leq \alpha \leq \infty$, which are of independent interest.</p>

            <h2>Quantum computational speedup and retrocausality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giuseppe Castagnoli</p>
            <p>Involving only the measurements of commuting observables - the problem-setting and the corresponding solution - quantum algorithms should be subject to classical logic. This would allow flanking their customary quantum description with a classical logic description, with surprising consequences. In the classical logic description of the quantum algorithm, very simply, it is as if the problem-solver knew in advance, before beginning her problem-solving action, one of the possible halves of the information that specifies the solution of the problem she will produce and measure in the future and could use this knowledge to produce the solution with fewer computation steps. This is a causal loop whose retrocausal character turns out to be implicit in the very notion of quantum state superposition, both an essential ingredient of the quantum computational speedup and one of the pillars of quantum mechanics. Indeed, the key point of the work is that the classical logic description of a quantum state superposition must resort to a logical form of retrocausality that in turn must be physically implicit in the superposition itself. The existence of retrocausality in ordinary quantum physics implies e different way of viewing physical reality. It explains in a unified way all quantum speedups and quantum nonlocality. It highlights the teleological character of quantum algorithms, that is, their being evolutions toward a goal (the solution of the problem) with an attractor in the solution they will produce in the future (the solution again). Under the quantum cosmological assumption, it provides a plausible physical basis to the teleological character of natural evolutions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yair Mulian</p>
            <p>The Magnus expansion offers a method to express a time-ordered exponential as an ordinary operatorial exponential. This representation has advantageous theoretical properties, while still solving the original differential equation. For any finite dimensional Hermitian Hamiltonians, the standard Magnus expansion guarantees a manifestly unitary representation. However, this property is no longer preserved if the Hamiltonian is infinite dimensional or non-Hermitian. In this work, we derive a generalized expansion that maintains the property of unitarity for all bounded finite dimensional Hamiltonians.</p>

            <h2>Role of scrambling and noise in temporal information processing with quantum systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weijie Xiong, Zoë Holmes, Armando Angrisani, Yudai Suzuki, Thiparat Chotibut, Supanut Thanasilp</p>
            <p>Scrambling quantum systems have attracted attention as effective substrates for temporal information processing. Here we consider a quantum reservoir processing framework that captures a broad range of physical computing models with quantum systems. We examine the scalability and memory retention of the model with scrambling reservoirs modelled by high-order unitary designs in both noiseless and noisy settings. In the former regime, we show that measurement readouts become exponentially concentrated with increasing reservoir size, yet strikingly do not worsen with the reservoir iterations. Thus, while repeatedly reusing a small scrambling reservoir with quantum data might be viable, scaling up the problem size deteriorates generalization unless one can afford an exponential shot overhead. In contrast, the memory of early inputs and initial states decays exponentially in both reservoir size and reservoir iterations. In the noisy regime, we also prove that memory decays exponentially in time for local noisy channels. These results required us to introduce new proof techniques for bounding concentration in temporal quantum models.</p>

            <h2>Physical Reduced Stochastic Equations for Continuously Monitored Non-Markovian Quantum Systems with a Markovian Embedding</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hendra I. Nurdin</p>
            <p>An effective approach to modeling non-Markovian quantum systems is to embed a principal (quantum) system of interest into a larger quantum system. A widely employed embedding is one that uses another quantum system, referred to as the auxiliary system, which is coupled to the principal system, and both the principal and auxiliary can be coupled to quantum white noise processes. The principal and auxiliary together form a quantum Markov system and the quantum white noises act as a bath (environment) for this system. Recently it was shown that the conditional evolution of the principal system in this embedding under continuous monitoring by a travelling quantum probe can be expressed as a system of coupled stochastic differential equations (SDEs) that involve only operators of the principal system. The reduced conditional state of the principal only (conditioned on the measurement outcomes) is determined by the ``diagonal" blocks of this coupled systems of SDEs. It is shown here that the ``off-diagonal" blocks can be exactly eliminated up to their initial conditions, leaving a reduced closed system of SDEs for the diagonal blocks only. Under additional conditions the off-diagonal initial conditions can be made to vanish. This new closed system of equations, which includes an integration term involving a two-time stochastic kernel, represents the non-Markovian stochastic dynamics of the principal system under continuous-measurement. The system of equations determine the reduced conditional state of the principal only and may be viewed as a stochastic Nakajima-Zwanzig type of equation for continuously monitored non-Markovian quantum systems.</p>

            <p>Quantum simulation offers a route to study open-system molecular dynamics in non-perturbative regimes by programming the interactions among electronic, vibrational, and environmental degrees of freedom on similar energy scales. Trapped-ion systems possess this capability, with their native spins, phonons, and tunable dissipation integrated within a single platform. Here, we demonstrate an open-system quantum simulation of charge and exciton transfer in a multi-mode linear vibronic coupling model. Employing tailored spin-phonon interactions alongside reservoir engineering techniques, we emulate a system with two dissipative vibrational modes coupled to donor and acceptor electronic sites and follow its non-equilibrium dynamics. We continuously tune the system from the charge transfer (CT) regime to the vibrationally assisted exciton transfer (VAET) regime by controlling the vibronic coupling strengths. We find that degenerate modes enhance CT and VAET rates at large energy gaps, while non-degenerate modes activate slow-mode pathways that reduce the energy-gap dependence, thus enlarging the window for efficient transfer. These results show that the presence of one additional vibration introduces interfering vibrationally assisted pathways and reshapes non-perturbative quantum excitation transfer. Our work establishes a scalable and hardware-efficient route to simulating chemically relevant, many-mode vibronic processes with engineered environments, guiding the design of next-generation organic photovoltaics and molecular electronics.</p>

            <p>By recursively nesting sums and products, probabilistic circuits have emerged in recent years as an attractive class of generative models as they enjoy, for instance, polytime marginalization of random variables. In this work we study these machine learning models using the framework of quantum information theory, leading to the introduction of positive unital circuits (PUnCs), which generalize circuit evaluations over positive real-valued probabilities to circuit evaluations over positive semi-definite matrices.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Carlo Marconi, Guillem Müller-Rigat, Jordi Romero-Pallejà, Jordi Tura, Anna Sanpera</p>
            <p>Symmetric quantum states are fascinating objects. They correspond to multipartite systems that remain invariant under particle permutations. This symmetry is reflected in their compact mathematical characterisation but also in their unique physical properties: they exhibit genuine multipartite entanglement and notable robustness against noise and perturbations. These features make such states particularly well-suited for a wide range of quantum information tasks. Here, we provide a pedagogic analysis of the mathematical structure and relevant physical properties of this class of states. Beyond the theoretical framework, robust tools for certifying and verifying the properties of symmetric states in experimental settings are essential. In this regard, we explore how standard techniques -- such as quantum state tomography, Bell tests, and entanglement witnesses -- can be specifically adapted for symmetric systems. Next, we provide an up-to-date overview of the most relevant applications in which these states outperform other classes of states in specific tasks. Specifically, we address their central role in quantum metrology, highlight their use in quantum error correction codes, and examine their contribution in computation and communication tasks. Finally, we present the current state-of-the-art in their experimental generation, ranging from systems of cold atoms to implementations via quantum algorithms. We also review the most significant results obtained in the different experimental realizations. Despite the notable progress made in recent years with regard to the characterisation and application of symmetric quantum states, several intriguing questions remain unsolved. We conclude this review by discussing some of these open problems and outlining promising directions for future research.</p>

Then, we examine the quantities obtained after the optimization is carried out over bipartite separable states instead. We prove that several of these quantities are equal to each other. Thus, we connect several approaches in the literature. We prove the triangle inequality for some of these quantities for the case of one of the three states being pure. As a byproduct, we show that the Uhlmann-Jozsa quantum fidelity can also be written as an optimization over separable states with given marginals. We use this to prove that some of these quantities equal the Uhlmann-Jozsa quantum fidelity for qubits.</p>

            <p>Bargmann invariants, also known as multivariate traces of quantum states $\operatorname{Tr}(\rho_1 \rho_2 \cdots \rho_n)$, are unitary invariant quantities used to characterize weak values, Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobabilities, out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs), and geometric phases. Here we give a complete characterization of the set $B_n$ of complex values that $n$-th order invariants can take, resolving some recently proposed conjectures. We show that $B_n$ is equal to the range of invariants arising from pure states described by Gram matrices of circulant form. We show that both ranges are equal to the $n$-th power of the complex unit $n$-gon, and are therefore convex, which provides a simple geometric intuition. Finally, we show that any Bargmann invariant of order $n$ is realizable using either qubit states, or circulant qutrit states.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xing Yao Mi, Yong-Chun Liu, Zhi Jiao Deng, Chun Wang Wu, Ping Xing Chen</p>
            <p>Fock-state lattice (FSL) offers a powerful quantum simulator for topological phenomena due to the unbounded scalability and ease of implementation. Nevertheless, the unique topological properties induced by its site-dependent coupling have remained elusive, mainly due to the challenge of handling an infinite state space without translational symmetry. Here, we rigorously analyze the topological features of a semi-infinite FSL-based Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, in both Hermitian and non-Hermitian realms, by mapping it to the solvable Jaynes-Cummings (JC) model via a unitary displacement transformation. We find a more stable topological zero mode than the conventional SSH model, originating from the bound state at the inherent domain wall under anisotropic conditions. With gain and loss introduced, we predict a non-Hermitian bound effect (NHBE), i. e., any state overlapping with the bound state will quickly stabilize to the domain wall, with the minimal stabilization time occurring in the vicinity of exceptional point (EP). The paritytime (PT ) phase transition can be observed by the oscillating-to-steady crossover of dynamics in the subspace orthogonal to the bound state. Our work takes the first step towards exploring unique topological properties in infinite anisotropic topological models based on the promising FSL simulator.</p>

            <h2>Collapses in quantum-classical probabilistically checkable proofs and the quantum polynomial hierarchy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kartik Anand, Kabgyun Jeong, Junseo Lee</p>
            <p>We investigate the structure of quantum proof systems by establishing collapse results that reveal simplifications in their complexity landscape. By extending classical theorems such as the Karp-Lipton theorem to quantum settings and analyzing uniqueness in quantum-classical PCPs, we clarify how various constraints influence computational power. Our main contributions are: (1) We show that restricting quantum-classical PCPs to unique proofs does not reduce their power: $\mathsf{UniqueQCPCP} = \mathsf{QCPCP}$ under $\mathsf{BQ}$-operator and randomized reductions. This parallels the known $\mathsf{UniqueQCMA} = \mathsf{QCMA}$ result, indicating robustness of uniqueness even in quantum PCP-type systems. (2) We prove a non-uniform quantum analogue of the Karp-Lipton theorem: if $\mathsf{QMA} \subseteq \mathsf{BQP}/\mathsf{qpoly}$, then $\mathsf{QPH} \subseteq \mathsf{Q\Sigma}_2/\mathsf{qpoly}$. This conditional collapse suggests limits on quantum advice for $\mathsf{QMA}$-complete problems. (3) We define a bounded-entanglement version of the quantum polynomial hierarchy, $\mathsf{BEQPH}$, and prove that it collapses above the fourth level. We also introduce the separable hierarchy $\mathsf{SepQPH}$ (zero entanglement), for which the same collapse result holds. These collapses stem not from entanglement, as in prior work, but from the convex structure of the protocols, which renders higher levels tractable. Collectively, these results offer new insights into the structure of quantum proof systems and the role of entanglement, uniqueness, and advice in defining their complexity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Runhong He, Qiaozhen Chai, Xin Hong, Ji Guan, Guolong Cui, Shengbin Wang, Shenggang Ying</p>
            <p>Molecular ground-state simulation is one of the most promising fields for demonstrating practical quantum advantage on near-term quantum computers. However, the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), a leading algorithm for this task, still faces significant challenges due to excessive circuit depth. This paper introduces a method to efficiently simplify the Unitary Coupled-Cluster with Single and Double Excitations (UCCSD) ansatz on classical computers. We propose to estimate the correlation energy contributions of excitations using their gradients at Hartree-Fock state, supported by a theoretical proof. For molecular systems with $K$ orbitals, these gradients can be obtained with complexity only $O(K^8)$, which can be efficiently implemented on classical computers, especially in parallel. By sorting and truncating the excitations based on these gradients, the simplified ansatz can be obtained immediately, avoiding the challenging task of optimizing ansatz structure on a quantum computer. Furthermore, we introduce a strategy to indirectly identify critical excitations through spin-adapted constraints, reducing gradient computations by $60\%$. Numerical experiments on prototype molecular systems (H${_4}$, HF, H${_2}$O, BeH${_2}$ and NH$_3$) demonstrate that our approach achieves up to $46\%$ parameter decrease, $60\%$ circuit depth reduction and $678\times$ runtime speedup compared to the state-of-the-art ADAPT-VQE algorithm, enabling significantly more compact quantum circuits with enhanced near-term feasibility.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Malik Magdon-Ismail, Khai Dong</p>
            <p>Period finding and phase estimation are fundamental in quantum computing. Prior work has established lower bounds on their success probabilities. Such quantum algorithms measure a state $|\hat\ell\rangle$ in an $n$-qubit computational basis, $\hat\ell \in [0, 2^n - 1]$, and then post-process this measurement to produce the final output, in the case of period finding, a divisor of the period $r$. We consider a general post-processing algorithm which succeeds whenever the measured $\hat\ell$ is within some tolerance $M$ of a positive integer multiple of $2^n / r$. We give new (tight) lower and upper bounds on the success probability that converge to 1. The parameter $n$ captures the complexity of the quantum circuit. The parameter $M$ can be tuned by varying the post-processing algorithm (e.g., additional brute-force search, lattice methods). Our tight analysis allows for the careful exploitation of the tradeoffs between the complexity of the quantum circuit and the effort spent in classical processing when optimizing the probability of success. We note that the most recent prior work in most recent work does not give tight bounds for general $M$.</p>

            <p>The incompatibility of quantum measurements, i.e. the fact that certain observable quantities cannot be measured jointly is widely regarded as a distinctive quantum feature with important implications for the foundations and the applications of quantum information theory. While the standard incompatibility of multiple measurements has been the focus of attention since the inception of quantum theory, its generalizations, such as measurement simulability, $n$-wise incompatibility, and mulit-copy incompatibility have only been proposed recently. Here, we point out that all these generalizations are differing notions of the question of how many measurements are genuinely contained in a measurement device. We then show, that all notions do differ not only in their operational meaning but also mathematically in the set of measurement assemblages they describe. We then fully resolve the relations between these different generalizations, by showing a strict hierarchy between these notions. Hence, we provide a general framework for generalized measurement incompatibility. Finally, we consider the implications our results have for recent works using these different notions.</p>

            <p>The recently introduced quantum gravity-induced entanglement of masses (QGEM) protocol aims to test the quantum nature of gravity by witnessing the entanglement produced by the virtual exchange of a graviton between two spatially superposed masses. Shortly after the original proposal, further improvements upon the experiment were suggested, including the addition of a third mass, showing that three-qubit setups can be more resilient to higher rates of decoherence caused by the interaction of the system with the environment. In this work, we investigate the type of tripartite entanglement generated in these three-qubit QGEM experiments when considering the effects of decoherence. We show that the gravitational interaction between the qubits is able to generate genuine tripartite entanglement between them, studying the corresponding parameter spaces and comparing the performance of the possible experimental configurations of the three qubits at allowing for the detection of genuine entanglement via an entanglement witness.</p>

            <p>The practical application of quantum technologies to chemical problems faces significant challenges, particularly in the treatment of realistic basis sets and the accurate inclusion of electron correlation effects. A direct approach to these problems is currently infeasible due to limitations in the number of logical qubits, their fidelity, and the shallow circuit depths supported by existing hardware; all of which hinder simulations at the required level of accuracy. A promising alternative is hybrid quantum-classical computing, where classical resources are used to construct effective Hamiltonians characterized by dimensions that conform to the constraints of current quantum devices. In this paper, we demonstrate the performance of a hybrid approach: coupled-cluster downfolded Hamiltonians are first evaluated in reduced-dimensionality active spaces, and the corresponding ground-state energies are subsequently computed using quantum algorithms. Our comprehensive analysis explores the achievable accuracy in recovering correlation energies when hundreds of orbitals are downfolded into a problem size tractable by today's quantum hardware. We argue that such flexible hybrid algorithms, where problem size can be tailored to available quantum resources, can serve as a bridge between noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices and future fault-tolerant quantum computers, marking a step toward the early realization of quantum advantage in chemistry.</p>

            <p>High-fidelity, high-rate quantum interconnect is a fundamental building block of scalable quantum technologies. The cavity-assisted photon scattering (CAPS) approach is an attractive alternative to commonly used active protocols based on photon emission and two-photon interference: it offers higher success probability and greater intrinsic robustness to imperfections, while remaining a passive operation that does not require complex atom excitation sequences or intermodule synchronization. Despite these advantages, CAPS has not been a primary choice for quantum interconnect protocols since the estimated fidelity and the rate of CAPS-based networking have been severely limited in existing protocols and analysis frameworks. In this work, we eliminate these limitations by protocol improvements aided by a thorough analysis of the atom-cavity dynamics, to demonstrate that existing or near-term optical cavity qualities are sufficient for achieving a fidelity of 0.999 with short optical pulses required for high-rate networking. We show that efficient time-multiplexed operation is possible with suppressed crosstalk, enabling high-rate entanglement generation. We also propose a hybrid network configuration leveraging both photon emission and CAPS gates, eliminating the need for external photon sources while maintaining performance and robustness. As a concrete example, with 200 ${}^{171}$Yb atoms coupled to a cavity with internal cooperativity 100, atom-atom entanglement generation rate of $4 \times 10^5~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ is estimated at a fidelity of 0.999, with further speedup beyond $10^6~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ anticipated by the use of multiple wavelength channels. Our results establish the CAPS-based network protocol as a leading candidate for scaling quantum information platforms.</p>

This scheme enables stable dissipative dynamics over timescales significantly longer than the oscillation period, leading to the emergence of discrete time-translation symmetry breaking in the phonon mode, i.e., a phonon time crystal, under specific conditions. We further analyze the experimental feasibility and numerically demonstrate this phonon time crystal using accessible experimental parameters. These results provide a practical scheme for observing a time crystal in a nonlinear phonon mode, which will advance research into time crystals.</p>

            <p>Consider a non-relativistic quantum particle with wave function inside a region $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^3$, and suppose that detectors are placed along the boundary $\partial \Omega$. The question how to compute the probability distribution of the time at which the detector surface registers the particle boils down to finding a reasonable mathematical definition of an ideal detecting surface; a particularly convincing definition, called the \emph{absorbing boundary rule}, involves a time evolution for the particle's wave function $\psi$ expressed by a Schrödinger equation in $\Omega$ together with an ``absorbing'' boundary condition on $\partial \Omega$ first considered by Werner in 1987, viz., $\partial \psi/\partial n=i\kappa\psi$ with $\kappa>0$ and $\partial/\partial n$ the normal derivative. We provide here a discussion of the rigorous mathematical foundation of this rule. First, for the viability of the rule it plays a crucial role that these two equations together uniquely define the time evolution of $\psi$; we point out here how, under some technical assumptions on the regularity (i.e., smoothness) of the detecting surface, the Lumer-Phillips theorem implies that the time evolution is well defined and given by a contraction semigroup. Second, we show that the collapse required for the $N$-particle version of the problem is well defined. We also prove that the joint distribution of the detection times and places, according to the absorbing boundary rule, is governed by a positive-operator-valued measure.</p>

Determining circuit complexity is believed to be a hard computational problem [1,2,3]. Recently, in the context of black holes, circuit complexity has been promoted to a physical property, wherein the growth of complexity is reflected in the time evolution of the Einstein-Rosen bridge (``wormhole'') connecting the two sides of an AdS ``eternal'' black hole [4]. Here we are motivated by an independent set of considerations and explore links between complexity and thermodynamics for functionally-equivalent circuits, making the physics-inspired approach relevant to real computational problems, for which functionality is the key element of interest. In particular, our thermodynamic framework provides a new perspective on the obfuscation of programs of arbitrary length -- an important problem in cryptography -- as thermalization through recursive mixing of neighboring sections of a circuit, which can be viewed as the mixing of two containers with ``gases of gates''. This recursive process equilibrates the average complexity and leads to the saturation of the circuit entropy, while preserving functionality of the overall circuit. The thermodynamic arguments hinge on ergodicity in the space of circuits which we conjecture is limited to disconnected ergodic sectors due to fragmentation. The notion of fragmentation has important implications for the problem of circuit obfuscation as it implies that there are circuits of same size and functionality that cannot be connected via a polynomial number of local moves. Furthermore, we argue that fragmentation is unavoidable unless the complexity classes NP and coNP coincide.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alejandro Mata Ali, Iñigo Perez Delgado, Marina Ristol Roura, Aitor Moreno Fdez. de Leceta</p>
            <p>We present two algorithms to initialize layers of tensorized neural networks and general tensor network algorithms using partial computations of their Frobenius norms and lineal entrywise norms, depending on the type of tensor network involved. The core of this method is the use of the norm of subnetworks of the tensor network in an iterative way, so that we normalize by the finite values of the norms that led to the divergence or zero norm. In addition, the method benefits from the reuse of intermediate calculations. We have also applied it to the Matrix Product State/Tensor Train (MPS/TT) and Matrix Product Operator/Tensor Train Matrix (MPO/TT-M) layers and have seen its scaling versus the number of nodes, bond dimension, and physical dimension.

            <h2>Randomized Gradient Descents on Riemannian Manifolds: Almost Sure Convergence to Global Minima in and beyond Quantum Optimization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emanuel Malvetti, Christian Arenz, Gunther Dirr, Thomas Schulte-Herbrüggen</p>
            <p>We analyze convergence of gradient-descent methods on Riemannian manifolds. In particular, we study randomization of Riemannian gradient algorithms for minimizing smooth cost functions (of Morse-Bott type). We prove that randomized gradient descent methods, where the Riemannian gradient is replaced by a random projection of it, converge to a single local optimum almost surely despite the existence of saddle points. We consider both uniformly distributed and discrete random projections. We also discuss the time required to pass a saddle point. As a major application, we consider ground-state preparation through quantum optimization over the unitary group. In mathematical terms our randomized algorithm applied to the trace function $U \to \operatorname{tr}(AU\rho U^*)$ almost surely converges to its global minimum. The minimum corresponds to the smallest eigenvalue (ground state) of the selfadjoint operator $A$ (Hamiltonian) if $\rho$ is a rank-one projector (pure state). In this setting, one can efficiently replace the uniform random projections by implementing so-called discrete unitary 2-designs.</p>

            <h2>Matrix Majorization in Large Samples with Varying Support Restrictions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Frits Verhagen, Marco Tomamichel, Erkka Haapasalo</p>
            <p>We say that a matrix $P$ with non-negative entries majorizes another such matrix $Q$ if there is a stochastic matrix $T$ such that $Q=TP$. We study matrix majorization in large samples and in the catalytic regime in the case where the columns of the matrices need not have equal support, as has been assumed in earlier works. We focus on two cases: either there are no support restrictions (except for requiring a non-empty intersection for the supports) or the final column dominates the others. Using real-algebraic methods, we identify sufficient and almost necessary conditions for majorization in large samples or when using catalytic states under these support conditions. These conditions are given in terms of multivariate divergences that generalize the Rényi divergences. We notice that varying support conditions dramatically affect the relevant set of divergences. Our results find an application in the theory of catalytic state transformation in quantum thermodynamics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hong Wu, Jun-Hong An</p>
            <p>It was recently found that, going beyond the tendfold Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes and violating the bulk-boundary correspondence of the usual topological phases, PT-invariant systems support a real Chern insulator with the so-called boundary criticality, which forbids the transition between different orders of topological phases accompanied by the closing and reopening of the bulk-band gap. Here, we fnd that the periodic driving can break the boundary criticality of a PT-invariant system. Setting free from the the boundary criticality, diverse first- and second-order topological phases absent in the static case are found in both the zero and Pi/T modes. The application of our result in the three-dimensional PT-invariant system permits us to discover exotic second-order Dirac and nodal-line semimetals with coexisting surface and hinge Fermi arcs. Enriching the family of the topological phases in PT-invariant systems, our result provides us a useful way to explore novel topological phases.</p>

            <p>Recent reports on the signatures of high-temperature superconductivity with a critical temperature Tc close to 80 K have triggered great research interest and extensive follow-up studies. Although the zero resistance has been successfully achieved under improved hydrostatic pressure conditions, the Meissner effect of $\mathrm{La_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7-\delta}}$ under high pressure remains controversial. Here, using shallow nitrogen-vacancy centers implanted on the culet of diamond anvils as in-situ quantum sensors, we observe compelling evidence for the Meissner effect in polycrystalline bilayer nickelate samples: the magnetic field expulsion during both field cooling and field warming processes. In particular, we explore the multiparameter measurement capacity of the diamond quantum sensors to extract the weak demagnetization signal of $\mathrm{La_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7-\delta}}$. The correlated measurements of Raman spectra and magnetic imaging indicate an incomplete structural transformation related to the displacement of oxygen ions emerging in the non-superconducting region. Our work clarifies the controversy about the Meissner effect of $\mathrm{La_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7-\delta}}$ and contributes to the development of quantum sensing of weak signals under high-pressure conditions.</p>

            <p>We introduce QICS (Quantum Information Conic Solver), an open-source primal-dual interior point solver fully implemented in Python, which is focused on solving optimization problems arising in quantum information theory. QICS has the ability to solve optimization problems involving the quantum relative entropy, noncommutative perspectives of operator convex functions, and related functions. It also includes an efficient semidefinite programming solver which exploits sparsity, as well as support for Hermitian matrices. QICS is also currently supported by the Python optimization modelling software PICOS. This paper aims to document the implementation details of the algorithm and cone oracles used in QICS, and serve as a reference guide for the software. Additionally, we showcase extensive numerical experiments which demonstrate that QICS outperforms state-of-the-art quantum relative entropy programming solvers, and has comparable performance to state-of-the-art semidefinite programming solvers.</p>

            <h2>Charge transport limited by nonlocal electron-phonon interaction. I. Hierarchical equations of motion approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Veljko Janković</p>
            <p>Studying charge transport in models with nonlocal carrier--phonon interaction is difficult because it requires finite-temperature real-time correlation functions of mixed carrier--phonon operators. Focusing on models with discrete undamped phonon modes, we show that such correlation functions can be retrieved from the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM), although phonons have been integrated out. Our procedure relies on the general explicit expression of HEOM auxiliaries in terms of phonon creation and annihilation operators. It reveals that the auxiliaries describe multiphonon-assisted carrier transitions induced by genuine many-phonon correlations, from which lower-order correlations are subtracted according to the finite-temperature Wick's theorem. Applying the procedure to our recently developed momentum-space HEOM method featuring appropriate hierarchy closing, we compute the numerically exact dynamical mobility of a carrier within the one-dimensional Peierls model. The carrier mobility at moderate temperatures decreases with increasing interaction, whereas high temperatures see the opposite trend, reflecting the prevalence of the phonon-assisted current over the purely electronic band current. The pronounced finite-size effects and HEOM instabilities delimit the range of applicability of our approach to moderate interactions, moderate to high temperatures, and not too fast phonons. Importantly, this range comprises the values relevant for charge transport in crystalline organic semiconductors, and we present and discuss the corresponding numerically exact results in a companion paper (arXiv:2501.05055).</p>

            <h2>Charge transport limited by nonlocal electron-phonon interaction. II. Numerically exact quantum dynamics in the slow-phonon regime</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Veljko Janković</p>
            <p>Transport of charge carriers in mechanically soft semiconductors is mainly limited by their interaction with slow intermolecular phonons. Carrier motion exhibits a crossover from superdiffusive to subdiffusive, producing a distinct low-frequency peak in the dynamical-mobility profile. These features can be understood within approaches relying on the timescale separation between carrier and phonon dynamics, such as the transient localization scenario (TLS). However, recovering them from fully quantum dynamics has proved elusive. Using the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM)-based approach exposed in a companion paper (arXiv:2501.05054), we study carrier transport in the one-dimensional Peierls model near the adiabatic limit. We find that the TLS approximates HEOM dynamics very well at higher temperatures and for stronger interactions. Then, the transport is predominantly phonon-assisted, and turns diffusive from the subdiffusive side well before one phonon period. In contrast, the band current dominates at moderate temperatures and interactions, relevant for transport in realistic materials. We then conclude that the super-to-subdiffusive crossover is transient, so that the diffusive motion sets in from the superdiffusive side on timescales comparable to the phonon period. The low-frequency dynamical mobility then additionally exhibits a dip at approximately one phonon frequency, and the zero-frequency peak. Our findings in this moderate regime show limitations of the TLS, and support the results of the most advanced quantum--classical simulations. We expect that the qualitative differences between HEOM and TLS dynamics would diminish for a more realistic phonon density of states.</p>

            <h2>Demonstrating Correlation Trends in the Electric Dipole Polarizabilities of Many Low-lying States in Cs I through First-principle Calculations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. Chakraborty, B. K. Sahoo</p>
            <p>Electron correlation and higher-order relativistic effects are probed in the evaluation of scalar and tensor static electric dipole (E1) polarizabilities ($\alpha_d$) of several even- and odd-parity states in cesium (Cs) using the Dirac-Hartree-Fock (DHF) method, second-order perturbation theory (MBPT(2)), third-order perturbation theory (MBPT(3)), random phase approximation (RPA), and singles and doubles approximated relativistic coupled-cluster (RCCSD) method. To account for perturbation due to odd-parity E1 operator on the atomic orbitals, calculations are carried out in the linear response approach. Our final $\alpha_d$ values, with the estimated uncertainties, show reasonably good agreement with the previous calculations and available experimental results. Differences among the DHF, MBPT(2), MBPT(3) and RPA results indicate pair-correlation (PC) effects play major roles than the core-polarization (CP) effects in the determination of $\alpha_d$ values in Cs. From the differences among the MBPT(3) and RCC results, we find correlations among the PC and CP effects and double CP effects together are also significant in these calculations. Contributions from the Breit interactions are found to be quite large in the high-lying states.</p>

            <p>We establish a quantum dynamics framework for curved submanifolds embedded in higher-dimensional spaces. Through rigorous dimensional reduction, we derive the first complete Schrödinger and Klein-Gordon equations incorporating non-perturbative geometric interactions-resolving ambiguities in constrained quantization. Crucially, extrinsic curvature of the ambient manifold governs emergent low-dimensional quantum phenomena. Remarkably, this mechanism generates scalar field masses matching Kaluza-Klein spectra while eliminating periodic compactification requirements. Geometric induction concurrently produces Higgs mechanism potentials. Particle masses emerge solely from submanifold embedding geometry, with matter-field couplings encoded in curvature invariants. This enables experimental access to higher-dimensional physics at all energy scales through geometric induction. We also discuss the Higgs vacuum near small-mass black holes.</p>

            <p>Can there be multiple bulk theories for the same boundary theory? We answer this affirmatively in the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) model using the tools of constrained systems. We find different symmetry sectors generated by specific constraints within the chord Hilbert space of the DSSYK with matter. Each sector corresponds to a different bulk description. These include chord parity symmetry, corresponding to End-Of-The-World (ETW) branes and Euclidean wormholes in sine dilaton gravity; and relative time-translations in a doubled DSSYK model (as a single DSSYK with an infinitely heavy chord) used in de Sitter holography. We derive the partition functions and thermal correlation functions in the ETW brane and Euclidean wormhole systems from the boundary theory. We deduce the holographic dictionary by matching geodesic lengths in the bulk with the spread complexity of the parity-gauged DSSYK. The Euclidean wormholes of fixed size are perturbatively stable, and their baby universe Hilbert space is non-trivial only when matter is added. We conclude studying the constraints in the path integral of the doubled DSSYK. We derive the gauge invariant operator algebra of one of the DSSYKs dressed to the other one and discuss its holographic interpretation.</p>

            <h2>Investigating the Fermi-Hubbard model by the Tensor-Backflow method</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiao Liang</p>
            <p>Recently, a variational wave-function based on the tensor representation of backflow corrections has achieved state-of-the-art energy precision in solving Fermi-Hubbard-type models. However, the Fermi-Hubbard model is very challenging to solve, and the validity of a method relies on investigating the ground state's physical property. For simplicity, we name the tensor representation of backflow corrections as the Tensor-Backflow in this work. We apply the Tensor-Backflow method to investigate the Fermi-Hubbard model on two-dimensional lattices as large as 256 sites, under various interaction strengths $U$, electron fillings $n$ and boundary conditions. Energy precision can be further improved by considering more backflow terms, such as considering backflow terms from next-nearest-neighbours or from all sites. Energy extrapolations on 64-site lattices give competitive results to the gradient optimized fPEPS with the bond dimension as large as $D$=20. For cases of $n$=0.875 and $U$=8 on the $16\times 16$ lattice under open boundary condition, by considering nearest-neighbour backflow terms, obtained energy is only $4.5\times 10^{-4}$ higher than the state-of-the-art method fPEPS with the bond dimension $D$=20. For periodic boundary condition, the variational wave-function is not enforced on any prior symmetry, meanwhile linear stripe order is successfully obtained. Under the same filling and $U$=10,12, energies obtained from initializations with the obtained wave-function for $U$=8 are lower than that from direct optimizations, meanwhile energies are competitive to or even better than state-of-the-art tensor network methods. For cases of $n$=0.8 and 0.9375, results consistent with the phase diagram from AFQMC are obtained by direct optimizations.</p>

            <p>Quantum battery (QB) is a conceptually new energy storage and conversion device, which consists usually of a quantum charger and an energy store (called usually as the QB for simplicity). The demonstrated advantage of QB, over its classical counterpart, is that its charging efficiency can be significantly enhanced by using quantum entanglement resources. In this letter, we investigate alternatively how to realize the switchable charging and the lossless power detection of the charged QB. With the proposed QB configuration we show that, by adjusting the eigenfrequency of the qubit-based charger, the cavity-based QB can be switched on between the charging and power-off states and its stored energy can be non-destructively monitored by probing the transmitted spectrum of the external electromagnetic waves scattered by the qubit-based charger. As the qubit-based charger has never been excited, the proposed cavity-based QB could directly store the coherent state energy (rather than the single-photon one) and thus possess significantly large ergotropy. The physical realization of the proposed switchable QB configuration is demonstrated specifically with the experimental circuit quantum electrodynamical devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benjamin Spreng, Jeremy N. Munday</p>
            <p>The Casimir effect, originating from quantum and thermal fluctuations, is well known for inducing forces between closely spaced surfaces. When these surfaces are optically anisotropic, these interactions can produce a Casimir torque that rotates the surfaces relative to each other. We investigate, for the first time, the influence of thermal fluctuations on the Casimir torque between birefringent plates. Our results reveal that thermal modes significantly diminish the torque, with reductions up to 2 orders of magnitude for highly birefringent materials. Temperature is also shown to alter the angular dependence of the torque, significantly deviating from the typical sinusoidal behavior, and becomes particularly important at large separations that exceed the thermal wavelength. Finally, we demonstrate that systems of dissimilar birefringent plates that exhibit a distance-dependent reversal in the torque's direction can enable precise control of the torque's magnitude and sign through temperature manipulation. These findings advance our understanding of quantum and thermal fluctuation interplay and provide a framework for designing innovative nanoscale sensors and devices leveraging Casimir torque phenomena.</p>

            <p>Presence of harmful noise is inevitable in entanglement-enhanced sensing systems, requiring careful allocation of resources to optimize sensing performance in practical scenarios. We advocate a simple but effective strategy to improve sensing performance in the presence of noise. Given a fixed number of quantum sensors, we partition the preparation of GHZ states by preparing smaller, independent sub-ensembles of GHZ states instead of a GHZ state across all sensors. We perform extensive analytical studies of the phase estimation performance when using partitioned GHZ states under realistic noise -- including state preparation error, particle loss during parameter encoding, and sensor dephasing during parameter encoding. We derive simple, closed-form expressions that quantify the optimal number of sub-ensembles for partitioned GHZ states. We also examine the explicit noisy quantum sensing dynamics under dephasing and loss, where we demonstrate the advantage from partitioning for maximal QFI, short-time QFI increase, and the sensing performance in the sequential scheme. The results offer quantitative insights into the sensing performance impact of different noise sources and reinforce the importance of resource allocation optimization in realistic quantum applications.</p>

            <p>Anomalous thermal relaxation is ubiquitous in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. An emblematic example of this is the Mpemba effect, where an initially ``hot'' system cools faster than an initially ``cooler'' one. This effect has recently been studied in a variety of different classical and quantum settings. In this Letter, we find a novel signature of the Mpemba effect in the context of quantum batteries. We identify situations where batteries in higher charge states can discharge faster than less charged states. Specifically, we consider a quantum battery encoded in a single bosonic mode that is charged using unitary Gaussian operations. We show that the ergotropy, used here as a dynamical indicator of the energy stored in the battery, can be recast as a phase space relative entropy between the system's state and the unitarily connected passive state, at each time. Our formalism allows us to compute the ergotropy analytically under dissipative dynamics and allows us to understand the conditions which give rise to a Mpemba effect. We also find situations where two batteries charged to the same value using different operations can discharge at different rates.</p>

            <p>Recent progress in quantum computing has enabled systems with tens of reliable logical qubits, built from thousands of noisy physical qubits. However, many impactful applications demand quantum computations with millions of logical qubits, necessitating highly scalable quantum error correction. In classical information theory, low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes can approach channel capacity efficiently. Yet, no quantum error-correcting codes with efficient decoding have been shown to approach the hashing bound - a fundamental limit on quantum capacity - despite decades of research. Here, we present quantum LDPC codes that not only approach the hashing bound but also allow decoding with computational cost linear in the number of physical qubits. This breakthrough paves the way for large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computation. Combined with emerging hardware that manages many qubits, our approach brings quantum solutions to important real-world problems significantly closer to reality.</p>

            <p>Within the framework of optical Dirac theory, we present a field-theoretical model of spin-orbit interaction and photonic spin/orbit Hall effects. Our approach reformulates light propagation along helical paths as solving the Maxwell equations in a ray-based curvilinear coordinate system. This system can alternatively be interpreted as a spin-degenerate medium with antisymmetric elements in the dielectric tensor, corresponding to the spin-1 excitation mode characterized by a rotational dipole vector. We show that, at leading order, the resulting effective Hamiltonian is equivalent to the Maxwell theory in a uniformly rotating frame, incorporating both spin-rotation and orbit-rotation coupling. This rotation arises from the torsion of helical paths, manifesting as extrinsic orbital angular momentum (EOAM) of photons. Notably, the spin angular momentum (SAM) of the photon and its intrinsic orbital angular momentum (IOAM) contribute jointly to the geometric phase. In the Heisenberg picture, the spin and orbital Hall effects naturally emerge from interaction terms in the ray equations. Furthermore, we find that the transverse spin of evanescent waves couples with EOAM, revealing that the geometric phase of elliptically polarized light differs from that of circularly polarized light. This distinction underscores the role of spin-orbit coupling in modifying phase accumulation.</p>

            <p>The interplay between coherence and system-environment interactions is at the basis of a wide range of phenomena, from quantum information processing to charge and energy transfer in molecular systems, biomolecules, and photochemical materials. In this work, we use a Frenkel exciton model with long-range interacting qubits coupled to a damped collective bosonic mode to investigate vibrationally assisted transfer processes in donor-acceptor systems featuring internal substructures analogous to light-harvesting complexes. We find that certain delocalized excitonic states maximize the transfer rate and that the entanglement is preserved during the dissipative transfer over a wide range of parameters. We investigate the reduction in transfer caused by static disorder, white noise, and finite temperature and study how transfer efficiency scales as a function of the number of dimerized monomers and the component number of each monomer, finding which excitonic states lead to optimal transfer. Finally, we provide a realistic experimental setting to realize this model in analog trapped-ion quantum simulators. Analog quantum simulation of systems comprising many and increasingly complex monomers could offer valuable insights into the design of light-harvesting materials, particularly in the non-perturbative intermediate parameter regime examined in this study, where classical simulation methods are resource-intensive.</p>

            <h2>Switchable coherent state stored quantum batteries with large ergotropies</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Y. F. Li, S. R. He, P. H. Ouyang, X. N. Feng, L. F. Wei</p>
            <p>Quantum battery (QB) is a conceptually new energy storage and conversion device, which consists usually of a quantum charger and an energy store (called usually as the QB for simplicity). The demonstrated advantage of QB, over its classical counterpart, is that its charging efficiency can be significantly enhanced by using quantum entanglement resources. In this letter, we investigate alternatively how to realize the switchable charging and the lossless power detection of the charged QB. With the proposed QB configuration we show that, by adjusting the eigenfrequency of the qubit-based charger, the cavity-based QB can be switched on between the charging and power-off states and its stored energy can be non-destructively monitored by probing the transmitted spectrum of the external electromagnetic waves scattered by the qubit-based charger. As the qubit-based charger has never been excited, the proposed cavity-based QB could directly store the coherent state energy (rather than the single-photon one) and thus possess significantly large ergotropy. The physical realization of the proposed switchable QB configuration is demonstrated specifically with the experimental circuit quantum electrodynamical devices.</p>

Several laser systems spanning 400-1100 nm are used to achieve high fidelity state preparation and readout. Photons are produced via the decay of an exited state, which is accessed using a custom 408 nm laser system that produces 150 ps optical pulses using non-linear photonics. We demonstrate single photon production through a Hanbury Brown-Twiss measurement for one to six ions.</p>

            <h2>Thermal Effects in the Casimir Torque between Birefringent Plates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benjamin Spreng, Jeremy N. Munday</p>
            <p>The Casimir effect, originating from quantum and thermal fluctuations, is well known for inducing forces between closely spaced surfaces. When these surfaces are optically anisotropic, these interactions can produce a Casimir torque that rotates the surfaces relative to each other. We investigate, for the first time, the influence of thermal fluctuations on the Casimir torque between birefringent plates. Our results reveal that thermal modes significantly diminish the torque, with reductions up to 2 orders of magnitude for highly birefringent materials. Temperature is also shown to alter the angular dependence of the torque, significantly deviating from the typical sinusoidal behavior, and becomes particularly important at large separations that exceed the thermal wavelength. Finally, we demonstrate that systems of dissimilar birefringent plates that exhibit a distance-dependent reversal in the torque's direction can enable precise control of the torque's magnitude and sign through temperature manipulation. These findings advance our understanding of quantum and thermal fluctuation interplay and provide a framework for designing innovative nanoscale sensors and devices leveraging Casimir torque phenomena.</p>

            <h2>Enhancing Photon Indistinguishability of Spectrally Mismatched Single Photons by Cavity Floquet Engineering</h2>

By periodically modulating two distinct single-photon states under a modulation frequency which is exactly equal to the spectral mismatch of two cavity modes, a pair of single-photon frequency-comb (SPFC) states is prepared energy-conservatively based on full unitary operations. The two states show high indistinguishability with an ideal $g^{(2)}_\mathrm{HOM}(0)$ down to zero due to the superposition of intensity-matched single-photon states coherently distributed across the teeth of the combs.</p>

            <p>The realization of a global quantum network holds the potential to enable groundbreaking applications such as secure quantum communication and blind quantum computing. However, building such a network remains a formidable challenge, primarily due to photon loss in optical fibers. In this work, we propose a quantum repeater architecture for distributing entanglement over intercontinental distances by leveraging low-Earth-orbit satellites equipped with spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) photon-pair sources and ground stations utilizing single-atom memories in optical cavities and single-photon detectors to implement the cavity-assisted photon scattering (CAPS) gates for high-fidelity entanglement mapping. The efficient entanglement swapping is achieved by performing high-fidelity Rydberg gates and readouts. We evaluate the entanglement distribution rates and fidelities by analyzing several key imperfections, including time-dependent two-photon transmission and time-dependent pair fidelity, for various satellite heights and ground station distances. We also investigate the impact of pair source fidelity and spin decoherence rate on the repeater performance. Furthermore, we introduce a spatial-frequency multiplexing strategy within this architecture to enhance the design's performance. Finally, we discuss in detail the practical implementation of this architecture. Our results show that this architecture enables entanglement distribution over intercontinental distances. For example, it can distribute over 10000 pairs per flyby over 10000 km with a fidelity above 90%, surpassing the capabilities of terrestrial quantum repeaters</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ivan Medina, Oisín Culhane, Felix C. Binder, Gabriel T. Landi, John Goold</p>
            <p>Anomalous thermal relaxation is ubiquitous in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. An emblematic example of this is the Mpemba effect, where an initially ``hot'' system cools faster than an initially ``cooler'' one. This effect has recently been studied in a variety of different classical and quantum settings. In this Letter, we find a novel signature of the Mpemba effect in the context of quantum batteries. We identify situations where batteries in higher charge states can discharge faster than less charged states. Specifically, we consider a quantum battery encoded in a single bosonic mode that is charged using unitary Gaussian operations. We show that the ergotropy, used here as a dynamical indicator of the energy stored in the battery, can be recast as a phase space relative entropy between the system's state and the unitarily connected passive state, at each time. Our formalism allows us to compute the ergotropy analytically under dissipative dynamics and allows us to understand the conditions which give rise to a Mpemba effect. We also find situations where two batteries charged to the same value using different operations can discharge at different rates.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Error Correction near the Coding Theoretical Bound</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daiki Komoto, Kenta Kasai</p>
            <p>Recent progress in quantum computing has enabled systems with tens of reliable logical qubits, built from thousands of noisy physical qubits. However, many impactful applications demand quantum computations with millions of logical qubits, necessitating highly scalable quantum error correction. In classical information theory, low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes can approach channel capacity efficiently. Yet, no quantum error-correcting codes with efficient decoding have been shown to approach the hashing bound - a fundamental limit on quantum capacity - despite decades of research. Here, we present quantum LDPC codes that not only approach the hashing bound but also allow decoding with computational cost linear in the number of physical qubits. This breakthrough paves the way for large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computation. Combined with emerging hardware that manages many qubits, our approach brings quantum solutions to important real-world problems significantly closer to reality.</p>

            <p>The practical application of quantum technologies to chemical problems faces significant challenges, particularly in the treatment of realistic basis sets and the accurate inclusion of electron correlation effects. A direct approach to these problems is currently infeasible due to limitations in the number of logical qubits, their fidelity, and the shallow circuit depths supported by existing hardware; all of which hinder simulations at the required level of accuracy. A promising alternative is hybrid quantum-classical computing, where classical resources are used to construct effective Hamiltonians characterized by dimensions that conform to the constraints of current quantum devices. In this paper, we demonstrate the performance of a hybrid approach: coupled-cluster downfolded Hamiltonians are first evaluated in reduced-dimensionality active spaces, and the corresponding ground-state energies are subsequently computed using quantum algorithms. Our comprehensive analysis explores the achievable accuracy in recovering correlation energies when hundreds of orbitals are downfolded into a problem size tractable by today's quantum hardware. We argue that such flexible hybrid algorithms, where problem size can be tailored to available quantum resources, can serve as a bridge between noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices and future fault-tolerant quantum computers, marking a step toward the early realization of quantum advantage in chemistry.</p>

            <h2>Induced Berry Connection and Photonic Spin Hall Effect in Optical Dirac Theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lili Yang, Longlong Feng</p>
            <p>Within the framework of optical Dirac theory, we present a field-theoretical model of spin-orbit interaction and photonic spin/orbit Hall effects. Our approach reformulates light propagation along helical paths as solving the Maxwell equations in a ray-based curvilinear coordinate system. This system can alternatively be interpreted as a spin-degenerate medium with antisymmetric elements in the dielectric tensor, corresponding to the spin-1 excitation mode characterized by a rotational dipole vector. We show that, at leading order, the resulting effective Hamiltonian is equivalent to the Maxwell theory in a uniformly rotating frame, incorporating both spin-rotation and orbit-rotation coupling. This rotation arises from the torsion of helical paths, manifesting as extrinsic orbital angular momentum (EOAM) of photons. Notably, the spin angular momentum (SAM) of the photon and its intrinsic orbital angular momentum (IOAM) contribute jointly to the geometric phase. In the Heisenberg picture, the spin and orbital Hall effects naturally emerge from interaction terms in the ray equations. Furthermore, we find that the transverse spin of evanescent waves couples with EOAM, revealing that the geometric phase of elliptically polarized light differs from that of circularly polarized light. This distinction underscores the role of spin-orbit coupling in modifying phase accumulation.</p>

            <h2>On Quantum Simulation of QED in Coulomb Gauge</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaojun Yao</p>
            <p>A recent work (Li, 2406.01204) considered quantum simulation of Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) on a lattice in the Coulomb gauge with gauge degrees of freedom represented in the occupation basis in momentum space. Here we consider representing the gauge degrees of freedom in field basis in position space and develop a quantum algorithm for real-time simulation. We show that the Coulomb gauge Hamiltonian is equivalent to the temporal gauge Hamiltonian when acting on physical states consisting of fermion and transverse gauge fields. The Coulomb gauge Hamiltonian guarantees that the unphysical longitudinal gauge fields do not propagate and thus there is no need to impose any constraint. The local gauge field basis and the canonically conjugate variable basis are swapped efficiently using the quantum Fourier transform. We prove that the qubit cost to represent physical states and the gate depth for real-time simulation scale polynomially with the lattice size, energy, time, accuracy and Hamiltonian parameters. We focus on the lattice theory without discussing the continuum limit or the UV completion of QED.</p>

            <h2>Passive Quantum Interconnects: High-Fidelity Quantum Networking at Higher Rates and Less Overhead</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seigo Kikura, Kazufumi Tanji, Akihisa Goban, Shinichi Sunami</p>
            <p>High-fidelity, high-rate quantum interconnect is a fundamental building block of scalable quantum technologies. The cavity-assisted photon scattering (CAPS) approach is an attractive alternative to commonly used active protocols based on photon emission and two-photon interference: it offers higher success probability and greater intrinsic robustness to imperfections, while remaining a passive operation that does not require complex atom excitation sequences or intermodule synchronization. Despite these advantages, CAPS has not been a primary choice for quantum interconnect protocols since the estimated fidelity and the rate of CAPS-based networking have been severely limited in existing protocols and analysis frameworks. In this work, we eliminate these limitations by protocol improvements aided by a thorough analysis of the atom-cavity dynamics, to demonstrate that existing or near-term optical cavity qualities are sufficient for achieving a fidelity of 0.999 with short optical pulses required for high-rate networking. We show that efficient time-multiplexed operation is possible with suppressed crosstalk, enabling high-rate entanglement generation. We also propose a hybrid network configuration leveraging both photon emission and CAPS gates, eliminating the need for external photon sources while maintaining performance and robustness. As a concrete example, with 200 ${}^{171}$Yb atoms coupled to a cavity with internal cooperativity 100, atom-atom entanglement generation rate of $4 \times 10^5~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ is estimated at a fidelity of 0.999, with further speedup beyond $10^6~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ anticipated by the use of multiple wavelength channels. Our results establish the CAPS-based network protocol as a leading candidate for scaling quantum information platforms.</p>

            <p>In this Letter, we propose that superradiant echoes can be achieved at room temperature by applying a laser illumination and a microwave Hahn echo sequence to a diamond with a high concentration of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers placed in a dielectric microwave cavity. We identify that the combined action of two microwave driving pulses and a free evolution imprints a phase grating among NV spin sub-ensembles in frequency space, and multiple re-phasing of the grated spin sub-ensembles leads to multiple superradiant echoes through a collective coupling with the cavity. Furthermore, we show that the superradiant echoes can be actively tailored with the microwave pulses and the laser illumination by modifying the grating parameters, and the multiple re-phasing dynamics is analogous to the one leading to superradiant beats in optical clock system. In the future, the spin sub-ensembles grating and the resulting echoes can be further optimized with dynamical decoupling, which might pave the way for applications in quantum sensing.</p>

            <p>The next generation of telecommunication networks will rely on the transmission of complex quantum states to enable secure and transformative information processing, utilizing entanglement and superposition. Cluster states - multipartite entangled states that retain entanglement under local measurements - are a vital resource for quantum networking applications such as blind photonic quantum computing, quantum state teleportation and all-photonic quantum repeaters. However, the transmission of cluster states over optical fiber has remained elusive with previous approaches. Here, we demonstrate the first transmission of a four-qubit cluster state over 25 km of single-mode fiber by using a two-photon multi-level time-bin encoding. We directly generate the state by exploiting coherent control of a parametric generation process, rendering a resource-intensive controlled-phase gate obsolete. To enable efficient and reconfigurable projective measurements on the multi-level time-bin encoded state, we introduce chirped-pulse modulation and implement the first time-bin beam splitter, allowing us to certify genuine multipartite entanglement and to demonstrate one-way computing operations. Our approach enables the transmission of complex quantum states over long-distance fibers, permitting the implementation of multipartite protocols and laying the foundation for large-scale quantum resource networks.</p>

By extending to quasiprobability, we derive quantum fluctuation theorems for many-body coherence and quantum correlations, presenting them in both integral and detailed forms. Our theoretical results are illustrated and verified using three-qubit examples, and feasible experimental verification protocols are proposed.

We revisit photon-graviton conversion in a quantum field theoretic framework, allowing us to track the evolution of arbitrary quantum states. Treating the photons as squeezed coherent states and the gravitons as the squeezed vacuum expected for primordial gravitational waves, we derive analytic expressions for the conversion probability and show that it can be significantly enhanced compared to the conventional estimate. We further demonstrate that the conversion both swaps preexisting entanglement and generates genuinely new entanglement between the electromagnetic and gravitational sectors, which is impossible in any classical description. Detecting such nonclassical correlations would constitute compelling evidence for the quantization of gravity and offers a novel pathway toward graviton detection.</p>

Scalable protocols for generating such states using solid-state spin-photon interfaces have recently emerged, but practical implementations have so far relied on emitters operating at short wavelengths, incompatible with low-loss fibre transmission. Here, we take a key step towards the generation of telecom wavelength multi-qubit entangled states using an InAs/InP quantum dot. After establishing that all essential criteria for generating cluster states using a ground state spin as the entangler are satisfied, we implement a scalable protocol to entangle the resident spin with sequentially emitted photons directly in the telecom C-band. We demonstrate a two-qubit (spin-photon) entanglement fidelity of $59.5\pm 8.7\%$ and a lower bound of three-qubit (spin-photon-photon) entanglement fidelity of $52.7\pm 11.4\%$.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marvin Bechtold, Johanna Barzen, Frank Leymann, Alexander Mandl</p>
            <p>Scaling beyond individual quantum devices via distributed quantum computing relies critically on high-fidelity quantum state transfers between devices, yet the quantum interconnects needed for this are currently unavailable or expected to be significantly noisy. These limitations can be bypassed by simulating ideal state transfer using quasiprobability decompositions (QPDs). Wire cutting, for instance, allows this even without quantum interconnects. Nevertheless, QPD methods face drawbacks, requiring sampling from multiple circuit variants and incurring substantial sampling overhead. While prior theoretical work showed that incorporating noisy interconnects within QPD protocols could reduce sampling overhead relative to interconnect quality, a practical implementation for realistic conditions was lacking. Addressing this gap, this work presents a generalized and practical QPD for state transfer simulation using noisy interconnects to reduce sampling overhead. The QPD incorporates a single tunable parameter for straightforward calibration to any utilized interconnect. To lower practical costs, the work also explores reducing the number of distinct circuit variants required by the QPD. Experimental validation on contemporary quantum devices confirms the proposed QPD's practical feasibility and expected sampling overhead reduction under realistic noise. Notably, the results show higher effective state transfer fidelity than direct transfer over the underlying noisy interconnect.</p>

Herein, we provide insights into cutting these algorithms using local operations (LO) to determine their aptitude for distribution. The key findings of our work are that many of these algorithms cannot be efficiently parallelized using LO, and new methods must be developed to apply electronic structure theory within a DQC framework.</p>

            <p>Feedback control in open quantum dynamics is crucial for the advancement of various coherent platforms. For a proper theoretical description, however, most feedback schemes rely on stochastic trajectories, which require significant statistical sampling and lack analytical insight. Currently, only a handful of deterministic feedback master equations exist in the literature. In this letter we derive a set of deterministic equations for describing feedback schemes based on generic causal signals. Our formulation is phrased in terms of sequentially applied quantum instruments, and is therefore extremely general, recovering various known results in the literature as particular cases. We then specialize this result to the case of quantum jumps and derive a new deterministic equation that allows for feedback based on the channel of the last jump, as well as the time since the last jump occurred. The strength of this formalism is illustrated with a detailed study of population inversion of a qubit using coherent drive and feedback, where our formalism allows all calculations to be performed analytically.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pablo Sala, Ruben Verresen</p>
            <p>Decohering topological order (TO) is central to the many-body physics of open quantum matter and decoding transitions. We identify relevant statistical mechanical models for decohering non-Abelian TO, which have been crucial for understanding the error threshold of Abelian stabilizer codes. The decohered density matrix can be described by loop models, whose topological loop weight $N$ is given by the quantum dimension of the decohering anyon -- reducing to the Ising model if $N=1$. In particular, the Rényi-$n$ moments of the decohered state correspond to $n$ coupled O$(N)$ loop models, and we exactly diagonalize the density matrix at maximal error rate. This allows us to relate the fidelity between two logically distinct ground states to properties of random O$(N)$ loop and spin models. Utilizing the literature on loop models, we find a remarkable stability to quantum channels which proliferate non-Abelian anyons with large quantum dimension, with the possibility of critical phases for smaller dimensions. We confirm our framework with exact results for Kitaev quantum double models, and with numerical simulations for the non-Abelian phase of the Kitaev honeycomb model. The latter is an example of a non-fixed-point wavefunction with non-bosonic and non-integral anyon dimensions. Our work opens up the possibility of non-Abelian TO being robust against maximally proliferating certain anyons, which can inform error-correction studies of these topological memories.</p>

            <p>We theoretically propose a tunable implementation of symmetry-protected topological phases in a synthetic superlattice, taking advantage of the long coherence time and exquisite spectral resolutions offered by gravity-tilted optical lattice clocks. We describe a protocol similar to Rabi spectroscopy that can be used to probe the distinct topological properties of our system. We then demonstrate how the sensitivity of clocks and interferometers can be improved by the protection to unwanted experimental imperfections offered by the underlying topological robustness. The proposed implementation opens a path to exploit the unique opportunities offered by symmetry-protected topological phases in state-of-the-art quantum sensors.</p>

            <h2>Optimized Spectral Purity of Heralded Single Photons at the Telecom O-Band</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wu-Hao Cai, Soyoung Baek, Rui-Bo Jin, Fumihiro Kaneda</p>
            <p>We report on optimizing the spectral purity of heralded single photons in the telecom O-band, where single photons can be propagated with low loss and low dispersion in a standard telecom optical fiber. We numerically searched for various group-velocity-matching conditions and corresponding optimal poling structures of a potassium titanyl phosphate crystal for spontaneous parametric downconversion. Our poling optimization results using phase-matching coherence-length and sub-coherence-length modulation schemes show > 99.4% spectral purity with pump wavelengths ranging from 603.8 nm to 887.3 nm. Some optimized configurations are feasible with off-the-shelf lasers and single-photon detectors. Moreover, by investigating noise photon spectra for different poling optimization methods, we show that, in practice, appropriate, gentle spectral filtering helps achieve high purity. This study will pave the way for developing practical quantum sources for quantum information applications at the telecom O-band.</p>

            <h2>Explicit Pfaffian Formula for Amplitudes of Fermionic Gaussian Pure States in Arbitrary Pauli Bases</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. A. Rajabpour, M. A. Seifi Mirjafarlou, Reyhaneh Khasseh</p>
            <p>The explicit computation of amplitudes for fermionic Gaussian pure states in arbitrary Pauli bases is a long-standing challenge in quantum many-body physics, with significant implications for quantum tomography, experimental studies, and quantum dynamics. These calculations are essential for analyzing complex properties beyond traditional measures, such as formation probabilities, global entanglement, and entropy in non-standard bases, where exact and computationally efficient methods remain underdeveloped. In addition to these physical applications, having explicit formulas is crucial for optimizing negative log-likelihood functions in quantum tomography, a key task in the NISQ era. In this work, we present an explicit Pfaffian formula (Theorem 1) for determining these amplitudes in arbitrary Pauli bases, utilizing a matrix whose structure reflects the qubit parity. Additionally, we introduce a recursive relation (Theorem 2) that connects amplitudes for systems with varying qubit numbers, enabling scalable computations for large systems. Together, these results provide a versatile framework for studying global entanglement, Shannon-Rényi entropies, formation probabilities, and performing efficient quantum tomography, thereby significantly expanding the computational toolkit for analyzing complex quantum systems. Finally, we utilize our formalism to determine the post-measurement entanglement entropy, reflecting how local measurements alter entanglement, and compare the outcomes with conformal field theory predictions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gonzalo Martín-Vázquez, Taneli Tolppanen, Matti Silveri</p>
            <p>Leakage out from the qubit subspace compromises standard quantum error correction protocols and is a challenge for practical quantum computing. We propose a passive leakage removal unit based on an array of coupled disordered transmons and last-site reset by feedback-measurement or dissipation. The transmons have parametric disorder both in frequency and anharmonicity such that the qubit subspace is protected by localization through energy level mismatch while the energy levels for leakage excitations are in resonance for maximized leakage mobility. Leakage excitations propagate through the idle transmons until reaching the last site with feedback-measurement or dissipation removing them. For removing leakage excitations, we find two optimal measurement rates, which are comprehensively understood through two distinct timescales between the propagation and disintegration of leakage excitations. Based only on an array of standard transmon devices, our approach is readily compatible with existing superconducting quantum processor designs under realistic conditions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matheus Eiji Ohno Bezerra, Francesco Albarelli, Rafal Demkowicz-Dobrzanski</p>
            <p>Quantum multiparameter metrology is hindered by incompatibility issues, such as finding a single probe state (probe incompatibility) and a single measurement (measurement incompatibility) optimal for all parameters. The simultaneous estimation of phase shift and loss in a single optical mode is a paradigmatic multiparameter metrological problem in which such tradeoffs are present. We consider two settings: single-mode or two-mode probes (with a reference lossless mode), and for each setting we consider either Gaussian states or arbitrary quantum states of light restricted only by a maximal number of photons allowed. We find numerically that, as the number of photons increases, there are quantum states of light for which probe incompatibility disappears both in the single- and two-mode scenarios. On the other hand, for Gaussian states, probe incompatibility is present in the single-mode case and may be removed only in the two-mode setting thanks to the entanglement with the reference mode. Finally, we provide strong arguments that the fundamental incompatibility aspect of the model is measurement incompatibility, which persists for all the scenarios considered, and unlike probe-incompatibility cannot be overcome even in the large photon number limit.</p>

            <h2>Query Complexity of Classical and Quantum Channel Discrimination</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Theshani Nuradha, Mark M. Wilde</p>
            <p>Quantum channel discrimination has been studied from an information-theoretic perspective, wherein one is interested in the optimal decay rate of error probabilities as a function of the number of unknown channel accesses. In this paper, we study the query complexity of quantum channel discrimination, wherein the goal is to determine the minimum number of channel uses needed to reach a desired error probability. To this end, we show that the query complexity of binary channel discrimination depends logarithmically on the inverse error probability and inversely on the negative logarithm of the (geometric and Holevo) channel fidelity. As a special case of these findings, we precisely characterize the query complexity of discriminating two classical channels and two classical-quantum channels. Furthermore, by obtaining a tighter characterization of the sample complexity of quantum hypothesis testing, including prior probabilities, we provide a more precise characterization of query complexity when the error probability does not exceed a fixed threshold. We also provide lower and upper bounds on the query complexity of binary asymmetric channel discrimination and multiple quantum channel discrimination. For the former, the query complexity depends on the geometric Rényi and Petz Rényi channel divergences, while for the latter, it depends on the negative logarithm of the (geometric and Uhlmann) channel fidelity. For multiple channel discrimination, the upper bound scales as the logarithm of the number of channels.</p>

            <h2>Verifiable End-to-End Delegated Variational Quantum Algorithms</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matteo Inajetovic, Petros Wallden, Anna Pappa</p>
            <p>Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have emerged as promising candidates for solving complex optimization and machine learning tasks on near-term quantum hardware. However, executing quantum operations remains challenging for small-scale users because of several hardware constraints, making it desirable to delegate parts of the computation to more powerful quantum devices. In this work, we introduce a framework for delegated variational quantum algorithms (DVQAs), where a client with limited quantum capabilities delegates the execution of a VQA to a more powerful quantum server. In particular, we introduce a protocol that enables a client to delegate a variational quantum algorithm to a server while ensuring that the input, the output and also the computation itself remain secret. Additionally, if the protocol does not abort, the client can be certain that the computation outcome is indeed correct. This work builds on the general verification protocol introduced by Fitzimons and Kashefi (2017), tailoring it to VQAs. Our approach first proposes a verifiable Protocol for delegating the quantum computation required at each optimization step of a VQA, and then combines the iterative steps into an error-resilient optimization process that offers end-to-end verifiable algorithm execution. We also simulate the performance of our protocol tackling the Transverse Field Ising Model. Our results demonstrate that secure delegation of variational quantum algorithms is a realistic solution for near-term quantum networks, paving the way for practical quantum cloud computing applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Leon Wichette, Hans Hohenfeld, Elie Mounzer, Linnea Grans-Samuelsson</p>
            <p>Based on the mapping between stabilizer quantum error correcting codes and disordered statistical mechanics models, we define a ratio of partition functions that measures the success probability for maximum partition function decoding, which at the Nishimori temperature corresponds to maximum likelihood (ML) decoding. We show that this ratio differs from the similarly defined order probability and describe the decoding strategy whose success rate is described by the order probability. We refer to the latter as a probabilistic partition function decoding and show that it is the strategy that at zero temperature corresponds to maximum probability (MP) decoding. Based on the difference between the two decoders, we discuss the possibility of a maximum partition function decodability boundary outside the order-disorder phase boundary. At zero temperature, the difference between the two ratios measures to what degree MP decoding can be improved by accounting for degeneracy among maximum probability errors, through methods such as ensembling. We consider in detail the example of the toric code under bitflip noise, which maps to the Random Bond Ising Model. We demonstrate that estimation of logical performance through decoding probability and order probability is more sample efficient than estimation by counting failures of the corresponding decoders. We consider both uniform noise and noise where qubits are given individual error rates. The latter noise model lifts the degeneracy among maximum probability errors, but we show that ensembling remains useful as long as it also samples less probable errors.</p>

            <h2>Learning to Maximize Quantum Neural Network Expressivity via Effective Rank</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Juan Yao</p>
            <p>Quantum neural networks (QNNs) are widely employed as ansätze for solving variational problems, where their expressivity directly impacts performance. Yet, accurately characterizing QNN expressivity remains an open challenge, impeding the optimal design of quantum circuits. In this work, we introduce the effective rank, denoted as $\kappa$, as a novel quantitative measure of expressivity. Specifically, $\kappa$ captures the number of effectively independent parameters among all the variational parameters in a parameterized quantum circuit, thus reflecting the true degrees of freedom contributing to expressivity. Through a systematic analysis considering circuit architecture, input data distributions, and measurement protocols, we demonstrate that $\kappa$ can saturate its theoretical upper bound, $d_n=4^n-1$, for an $n$-qubit system when each of the three factors is optimally expressive. This result provides a rigorous framework for assessing QNN expressivity and quantifying their functional capacity. Building on these theoretical insights, and motivated by the vast and highly structured nature of the circuit design space, we employ $\kappa$ as a guiding metric for the automated design of highly expressive quantum circuit configurations. To this end, we develop a reinforcement learning framework featuring a self-attention transformer agent that autonomously explores and optimizes circuit architectures. By integrating theoretical characterization with practical optimization, our work establishes $\kappa$ as a robust tool for quantifying QNN expressivity and demonstrates the effectiveness of reinforcement learning in designing high-performance quantum circuits. This study paves the way for building more expressive QNN architectures, ultimately enhancing the capabilities of quantum machine learning.</p>

            <p>Photon triplet sources exhibit non-Gaussian features, a key property for applications in quantum computing and quantum information. However, spectral correlations can limit the performance and detection efficiency of these systems. Motivated by this, we present a theoretical analysis of the spectral correlations of photon triplets generated through spontaneous third-order parametric down-conversion in photonic devices, and discuss strategies to quantify and minimize them. We propose two strategies to minimize spectral correlations: dispersion engineering in waveguides and pump engineering in resonators. We apply these strategies in two realistic source designs, namely a high-index-contrast optical fiber taper and a silicon nitride microring resonator. Finally, we discuss detection strategies for probing non-Gaussian features of the triplet state. We find that it is feasible to achieve few-mode generation of photon triplets using state-of-the-art experimental systems, a crucial step toward practical applications of photon triplet sources in quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>Fock-state lattice (FSL) offers a powerful quantum simulator for topological phenomena due to the unbounded scalability and ease of implementation. Nevertheless, the unique topological properties induced by its site-dependent coupling have remained elusive, mainly due to the challenge of handling an infinite state space without translational symmetry. Here, we rigorously analyze the topological features of a semi-infinite FSL-based Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, in both Hermitian and non-Hermitian realms, by mapping it to the solvable Jaynes-Cummings (JC) model via a unitary displacement transformation. We find a more stable topological zero mode than the conventional SSH model, originating from the bound state at the inherent domain wall under anisotropic conditions. With gain and loss introduced, we predict a non-Hermitian bound effect (NHBE), i. e., any state overlapping with the bound state will quickly stabilize to the domain wall, with the minimal stabilization time occurring in the vicinity of exceptional point (EP). The paritytime (PT ) phase transition can be observed by the oscillating-to-steady crossover of dynamics in the subspace orthogonal to the bound state. Our work takes the first step towards exploring unique topological properties in infinite anisotropic topological models based on the promising FSL simulator.</p>

            <h2>Certification of high stellar ranks of quantum states of light with a pair of click detectors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jaromír Fiurášek</p>
            <p>Stellar rank of quantum states of light quantifies the amount of non-Gaussian resources required for their generation. One popular and practical approach to certification of stellar rank is based on measurement of click statistics with an array of binary detectors that can only distinguish the presence and absence of photons. Specifically, it was shown that measurements with an array of m+1 detectors allows one to certify stellar rank of approximate Fock state |m>, even when the state is subjected to losses or certain noise. Here we address the question how many click detectors are in principle required to certify high stellar ranks. We show that two click detectors arranged in a Hanbury Brown-Twiss setup suffice. Interestingly, detection of higher stellar rank is greatly facilitated by making the total detection efficiency of the detectors sufficiently low but well calibrated. Losses affect the response of the detection scheme in a way that can be exploited to certify stellar rank of high Fock states. We explicitly construct the corresponding stellar rank witnesses and discuss dependence of the stellar rank thresholds on parameters of the considered setup. Our results reveal that it is possible to certify high stellar ranks even with a minimalistic scheme that provides only very coarse grained information about the photon number statistics of the characterized state.</p>

            <p>Propagating photons serve as essential links for distributing quantum information and entanglement across distant nodes. Knowledge of their Wigner functions not only enables their deployment as active information carriers but also provides error diagnostics when photons passively leak from a quantum processing unit. While well-established for standing waves, characterizing propagating microwave photons requires post-processing of room-temperature signals with excessive amplification noise. Here, we demonstrate amplification-free Wigner function tomography of propagating microwave photons using a superconductor--normal-metal--superconductor bolometer based on the resistive heating effect of absorbed radiation. By introducing two-field interference in power detection, the bolometer acts as a sensitive and broadband quadrature detector that samples the input field at selected angles at millikelvin with no added noise. Adapting the principles of computed tomography (CT) in medical imaging, we implement Wigner function CT by combining quadrature histograms across different projection angles and demonstrate it for Gaussian states at the single-photon level. Compressed sensing and neural networks further reduce the projections to three without compromising the reconstruction quality. These results address the long-standing challenge of characterizing propagating microwave photons in a superconducting quantum network and establish a new avenue for real-time quantum error diagnostics and correction.</p>

We show that the two-boson state is entangled and violates the CGLMP inequality for all values of the (anomalous) coupling constants and that in this case the state is entangled iff it can violate the CGLMP inequality. As an exemplary process of this kind we use the decay $H\to ZZ$ with anomalous coupling.</p>

            <p>The effect of decoherence on topological order (TO) has been most deeply understood for the toric code, the paragon of Abelian TOs. We show that certain non-Abelian TOs can be analyzed and understood to a similar degree, despite being significantly richer. We consider both wavefunction deformations and quantum channels acting on $D_4$ TO, which has recently been realized on a quantum processor. By identifying the corresponding local statistical mechanical spin or rotor model with $D_4$ symmetry, we find a remarkable stability against proliferating non-Abelian anyons. This is shown by leveraging a reformulation in terms of the tractable O$(2)$ loop model in the pure state case, and $n$ coupled O$(2)$ loop models for Rényi-$n$ quantities in the decoherence case -- corresponding to worldlines of the proliferating anyon with quantum dimension $2$. In particular, we find that the purity ($n=2$) remains deep in the $D_4$ TO for any decoherence strength, while the $n \to \infty$ limit becomes critical upon maximally decohering a particular anyon type, similar to our wavefunction deformation result. The information-theoretic threshold ($n\to 1$) appears to be controlled by a disordered version of these stat-mech models, akin to the toric code case although significantly more robust. We furthermore use Monte Carlo simulations to explore the phase diagrams when multiple anyon types proliferate at the same time, leading to a continued stability of the $D_4$ TO in addition to critical phases with emergent $U(1)$ symmetry. Instead of loop models, these are now described by net models corresponding to different anyon types coupled together according to fusion this http URL opens up the exploration of statistical mechanical models for decohered non-Abelian TO, which can inform optimal decoders, and which in an ungauged formulation examples of non-Abelian strong-to-weak symmetry breaking.</p>

            <p>Hyper-Ramsey protocols have been successfully implemented on ultra-narrow optical clock transitions to reduce systematic frequency-shifts induced by AC-Stark shift and amplitude pulse variation. However, the compensation remains imperfect against laser probe intensity fluctuation, decoherence and unsuited for external quasi-static or low frequency noise perturbations. Here, we address these limitations by employing dynamical-decoupling methods composed by multiple rotary Hahn-echo pulses toggling probe frequency detunings between opposite signs during interrogating laser pulses. Time-optimized Uhrig sequences of refocusing pulses produce highly contrasted and robust hyper-Ramsey interferences against low-frequency noise distortions caused by environmental factors and imperfections in the probe parameters. Dynamically-decoupled SU(2) hyper-clocks pave the way to universal noise-resilient quantum sensors, unveiling fault-tolerant quantum metrology to track fundamental symmetries and search for new physics beyond the Standard Model.</p>

            <p>Scalable atom-based quantum platforms for simulation, computing, and metrology require fast high-fidelity, low-loss imaging of individual atoms. Standard fluorescence detection methods rely on continuous cooling, limiting the detection range to one atom and imposing long imaging times that constrain the experimental cycle and mid-circuit conditional operations. Here, we demonstrate fast and low-loss single-atom imaging in optical tweezers without active cooling, enabled by the favorable properties of ytterbium. Collecting fluorescence over microsecond timescales, we reach single-atom discrimination fidelities above 99.9% and single-shot survival probabilities above 99.5%. Through interleaved recooling pulses, as short as a few hundred microseconds for atoms in magic traps, we perform tens of consecutive detections with constant atom-retention probability per image - an essential step toward fast atom re-use in tweezer-based processors and clocks. Our scheme does not induce parity projection in multiply-occupied traps, enabling number-resolved single-shot detection of several atoms per site. This allows us to study the near-deterministic preparation of single atoms in tweezers driven by blue-detuned light-assisted collisions. Moreover, the near-diffraction-limited spatial resolution of our low-loss imaging enables number-resolved microscopy in dense arrays, opening the way to direct site-occupancy readout in optical lattices for density fluctuation and correlation measurements in quantum simulators.</p>

There are various methods for noise suppression. In this paper, we propose leveraging the cross-correlation of multi-directional vibration noises to mitigate their dephasing effect in matter-wave interferometers. Specifically, we analyse an interferometer driven by its internal qubit under an external field and examine the dephasing caused by a two-dimensional random inertial force. As we will demonstrate, the coupling between the two-dimensional inertial force noise components will shift the resonance peak but not change the shape of the power spectral density. Moreover, when the noise approximately resonates with the intrinsic frequency of the test mass, we find that the standard deviation of the phase can be suppressed by a factor roughly equal to the Q-factor of the noise. This technique holds significant potential for future gravity experiments utilising quantum sensors, such as measuring gravitational acceleration and exploring quantum entanglement induced by gravity.</p>

            <h2>High-fidelity two-qubit quantum logic gates in a trapped-ion chain using axial motional modes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xingyu Zhao, Ji Bian, Yi Li, Yue Li, Mengxiang Zhang, Yiheng Lin</p>
            <p>Trapped-ion systems are one of the leading platforms for quantum information processing, where a key challenge is to scale up system size while maintaining high-fidelity two-qubit operations. A promising approach is to build high-performance modules interconnected via strong coupling. In particular, axial motional modes provide a feasible means of coupling short ion chains. However, previous implementations of fully connected 5-ion modules based on axial modes have been limited to fidelities of $96.6-98.0\%$. Here, we demonstrate two-qubit quantum logic gates in a 5-ion $^{40}$Ca$^{+}$ chain using axial modes, achieving fidelities exceeding $99\%$ for adjacent pairs and over $98\%$ for arbitrary pairs by carefully tackling dominant error sources. Our results are beneficial to the development of scalable ion-trap quantum processors, quantum simulation and quantum-enhanced metrology.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wen-Te Liao, Sven Ahrens</p>
            <p>The generation, controls, and storage of the gravitationally induced photon echo using the 8.4 eV Thorium-229 nuclear clock transition on Earth are theoretically investigated. With its exceptionally narrow linewidth of approximately 1 mHz and high quality factor in the order of $10^{19}$, the Thorium-229 clock transition allows for the potential detection of gravitational-redshift effects at millimeter-scale altitude variations. Moreover, the 1740-second half lifetime of the Thorium-229 isomeric state allows for the slow movement of the system within its coherence time. Along this line, we explore the generation, controls, and storage of photon echo arising from a rotation induced inversion of the gravitational frequency shift in a single target or in multiple equally spaced samples. Our approach lays the foundation for the controllable gravitational quantum optics on Earth.</p>

            <h2>Behavior of quantum coherence in the ultrastrong and deep strong coupling regimes of light-matter system</h2>

            <p>The ultrastrong and deep strong coupling regimes exhibit a variety of intriguing physical phenomena. In this work, we utilize the Hopfield model of a two-mode bosonic system, with each mode interacts with a heat reservoir, to research the behavior of quantum coherence. Our results indicate that a coupled oscillator system can exhibit significant quantum coherence in the ultrastrong and deep strong coupling regimes. In the ground state, the photon-mode and the matter-mode coherences are equal. The larger coherences that encompass the photon mode, the matter mode, and the overall system are achieved at lower optical frequencies and with increased coupling strengths. Notably, the the beam-splitter and phase rotation terms alone does not generate coherences for either total coherence or subsystem coherences; instead, the generation of quantum coherences originates from the one-mode and two-mode squeezing terms. When heat environments are present, the total coherence can be enhanced by the the beam-splitter and phase rotation terms, while it has no effect on subsystem coherences. Moreover, when the one-mode and two-mode squeezing terms and the the beam-splitter and phase rotation terms are considered together, the total coherence increases with stronger coupling. We also observe that lower frequencies maximize total coherence in the deep strong coupling regime. These results demonstrate that the ultrastrong and deep strong coupling regimes give rise to novel characteristics of quantum coherence. This work provides valuable insights into the quantum coherence properties, particularly in the ultrastrong and deep strong coupling regimes between light and matter and may have potential applications in quantum information processing.</p>

            <h2>Static disorder-induced renormalization of polariton group velocity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gustavo J. R. Aroeira, Raphael F. Ribeiro</p>
            <p>Molecular exciton-polaritons exhibit long-range, ultrafast propagation, yet recent experiments have reported far slower propagation than expected. In this work, we implement a nonperturbative approach to quantify how static energetic disorder renormalizes polariton group velocity in strongly coupled microcavities. The method requires no exact diagonalization or master equation propagation, and depends only on measurable parameters: the mean exciton energy and its variance, the microcavity dispersion, and the Rabi splitting. Using parameters corresponding to recently probed organic microcavities, we show that exciton inhomogeneous broadening slows both lower and upper polaritons, particularly when the mean exciton energy fluctuation approaches the collective light-matter coupling strength. A detailed discussion and interpretation of these results is provided using perturbation theory in the limit of weak resonance scattering. Overall, our results support the view that exciton-phonon interactions likely dominate the recent experimental observations of polariton slowdown in disordered media.</p>

            <p>A many-body quantum system which consists of collective quantum states, such as superradiant and subradiant states, behaves as a multi-level superatom in light-matter interaction. In this work, we experimentally study one-dimensional superatoms in waveguide quantum electrodynamics with a periodic array of superconducting artificial atoms. We engineer the periodic atomic array with two distinct nearest-neighbor spacings, i.e., $d$=$\lambda_0/2$ and $d$=$\lambda_0/4$, which correspond to Bragg and anti-Bragg scattering conditions, respectively. The system consists of eight atoms arranged to maintain these specific interatomic distances. By controlling atomic frequencies, we modify Bragg and anti-Bragg superatoms, resulting in distinctly different quantum optical phenomena, such as collectively induced transparency and a broad photonic bandgap. Moreover, due to strong waveguide-atom couplings in superconducting quantum circuits, efficient light manipulations are realized in small-size systems. Our work demonstrates tunable optical properties of Bragg and anti-Bragg superatoms, as well as their potential applications in quantum devices.</p>

            <h2>The controlled exciton transport of the Multi-chain system by cavity-dressed energy level crossings and anticrossings</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jia-Hui Wang, Yu-Ren Shi, Ji-Ming Gao, Zi-Fa Yu, Ju-Kui Xue, Fang-Qi Hu</p>
            <p>The performance of various quantum devices is fundamentally linked to the control of exciton transport. To explore this, we study the exciton transport of the two-dimensional multi-chain systems with different coupling configurations in an optical cavity. Two types of the chains--the homogeneous and heterogeneous coupling chain, as well as two inter-chain coupling conformations--the square and triangular arrangements, are considered. The effects of the inter-chain coupling, the dimerization parameter, the cavity, the length and number of the chains on exciton transport are systematically investigated for different coupling configurations through the spectra, the Hopfield coeffcients, and the steady-state dynamics of the system. The results show that in the absence of a cavity the exciton transport currents and effciency are determined by the exciton distribution across the multi-chain system. However, when a cavity is introduced the exciton transport can be significantly enhanced or suppressed by the polariton formation at the cavity-dressed energy level crossings and anticrossings near zero-energy modes, where the coherent excitation and LandauZener transitions occur. Meanwhile, we discover that the discontinuous and extremal points in the second-order partial derivatives of the photon Hopfield coeffcients with respect to the inter-chain coupling and the dimerization parameter correspond respectively to the crossings and anticrossings at the extreme points of the photon occupation number. Additionally, exciton transport effciency is closely related to the odevity of both chain length and chain number, and exhibits oscillatory behaviour. This work provides critical insights into the exciton transport mechanism in multichain-cavity system and theoretical basis for designing high-erformance excitonic devices with tunable transport properties.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiaojiao Chen, Wei Xiong, Dong Wang, Liu Ye</p>
            <p>Macroscopic entanglement, as a critical quantum resource in quantum information science, has been extensively studied in coherent optomechanics over the past decades. However, entanglement in dissipative optomechanics, where the cavity linewidth depends on the position of the mechanical resonator, remains largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate quantum entanglement in a dissipative optomechanical system realized by a Michelson-Sagnac interferometer with a movable membrane. This configuration enables the switching between coherent and dissipative optomechanical couplings at will. With experimentally feasible parameters, we demonstrate that the steady-state mechanical displacement exhibits a nonlinear (linear) dependence on the driving power under coherent (dissipative) coupling. Furthermore, we show that the quantum entanglement generated via dissipative coupling is significantly stronger and more robust to noise than that generated via coherent coupling. When both coherent and dissipative couplings are simultaneously present, the entanglement is weakened due to quantum interference. Our results indicate that dissipative optomechanical coupling can be a promising route for engineering strong and noise-resilient quantum entanglement.</p>

            <h2>Spectral Bias in Variational Quantum Machine Learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Callum Duffy, Marcin Jastrzebski</p>
            <p>In this work, we investigate the phenomenon of spectral bias in quantum machine learning, where, in classical settings, models tend to fit low-frequency components of a target function earlier during training than high-frequency ones, demonstrating a frequency-dependent rate of convergence. We study this effect specifically in parameterised quantum circuits (PQCs). Leveraging the established formulation of PQCs as Fourier series, we prove that spectral bias in this setting arises from the ``redundancy'' of the Fourier coefficients, which denotes the number of terms in the analytical form of the model contributing to the same frequency component. The choice of data encoding scheme dictates the degree of redundancy for a Fourier coefficient. We find that the magnitude of the Fourier coefficients' gradients during training strongly correlates with the coefficients' redundancy. We then further demonstrate this empirically with three different encoding schemes. Additionally, we demonstrate that PQCs with greater redundancy exhibit increased robustness to random perturbations in their parameters at the corresponding frequencies. We investigate how design choices affect the ability of PQCs to learn Fourier sums, focusing on parameter initialization scale and entanglement structure, finding large initializations and low-entanglement schemes tend to slow convergence.</p>

            <h2>Metric formalism for precision assessment in non-Hermitian systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Javid Naikoo, Ravindra W. Chhajlany, Jan Kołodyński, Adam Miranowicz</p>
            <p>Enhancing measurement precision in quantum systems is vital for advancing technologies like quantum sensing and communication. Traditionally, quantum Fisher information (QFI) has been the key tool in determining precision limits within Hermitian quantum systems. However, recent research has expanded to non-Hermitian systems exhibiting real spectra. This study investigates various interpretations of non-Hermitian quantum dynamics such as the normalization and metric approaches. We demonstrate that owing to distinct types of dynamic behaviour, QFI expressions vary significantly depending on the formalism. In particular, the normalization formalism overestimates the enhancement and/or revivals in QFI, effectively post-selecting the most optimistic case of the evolution, which may give an overly favourable impression of the sensitivity and accuracy of quantum measurements. The metric-based interpretation maintains consistency with a Hermitian-like structure, offering a more stable and conservative assessment of measurement precision. This approach provides a more natural representation of the system's evolution, enabling a more accurate assessment of quantum measurement sensitivity without the need for post-selection. We support our claims by focussing on QFI dynamics for a qubit system, while advocating the metric interpretation as a more reliable guide for quantum metrology despite presenting both approaches as valid and complementary ways of understanding non-Hermitian dynamics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Friederike Butt, Ivan Pogorelov, Robert Freund, Alex Steiner, Marcel Meyer, Thomas Monz, Markus Müller</p>
            <p>The ability to perform quantum error correction (QEC) and robust gate operations on encoded qubits opens the door to demonstrations of quantum algorithms. Contemporary QEC schemes typically require mid-circuit measurements with feed-forward control, which are challenging for qubit control, often slow, and susceptible to relatively high error rates. In this work, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a universal toolbox of fault-tolerant logical operations without mid-circuit measurements on a trapped-ion quantum processor. We present modular logical state teleportation between two four-qubit error-detecting codes without measurements during algorithm execution. Moreover, we realize a fault-tolerant universal gate set on an eight-qubit error-detecting code hosting three logical qubits, based on state injection, which can be executed by coherent gate operations only. We apply this toolbox to experimentally realize Grover's quantum search algorithm fault-tolerantly on three logical qubits encoded in eight physical qubits, with the implementation displaying clear identification of the desired solution states. Our work demonstrates the practical feasibility and provides first steps into the largely unexplored direction of measurement-free quantum computation.</p>

Our scanning setup enables tunable coherent coupling to systems of interest without the need for fabricating on-chip superconducting resonators. We measure the internal quality factor of our resonator sensor in the single-photon regime to be > 10000 and demonstrate capacitive imaging using our sensor with zeptoFarad sensitivity and micron spatial resolution at milliKelvin temperatures. We then use our setup to characterize the energy spectrum and coherence times of multiple transmon qubits with no on-chip readout circuitry.

            <p>Neutral Rydberg atoms trapped in optical tweezer arrays provide a platform for quantum simulation and computation. In this work, we investigate the Lamb-Dicke dynamics of coupled Rydberg atoms for different trapping frequencies. We model the atomic motion by both internal and motional degrees of freedom, in which the motional states arise due to the oscillation of each atom in optical tweezer traps due to the light-atom interaction. In this setup, the internal states are coupled to a laser light with a Rabi frequency, while each internal state of each atom is also harmonically trapped with a trap frequency that depends on the internal state. The impact of the coherent motion of the optical tweezers on the collective dynamics of the many-body Rydberg atoms is explored for varying Lamb-Dicke parameters and with different trap frequencies. We see the occurrence of dynamical phases e.g., Rabi oscillations in the decoupled limit, the limit torus phase for magic trapping, and the limit cycle phase as the trap frequency is further increased.</p>

            <p>Understanding random open quantum systems is critical for characterizing the performance of large-scale quantum devices and exploring macroscopic quantum phenomena. Various features in these systems, including spectral distributions, gap scaling, and decoherence, have been examined by modelling randomness under the central limit theorem. Here, we investigate random open quantum systems beyond the central limit theorem, focusing on heavy-tailed system-environment interactions. By extending the Ginibre unitary ensemble, we model system-environment interactions to exhibit a continuous transition from light-tailed to heavy-tailed distributions. This generalized configuration reveals unique properties-gapless spectra, Pareto principle governing dissipation, orthogonalization, and quasi-degeneracies-all linked to the violation of the central limit theorem. The synergy of these features challenges the common belief-the tradeoff between stability and sensitivity-through the emergence of long-lived and ultrasensitive quantum coherences that exhibit an enhancement of two orders of magnitude compared to predictions under the central limit theorem. The result, which is based on heavy-tailedness of open quantum systems, provides highly desirable platforms for quantum sensing applications.</p>

            <p>We present an extended formulation of the non-Markovian stochastic Schrödinger equation with complex frequency modes (extended cNMSSE), enabling the treatment of open quantum system dynamics under general spectral densities. This extension employs complete non-exponential basis expansions for the bath correlation functions, thereby generalizing the applicability of the cNMSSE framework beyond environments with Debye-type spectral structures. By preserving the wavefunction-based description and favorable linear-scaling properties, the extended cNMSSE offers an efficient and flexible approach to simulate non-Markovian quantum dynamics. The method is implemented within a pseudo-Fock space using conventional ladder operators and solved numerically via matrix product state (MPS) techniques. Benchmark simulations on four representative cases, including discrete spectra, Ohmic spectra with exponential and algebraic cutoffs, and critically damped Brownian spectral densities, demonstrate excellent agreement with results of hierarchy of forward-backward stochastic Schrödinger equations (HFB-SSE) and extended hierarchical equation of motion (HEOM). The extended cNMSSE thus provides a robust and scalable framework for accurate simulations of non-Markovian open quantum systems with general environments.</p>

            <p>Quantum information is typically fragile under measurement and environmental coupling. Remarkably, we find that its lifetime can scale exponentially with system size when the environment is continuously monitored via mid-circuit measurements -- regardless of bath size. Starting from a maximally entangled state with a reference, we analytically prove this exponential scaling for typical Haar random unitaries and confirm it through numerical simulations in both Haar-random and chaotic Hamiltonian systems. In the absence of bath monitoring, the lifetime exhibits a markedly different scaling: it grows at most linearly -- or remains constant -- with system size and decays inversely with bath size. We further extend our findings numerically to a broad class of initial states. We discuss implications for monitored quantum circuits in the weak measurement limit, quantum algorithms such as quantum diffusion models and quantum reservoir computing, and quantum communication. Finally, we evaluate the feasibility of resolving the predicted scaling regimes experimentally via noisy simulations of IBM Quantum hardwares.</p>

This compact THz source operates up to 60 K, with Tc= 90 K, delivering stable radiation in the 0.7-0.8 THz range, with on-chip electrical tunability from 100 GHz to 1 THz. Coherence arises from the phase-locked oscillation of intrinsic Josephson junction arrays, resonantly coupled to transverse electromagnetic modes within the cavity, analogous to a laser cavity, yielding collective macroscopic oscillations. THz emission remains detectable across a 0.5 m free-space open-air link at room temperature. We analyse the cavity-mode structure and extract THz photon generation rates up to 503 photons fs-1 in cryogenic conditions and 50-260 photons ps-1 over-the-air. These results establish long-term coherent THz emission from superconductors and chart a viable path toward scalable, tunable, solid-state coherent THz laser-on-a-chip platforms, especially for future classical and quantum systems.</p>

            <p>Superfluorescence (SF), a many-body quantum optics phenomenon, emerges from the collective interactions among self-organized and cooperatively coupled emitters, producing intense burst of ultrashort coherent radiation1-4. While SF has been observed in several solid-state materials5-9, the spontaneous generation of circularly polarized (CP) chiral SF has not been realized. Here, we report room-temperature chiral CP-SF originating from edge states in large-area (>100 um * 100 um), transferable vertically aligned chiral quasi-2D perovskite superlattices. Theoretical quantum optics calculations reveal that chirality-induced photon transport drives the transition from initially incoherent, weakly polarized spontaneous emission to highly polarized CP-SF, amplifying the circular polarization degree up to around 14%. Notably, the polarization helicity is found to flip between forward and backward propagation directions, a characteristic signature of a macroscopic CP dipole transition. Moreover, both the intensity and polarization degree of CP-SF can be tuned under weak magnetic fields, enabling precise control over solid-state quantum light emission at room temperature. Our findings emphasize the crucial role of chirality in establishing large-scale quantum coherence within chiral superlattices, thereby unveiling promising avenues for chirality-controlled quantum spin-optical applications 10,11.</p>

We show however, that strong collective coupling leads to a drastic modification of the excitation spectrum, as evidenced by well-resolved vacuum Rabi splitting in the intensity of the fluctuations. Furthermore, we demonstrate a significant polarization rotation in the linear scattering off the subradiant array via Raman scattering induced by the strongly coupled vacuum field.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amir Sivan, Meir Orenstein</p>
            <p>We show here that the photonic states emitted by ensembles of multilevel atoms via a superradiance process exhibit entanglement in the modal (frequency) degree of freedom, making this collective emission process a favorable candidate for a fast, bright and deterministic source of entangled photons. This entanglement is driven by two mechanisms: (i) selective excitation of the atomic ensemble to a superposition state and (ii) degeneracies of the optical transitions due to internal structure of the emitting atoms. The latter induces intricate non-radiative virtual transitions in the ensemble, which create interatomic correlations that are imprinted onto the emitted photons. One of the important outcomes of this complexity is the generation of mode-independent entangled multiphoton states. In addition, we study the dynamics of the correlations of the superradiating multilevel atom ensembles, and demonstrate a case where they exhibit beating in steady-state due to the aforementioned virtual transitions.</p>

Using a quantum-state diffusion approach to unravel the emission process, we investigate entanglement and classical correlations along individual quantum trajectories over time. This numerical analysis shows that despite an initial build-up of entanglement and a significant amount of entanglement due to either spin squeezing or dark states at late times, the essential features of the superradiant burst are well described by averages over fully factorizable states. We explain this observation in terms of an almost complete factorization of all 2-local observables, which we identify as a generic property of superradiant decay. Based on this insight, we provide a purely classical theory for the burst in squeezed superradiance, which is both intuitive and exact for a large number of emitters. Moreover, we find that our numerical approach also performs well in the presence of subradiant states, which dominate the slow residual decay of non-uniform ensembles at late times.</p>

            <h2>Observing Laughlin's pump using quantized edge states in graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bjarke S. Jessen, Maëlle Kapfer, Yuhao Zhao, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Cory R. Dean, Oded Zilberberg</p>
            <p>Laughlin's thought experiment of quantized charge pumping is central to understanding the integer quantum Hall effect (IQHE) and the topological origin of its conductance quantization. Its direct experimental observation, however, has been hindered by the difficulty of realizing clean electronic edges. We address this by fabricating ultra-small, lithographically defined contacts on graphene. This creates a Corbino-equivalent system, with well-confined inner edge states. Crucially, the small contact size induces strong energy quantization of the edge states. This quantization allows us to directly resolve the spectral flow associated with Laughlin's pump. By tracing the finite-size resonances of the inner edge, we observe clear oscillations in conductance as a function of magnetic field and carrier density. The oscillation period scales with contact size, consistent with quantized charge transfer. Thus, our results provide a direct observation of the spectral flow underlying Laughlin's pump. The simplicity of the graphene platform makes this approach scalable and robust for exploring fundamental topological effects.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mobin Motaharifar, Mahmood Hasani, Hassan Kaatuzian</p>
            <p>Quantum key distribution (QKD) represents a cornerstone of secure communication in the quantum era. While discrete-variable QKD (DV-QKD) protocols were historically the first to demonstrate secure key exchange, continuous-variable QKD (CV-QKD) has emerged as a more practical alternative due to its seamless compatibility with current telecommunications infrastructure. CV-QKD relies on coherent and squeezed states of light, offering significant advantages for integration into modern optical networks. This review comprehensively explores the theoretical underpinnings, technological advancements, and practical challenges of CV-QKD. Special attention is given to the role of photonic integrated circuits (PICs) in enabling scalable and efficient implementation of CV-QKD systems. Furthermore, recent advances in machine learning have been leveraged to optimize CV-QKD performance, with data-driven techniques enhancing noise estimation, parameter optimization, and system security. Additionally, tensor networks provide efficient computational tools for analyzing complex quantum correlations, improving the efficiency and robustness of quantum key distribution protocols. These developments, combined with ongoing improvements in quantum photonic integration, pave the way for the practical deployment of large-scale, high-speed quantum-secure networks.</p>

            <h2>Operational Threshold for Spatial Entanglement Survival Under Ionizing Decoherence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mrittunjoy Guha Majumdar</p>
            <p>The resilience of quantum entanglement under irreversible, energy-transferring interactions remains a fundamental question in quantum foundations and emerging quantum technologies. We develop a fully microscopic quantum electrodynamics framework to describe how spatial entanglement evolves when one particle of an entangled pair undergoes dissipative processes such as ionization or inelastic scattering. We show that entanglement decay follows an exponential law governed by recoil-induced momentum diffusion and identify a sharp operational threshold separating quantum-coherent and classical regimes. This threshold depends on whether the cumulative recoil-induced uncertainty exceeds the intrinsic bandwidth of the entangled state. Our results extend decoherence theory beyond Gaussian and weak-coupling models, providing quantitative criteria for entanglement survival in radiative environments and informing the design of robust quantum protocols in quantum sensing, imaging, and radiation-based quantum technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Baptiste Carles, Julien Dudas, Léo Balembois, Julie Grollier, Danijela Marković</p>
            <p>Quantum reservoir computing is a machine learning framework that offers ease of training compared to other quantum neural network models, as it does not rely on gradient-based optimization. Learning is performed in a single step on the output features measured from the quantum system. Various implementations of quantum reservoir computing have been explored in simulations, with different measured features. Although simulations have shown that quantum reservoirs present advantages in performance compared to classical reservoirs, experimental implementations have remained scarce. This is due to the challenge of obtaining a large number of output features that are nonlinear transformations of the input data. In this work, we propose and experimentally implement a novel quantum reservoir computing platform based on a circuit quantum electrodynamics architecture, consisting of a single cavity mode coupled to a superconducting qubit. We obtain a large number of nonlinear features from a single physical system by encoding the input data in the amplitude of a coherent drive and measuring the cavity state in the Fock basis. We demonstrate classification of two classical tasks with significantly smaller hardware resources and fewer measured features compared to classical neural networks. Our experimental results are supported by numerical simulations that show additional Kerr nonlinearity is beneficial to reservoir performance. Our work demonstrates a hardware-efficient quantum neural network implementation that can be further scaled up and generalized to other quantum machine learning models.</p>

            <h2>Microscopic approach to the quantized light-matter interaction in semiconductor nanostructures: Complex coupled dynamics of excitons, biexcitons, and photons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hendrik Rose, Stefan Schumacher, Torsten Meier</p>
            <p>We present a microscopic and fully quantized model to investigate the interaction between semiconductor nanostructures and quantum light fields including the many-body Coloumb interaction between photoexcited electrons and holes. Our approach describes the coupled dynamics of the quantum light field and single and double electron-hole pairs, i.e., excitons and biexcitons, and exactly accounts for Coulomb many-body correlations and carrier band dispersions. Using a simplified yet exact approach, we study a one-dimensional two-band system interacting with a single-mode, two-photon quantum state within a Tavis$\unicode{x2013}$Cummings framework. By employing an exact coherent factorization scheme, the computational complexity is reduced significantly enabling numerical simulations. We also derive a simplified model which includes only the bound $1s$-exciton and biexciton states for comparison. Our simulations reveal distinct single- and two-photon Rabi oscillations, corresponding to photon-exciton and exciton-biexciton transitions. We demonstrate, in particular, that biexciton continuum states significantly modify the dynamics in a way that cannot be captured by simplified models which consider only bound states. Our findings emphasize the importance of a comprehensive microscopic modeling in order to accurately describe quantum optical phenomena of interacting electronic many-body systems.</p>

            <p>Cavity magnonics explores the hybridization of photons and magnons within microwave resonators. One of the hallmarks of these systems is their ability to exhibit non-reciprocity, which is a key feature for radio frequency (RF) applications. One way to control non-reciprocal behaviors in cavity magnonics is the design of chiral cavities that allow selective coupling between photons and magnons depending on their polarization. However, a built-in chiral platform to harness and control non-reciprocity remains to be achieved. Here, we experimentally demonstrate controllable non-reciprocity (with an absolute isolation ratio reaching 46 dB) in a chiral resonator loaded with multiple yttrium iron garnet spheres. We develop a theoretical model of the S-parameters based on input-output formalism which highlights the links between the phases occurring in the system and its non-reciprocal behavior. Controllable non-reciprocity in cavity magnonics could enable the development of programmable isolators, circulators, and RF switches with improved performance. Such developments could pave the way toward more versatile and scalable information processing systems.</p>

            <h2>Decoherence of Majorana qubits by 1/f noise</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhijeet Alase, Marcus C. Goffage, Maja C. Cassidy, Susan N. Coppersmith</p>
            <p>Qubits based on Majorana Zero Modes (MZMs) in superconductor-semiconductor nanowires have attracted intense interest as a platform for utility-scale quantum computing. These qubits have been predicted to show extremely low error rates due to topological protection of the MZMs, where decoherence processes have been thought to be exponentially suppressed by either the nanowire length or the temperature. However, here we show that 1/f noise, which is ubiquitous in semiconductors, gives rise to a previously unexplored mechanism for Majorana qubit decoherence. The high frequency components of this noise causes quasiparticle excitations in the bulk of the topological superconductor, which in turn result in qubit errors that increase with the length of the nanowire. We calculate the probability of quasiparticle excitation for disorder-free nanowires in the presence of 1/f noise and show that this mechanism limits the decoherence times of the MZM qubits currently being developed to less than a microsecond even for perfectly uniform nanowires with no disorder. This decoherence time is significantly shorter than the time to implement quantum gates using this technology and is also shorter than the decoherence times of qubits in other leading solid-state architectures.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Features of the Thermal Two-Qubit Quantum Rabi Model in Ultra- and Deep-Strong Regimes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ciro Micheletti Diniz, Gabriella G. Damas, Norton G. de Almeida, Celso J. Villas-Bôas, G. D. de Moraes Neto</p>
            <p>Quantum correlations and non-classical states are indispensable resources for advancing quantum technologies, and their resilience at finite temperatures is crucial for practical experimental implementations. The two-qubit quantum Rabi model (2QQRM), a natural extension of the quantum Rabi model, describes two qubits coupled to a single bosonic mode and has been extensively studied in cavity quantum electrodynamics, superconducting circuits, and quantum information science. In this work, we investigate the persistence of quantum correlations and non-classical states in the 2QQRM at thermal equilibrium, focusing on the ultrastrong and deep strong coupling regimes. Through a systematic analysis of quantumness quantifiers, we demonstrate the emergence of long-lived quantum correlations, even in the presence of thermal noise. Notably, we uncover striking phenomena arising from the interplay between detuning and deep strong-coupling: in the high-frequency limit, where the qubit energy exceeds the cavity-mode energy, quantum criticality emerges, leading to a high degree of photon squeezing. In contrast, the opposite regime is characterized by robust qubit-qubit quantum correlations. Importantly, we show that both dispersive regimes exhibit quantum features that are remarkably robust to parameter fluctuations, making them advantageous for maintaining quantum coherence. These results highlight the exceptional resilience of quantum resources in the 2QQRM and provide valuable insights for developing quantum technologies operating under realistic, finite-temperature conditions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eric Kleinherbers, Shane P. Kelly, Yaroslav Tserkovnyak</p>
            <p>We present how entanglement between a spatially separated pair of color centers can be created by letting them weakly interact with the quantum fluctuations of a nonequilibrium magnetic environment. To this end, we consider two coupled ferromagnets, one in the ground state and one in an inverted state with respect to an applied magnetic field. The resulting energetic instability leads to a quantum spin current in the vacuum state that is sustained by the creation of magnon-antimagnon pairs at the interface. We show that these quantum fluctuations imprint a steady-state entanglement onto the two dipole-coupled color centers through nonlocal dissipation. We derive conditions for establishing a maximally entangled Bell state. This entanglement is absent in thermal equilibrium.</p>

            <p>Micrometer-scale thin diamond devices are key components for various quantum sensing and networking experiments, including the integration of color centers into optical microcavities. In this work, we introduce a laser-cutting method for patterning microdevices from millimeter-sized diamond membranes.

We compare this method with an established nanofabrication process based on electron-beam lithography, a two-step transfer pattern utilizing a silicon nitride hard mask material, and reactive ion etching. Microdevices fabricated using both methods are bonded to a cavity Bragg mirror and characterized using scanning cavity microscopy. We record two-dimensional cavity finesse maps over the devices, revealing insights about the variation in diamond thickness, surface quality, and strain. The scans demonstrate that devices fabricated by laser-cutting exhibit similar properties to devices obtained by the conventional method. Finally, we show that the devices host optically coherent Tin- and Nitrogen-Vacancy centers suitable for applications in quantum networking.</p>

            <p>Color center spins in diamond nanostructures are a key resource for emerging quantum technologies. Their innate surface proximity makes precise control of diamond surface chemistry essential for optimizing their functionality and charge states. However, conventional surface functionalization methods typically lack the tunability and efficiency required for robust charge-state control. Here, we introduce a deterministic, nonvolatile technique for continuously and efficiently tuning diamond's surface termination via laser-induced oxidation of H-terminated diamond nanopillars. By tracking SiV$^-$ photoluminescence as a charge-state proxy, we uncover the microscopic mechanism of this photocatalytic process through a systematic photon-flux and -energy analysis, where we identify charge-cycling of native defects as sources of optically generated holes driving the desired surface oxidation. Our results suggest that our method applies broadly to other color centers and host materials, offering a versatile tool for on-demand charge-state control and surface engineering in solid-state quantum devices.</p>

            <p>An efficient interface between a spin qubit and single photons is a key enabling system for quantum science and technology. We report on a coherently controlled diamond nitrogen-vacancy center electron spin qubit that is optically interfaced with an open microcavity. Through Purcell enhancement and an asymmetric cavity design, we achieve efficient collection of resonant photons, while on-chip microwave lines allow for spin qubit control at a 10 MHz Rabi frequency. With the microcavity tuned to resonance with the nitrogen-vacancy center's optical transition, we use excited state lifetime measurements to determine a Purcell factor of 7.3 $\pm$ 1.6. Upon pulsed resonant excitation, we find a coherent photon detection probability of 0.5 % per pulse. Although this result is limited by the finite excitation probability, it already presents an order of magnitude improvement over the solid immersion lens devices used in previous quantum network demonstrations. Furthermore, we use resonant optical pulses to initialize and read out the electron spin. By combining the efficient interface with spin qubit control, we generate two-qubit and three-qubit spin-photon states and measure heralded Z-basis correlations between the photonic time-bin qubits and the spin qubit.</p>

            <p>We show how to perform measurement-based quantum computing on qudits (high-dimensional quantum systems) using alternative resource states beyond the cluster state. Here, the entangling gate, characterizing the resource state, is a diagonal or block-diagonal Clifford operation instead of the usual controlled-phase gate for cluster states. This simple change has remarkable consequences: the applied entangling operation determines an intrinsic single-qudit gate associated with the resource that drives the quantum computation when performing single-qudit measurements on the resource state. We prove a condition for the intrinsic gate allowing for the measurement-based implementation of arbitrary single-qudit unitaries. Furthermore, for prime-power-dimensional qudits, we demonstrate that the complexity of the realization depends linearly on the dimension and the Pauli order of the intrinsic gate so that different entangling gates are associated with different computational overheads. In particular, we provide two examples of qutrit resource states, which allow more efficient quantum information transport and processing than the qutrit cluster state. Finally, we discuss the required two-dimensional geometry of the resource state for universal measurement-based quantum computing.</p>

            <p>We describe a novel scheme for the generation of stationary entanglement between two separated qubits that are driven by a purely thermal photon source. While in this scenario the qubits remain in a separable state at all times when the source is broadband, i.e. Markovian, the qubits relax into an entangled steady state once the bandwidth of the thermal source is sufficiently reduced. We explain this phenomenon by the appearance of a quasiadiabatic dark state and identify the most relevant nonadiabatic corrections that eventually lead to a breakdown of the entangled state, once the temperature is too high. This effect demonstrates how the non-Markovianity of an otherwise incoherent reservoir can be harnessed for quantum communication applications in optical, microwave, and phononic networks. As two specific examples, we discuss the use of filtered room-temperature noise as a passive resource for entangling distant superconducting qubits in a cryogenic quantum link or solid-state spin qubits in a phononic quantum channel.</p>

            <p>Violation of Bell inequalities is an essential requirement for many quantum information and communication protocols. In high-dimensional systems, Bell inequality tests face the challenge of implementing genuinely multi-outcome measurements, since the emulation of these with separate dichotomic projections opens a binarisation loophole that local hidden variable theories can exploit. Here we show that the joint spectral intensity of a two-photon entangled state contains access to the necessary multi-outcome measurements to overcome this obstacle and certify nonlocality for high-dimensional states. This result is contrary to the belief that the joint spectral intensity is a phase-insensitive quantity and does not have sufficient information to certify entanglement or nonlocality. Using this approach, we violate the CGLMP Bell inequality up to dimension d = 8, all with negligible p-values, and for the first time close the binarisation loophole in high-dimensional Bell experiments. Guaranteeing nonlocal correlations using frequency-only measurements removes the technological hurdle of measurements in the temporal domain, thus greatly simplifying any practical implementation of future high-dimensional quantum information protocols.</p>

            <p>Semiclassical instanton theory captures nuclear quantum effects such as tunnelling in chemical reactions. It was originally derived from two different starting points, the flux correlation function and the ImF premise. In pursuit of a nonadiabatic rate theory, a number of methods have been proposed; almost all based on the less rigorous ImF premise. Only recently, we introduced a rigorous nonadiabatic ring-polymer instanton rate theory in the flux-correlation function framework which successfully bridges from the Born-Oppenheimer to the golden-rule limit. Here, we examine the previous ImF-based attempts and conclude that they do not capture the two limits correctly. In particular, we will highlight how the last in a series of developments, called mean-field ring-polymer instanton theory, breaks down in the golden-rule limit. We develop a new nonadiabatic ImF rate theory to remedy the failings of previous attempts while taking inspiration from them. We also consider the crossover from deep tunnelling to a high-temperature rate theory. We test our new nonadiabatic ImF theory on a range of models including asymmetric and multidimensional systems and we show reliable results for the deep-tunnelling regime but limitations for the related high-temperature rate theory.</p>

Such fields can induce a rich phase diagram, including a first-order line and also a continuous wetting transition, which is a quantum version of the classical wetting surface phenomenon. We present results for noiseless simulations of the associated quantum circuits as well as hardware results taken from a superconducting quantum processor. For different regions of the phase diagram, the quantum algorithm allows us to predict the critical value of the magnetic fields responsible for either the first or second-order transitions occuring in the system.</p>

We finally perform experiments with unified two-photon states, and validate the uncertainty principle, coherence and Bell nonlocality within the experimental error.

Here, we experimentally investigate a chaotic quantum many-body system using projected ensembles on a superconducting processor with 16 qubits on a square lattice. Our results provide direct evidence of deep thermalization by observing a Haar-distributed projected ensemble for the steady states within a charge-conserved sector. Moreover, by introducing an ensemble-averaged entropy as a metric, we establish a benchmark for many-body information leakage from the system to its environment.

This work challenges that assumption by introducing $q$ boson Fock state sampling, a variant in which transmon qubits can operate effectively. Through direct mapping to the $q$ boson formalism, we demonstrate that transmons possess the capability to achieve quantum supremacy in $q$ boson sampling tasks. This finding expands the potential applications of transmon-based quantum processors and paves the way for new avenues in quantum computation.</p>

            <h2>Deterministic quantum search on all Laplacian integral graphs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guanzhong Li, Jingquan Luo, Shiguang Feng, Lvzhou Li</p>
            <p>Searching for an unknown marked vertex on a given graph (also known as spatial search) is an extensively discussed topic in the area of quantum algorithms, with a plethora of results based on different quantum walk models and targeting various types of graphs. Most of these algorithms have a non-zero probability of failure. In recent years, there have been some efforts to design quantum spatial search algorithms with $100\%$ success probability. However, these works either only work for very special graphs or only for the case where there is only one marked vertex. In this work, we propose a different and elegant approach to quantum spatial search, obtaining deterministic quantum search algorithms that can find a marked vertex with certainty on any Laplacian integral graph with any predetermined proportion of marked vertices. Thus, this work discovers the largest class of graphs so far that allow deterministic quantum search, making it easy to design deterministic quantum search algorithms for many graphs, including the different graphs discussed in previous works, in a unified framework.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicetu Tibau Vidal, Chiara Marletto, Vlatko Vedral, GIulio Chiribella</p>
            <p>Reconciling quantum mechanics and general relativity remains one of the most profound challenges in modern physics. The BMV (Bose-Marletto-Vedral) experiment can assess the quantum nature of gravity by testing whether gravitational interactions can generate entanglement between quantum systems. In this work, we show that entanglement can be generated by gravity without requiring spacetime superpositions or quantum spacetime degrees of freedom by using mediators that do not satisfy the usual property of local tomography when coupling to quantum matter. Specifically, we showcase how entanglement can be generated using three distinct toy models that display non-locally tomographic couplings between quantum matter and a locally classical gravitational mediator. These models include (i) fermionic systems with the parity superselection rule, (ii) non-Abelian anyonic systems, and (iii) a novel bit anti-bit model. Our results demonstrate a crucial point: a gravitational mediator which does not exhibit superpositions of its classical basis but still qualifies as non-classical via non-locally tomographic coupling mechanisms can generate entanglement through local interactions. This work also underscores the importance of relaxing local tomography in exploring the quantum-gravitational interface. It provides a novel perspective on the role of spacetime degrees of freedom in entanglement generation through local interactions.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Adaptive Search: A Hybrid Quantum-Classical Algorithm for Global Optimization of Multivariate Functions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> G. Intoccia, U. Chirico, V. Schiano Di Cola, G. Pepe, S. Cuomo</p>
            <p>This work presents Quantum Adaptive Search (QAGS), a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for the global optimization of multivariate functions. The method employs an adaptive mechanism that dynamically narrows the search space based on a quantum-estimated probability distribution of the objective function. A quantum state encodes information about solution quality through an appropriate complex amplitude mapping, enabling the identification of the most promising regions, and thus progressively tightening the search bounds; then a classical optimizer performs local refinement of the solution. The analysis demonstrates that QAGS ensures a contraction of the search space toward global optima, with controlled computational complexity. The numerical results on the benchmark functions show that, compared to the classical methods, QAGS achieves higher accuracy while offering advantages in both time and space complexity.</p>

            <p>Here we investigate analogy between quantum signal processing (QSP) and the adiabatic-impulse model (AIM) in order to implement the QSP algorithm with fast quantum logic gates. QSP is an algorithm that uses single-qubit dynamics to perform a polynomial function transformation. AIM effectively describes the evolution of a two-level quantum system under strong external driving field. We can map parameters from QSP to AIM to implement QSP-like evolution with nonadiabatic, high-amplitude external drives. By choosing AIM parameters that control non-adiabatic transition parameters (such as driving amplitude $A$, frequency $\omega$, and signal timing), one can achieve polynomial approximations and increase robustness in quantum circuits. The analogy presented here between QSP and AIM can be useful as a way to directly implement the QSP algorithm on quantum systems and obtain all the benefits from the fast Landau-Zener-Stuckelberg-Majotana (LZSM) quantum logic gates.</p>

            <p>We study the first detected recurrence time problem of continuous-time quantum walks on graphs. While previous works have employed projective measurements to determine the first return time, we implement a protocol based on weak measurements on a dilated system, enabling minimally invasive monitoring throughout the evolution. To achieve this, we extend the theoretical framework and complement it with both numerical simulations and experimental investigations on an IBM quantum computer. Despite the implementation of a generalized measurement, our modified formalism of weak recurrence provides a description purely within the Hilbert space of the quantum system. Our results reveal that the first hitting time scales inversely with the coupling parameter between the ancilla and the quantum system.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> L. Acevedo, J. Sánchez-Cánovas, M. Donaire</p>
            <p>We study the optical response of a binary system of identical atoms in which one of them is excited by an incoherent pump. %We study the properties of photon scattering, absorption and emission, together with the time evolution of the atomic system. %This allows us to characterize and eventually manipulate the state of the system, paving the way for prospective applications in quantum information processing. Applying the diagrammatic formalism developed in Donaire [Phys. Rev. A104, 043704 (2021)], it is shown how scattering, absorption, stimulated emission, spontaneous emission and resonant energy transfer can be tailored by varying i) the interatomic distance, which governs the interference effects of the emitted radiation; and ii) the pump rate, which determines the population of the atomic levels. It is found that, for sufficiently strong pumping, the collective component of the extinction cross-section becomes negligible, regardless of the interatomic distance, as optical gains compensate for losses, and the total extinction cross-section is reduced to less than half of its value in the absence of pumping. In contrast, at weak pumping and short interatomic distances, interference effects lead to a significant suppression of the extinction cross-section relative to that of two noninteracting atoms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lavakumar Addepalli, P.K. Pathak</p>
            <p>We propose a scheme for two-mode hyperradiant lasing in a system comprising two incoherently pumped quantum dots (QDs) coupled to a bimodal photonic crystal cavity. To account for the exciton-phonon interactions, we employ a time-convolutionless polaron-transformed master equation. Both resonant and off-resonant couplings of the QDs to the cavity modes are considered, and we analyze the resulting radiance witness as well as the intra- and inter-mode photon correlations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that phonon-induced cooperative two-mode two-photon processes significantly enhance the radiance witness. This enhancement is quantified by evaluating the emission and absorption rates associated with both single-mode and two-mode two-photon transitions. Finally, we compare the radiance witness and emission spectral linewidths for QDs coupled to single-mode and bimodal cavities, revealing that an increase in radiance witness is accompanied by a narrowing of the emission linewidth.</p>

Unlike measurement-based feedback, this all-optical scheme preserves the correlations between mechanical motion and the feedback signal. Adjustment of the feedback phase and delay provides precise and tunable control over the system dynamics. The ultimate cooling performance is currently limited by phase noise, which we analyze within a theoretical framework that outlines the constraints and prospects for reaching the motional ground state. Our results establish coherent feedback as a powerful tool for quantum control of levitated systems, extending beyond center-of-mass cooling.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jost Kellner, Alessandra Sabatti, Tristan Kuttner, Robert J. Chapman, Rachel Grange</p>
            <p>Quantum photonic technologies rely on the ability to generate, manipulate, and interfere indistinguishable single photons on a scalable platform. Among the various approaches, spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) remains one of the most widely used methods for generating entangled or pure photon pairs. However most integrated SPDC sources relying on co-propagating geometries have a limited purity of heralded photons, or require lossy filtering. Type-2 SPDC processes can produce pure separable photons but typically suffer from lower efficiency and added complexity due to polarisation management. Here we show the first integrated counter-propagating photon-pair source on lithium niobate on insulator, where signal and idler photons are generated in opposite directions. The counter-propagating geometry leads to spectrally uncorrelated photon pairs without spectral filtering. The joint spectral intensity measurements and unheralded $g^{(2)}$ correlations, yield purities of (92$\pm$3)%. Interference between two independent sources achieves heralded visibilities of (71$\pm$3)%, confirming the scalability of the platform. These results establish a new route toward integrated, high-purity, and tunable photon sources. The demonstrated counter-propagating geometry offers a scalable solution for quantum photonic networks.</p>

            <p>Advanced photonic quantum technologies -- from quantum key distribution to quantum computing -- require on-chip sources of entangled photons that are both efficient and readily scalable. In this theoretical study, we demonstrate the generation of polarization-entangled Bell states in structurally simple waveguides by exploiting the intrinsic properties of nonlinear crystals. We thereby circumvent elaborate phase-matching strategies that commonly involve the spatial modulation of a waveguide's linear or nonlinear optical properties. We derive general criteria for the second-order susceptibility tensor that enable the generation of cross-polarized photon pairs via spontaneous parametric down-conversion in single-material waveguides. Based on these criteria, we systematically categorize all birefringent, non-centrosymmetric crystal classes in terms of their suitability. Using coupled mode theory, we then numerically analyze cuboid waveguides made from two materials that are highly relevant to integrated photonics: lithium niobate, a well-established platform, and barium titanate, an emerging alternative. We find that barium titanate consistently outperforms lithium niobate by providing a higher nonlinear efficiency and high concurrence over a significantly broader spectral range. These findings outline a practical route toward highly efficient, fabrication-friendly, and scalable sources of polarization-entangled photons for integrated quantum photonic circuits.</p>

            <p>Laughlin's thought experiment of quantized charge pumping is central to understanding the integer quantum Hall effect (IQHE) and the topological origin of its conductance quantization. Its direct experimental observation, however, has been hindered by the difficulty of realizing clean electronic edges. We address this by fabricating ultra-small, lithographically defined contacts on graphene. This creates a Corbino-equivalent system, with well-confined inner edge states. Crucially, the small contact size induces strong energy quantization of the edge states. This quantization allows us to directly resolve the spectral flow associated with Laughlin's pump. By tracing the finite-size resonances of the inner edge, we observe clear oscillations in conductance as a function of magnetic field and carrier density. The oscillation period scales with contact size, consistent with quantized charge transfer. Thus, our results provide a direct observation of the spectral flow underlying Laughlin's pump. The simplicity of the graphene platform makes this approach scalable and robust for exploring fundamental topological effects.</p>

            <h2>Imaginary Time Formalism for Causal Nonlinear Response Functions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sounak Sinha, Barry Bradlyn</p>
            <p>It is well established that causal linear response functions can be found by computing the much simpler imaginary time-ordered Matsubara functions and performing an analytic continuation. This principle is the basis for much of our understanding of linear response for interacting and disordered systems, via diagrammatic perturbation theory. Similar imaginary-time approaches have recently been introduced for computing nonlinear response functions as well, although the rigorous connection between Matsubara and causal nonlinear response functions has not been clearly elucidated. In this work, we provide a proof of this connection to all orders in perturbation theory. Using an equations of motion approach, we show by induction that casual nonlinear response functions at every order can be obtained from an analytic continuation of an appropriate time-ordered Matsubara function. We demonstrate this connection explicitly for second order response functions in the Lehmann representation. As a byproduct of our approach, we derive an explicit expression for the Lehmann representation of $n$-th order response functions by solving the equations of motion. We also use our result to find an analytic spectral density representation for both causal response functions and Matsubara functions. Finally, we show how our results lead to a family of generalized sum rules, focusing explicitly on the asymptotic expression for $n$-th harmonic generation rate.</p>

            <p>Can there be multiple bulk theories for the same boundary theory? We answer this affirmatively in the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) model using the tools of constrained systems. We find different symmetry sectors generated by specific constraints within the chord Hilbert space of the DSSYK with matter. Each sector corresponds to a different bulk description. These include chord parity symmetry, corresponding to End-Of-The-World (ETW) branes and Euclidean wormholes in sine dilaton gravity; and relative time-translations in a doubled DSSYK model (as a single DSSYK with an infinitely heavy chord) used in de Sitter holography. We derive the partition functions and thermal correlation functions in the ETW brane and Euclidean wormhole systems from the boundary theory. We deduce the holographic dictionary by matching geodesic lengths in the bulk with the spread complexity of the parity-gauged DSSYK. The Euclidean wormholes of fixed size are perturbatively stable, and their baby universe Hilbert space is non-trivial only when matter is added. We conclude studying the constraints in the path integral of the doubled DSSYK. We derive the gauge invariant operator algebra of one of the DSSYKs dressed to the other one and discuss its holographic interpretation.</p>

            <h2>Observers and Timekeepers: From the Page-Wootters Mechanism to the Gravitational Path Integral</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zixia Wei</p>
            <p>Quantum gravity in a closed universe faces two a priori distinct yet seemingly related issues: the problem of time and the fact that its Hilbert space dimension is one. Both have been argued to be resolvable by formulating physics relative to an observer. Using a simple gravitational path integral model, we explain that the two issues arise from two distinct non-perturbative effects: the former from summing over metrics and the latter from summing over topologies. We then revisit the Page-Wootters mechanism, one of the earliest frameworks for formulating quantum mechanics relative to an observer, see how it applies to both issues, and introduce some new ingredients. In particular, we emphasize a hierarchy between an observer and a timekeeper. An observer is a subsystem of the universe whose specification results in a nontrivial Hilbert space, while a timekeeper is an observer with a specified history that can be used as a reference for the time of the environment and experiences a nontrivial time evolution. Finally, we propose a method for incorporating observers and timekeepers into the gravitational path integral and show that implementing a timekeeper in this way furnishes an observer-dependent generalization of holography.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hanggai Nuomin, Feng-Feng Song, Peng Zhang, David N. Beratan</p>
            <p>Molecular structures with multiple donor, bridge, or acceptor units can display quantum interference effects that influence electron and energy transfer (ET and EnT) rates. Recent experiments found a 4- to 5-fold increase in ET rates for donor-acceptor structures with two acceptors compared to one. This result is surprising: simple classical or quantum analysis suggests a factor of two rate enhancement. We analyze the coupling interactions in multiple acceptor systems and find that rate enhancements beyond additive effects arise from acceptor-acceptor interactions that: 1) shift the reaction free energy, 2) change the donor-acceptor couplings, and 3) alter the reaction-coordinate motion. Consideration of these effects explains the observed rates in multi-acceptor systems and suggests strategies to tailor energy and electron transfer kinetics.</p>

The answer, as we show, is in the affirmative. In particular, by considering isospectral deformations of the uniform magnetic field, we present explicit expressions for non-uniform magnetic fields that are strictly isospectral to their uniform counterpart, thus supporting the Landau levels.</p>

            <p>One of the most important physical effects in condensed matter physics is the Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC), introduced in seminal works by Emmanuel Rashba. In this article, we discuss, describe, and review (providing critical perspectives on) the crucial role of RSOC in the currently active research area of topological quantum computation. Most, if not all, of the current experimental topological quantum computing platforms use the idea of Majorana zero modes as the qubit ingredient because of their non-Abelian anyonic property of having an intrinsic quantum degeneracy, which enables nonlocal encoding protected by a topological energy gap. It turns out that RSOC is a crucial ingredient in producing a low-dimensional topological superconductor in the laboratory, and such topological superconductors naturally have isolated localized midgap Majorana zero modes. In addition, increasing the RSOC strength enhances the topological gap, thus enhancing the topological immunity of the qubits to decoherence. Thus, Rashba's classic work on SOC may lead not only to the realization of localized non-Abelian anyons, but also fault tolerant quantum computation.</p>

This result implies a negative resolution of Tsirelson's problem, that is, $C_{qa}$ (the closure of the set of tensor product correlations) and $C_{qc}$ (the set of commuting correlations) can be separated by a hyperplane (that is, a Bell-like inequality). In particular, there are correlations produced by commuting measurements (a finite number of them and with a finite number of outcomes) on an infinite-dimensional quantum system which cannot be approximated by sequences of finite-dimensional tensor product correlations. Here, we point out that there are four logical possibilities of this result. Each possibility is interesting because it fundamentally challenges the nature of spacially separated systems in different ways.

            <p>Scrambling of quantum information in both integrable and nonintegrable Floquet spin systems is studied. Our study employs tripartite mutual information (TMI), with negative TMI serving as an indicator of scrambling, where a more negative value suggests a higher degree of scrambling. Both integrable and nonintegrable Floquet systems display scrambling behavior across all periods lying between 0 to {\pi}/2, except at self-dual point({\pi}/4). Nonintegrable Floquet systems exhibit more pronounced scrambling compared to integrable ones across all periods. The degree of scrambling increases as we move towards the self-dual point (but not at the self-dual point), regardless of the initial states. TMI demonstrates periodic behavior at the self-dual point, with a period matching the system size in the case of the integrable system while displaying complex patterns in the non-integrable system. The initial growth of scrambling in both integrable and nonintegrable Floquet systems manifests as a power-law increase for small periods, followed by a sudden jump in scrambling near the self-dual point.</p>

            <p>Quantum Process Tomography (QPT) methods aim at identifying, i.e. estimating, a quantum process. QPT is a major quantum information processing tool, since it especially allows one to experimentally characterize the actual behavior of quantum gates, that may be used as the building blocks of quantum computers. We here consider unitary, possibly dense (i.e. without sparsity constraints) processes, which corresponds to isolated systems. Moreover, we develop QPT methods that are applicable to a significant number of qubits and hence to a high state space dimension, which allows one to tackle more complex problems. Using the unitarity of the process allows us to develop methods that first achieve part of QPT by performing an eigenanalysis of the estimated density matrix of a process output. Building upon this idea, we first develop a class of complete algorithms that are single-stage, in the sense that they use only one eigendecomposition. We then extend them to multiple-stage algorithms (i.e. with several eigendecompositions), in order to address high-dimensional state spaces while being less limited by the estimation errors made when using an arbitrary given Quantum State Tomography (QST) algorithm as a building block of our overall methods. We first propose two-stage methods and we then extend them to dichotomic methods, whose number of stages increases with the considered state space dimension. The relevance of our methods is validated with simulations. Single-stage and two-stage methods efficiently apply up to 13 qubits on a standard PC (with 16 GB of RAM). Multi-stage methods yield an even higher accuracy.</p>

We propose here a generalization of the Landau-Zener (LZ) problem characterized by distinct paths of the instantaneous eigenstates as the system evolves in time while keeping the instantaneous eigenenergies exactly as in the standard LZ model. We show that these paths play an essential role in the transition probability $P$ between the two states, and can lead to a substantial reduction of $P$, being possible even to achieve $P=0$ in an instructive extreme case, and also to large $P$ even in the absence of any anticrossing point.

            <p>Standard compilers for quantum circuits decompose arbitrary single-qubit gates into a sequence of physical X(pi/2) pulses and virtual-Z phase gates. Consequently, many circuit classes implement different logic operations but have an equivalent structure of physical pulses that only differ by changes in virtual phases. When many structurally-equivalent circuits need to be measured, generating sequences for each circuit is unnecessary and cumbersome, since compiling and loading sequences onto classical control hardware is a primary bottleneck in quantum circuit execution. In this work, we develop a hardware-assisted protocol for executing parameterized circuits on our FPGA-based control hardware, QubiC. This protocol relies on a hardware-software co-design technique in which software identifies structural equivalency in circuits and "peels" off the relevant parameterized angles to reduce the overall waveform compilation time. The hardware architecture then performs real-time "stitching" of the parameters in the circuit to measure circuits that implement a different overall logical operation. This work demonstrates significant speed ups in the total execution time for several different classes of quantum circuits.</p>

By the efficient use of environment tensors, the algorithm is scalable in depth beyond prior work, and we present circuit compilations of up to 64 layers of $SU(4)$ gates. Surpassing only 1D circuits, our approach can flexibly target a particular quasi-2D gate topology. We demonstrate this by compiling a 52-qubit 2D Transverse-Field Ising propagator onto the IBM Heavy-Hex topology. For all circuit depths and widths tested, we produce circuits with smaller errors than all equivalent depth Trotter unitaries, corresponding to reductions in error by up to 4 orders of magnitude and circuit depth compressions with a factor of over 6.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Token Obfuscation via Superposition: A Post-Quantum Security Framework Using Multi-Basis Verification and Entropy-Driven Evolution</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S.M. Yousuf Iqbal Tomal, Abdullah Al Shafin</p>
            <p>Traditional cryptographic techniques, including token obfuscation, are increasingly vulnerable to quantum attacks due to advancements in quantum computing. Quantum algorithms such as Shor's and Grover's pose significant threats to classical security methods, necessitating quantum-resistant alternatives. This study proposes a quantum-based approach to token obfuscation that leverages superposition and multi-basis verification to enhance security against quantum adversaries. Tokens are encoded in quantum superposition states, ensuring probabilistic concealment until measured. A multi-basis verification protocol strengthens authentication by requiring validation across multiple quantum measurement bases. Additionally, a quantum decay protocol and token refresh mechanism dynamically manage the token lifecycle to prevent prolonged exposure and replay attacks. The model was tested through quantum simulations, evaluating entropy quality, adversarial robustness, and token verification reliability. Experimental validation demonstrates an entropy quality score of 0.9996, a 0% attack success rate across five adversarial models, and a 67% false positive rate, indicating strict security constraints. These findings confirm the effectiveness of quantum-based token obfuscation in preventing unauthorized reconstruction. The proposed approach provides a foundation for post-quantum cryptographic security by integrating entropy-driven state transformations, dynamic token evolution, and multi-basis verification. Future work will focus on optimizing computational efficiency and testing real-world implementations on quantum hardware.</p>

            <p>Recent progress in manipulating individual quantum systems enables the exploration of engines exploiting non-classical resources. One of the most appealing is the energy provided by the inherent backaction of quantum measurements. While a handful of experiments have investigated the inner dynamics of engines fueled by measurement backaction, powering a useful task by such an engine is missing. Here we demonstrate the amplification of microwave signals by an engine fueled by repeated quantum measurements of a superconducting transmon qubit. Using feedback, the engine acts as a quantum Maxwell demon operating without a hot thermal source. Measuring the gain of this amplification constitutes a direct probing of the work output of the engine, in contrast with inferring the work by measuring the qubit state along its evolution. Observing a good agreement between both work estimation methods, our experiment validates the accuracy of the indirect method. We characterize the long-term stability of the engine as well as its robustness to transmon decoherence, loss and drifts. Our experiment exemplifies a practical usage of the energy brought by quantum measurement backaction.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nilachal Chakrabarti, Neha Nirbhan, Arpan Bhattacharyya</p>
            <p>In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of a non-Hermitian SSH model that arises out of the no-click limit of a monitored SSH model in the Krylov space. We find that the saturation timescale of the complexity associated with the spread of the state in the Krylov subspace increases with the measurement rate, and late time behaviour differs across the $\mathrm{PT}$ symmetry transition point. Furthermore, extending the notion of this complexity for subsystems in Krylov space, we find that the scaling of its late time value with subsystem size shows a discontinuous jump across the $\mathrm{PT}$ transition point, indicating that it can be used as a suitable order parameter for such transition but not for the measurement-induced transition. Finally, we show that a generalized measure in the Krylov subspace, which contains information about the correlation landscape, such as Quantum Fisher information, which also possesses some structural similarity with the complexity functional, can be a promising probe of the measurement-induced phase.</p>

            <h2>Measurement-Device-Independent Schmidt Number Certification of All Entangled States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saheli Mukherjee, Bivas Mallick, Arun Kumar Das, Amit Kundu, Pratik Ghosal</p>
            <p>Bipartite quantum states with higher Schmidt numbers have been shown to outperform those with lower Schmidt numbers in various quantum information processing tasks, highlighting the operational advantage of entanglement dimensionality. Certifying the Schmidt number of such states is therefore crucial for efficient resource utilization. Ideally, this certification should rely as little as possible on the certifying devices to ensure robustness against their potential imperfections. Fully device-independent certification via Bell-nonlocal games offer strong robustness but suffers from fundamental limitations: it cannot certify the Schmidt number of all entangled states. We demonstrate that this insufficiency of Bell-nonlocal games is not limited to entangled states that do not exhibit Bell-nonlocality. Specifically, we prove the existence of Bell-nonlocal states whose Schmidt number cannot be certified by any Bell-nonlocal game when the parties are restricted to local projective measurements. To overcome this, we develop a measurement-device-independent certification method based on semi-quantum nonlocal games, which assume trusted preparation devices but treat measurement devices as black boxes. We prove that for any bipartite state with Schmidt number exceeding r, there exists a semi-quantum nonlocal game that can certify its Schmidt number. Finally, we provide an explicit construction of such a semi-quantum nonlocal game based on an optimal Schmidt number witness operator.</p>

            <h2>2-Adic quantum mechanics, continuous-time quantum walks, and the space discreteness</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> W. A. Zúñiga-Galindo</p>
            <p>We show that a large class of 2-adic Schrödinger equations is the scaling limit of certain continuous-time quantum Markov chains (CTQMCs). Practically, a discretization of such an equation gives a CTQMC. As a practical result, we construct new types of continuous time quantum walks (CTQWs) on graphs using two symmetric matrices. One matrix describes the transport between nodes in one direction, while the second describes the transport between nodes in the opposite direction. This construction includes, as a particular case, the CTQWs constructed using adjacency matrices. The final goal of this work is to contribute to the understanding of the foundations of quantum mechanics (QM) and the role of the hypothesis of the discreteness of space. The connection between 2-adic QM and CTQWs shows that 2-adic QM has a physical meaning. 2-Adic QM is a nonlocal theory because the Hamiltonians used are nonlocal operators, and consequently, spooky actions at a distance are allowed. However, this theory is not a mathematical toy. The experimental confirmation of the violation of Bell's inequality implies that this theory allows realism. We pointed out several new research problems connected with the foundations of quantum mechanics.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Measurement Without Collapse or Many Worlds: The Branched Hilbert Subspace Interpretation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xing M. Wang</p>
            <p>We propose the Branched Hilbert Subspace Interpretation (BHSI) as an alternative perspective on quantum measurement. BHSI describes measurement as a unitary branching of the local Hilbert space into decoherent, independent, and unitarily evolving subspaces, while updating observer states (through their equipment) by causally engaging and disengaging operators. Unlike the Copenhagen Interpretation (CI), BHSI avoids wave function collapse while maintaining the Born rule through the branch weights associated with the initial system state. Unlike the Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI), BHSI sidesteps parallel worlds by entangling branches with the local environment within a single world. We compare BHSI features with those of CI, MWI, and Bohmian Mechanics (BM). We investigate its implications for the double-slit experiment, Bell tests, Wigner and his friend, black hole radiation, and the delayed-choice quantum eraser. We examine quantum teleportation, demonstrating that locally controlled decoherence and recoherence processes (CDRP) can be observed. Specifically, we suggest experiments using modern Stern-Gerlach interferometers (SGI) to visualize the CDRP, measure branch weights that encode the Born rule, and predict the electromagnetic (EM) phase shift resulting from the independent unitary evolution of decoherent branches. BHSI thus provides a minimalist alternative to interpretations based on collapse or many-worlds.</p>

            <h2>Large speed-up of quantum emitter detection via quantum interference</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Warwick P. Bowen</p>
            <p>Quantum emitters are a key resource in quantum technologies, microscopy, and other applications. The ability to rapidly detect them is useful both for quality control in engineered emitter arrays and for high-contrast imaging of naturally occurring emitters. Using full photon-counting statistics and optimal Bayesian hypothesis testing, we show that extended Hong-Ou-Mandel interference between quantum emission and a coherent field enables orders-of-magnitude speed-ups in emitter detection under realistic noise and loss. Strikingly, the performance advantage improves as loss and background noise increase, and persists for incoherent emission. Taken together with prior demonstrations of extended Hong-Ou-Mandel interference, this suggest that substantial performance gains are achievable with current technology under realistic, non-ideal conditions. This offers a new approach to fast, low-intensity imaging and for emitter characterization in large-scale quantum systems. Fundamentally, the discovery that quantum interference and measurements, used together, are more robust to both loss and noise than standard measurement techniques opens the possibility of broad applications across quantum metrology.</p>

Our findings show that delocalized probes generally outperform localized ones, with the precision enhancement scaling quadratically with the separation between the two wavefunction components. This advantage persists under realistic position measurements, which can achieve precision not too far from the ultimate bound. We also discuss the influence of Earth's surface, demonstrating that its effect can be neglected until shortly before the particle hits the floor. Finally, we address the joint estimation of the gravitational acceleration $g$ and the probe mass $m$, proving that the excess estimation noise arising from their inherent incompatibility is negligible.</p>

A sub-millimeter permanent magnet is levitated in a superconducting trap with a measured force sensitivity of $0.2\,\mathrm{fN/\sqrt{Hz}}$.

Our most stringent limit on the coupling strength is $g_{B - L} \lesssim 2.98 \times 10^{-21}$. We propose the POLONAISE (Probing Oscillations using Levitated Objects for Novel Accelerometry in Searches of Exotic physics) experiment, featuring short-, medium-, and long-term upgrades that will give us leading sensitivity in a wide mass range and demonstrating the promise of this novel quantum sensing technology in the hunt for dark matter.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dipendu Halder, Saurabh Basu</p>
            <p>Anderson localization and the non-Hermitian skin effect are two distinct confinement phenomena of the eigenfunctions that are driven, respectively, by disorder and nonreciprocity. Understanding their interplay within a unified framework offers valuable insights into the localization properties of low-dimensional systems. To this end, we investigate a non-Hermitian version of the celebrated Aubry-André model, which serves as an ideal platform due to its unique self-dual properties and ability to demonstrate a delocalization-localization transition in one dimension. Interestingly, in our setting, the competition between Anderson localization and the skin effect can be precisely controlled via the complex phase of the quasiperiodic disorder. Additionally, by analyzing the time evolution, we demonstrate that quantum jumps between the skin states and the Anderson-localized states occur in the theoretical model. Further, to gain support for our theoretical predictions in an experimental platform, we propose a topolectrical circuit featuring an interface that separates two distinct electrical circuit networks. The voltage profile of the circuit exhibits confinement at the interface, analogous to the skin effect, while the phenomenon of Anderson localization in the circuit can be perceived via a predicted localization behavior near the excitation node, rather than exhibiting sudden non-Hermitian jumps, as observed in the tight-binding framework. This interplay leads to a spatially tunable localization of the output voltage of the circuit. Our findings provide deeper insights into the controlled confinement of the eigenstates of the non-Hermitian Aubry-André model by designing analogous features in topolectrical circuits, opening avenues in the fabrication of advanced electronic systems such as highly sensitive sensors and efficient devices for information transfer and communication.</p>

This is motivated by the desire to identify lattices for quantum simulations that involve only 3-link vertices among the gauge field group spaces in order to reduce the complexity in applications of the plaquette operator. For the honeycomb lattice, we derive a classically ${\cal O}(b^2)$-improved Hamiltonian, with $b$ being the lattice spacing. Tadpole improvement via the mean-field value of the plaquette operator is used to provide the corresponding quantum improvements. We have identified the (non-chiral) hyperhoneycomb as a candidate spatial tessellation for 3+1D quantum simulations of gauge theories, and determined the associated ${\cal O}(b)$-improved Hamiltonian.</p>

            <p>Femtosecond laser-writing offers distinct capabilities for fabrication, including three-dimensional, multi-material, and sub-diffraction-limited patterning. In particular, demonstrations of laser-written quantum emitters and photonic devices with superior optical properties have attracted attention. Recently, gallium nitride (GaN) has been reported to host quantum emitters with narrow and bright zero-phonon photoluminescence from ultraviolet to telecom ranges. However, emitters formed during epitaxy are randomly positioned, and until now, it has not been possible to fabricate quantum emitters in ordered arrays. In this paper, we employ femtosecond laser writing to create nano-ablations with sub-diffraction-limited diameter, and use rapid thermal annealing to activate co-located stable emitters. The emitters show MHz antibunched emission with a sharp spectral peak at room temperature. Our study not only presents an efficient approach to laser-written nanofabrication on GaN but also offers a promising pathway for the deterministic creation of quantum emitters in GaN, shedding light on the underlying mechanisms involved.</p>

This review establishes metamaterials, artificial structures with on-demand electromagnetic properties, as a transformative solution.

We survey state-of-the-art performance, highlighting record coherence times and coupling strengths achieved through metamaterial design. Furthermore, we explore advanced applications where engineered environments give rise to exotic excitations and topologically protected states, enabling novel error correction schemes and qubit architectures. Ultimately, we argue that metamaterials are evolving from passive components into the core architectural element of next-generation quantum technologies, paving a viable path toward scalable quantum computation.</p>

This contrasts sharply with the two-qubit case, where the induced coupling significantly influences the entanglement dynamics. Furthermore, we explore two promising approaches to enhance the tripartite entanglement by steering the system towards the dark state: post-selection and coherent driving.

Indefinite causal order provides a resource for quantum information processing, and can be in principle be detected by the violation of certain inequalities on the correlations between measurement outcomes observed in the laboratory, in a similar way as quantum nonlocality can be detected by the violation of Bell inequalities. Here we report the experimental violation of a Bell-like inequality for causal order using a photonic setup where the order of two optical processes is controlled by a single photon of a polarization-entangled photon pair. Our proof-of-principle demonstration overcomes major technical challenges, including the need of high-speed quantum operations in photonic time-bin encoding, nanosecond synchronization of active optical and electronic elements to meet the target required for spacelike separation, and active temperature stabilization of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer to ensure statistically significant violations. These experimental advances enable a statistically significant violation of the causal inequality, and open up a path towards a device-independent certification of indefinite order of events with uncharacterized quantum devices.</p>

However, to harness the full potential of the photonics platform, several engineering feats need to be accomplished, among those is the quest for a scalable source of pure single photons. While single photon sources can be implemented in a variety of different ways, integrated lithium niobate stands out as a prime contender for a monolithic quantum photonics platform, given its second-order nonlinearity and proven classical scalability. Despite the extensive effort put into developing the platform, integrating suitable photon pair sources remains a hurdle limiting the scalability of quantum photonic systems in lithium niobate. We engineer three-wave-mixing in a nanophotonic lithium niobate device, integrating multiple near-perfect spectrally separable heralded single photon sources. By mixing photons generated via the developed sources, we show bosonic interference between indistinguishable photons, a crucial interaction for many photonic quantum computing protocols. This demonstration of the first proof-of-principle multi-source interference in integrated lithium niobate contributes to developing a truly scalable quantum photonics platform.</p>

            <p>Quantum metrology promises measurement precision beyond the classical limit by using suitably tailored quantum states and detection strategies. However, scaling up this advantage is experimentally challenging, due to the difficulty of generating high-quality large-scale probes. Here, we build a photonic setup that achieves enhanced precision scaling by manipulating the probe's dynamics through operations performed in a coherently controlled order. Our setup applies an unknown rotation and a known orbital angular momentum increase in a coherently controlled order, in a way that reproduces a hybrid quantum SWITCH involving gates generated by both discrete and continuous variables. The unknown rotation angle $\theta$ is measured with precision scaling as $1/4ml$ when a photon undergoes a rotation of $2m\theta$ and an angular momentum shift of $2l \hbar$. With a practical enhancement factor as high as 2317, the ultimate precision in our experiment is $0.0105^{\prime \prime}$ when using $7.16\times10^7$ photons, corresponding to a normalized precision of $\approx 10^{-4}$rad per photon. No photon interaction occurs in our experiment, and the precision enhancement consumes only a linearly increasing amount of physical resources while achieving a nonlinear scaling of the precision. We further indicate that this nonlinear enhancement roots in an in-depth exploration of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle (HUP), and our findings not only deepen the understanding of the HUP but also pave a pathway for advancements in quantum metrology.</p>

            <p>Motivated by recent advances in digital quantum simulation and the overall prospective of solving correlated many-electron problems using quantum algorithms, we design a gate-based quantum circuit that emulates the dynamics of the Kondo impurity model. We numerically determine the impurity magnetization, entanglement between impurity and fermionic sites and energy as a function of time (i.e.~circuit depth) for various initial states and find universal long-time dynamics. We complement the numerical simulations for moderate system size with an asymptotically exact analytical solution that is effective in the limit of large system sizes and for starting states corresponding to a filled Fermi sea. This work opens up the perspective of studying the dynamics of electronic quantum many-body states on quantum chips of the NISQ era.</p>

            <h2>Universal framework with exponential speedup for the quantum simulation of quantum field theories including QCD</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jad C. Halimeh, Masanori Hanada, Shunji Matsuura</p>
            <p>We present a quantum simulation framework universally applicable to a wide class of quantum systems, including quantum field theories such as quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Specifically, we generalize an efficient quantum simulation protocol developed for bosonic theories in [Halimeh et al., arXiv:2411.13161] which, when applied to Yang-Mills theory, demonstrated an exponential resource advantage with respect to the truncation level of the bosonic modes, to systems with both bosons and fermions using the Jordan-Wigner transform and also the Verstraete-Cirac transform. We apply this framework to QCD using the orbifold lattice formulation and achieve an exponential speedup compared to previous proposals. As a by-product, exponential speedup is achieved in the quantum simulation of the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian, the latter being a special limit of the orbifold lattice Hamiltonian. In the case of Hamiltonian time evolution of a theory on an $L^d$ spatial lattice via Trotterization, one Trotter step can be realized using $\mathcal{O}(L^d)$ numbers of CNOT gates, Hadamard gates, phase gates, and one-qubit rotations. We show this analytically for any matter content and $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ gauge group with any $N$. Even when we use the Jordan-Wigner transform, we can utilize the cancellation of quantum gates to significantly simplify the quantum circuit. We also discuss a block encoding of the Hamiltonian as a linear combination of unitaries using the Verstraete-Cirac transform. Our protocols do not assume oracles, but rather present explicit constructions with rigorous resource estimations without a hidden cost, and are thus readily implementable on a quantum computer.</p>

            <h2>Nonstabilizerness and Error Resilience in Noisy Quantum Circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fabian Ballar Trigueros, José Antonio Marín Guzmán</p>
            <p>We investigate how noise impacts nonstabilizerness - a key resource for quantum advantage - in many-body qubit systems. While noise typically degrades quantum resources, we show that amplitude damping, a nonunital channel, can generate or enhance magic, whereas depolarizing noise provably cannot. In an encoding-decoding protocol, we find that, unlike in the coherent case, a sharp decoding fidelity transition does not match a transition in nonstabilizerness. Our results point toward the possibility of leveraging, rather than merely mitigating, noise for quantum information processing.</p>

            <h2>Transversal Surface-Code Game Powered by Neutral Atoms</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shinichi Sunami, Akihisa Goban, Hayata Yamasaki</p>
            <p>Neutral atom technologies have opened the door to novel theoretical advances in surface-code protocols for fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC), offering a compelling alternative to lattice surgery by leveraging transversal gates. However, a crucial gap remains between the theory of FTQC and its practical realization on neutral atom systems; most critically, a key theoretical requirement -- that syndrome extraction must be performed frequently enough to keep error accumulation below a threshold constant -- is difficult to satisfy in a scalable manner in conventional zoned approach. In this work, we develop a comprehensive theoretical framework that closes such a gap, bridging theoretical advances in surface-code fault-tolerant protocols with capabilities of neutral atoms. Building on the "game of surface code" framework originally developed for superconducting qubits, we introduce an alternative game-based paradigm for transversal-gate FTQC that harnesses the unique strengths of neutral atom arrays. The game rules are designed to enable syndrome extraction at any intermediate step during logical gate implementation, ensuring compatibility with the threshold theorem. We further present an efficient method for designing resource state factories tailored to transversal-gate FTQC. As an application, our framework offers a systematic methodology and high-level abstraction for resource estimation and optimization, demonstrating that space-time performance competitive with a baseline lattice-surgery-based approach on superconducting qubits is possible, even when physical operations on neutral atoms are orders of magnitude slower. These results establish a solid foundation that bridges the theory and experiment of FTQC powered by neutral atoms, charting a well-founded pathway toward scalable, fault-tolerant quantum computers and setting practical directions for technological development.</p>

            <h2>Fundamental Scaling Limit in Critical Quantum Metrology</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ju-Yeon Gyhm, Hyukjoon Kwon, Myung-Joong Hwang</p>
            <p>Critical quantum metrology aims to harness critical properties near quantum phase transitions to enhance parameter estimation precision. However, critical slowing down inherently limits the achievable precision within a finite evolution time. To address this challenge, we establish a fundamental scaling limit of critical quantum metrology with respect to the total evolution time. We find that the winding number of the system's phase space trajectory determines the scaling bound of quantum Fisher information. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the exponential scaling of the quantum Fisher information can be obtained, and for this, it is necessary to increase the winding number by the total evolution time. We explicitly construct a time-dependent control to achieve optimal scaling from a simple on-off scheme depending on the system's phase and discuss its topological nature. We highlight that such an exponential scaling of quantum Fisher information remains valid even without reaching the critical point and in the presence of thermal dissipation, albeit with a decreased exponent.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pietro Brighi, Alberto Biella</p>
            <p>In this work we study the dissipative quantum North-East-Center (NEC) model: a two-dimensional spin-1/2 lattice subject to chiral, kinetically constrained dissipation and coherent quantum interactions. This model combines kinetic constraints and chirality at the dissipative level, implementing local incoherent spin flips conditioned by an asymmetric majority-vote rule. Through a cluster mean-field approach, we determine the steady-state phase diagram of the NEC model under different Hamiltonians, consistently revealing the emergence of two distinct phases, bistable and normal, across all cases considered. We further investigate the stability of the steady-state with respect to inhomogeneous fluctuations in both phases, showing the emergence of instabilities at finite wavevectors in the proximity of the phase transition. Next, we study the nonergodicity of the model in the bistable phase. We characterize the dynamics of minority islands of spins surrounded by a large background of spins pointing in the opposite direction. We show that in the bistable phase, the minority islands are always reabsorbed by the surrounding at a constant velocity, irrespectively of their size. Finally, we propose and numerically benchmark an equation of motion for the reabsorption velocity of the islands where thermal and quantum fluctuations act independently at linear order.</p>

            <p>Photonic implementations of unitary processes on lattice structures, such as quantum walks, have been demonstrated across various architectures. However, few platforms offer the combined advantages of scalability, reconfigurability, and the ability to simulate dynamics on lattices with periodic boundary conditions, such as cyclic or toroidal geometries. Here, we employ a recently developed platform that enables the implementation of arbitrary translationally invariant unitary operations on one- and two-dimensional lattices, and demonstrate a natural mechanism for introducing periodic boundary conditions. Our approach leverages direct access to the reciprocal lattice, where discrete sampling of the unitary evolution effectively enforces the desired topology. We program our platform to realize quantum walks on 1D cyclic lattices and 2D lattices with cylindrical or toroidal topologies. The lattice size can be readily tuned by adjusting the sampling density in reciprocal space. By controlling reciprocal-space occupancy, we investigate the dynamics of localized states and wavepackets, observing refocusing behavior, breathing modes modulated by reciprocal-space discretizations, and wavepacket trajectories that reflect the underlying topology. We further demonstrate a form of dimensional reduction by mapping a 2D quantum walk on a cylinder to a 1D walk with a high-dimensional coin. These results establish a versatile platform for realizing a broad class of optical mode transformations within bounded Hilbert spaces.</p>

            <p>Multi-dimensional entangled photon states represent an important resource in quantum communication networks. Specifically, hyperentangled states presenting simultaneous entanglement in several degrees of freedom (DoF), stand out for their noise resilience and information capacity. In this work, we demonstrate the generation of hyperentangled photon pairs in the time and frequency-bin domain by spontaneous four-wave mixing from the coherent driving of two integrated Silicon microresonators. We demonstrate entanglement in each DoF by proving the violation of the Clauser Horne Shimony Holt (CHSH) inequality by more than 27 standard deviations (STDs) in each reduced space. Genuine hyperentanglement is then assessed from the negativity of an hyperentanglement witness, which is verified by more than 60 STDs. These results mark, to the best of our knowledge, the first demonstration of time-frequency bin hyperentanglement in an integrated silicon photonic device.</p>

We analyze the entanglement dynamics between optical and mechanical modes, as well as quantum correlations in a mixed optomechanical bipartite system (optic-optic mode) mediated by radiation pressure. Using logarithmic negativity as a measure, we quantify the entanglement evolution in both optic-optic and mirror-mirror bipartite subsystems. Furthermore, we show how three distinct types of extractable work vary with system parameters and examine their relationship with entanglement.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maria Carolina Volpato, Kalebe B. Estevam, Marcelo I. Davanco, Pierre-Louis de Assis</p>
            <p>Horizontal slot waveguides are planar photonic structures with a guided mode which is strongly polarized in the out-of-plane direction and tightly confined in a sub-wavelength region of lower refractive index. We show through FDTD simulations that this mode can lead to coupling efficiencies $\beta>80\%$ and Purcell factors $F_P>10$ for some types of dark intralayer excitons in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers -- more aplty named ``gray excitons'', as their out-of-plane dipole does couple to adequately polarized light -- as well as interlayer excitons in TMD heterostructures. These figures indicate a path to the strong coupling regime for gray and interlayer excitons, while bright excitons are poorly coupled to the slot mode and experience Purcell suppression for $\lambda>\SI{1}{\micro\meter}$. A significant hurdle towards strong coupling, however, is the low oscillator strengths of these two excitonic species. We use the Tavis-Cummings model to show that a horizontal-slot racetrack resonator can overcome this difficulty and reach a cooperativity $C>>1$, albeit sacrificing the broadband characteristic of waveguides.</p>

            <p>We numerically study the transport of Rydberg excitations in chains of neutral atoms. We realize an effective flip-flop interaction using off-resonant driving fields. By tuning the relative distances between atoms and applying atom-selective detuning fields, we realize the perfect transport condition. This condition enables the transfer of a single Rydberg excitation from one end of the chain to the other, allowing the distribution of entanglement across the chain at the quantum speed limit. Through numerical simulations, we identify the set of control parameters that maximize the transport probability for experimentally relevant parameters. We study the various competing trade-offs involved in the hierarchy of approximations used to map the native Rydberg spin model onto the effective model driving spin transport. Our results suggest that entanglement can be distributed over chains of more than fifty atoms spanning hundreds of microns at room temperature. This study informs the selection of parameters for the experimental realization of perfect transport in Rydberg chains, providing a new approach to distribute entanglement among distant atoms in quantum processors.</p>

            <p>While ideal lattice models have been widely used to study giant-atom-lattice systems, they often neglect the disorder induced by defects during experimental fabrication. This work systematically explores the dynamics of a giant atom coupled to a disordered lattice characterized by random eigenfrequency fluctuations. By analyzing atomic excitation probabilities, photon dynamics, and energy spectra, we reveal that the system exhibits remarkable robustness when disorder is confined within a specific range. The atomic excitation probability remains stable, the lattice evolution process shows reproducibility, and the energy spectrum structure is minimally distorted. Notably, we introduce a quantitative parameter to measure non-Markovianity and demonstrate that disorder significantly influences the system's memory effects. These findings provide insights into the interplay between disorder, non-Markovianity, and photon dynamics, with potential applications in quantum information processing and the design of robust quantum devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xueying Mai, Liyun Zhang, Qinyang Yu, Junhua Zhang, Yao Lu</p>
            <p>A central challenge in developing practical quantum processors is maintaining low control complexity while scaling to large numbers of qubits. Trapped-ion systems excel in small-scale operations and support rapid qubit scaling via long-chain architectures. However, their performance in larger systems is hindered by spectral crowding in radial motional modes, a problem that forces reliance on intricate pulse-shaping techniques to maintain gate fidelities. Here, we overcome this challenge by developing a novel trapped-ion processor with an individual-addressing system that generates steerable Hermite-Gaussian beam arrays. The transverse gradient of these beams couples qubits selectively to sparse axial motional modes, enabling to isolate a single mode as entanglement mediator. Leveraging this capability, we demonstrate addressable two-qubit entangling gates in chains up to six ions with fidelities consistently around 0.97, achieved without complex pulse shaping. Our method significantly reduces control overhead while preserving scalability, providing a crucial advance toward practical large-scale trapped-ion quantum computing.</p>

            <p>The construction of entangling gates with individual addressing capability represents a crucial approach for implementing quantum computation in trapped ion crystals. Conventional entangling gate schemes typically rely on laser beam wave vectors to couple the ions' spin and motional degrees of freedom. Here, we experimentally demonstrate an alternative method that employs a polarization gradient field generated by a tightly focused laser beam, previously proposed as a Magnus-type quantum logic gate. Using this technique, we perform Raman operations on nuclear spin qubits encoded in 171Yb+ ions, generating spin-dependent forces along axial motional modes in a linear trap. By utilizing an acousto-optic deflector to create arbitrary spot pairs for individual ion addressing in two-ion (four-ion) chains, we achieve MS gates with fidelities exceeding 98.5% (97.2%). Further improvements in numerical aperture and laser power could reduce gate durations while enhancing fidelity. This method is compatible with, and can significantly simplify, optical tweezer gate proposals, where motional mode engineering enables scalable trapped-ion quantum computation. The technique can be extended to two-dimensional ion crystals, representing a key step toward large-scale trapped-ion quantum processors.</p>

            <p>High-efficiency single-photon detection in the microwave domain is a key enabling technology for quantum sensing, communication, and information processing. However, the extremely low energy of microwave photons (~{\mu}eV) presents a fundamental challenge, preventing direct photon-to-charge conversion as achieved in optical systems using semiconductors. Semiconductor quantum dot (QD) charge qubits offer a compelling solution due to their highly tunable energy levels in the microwave regime, enabling coherent coupling with single photons. In this work, we demonstrate microwave photon detection with an efficiency approaching 70% in the single-photon regime. We use a hybrid system comprising a double quantum dot (DQD) charge qubit electrostatically defined in a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure, coupled to a high-impedance Josephson junction (JJ) array cavity. We systematically optimize the hybrid device architecture to maximize the conversion efficiency, leveraging the strong charge-photon coupling and the tunable DQD tunnel coupling rates. Incoming cavity photons coherently excite the DQD qubit, which in turn generates a measurable electrical current, realizing deterministic photon-to-charge conversion. Moreover, by exploiting the independent tunability of both the DQD transition energy and the cavity resonance frequency, we characterize the system efficiency over a range of 3-5.2 GHz. Our results establish semiconductor-based cavity-QED architectures as a scalable and versatile platform for efficient microwave photon detection, opening new avenues for quantum microwave optics and hybrid quantum information technologies.</p>

            <p>The recurrence time is the time a process first returns to its initial state. Using quantum walks on a graph, the recurrence time is defined through stroboscopic monitoring of the arrival of the particle to a node of the system. When the time interval between repeated measurements is tuned in such a way that eigenvalues of the unitary become degenerate, the mean recurrence time exhibits resonances. These resonances imply faster mean recurrence times, which were recorded on quantum computers. The resonance broadening is captured by a restart uncertainty relation [R. Yin, Q. Wang, S. Tornow, E. Barkai, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 122, e2402912121 (2025)]. To ensure a comprehensive analysis, we extend our investigation to include the impact of system size on the widened resonances, showing how the connectivity and energy spectrum structure of a system influence the restart uncertainty relation. Breaking the symmetry of the system, for example time-reversal symmetry breaking with a magnetic flux applied to a ring, removes the degeneracy of {the eigenvalues of the unitary}, hence modifying {the mean recurrence time and the widening of the transitions}, and this effect is studied in detail. The width of resonances studied here is related to the finite time resolution of relevant experiments on quantum computers, and to the restart paradigm.19</p>

            <p>Any quantum computation consists of a sequence of unitary evolutions described by a finite set of Hamiltonians. When this set is taken to consist of only products of Pauli operators, we show that the minimal such set generating $\mathfrak{su}(2^{N})$ contains $2N+1$ elements. We provide a number of examples of such generating sets and furthermore provide an algorithm for producing a sequence of rotations corresponding to any given Pauli rotation, which is shown to have optimal complexity. We also observe that certain sets generate $\mathfrak{su}(2^{N})$ at a faster rate than others, and we show how this rate can be optimized by tuning the fraction of anticommuting pairs of generators. Finally, we briefly comment on implications for measurement-based and trapped ion quantum computation as well as the construction of fault-tolerant gate sets.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuxuan Zheng, Xinfang Nie, Hongfeng Liu, Yutong Luo, Dawei Lu, Xiangjing Liu</p>
            <p>The quantum no-broadcasting theorem states that it is fundamentally impossible to perfectly replicate an arbitrary quantum state, even if correlations between the copies are allowed. While quantum broadcasting cannot occur through any physical process, it can be achieved via postprocessing of experimental data using a process called virtual quantum broadcasting (VQB). In this work, we report the experimental implementation of a quantum circuit based on the linear combination of unitaries, integrated with a post-processing protocol, to realize VQB in a nuclear magnetic resonance system. VQB can be expressed as a linear combination of two channels: the universal cloner, which broadcasts the target quantum state, and the universal antisymmetrizer, which reduces broadcasting error. We implement both channels within the same circuit and demonstrate that the universal cloner is the closest physical map to VQB. In addition, we show how the universal antisymmetrizer can be utilized to mitigate imperfections in the cloner, enabling near-ideal fidelity. Our method is applicable to broadcasting quantum systems of any dimension.</p>

            <h2>Thermalization and irreversibility of an isolated quantum system</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xue-Yi Guo</p>
            <p>The irreversibility and thermalization of many-body systems can be attributed to the erasure of spread non-equilibrium state information by local operations. This thermalization mechanism can be demonstrated by the sequence $[\hat{O}^\dagger \hat{O}(t)]^N$, where $\hat{O}$ is a local operator, $\hat{O}(t) = e^{i\hat{H}t} \hat{O} e^{-i\hat{H}t}$, $\hat{H}$ is the system Hamiltonian, and $N$ denotes the number of repetitions. We begin by preparing a non-equilibrium initial state with an inhomogeneous particle number distribution in a one-dimensional Hubbard model. As particles propagate and interact within the lattice, the system evolves into a highly entangled quantum state, where the entanglement entropy satisfies a volume law, yet the information of the initial state remains well preserved. The local operator $\hat{O}$ erases part of the information in the entangled state, altering the interference of the system wavefunction and the disentangling process during time-reversed evolution. Repeatedly applying $\hat{O}^\dagger \hat{O}(t)$ leads to a monotonic increase in the entanglement entropy until it saturates at a steady value. By incorporating this information erasure mechanism into the one-dimensional Hubbard model, our numerical simulations demonstrate that in a completely isolated system, a thermalization process emerges. Finally, we discuss the feasibility of implementing related quantum simulation experiments on superconducting quantum processors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Juhi Singh, Jan A. P. Reuter, Tommaso Calarco, Felix Motzoi, Robert Zeier</p>
            <p>Ultracold atoms trapped in optical lattices have emerged as a scalable and promising platform for quantum simulation and computation. However, gate speeds remain a significant limitation for practical applications. In this work, we employ quantum optimal control to design fast, collision-based two-qubit gates within a superlattice based on a Fermi-Hubbard description, reaching errors in the range of $10^{-3}$ for realistic parameters. Numerically optimizing the lattice depths and the scattering length, we effectively manipulate hopping and interaction strengths intrinsic to the Fermi-Hubbard model. Our results provide five times shorter gate durations by allowing for higher energy bands in the optimization, suggesting that standard modeling with a two-band Fermi-Hubbard model is insufficient for describing the dynamics of fast gates and we find that four to six bands are required. Additionally, we achieve non-adiabatic gates by employing time-dependent lattice depths rather than using only fixed depths. The optimized control pulses not only maintain high efficacy in the presence of laser intensity and phase noise but also result in negligible inter-well couplings.</p>

            <p>We elucidate the requirements for quantum operations that achieve environment-assisted invariance (envariance), a symmetry of entanglement. While envariance has traditionally been studied within the framework of local unitary operations, we extend the analysis to consider non-unitary local operations. First, we investigate the conditions imposed on operators acting on pure bipartite entanglement to attain envariance. We show that the local operations must take a direct-sum form in their Kraus operator representations, establishing decoherence-free subspaces. Furthermore, we prove that this also holds for the multipartite scenario. As an immediate consequence, we demonstrate that environment-assisted shortcuts to adiabaticity cannot be achieved through non-unitary operations. In addition, we show that the static condition of the eternal black hole in AdS/CFT is violated when the CFTs are coupled to the external baths.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Igor Ermakov</p>
            <p>We study operator growth in many-body systems with on-site spins larger than $1/2$, considering both non-integrable and integrable regimes. Specifically, we compute Lanczos coefficients in the one- and two-dimensional Ising models for spin values $S=1/2$, $1$, and $3/2$, and observe asymptotically linear growth $b_n \sim n$. On the integrable side, we investigate the Potts model and find square-root growth $b_n \sim \sqrt{n}$. Both results are consistent with the predictions of the Universal Operator Growth Hypothesis. To analyze operator dynamics in this setting, we employ a generalized operator basis constructed from tensor products of shift and clock operators, extending the concept of Pauli strings to higher local dimensions. We further report that the recently introduced formalism of equivalence classes of Pauli strings can be naturally extended to this setting. This formalism enables the study of simulable Heisenberg dynamics by identifying dynamically isolated operator subspaces of moderate dimensionality. As an example, we introduce the Kitaev-Potts model with spin-$1$, where the identification of such a subspace allows for exact time evolution at a computational cost lower than that of exact diagonalization.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Roman Schnabel</p>
            <p>The amazing quantum effect of `entanglement' was discovered in the 1935 thought experiment by Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen (`EPR'). The ensuing research opened up fundamental questions and led to experiments that proved that quantum theory cannot be completed by local hidden variables. Remarkably, EPR did not discuss how to create the entanglement in their thought experiment. Here I add this part. What is required in the original EPR thought experiment is a simple elastic particle collision, an unbalanced mass ratio of e.g. 1:3 and initial states that are position and momentum squeezed, respectively. In the limiting case of infinite squeeze factors, the measurement of the position or momentum of one particle allows an absolutely precise conclusion to be drawn about the value of the same quantity of the other particle. The EPR idea has never been tested in this way. I outline a way to do this.</p>

            <p>We consider the implementation of a unitary gate on a qubit system S via a global energy-preserving operation acting on S and an auxiliary system B that can be seen as a battery. We derive a simple, asymptotically exact expression for the implementation error as a function of the battery state, which we refer to as the it Unitary Defect. Remarkably, this quantity is independent of the specific gate being implemented, highlighting a universal property of the battery itself. We show that minimizing the unitary defect, under given physical constraints on the battery state, is mathematically equivalent to solving a Lagrangian optimization problem, often corresponding to finding the ground state of a one-dimensional quantum system. Using this mapping, we identify optimal battery states that achieve the highest precision under constraints on energy, squared energy, number of levels and Quantum Fisher Information. Overall, our results provide an efficient method for establishing bounds on the physical requirements needed to implement a unitary gate via energy-preserving operations and for determining the corresponding optimal protocols.</p>

            <p>We investigate the impact of coherent control errors on quantum state evolution by deriving a general norm inequality based on Gronwall's lemma. This inequality provides an explicit upper bound on the deviation between an ideal quantum state and one subject to arbitrary coherent perturbations, including both time-dependent and time-independent cases. The framework is broadly applicable, requiring no assumptions about the detailed structure of the perturbation and full dynamics of the quantum system. We apply this approach to analyze the robustness of Grover's search algorithm in the presence of coherent errors. Our results characterizes quantitative scaling relations between the error strength, algorithm runtime, and success probability, offering practical guidelines for the design of resilient quantum protocols. We further compare the effects of time-dependent and time-independent perturbations, showing the distinctive ways in which coherent errors accumulate in quantum dynamics.</p>

Notably, QDM measurements agree well with conventional electrical probing measurements, and enable current sensing in internal circuit paths inaccessible via conventional methods. Our results highlight QDM's capability as a noninvasive diagnostic tool for the characterization of emerging semiconductor technologies, especially oxide-based TFTs.

            <p>Control of optical properties of materials by tuning their refractive index can revolutionize the current state-of-the-art technology to manipulate light propagation in the high loss media. Here we demonstrate active optical tuning of the plasmonic analog of \textit{enhancement of index of refraction} (EIR) in both linear and nonlinear regimes using a quantum mechanical approach. By employing a pump-probe scheme, we investigate the tuning of refractive index of the probe field by varying amplitude and phase of the pump source. In contrast to classical approach used in \cite{Panahpour2019}, we formulate both first- and second-order quantization to analyze nonlinear enhancement in the refractive index by modulating the response function of probe field. This approach enables indirect tuning of nonlinear modes and coherent control of the probe pulse under the coupling of linear plasmonic modes supported by two L-shaped nano-ellipsoids. Varying the pump amplitude not only shows a significant enhancement in the EIR in both regimes but also effectively suppresses optical losses with zero dispersion at the system's resonance frequency. Additionally, tuning pump phase induces a spectral shift in the frequency of the probe field which open new ways for active tuning of epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) materials. Our approach offers all-optical tuning of nonlinear refractive index which is essential for quantum technological applications. It also provides coherent control of optical properties of plasmonic nanostructures with applications in loss-compensated propagation and zero-index to high-refractive-index plasmonic metamaterials, as well as photonic switches.</p>

Atom gravity gradiometers (AGGs) could be among the most accurate mobile gravity gradiometers but are currently constrained by the trade-off between portability and sensitivity.

In the laboratory, it achieves a sensitivity of 77 E/$\sqrt{Hz}$ (1 E=1$\times10^{-9}$/s$^2$) and a long-term stability of better than 0.5 E. We integrated the instrument in a minivan, enabling efficient mobile field surveys with excellent maneuverability in confined spaces. Using this vehicular system, we surveyed the gravitational field over a set of subsurface structures within a small wooded area, successfully resolving their structural signatures with a signal-to-noise ratio of 57 and quantifying the water depth in a reservoir with an accuracy of $\pm$0.23 m. Compared with previous observations using a CG-5 gravimeter, the superior spatial resolution inherent in gradiometry is clearly demonstrated.

            <p>Single-photon wave packets are utilized as quantum information carriers within quantum information science and quantum communication applications. Here, we analyze the time-dependent interaction of a two-level atom with a spectrally encoded single-photon wave packet and obtain the excitation probability of the atom based on the Heisenberg-Langevin equations. Our results show that the spectral encoding process causes the single-photon wave packet to spread in the time domain, and the intensity of the wave packet decreases. Therefore, an encoded single-photon wave packet excites a two-level atom much weaker than an uncoded one. These results are crucial for understanding how encoded quantum light interacts with quantum nodes in realistic quantum networks. In particular, they reveal limitations and trade-offs in using spectrally encoded photons for secure, multiplexed quantum communication. The findings offer insights into optimizing encoding strategies for efficient atom-photon interactions and contribute to the development of scalable and secure quantum networking protocols.</p>

            <p>Recent research in 2-dimensional (2D) topological matter has generalized the notion of edge states from chiral to antichiral configurations with the same propagating direction at parallel edges, revealing a rich variety of robust transport phenomena. Here, we propose that antichiral hinge states can emerge in a 3D higher-order topological insulator/semimetal, where two surface/bulk Dirac points are connected by the hinge states. The band dispersion can be controlled and tilted independently for each hinge using properly designed tunnelings, resulting in tunable antichiral hinge states with programmable propagation direction and velocity. Moreover, we propose experimental realization schemes based on a 1D coupled cavity array with additional synthetic dimensions represented by the photonic orbital angular momentum and frequency. We innovatively introduce both longitudinal and transversal electro-optic modulators to generate the desired tunable tunnelings along the synthetic dimensions, which significantly reduce the experimental complexity by eliminating the need for beam splittings and auxiliary cavities. The tunable antichiral hinge states are confirmed by the photonic transmission spectra.

            <p>Fock-state lattice (FSL) offers a powerful quantum simulator for topological phenomena due to the unbounded scalability and ease of implementation. Nevertheless, the unique topological properties induced by its site-dependent coupling have remained elusive, mainly due to the challenge of handling an infinite state space without translational symmetry. Here, we rigorously analyze the topological features of a semi-infinite FSL-based Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, in both Hermitian and non-Hermitian realms, by mapping it to the solvable Jaynes-Cummings (JC) model via a unitary displacement transformation. We find a more stable topological zero mode than the conventional SSH model, originating from the bound state at the inherent domain wall under anisotropic conditions. With gain and loss introduced, we predict a non-Hermitian bound effect (NHBE), i. e., any state overlapping with the bound state will quickly stabilize to the domain wall, with the minimal stabilization time occurring in the vicinity of exceptional point (EP). The paritytime (PT ) phase transition can be observed by the oscillating-to-steady crossover of dynamics in the subspace orthogonal to the bound state. Our work takes the first step towards exploring unique topological properties in infinite anisotropic topological models based on the promising FSL simulator.</p>

            <p>Entanglement is central to quantum technologies such as cryptography, sensing, and computing. Photon pairs generated via nonlinear optical processes are excellent for preparing entangled states due to their long coherence times and compatibility with fiber optic networks. Steady progress in nanofabrication has positioned lithium niobate-on-insulator (LNOI) as a leading platform for monolithic integration of photon pair sources into optical circuits, leveraging its strong second-order nonlinearity. Here, we present a reconfigurable photonic integrated circuit on LNOI, which combines two on-chip photon pair sources with programmable interferometers, enabling generation of entangled states. The pair sources achieve a source brightness of MHz nm$^{-1}$ mW$^{-1}$ while maintaining a coincidence-to-accidental ratio above 100. We successfully interfere the two sources with $99 \pm 0.7$ % visibility, demonstrating the indistinguishability required for producing entanglement on-chip. We show preparation of any of the maximally entangled Bell states with fidelity above 90 % verified by quantum state tomography.

Additionally, we explore the emission properties of these systems under incoherent excitation of the emitters, employing a general theoretical framework for open cavity-QED systems, which is valid across all light-matter interaction regimes and preserves gauge invariance within truncated Hilbert spaces. Furthermore, we study the influence of the emitter-environment interaction on the spectral properties of the system. Specifically, when each emitter interacts independently with its own reservoir, we observe the emergence of an emission peak at the cavity's resonant frequency for even values of $N$. Our analysis also clarify the evolution of the system as the number of emitters increases, ultimately converging towards an equivalent system composed of two interacting single-mode bosonic fields.</p>

            <p>Quantum phase estimation plays a central role in quantum simulation as it enables the study of spectral properties of many-body quantum systems. Most variants of the phase estimation algorithm require the application of the global unitary evolution conditioned on the state of one or more auxiliary qubits, posing a significant challenge for current quantum devices. In this work, we present an approach to quantum phase estimation that uses only locally controlled operations, resulting in a significantly reduced circuit depth. At the heart of our approach are efficient routines to measure the complex phase of the expectation value of the time-evolution operator, the so-called Loschmidt echo, for both circuit dynamics and Hamiltonian dynamics. By tracking changes in the phase during the dynamics, the routines trade circuit depth for an increased sampling cost and classical postprocessing. Our approach does not rely on reference states and is applicable to any efficiently preparable state, regardless of its correlations. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the sample complexity and illustrate the results with numerical simulations. Our methods offer a practical pathway for measuring spectral properties in large many-body quantum systems using current quantum devices.</p>

            <p>Superconducting quantum circuits provide a versatile platform for studying quantum materials by leveraging precise microwave control and utilizing the tools of circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED). Hybrid circuit devices incorporating novel quantum materials could also lead to new qubit functionalities, such as gate tunability and noise resilience. Here, we report experimental progress towards a transmon-like qubit made with a superconductor-topological insulator-superconductor (S-TI-S) Josephson junction using exfoliated BiSbTeSe2. We present a design that enables us to systematically characterize the hybrid device, from DC transport of the S-TI-S junction, to RF spectroscopy, to full circuit QED control and measurement of the hybrid qubit. In addition, we utilize a high-quality-factor superconducting cavity to characterize material and fabrication-induced losses, thereby guiding our efforts to improve device quality.</p>

            <p>Diamond is a promising platform for quantum information processing as it can host highly coherent qubits that could allow for the construction of large quantum registers. A prerequisite for such devices is a coherent interaction between nitrogen vacancy (NV) electron spins. Entanglement between dipolar-coupled NV spin pairs has been demonstrated, but with a limited entanglement fidelity and its error sources have not been characterized. Here, we design and implement a robust, easy to implement entangling gate between NV spins in diamond and quantify the influence of multiple error sources on the gate performance. Experimentally, we demonstrate a record gate fidelity of $F=(96.0 \pm 2.5)$ % under ambient conditions. Our identification of the dominant errors paves the way towards NV-NV gates beyond the error correction threshold.</p>

            <h2>Non-Gaussian Noise Magnetometry Using Local Spin Qubits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonathan B. Curtis, Amir Yacoby, Eugene Demler</p>
            <p>Atomic scale qubits, as may be realized in nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, offer the opportunity to study magnetic field noise with nanometer scale spatial resolution. Using these spin qubits, one can learn a great deal about the magnetic-field noise correlations, and correspondingly the collective-mode spectra, in quantum materials and devices. However, to date these tools have been essentially restricted to studying Gaussian noise processes -- equivalent to linear-response. In this work we will show how to extend these techniques beyond the Gaussian regime and show how to unambiguously measure higher-order magnetic noise cumulants in a local, spatially resolved way. We unveil two protocols for doing this; the first uses a single spin-qubit and different dynamical decoupling sequences to extract non-Markovian and non-Gaussian spin-echo noise. The second protocol uses two-qubit coincidence measurements to study spatially non-local cumulants in the magnetic noise. We then demonstrate the utility of these protocols by considering a model of a bath of non-interacting two-level systems, as well as a model involving spatially correlated magnetic fluctuations near a second-order Ising phase transition. In both cases, we highlight how this technique can be used to measure in a real many-body system how fluctuation dynamics converge towards the central limit theorem as a function of effective bath size. We then conclude by discussing some promising applications and extensions of this method.</p>

            <h2>Measurement-Induced Dynamical Quantum Thermalization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marvin Lenk, Sayak Biswas, Anna Posazhennikova, Johann Kroha</p>
            <p>One of the fundamental problems of quantum statistical physics is how an ideally isolated quantum system can ever reach thermal equilibrium behavior despite the unitary time evolution of quantum-mechanical systems. Here, we study, via explicit time evolution for the generic model system of an interacting, trapped Bose gas with discrete single-particle levels, how the measurement of one or more observables subdivides the system into observed and non-observed Hilbert subspaces and the tracing over the non-measured quantum numbers defines an effective, thermodynamic bath, induces the entanglement of the observed Hilbert subspace with the bath, and leads to a bi-exponential approach of the entanglement entropy and of the measured observables to thermal equilibrium behavior as a function of time. We find this to be more generally fulfilled than in the scenario of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), namely for both local particle occupation numbers and non-local density correlation functions, and independent of the specific initial quantum state of the time evolution.</p>

            <p>In most lattice models, gap closing typically occurs at high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone. In the transverse field Ising model with cluster interaction, besides the gap closing at high-symmetry points, the gap closing at the quantum phase transition between paramagnetic and cluster phases of the model can be moved by tuning the strength of the cluster interaction. We take advantage of this property to examine the nonequilibrium dynamics of the model in the framework of dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) after a noiseless and noisy ramp of the transverse magnetic field. The numerical results show that DQPTs always happen if the starting or ending point of the quench field is restricted between two critical points. In other ways, there is always critical sweep velocity above which DQPTs disappear. Our finding reveals that noise modifies drastically the dynamical phase diagram of the model. We find that the critical sweep velocity decreases by enhancing the noise intensity and scales linearly with the square of noise intensity for weak and strong noise. Moreover, the region with multi-critical modes induced in the dynamical phase diagram by noise. The sweep velocity under which the system enters the multi-critical modes (MCMs) region increases by enhancing the noise and scales linearly with the square of noise intensity</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robert Kent, Benjamin Lienhard, Gregory Lafyatis, Daniel J. Gauthier</p>
            <p>Quantum processors require rapid and high-fidelity simultaneous measurements of many qubits. While superconducting qubits are among the leading modalities toward a useful quantum processor, their readout remains a bottleneck. Traditional approaches to processing measurement data often struggle to account for crosstalk present in frequency-multiplexed readout, the preferred method to reduce the resource overhead. Recent approaches to address this challenge use neural networks to improve the state-discrimination fidelity. However, they are computationally expensive to train and evaluate, resulting in increased latency and poor scalability as the number of qubits increases. We present an alternative machine learning approach based on next-generation reservoir computing that constructs polynomial features from the measurement signals and maps them to the corresponding qubit states. This method is highly parallelizable, avoids the costly nonlinear activation functions common in neural networks, and supports real-time training, enabling fast evaluation, adaptability, and scalability. Despite its lower computational complexity, our reservoir approach is able to maintain high qubit-state-discrimination fidelity. Relative to traditional methods, our approach achieves error reductions of up to 50% and 11% on single- and five-qubit datasets, respectively, and delivers up to 2.5x crosstalk reduction on the five-qubit dataset. Compared with recent machine-learning methods, evaluating our model requires 100x fewer multiplications for single-qubit and 2.5x fewer for five-qubit models. This work demonstrates that reservoir computing can enhance qubit-state discrimination while maintaining scalability for future quantum processors.</p>

            <h2>Fast simulations of X-ray absorption spectroscopy for battery materials on a quantum computer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stepan Fomichev, Pablo A. M. Casares, Jay Soni, Utkarsh Azad, Alexander Kunitsa, Arne-Christian Voigt, Jonathan E. Mueller, Juan Miguel Arrazola</p>
            <p>X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is a leading technique for understanding structural changes in advanced battery materials such as lithium-excess cathodes. However, extracting critical information like oxidation states from the experimental spectra requires expensive and time-consuming simulations. Building upon a recent proposal to simulate XAS using quantum computers, this work proposes a highly-optimized implementation of the time-domain algorithm for X-ray absorption. Among a host of improvements to Hamiltonian representation, circuit implementation, and measurement strategies, three optimizations are key to the efficiency of the algorithm. The first is the use of product formulas with the compressed double factorized form of the Hamiltonian. The second is recognizing that for spectroscopy applications, it is sufficient to control the error in the eigenvalues of the (approximate) Hamiltonian being implemented by the product formula, rather than the generic error on the full time evolution operator. Using perturbation theory to estimate this eigenvalue error, we find that significantly fewer Trotter steps are needed than expected from the time evolution error bound. The third is the choice of an optimized distribution of samples that takes advantage of the exponentially decaying Lorentzian kernel. Through constant factor resource estimates, we show that a challenging model Li$_4$Mn$_2$O cluster system with 18 spatial orbitals and 22 electrons in the active space can be simulated with 100 logical qubits and less than $4 \times 10^8$ T gates per circuit. Finally, the algorithm is implemented on a simulator, and the reconstructed spectrum is verified against a classical computational reference. The low cost of our algorithm makes it attractive to use on fault-tolerant quantum devices to accelerate the development and commercialization of high-capacity battery cathodes.</p>

            <p>Quantum control protocols are typically devised in the time domain, leaving their spectral behavior to emerge only a posteriori. Here, we invert this paradigm. Starting from a target frequency-domain filter, we employ the dynamical-invariant framework to derive the continuous driving fields that enact the chosen spectral response on a qubit. This approach, Quantum Invariant Filtering (QIF), maps arbitrary finite-impulse responses, including multi-band and phase-sensitive profiles, into experimentally feasible Hamiltonian modulations. Implemented on a single nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond, the method realizes the prescribed passbands with high fidelity, suppresses noise, and preserves coherence for milliseconds, two orders of magnitude longer than Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill sequences, while remaining robust to 50% drive-amplitude errors. Our results establish QIF as a broadly applicable framework for enhanced quantum control and sensing across diverse physical platforms, including superconducting qubits, trapped ions, and nuclear magnetic resonance systems.</p>

            <p>Photon triplet sources exhibit non-Gaussian features, a key property for applications in quantum computing and quantum information. However, spectral correlations can limit the performance and detection efficiency of these systems. Motivated by this, we present a theoretical analysis of the spectral correlations of photon triplets generated through spontaneous third-order parametric down-conversion in photonic devices, and discuss strategies to quantify and minimize them. We propose two strategies to minimize spectral correlations: dispersion engineering in waveguides and pump engineering in resonators. We apply these strategies in two realistic source designs, namely a high-index-contrast optical fiber taper and a silicon nitride microring resonator. Finally, we discuss detection strategies for probing non-Gaussian features of the triplet state. We find that it is feasible to achieve few-mode generation of photon triplets using state-of-the-art experimental systems, a crucial step toward practical applications of photon triplet sources in quantum technologies.</p>

In this work, we propose an efficient scheme in CA-DMRG to deal with \textit{ab initio} quantum chemistry Hamiltonians, and apply it to study several molecular systems. Our numerical results show that CA-DMRG can reach several orders of magnitude higher accuracy than DMRG using the same bond dimension, pointing out a promising route to push the boundary of solving \textit{ab initio} quantum chemistry with strong static correlations.</p>

The QRM with dominant unitary dynamics has been demonstrated in circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED) systems, but an open QRM with a strong photonic dissipation has not been experimentally explored. We here present the first experimental demonstration of such an open system in circuit QED, featuring a controlled competition between the coherent qubit-field interaction and the photonic dissipation. We map out the photon number distributions of the dissipative resonator for different coupling strengths in the steady state. We further observe the variation of the photon number during the system's evolution toward the steady state with fixed control parameters. The results demonstrate that the system's behavior is significantly modified by photonic dissipation.</p>

            <p>Quantum physics with its unique features enables parameter estimation with precisions beyond the capability of classical sensors, a phenomenon known as quantum-enhanced sensing. Quantum criticality has been identified as a resource for achieving such an enhancement. Despite immense theoretical progress in characterizing criticality-enhanced sensing, experimental implementations of such systems have been extremely challenging. This is due to the complexity of ground-state preparation and the long time required to reach the steady state near the critical points. Here we experimentally demonstrate criticality-enhanced quantum sensitivity in a non-Hermitian topological system. Our photonic quantum walk setup supports two distinct topological phase transitions at which quantum-enhanced sensitivity is observed even at the transient times, where the system has not yet reached its steady state. Indeed, our theoretical analysis shows that the detected enhancement is a direct implication of the steady-state behavior. The merit of our setup is also captured through Bayesian inference which shows excellent estimation and precision. Our experiment showcases the leveraging of quantum criticality and non-Hermitian physics for achieving quantum-enhanced sensitivity.</p>

            <p>Optical technology emerges as a highly promising platform for quantum computing, driven by its enormous potential for large-scale ultrafast computation and its integration with telecom technology. There have been intensive investigations ongoing into the development of optical quantum computers, however, they are limited to small-scale, special-purpose, or low-quality systems. Error correction for fault tolerance is still very challenging, making a full-scale fault-tolerant quantum computer a long-term goal. However, practical testbeds for quantum computers, without the difficulty in error correction, are in high demand. Here we present an innovative analog optical quantum computer utilising continuous variables. Our analog optical quantum computer is based on sequential measurements of time-domain-multiplexed large-scale two-dimensional entanglement. Accumulated Gaussian noise and spurious bias caused by the imperfection of analog computing can be suppressed through careful calibration and repeated trials without complicated error correction. Our system achieves a hundred analog inputs and operates at a clock frequency of 100 MHz with a comprehensive full-stack architecture featuring a cloud interface and a Python software development kit (SDK) for enhanced accessibility and scalability. We demonstrate the detailed characterisation of our optical quantum computer and quantum state sorting as its example application.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hana Vargová</p>
            <p>We rigorously analyze the global tripartite entanglement in a Heisenberg trimer with mixed spins-($1$,$1/2$,$1$) under varying exchange couplings between dissimilar and identical spins, magnetic fields, and temperatures. The global tripartite entanglement is quantified using the geometric mean of all three bipartite contributions, evaluated through negativity. We precisely map the regions of parameter space in which the trimer system exhibits spontaneous global entanglement. In addition, we classify the nature of the tripartite entangled states based on the distribution of reduced bipartite negativities among the spin dimers in the trimer. We further examine the thermal stability of global tripartite entanglement throughout the full parameter space. Special attention is given to the theoretical prediction of thermal robustness in a real three-spin complex, [Ni(bapa)(H$_2$0)]$_2$Cu(pba)(ClO$_4$)$_2$, where bapa stands for bis($3$-aminopropyl)amine, and pba denotes $1$,$3$-propylenebis(oxamato), which serves as an experimental realization of the mixed-spin ($1$,$1/2$,$1$) Heisenberg trimer. Notably, global entanglement in this system is predicted to persist up to approximately $100$ K and magnetic fields approaching $210$ T. Moreover, we uncover a thermally induced activation of robust global entanglement in regions where the ground state is biseparable. The magnitude of this thermal entanglement is remarkably high, nearly reaching a value of $1/2$, which has not been reported before. Finally, we propose a connection between the theoretically predicted tripartite entanglement, quantified via negativity derived from the density matrix, and the quantities measured directly or indirectly from various experiments.</p>

We first show a system composed of two spatially separated qubits, prepared in a doubly excited state (both fully excited), and provide a comprehensive study of how delayed feedback influences the collective system decay rates, as well as the quantum correlations between waveguide photons, atoms, and between atom and photons. The system is then extended to include two additional qubits located next to the initial ones (four qubits in total), and we demonstrate, by manipulating the initial excitations and the time-delay effects, how long-term quantum correlations and light-matter entangled states can be established.</p>

By treating syndrome measurements as a source of metadata, we embed verification seamlessly into standard QEC protocols and eliminate the need for separate challenge-response pairs. We validate our approach using multiple error-correcting codes, quantum states, and circuit compilation strategies on several generations of IBM quantum computers. Our classifiers achieve 99\% accuracy with only 500 shots in distinguishing among five backends.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kuchibhotla Aditi, Stephen Becker</p>
            <p>Existing quantum state tomography methods are limited in scalability due to their high computation and memory demands, making them impractical for recovery of large quantum states. In this work, we address these limitations by reformulating the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) problem using the Burer-Monteiro factorization, resulting in a non-convex but low-rank parameterization of the density matrix. We derive a fully unconstrained formulation by analytically eliminating the trace-one and positive semidefinite constraints, thereby avoiding the need for projection steps during optimization. Furthermore, we determine the Lagrange multiplier associated with the unit-trace constraint a priori, reducing computational overhead. The resulting formulation is amenable to scalable first-order optimization, and we demonstrate its tractability using limited-memory BFGS (L-BFGS). Importantly, we also propose a low-memory version of the above algorithm to fully recover certain large quantum states with Pauli-based POVM measurements. Our low-memory algorithm avoids explicitly forming any density matrix, and does not require the density matrix to have a matrix product state (MPS) or other tensor structure. For a fixed number of measurements and fixed rank, our algorithm requires just $\mathcal{O}(d \log d)$ complexity per iteration to recover a $d \times d$ density matrix. Additionally, we derive a useful error bound that can be used to give a rigorous termination criterion. We numerically demonstrate that our method is competitive with state-of-the-art algorithms for moderately sized problems, and then demonstrate that our method can solve a 20-qubit problem on a laptop in under 5 hours.</p>

To facilitate the experimental implementation, we introduce a hardware-efficient gate decomposition scheme for quantum routers, which effectively reduces the depth of the QRAM circuit by more than 30% compared to the conventional controlled-SWAP-based implementation. We further propose an error mitigation method to boost the QRAM query fidelity. With these techniques, we are able to experimentally implement the QRAM architectures with two and three layers, achieving query fidelities up to 0.800 $\pm$ 0.026 and 0.604$\pm$0.005, respectively.

The thermal noise flow between the mechanical resonators can be fully suppressed by addressing the overall loop phase in the plaquette, irrespective of their thermal temperatures. We find that optimal mechanical cooling, even down to the ground state, can be realized in this regime. The thermal noise routing, achieved by dissipation engineering at optomechanical interfaces, provides a valuable and complementary approach to conventional coherent dark-mode control theory. It can be generalized to nonreciprocal control of phonon transport and mechanical cooling, and may find applications in optomechanical networks with complex thermal environments.</p>

            <h2>Quantum prime factorization algorithms using binary carry propagation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arim Ryou, Kiwoong Kim, Kyungtaek Jun</p>
            <p>The RSA cryptosystem, which relies on the computational difficulty of prime factorization, faces growing challenges with the advancement of quantum computing. In this study, we propose a quantum annealing based approach to integer factorization using both high order unconstrained binary optimization (HUBO) and constrained quadratic model (CQM) formulations. We begin by modeling binary multiplication with explicit carry propagation, translating this into a HUBO representation and subsequently reducing it to a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization form compatible with current quantum solvers. To address scalability limitations, we implement a CQM approach with constraint relaxation and global product consistency. While the HUBO model successfully factors small semiprimes, it exhibits exponential memory growth, making it impractical for inputs larger than 10 bits. In contrast, the CQM model achieves accurate factorization of semiprimes up to 60 bits including N = 1152921423002469787 demonstrating significantly improved scalability. Experimental results further show that applying global product constraints enhances factorization accuracy and consistency across all tested instances. This work highlights both the promise and current limitations of quantum-assisted factorization and establishes a foundation for evaluating RSA security in the emerging quantum era.</p>

            <h2>Quantum versus Classical Separation in Simultaneous Number-on-Forehead Communication</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guangxu Yang, Jiapeng Zhang</p>
            <p>Quantum versus classical separation plays a central role in understanding the advantages of quantum computation. In this paper, we present the first exponential separation between quantum and bounded-error randomized communication complexity in a variant of the Number-on-Forehead (NOF) model. Namely, the three-player Simultaneous Number-on-Forehead model. Specifically, we introduce the Gadgeted Hidden Matching Problem and show that it can be solved using only $O(\log n)$ simultaneous quantum communication. In contrast, any simultaneous randomized protocol requires $\Omega(n^{1/16})$ communication. On the technical side, a key obstacle in separating quantum and classical communication in NOF models is that all known randomized NOF lower bound tools, such as the discrepancy method, typically apply to both randomized and quantum protocols. In this regard, our technique provides a new method for proving randomized lower bounds in the NOF setting and may be of independent interest beyond the separation result.</p>

            <h2>Wide band magnetometry based on color centers with transverse zero-field splitting</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiayan Ding, Lu Chen, Qiong Chen</p>
            <p>Solid-state color centers embedded in diamond, silicon carbide (SiC) and other host-matrices offer a promising platform for nanoscale quantum sensing. Sometimes a relatively strong transverse zero-field splitting (ZFS) is introduced in a color center due to its local strain and low symmetry of the host structure. While clock transitions induced by transverse zero-field splitting (ZFS) serve as a method to prolong the coherence time, the Zeeman sub-levels of solid-state color centers become insensitive to first-order magnetic field signals, thereby limiting their utility as magnetometers. In this work, we address this challenge and achieve wide band AC field detection spanning from hundreds of kHz to hundreds of MHz by utilizing a combination of orthogonal microwaves and phase modulation at different frequencies. Our control method effectively suppresses the system noise and the amplitude fluctuation of the driving field, which extends the coherence time of the quantum system.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marzio Vallero, Gioele Casagranda, Flavio Vella, Paolo Rech</p>
            <p>The quest for universal superconducting quantum computing is hindered by noise and errors. It has been proven that Quantum Error Correction (QEC) codes will lay at the foundation of fault tolerant quantum computing. However, cosmic-ray induced correlated errors, which are the most detrimental events that can impact superconducting quantum computers, are yet to be efficiently tackled. In order to reach fault tolerance, we must also develop radiation aware methods to complement QEC. In this paper, we propose the first algorithm to effectively exploit syndrome information for the efficient detection of radiation events in superconducting quantum devices at runtime. We perform a thorough analysis of simulated Rotated Surface codes injecting over 11 million physics-modeled radiation-induced faults. We consider the properties of the X and Z check bases, the impact of code distance, and the decoder's time to solution constraints. Our technique detects $100\%$ of injected faults, regardless of the impact's position. Moreover, we accurately identify both the radiation impact centre and the area affected, with an overhead lower than $0.3\%$ the decoding time. Additionally, we use the fault identification information to propose a radiation fault correction technique that improves of up to $20\%$ the output correctness compared to existing decoders.</p>

            <p>Starting from a generalization of Weyl's relations in finite dimension $N$, we show that the Heisenberg commutation relations can be satisfied in a specific $N-1$ dimensional subspace, and display a linear map for projecting operators to this subspace. This setup is used to construct a hierarchy of parameter-dependent commuting matrices in $N$ dimensions. This family of commuting matrices is then related to Type-1 matrices representing quantum integrable models. The commuting matrices find an interesting application in quantum computation, specifically in Grover's database search problem. Each member of the hierarchy serves as a candidate Hamiltonian for quantum adiabatic evolution and, in some cases, achieves higher fidelity than standard choices -- thus offering improved performance.</p>

We then show numerically how the resulting circuits can be implemented on a quantum processing unit consisting of a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond and surrounding nuclear spins.</p>

            <p>We propose a quantum authentication and digital signature protocol whose security is founded on the Quantum Merlin Arthur~(QMA)-completeness of the consistency of local density matrices. The protocol functions as a true public-key cryptography system, where the public key is a set of local density matrices generated from the private key, a global quantum state. This construction uniquely eliminates the need for trusted third parties, pre-shared secrets, or authenticated classical channels for public key distribution, making a significant departure from symmetric protocols like quantum key distribution. We provide a rigorous security analysis, proving the scheme's unforgeability against adaptive chosen-message attacks by quantum adversaries. The proof proceeds by a formal reduction, demonstrating that a successful forgery would imply an efficient quantum algorithm for the QMA-complete Consistency of Quantum Marginal Problem~(QMP). We further analyze the efficiency of verification using partial quantum state tomography, establishing the protocol's theoretical robustness and outlining a path towards practical implementation</p>

            <p>We theoretically investigate the collective emission of one and two circular arrays of two-level atoms surrounding an optical nanofiber. We show that the radiation eigenmodes of a single ring selectively couple to specific guided modes of the fiber, according to their symmetry, and study how the physical parameters of the system control their nature. In particular, we identify situations in which the emission toward radiation modes is highly suppressed with respect to fiber-guided modes while the lifetime of the atomic excitation is enhanced. We further address the case of two identical nanorings positioned at a distance from each other along the nanofiber. By contrast to free-space configurations, the rings can exchange excitations even at large separation through nanofiber guided modes resulting in enhanced sub- and super-radiance with respect to the single-ring case. Our findings suggest that the ring configuration is promising for the implementation of efficient and versatile light-matter nanofiber-based interfaces and the achievement of waveguide quantum electrodynamics.</p>

Similarly to QHP codes, the proposed codes have highly redundant sets of low-weight stabilizer generators, which improves decoding accuracy in a fault-tolerant regime and gives them single-shot properties. The advantage of the new construction is that it gives shorter codes. We derive simple expressions for the dimension of the proposed codes in two important special cases, give bounds on the distances, and explicitly construct some relatively short codes. Circuit simulations for codes locally equivalent to 4-dimensional toric codes show a (pseudo)threshold close to 1.1%, better than for toric or surface codes with a similar noise model.</p>

            <p>Despite the successful experimental generation and verification of genuine multipartite entanglement, several existing entanglement measures remain insufficient to reliably capture its presence. In this study, we overcome this challenge by utilizing a geometric measure known as concurrence fill, which quantifies genuine multipartite entanglement using the area associated with the underlying concurrence triangle. Firstly, the concurrence fill for three-qubit pure states is reformulated using three tangle and partial tangles. This yields a representation that is more tractable and operational. Using this formulation, we derive a criterion to classify GHZ and W class of states. Next, we analyse the rank-2 mixture of generalized GHZ and W class of states. Furthermore, we derive the concurrence fill for the eigenstates of the corresponding mixture and obtain an upper bound for mixed states with zero tangle.</p>

            <p>Parameterized quantum circuits represent promising architectures for machine learning applications, yet many lack clear connections to classical models, potentially limiting their ability to translate the wide success of classical neural networks to the quantum realm. We examine a specific type of quantum neural network (QNN) built exclusively from SWAP test circuits, and discuss its mathematical equivalence to a classical two-layer feedforward network with quadratic activation functions under amplitude encoding. Our analysis across classical real-world and synthetic datasets reveals that while this architecture can successfully learn many practical tasks, it exhibits fundamental expressivity limitations due to violating the universal approximation theorem, particularly failing on harder problems like the parity check function. To address this limitation, we introduce a circuit modification using generalized SWAP test circuits that effectively implements classical neural networks with product layers. This enhancement enables successful learning of parity check functions in arbitrary dimensions which we analytically argue to be impossible for the original architecture beyond two dimensions regardless of network size. Our results establish a framework for enhancing QNN expressivity through classical task analysis and demonstrate that our SWAP test-based architecture offers broad representational capacity, suggesting potential promise also for quantum learning tasks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Carla M. D. Richter, Michael Antesberger, Huan Cao, Philip Walther, Lee A. Rozema</p>
            <p>In classical physics, events follow a definite causal order: the past influences the future, but not the reverse. Quantum theory, however, permits superpositions of causal orders -- so-called indefinite causal orders -- which can provide operational advantages over classical scenarios. Verifying such phenomena has sparked significant interest, much like earlier efforts devoted to refuting local realism and confirming the quantum entanglement. To date, demonstrations of indefinite causal order have all been based a process called the quantum switch and have relied on device-dependent or semi-device-independent protocols. A recent theoretical development introduced a Bell-like inequality that allows for fully device-independent verification of indefinite causal order in a quantum switch. Here we implement this verification by experimentally violating this inequality. In particular, we measure a value of $1.8427 \pm 0.0038$, which is 24 standard deviations above the classical bound of $1.75$. Our work presents the first implementation of a device-independent protocol to verify indefinite causal order, albeit in the presence of experimental loopholes. This represents an important step towards the device-independent verification of an indefinite causal order, and provides a context in which to identify loopholes specifically related to the verification of indefinite causal order.</p>

            <p>In this work, we investigate the trade-off between the circuit depth and the number of ancillary qubits for preparing sparse quantum states. We prove that any $n$-qubit $d$-spare quantum state (i.e., it has only $d$ non-zero amplitudes) can be prepared by a quantum circuit with depth $O\left(\frac{nd \log m}{m \log m/n} + \log nd\right)$ using $m\geq 6n$ ancillary qubits, which achieves the current best trade-off between depth and ancilla number. In particular, when $m = \Theta({\frac{nd}{\log d}})$, our result recovers the optimal circuit depth $\Theta(\log nd)$ given in \hyperlink{cite.zhang2022quantum}{[Phys. Rev.

To generate the requisite entanglement, we generalize the paradigmatic two-axis countertwisting Hamiltonian -- akin to squeezing by parametric amplification -- to systems with power-law interactions, incorporating a Heisenberg coupling that aids in spreading correlations and protects the collective spin coherence. The resulting time to approach the Heisenberg limit scales sublinearly with particle number in 2D dipolar and 3D van der Waals interacting systems. Our protocol is robust to disorder and density fluctuations, and can be implemented in near-term experiments with molecules, Rydberg atoms, and solid-state spins.</p>

We systematically analyze the impact of various noise profiles on the fidelity distribution of the quantum states. The measured fidelities are compared against theoretical predictions made using the stochastic Schr{ö}dinger equation.

            <p>Majorana zero modes (MZMs) are non-Abelian quasiparticles with the potential to serve as topological qubits for fault-tolerant quantum computing due to their ability to encode quantum information nonlocally. In multi-Majorana systems configured into two separated subsystems, nontrivial quantum correlations persist, but the presence of trivial Andreev bound states (ABSs) can obscure this nonlocality if MZM preparation fails. To address this, we propose a protocol using an entanglement witness based solely on parity measurements to distinguish the nonlocal characteristics of MZM systems. Our framework, which is experimentally implementable, achieves a detection probability of approximately 18% in a 6-site system and demonstrates robustness under environmental noise, albeit with a reduced detection rate in the resence of quasiparticle contamination.</p>

            <p>The spin-boson model is a widely used model for understanding the properties of a two-level open quantum system. Accurately describing its dynamics often requires going beyond the weak system-environment coupling approximation. However, calculating the higher-order generators of such a dynamics, with a system-environment coupling that is not too weak, has been known to be challenging, both numerically and analytically. This work presents the analytical derivation of the complete fourth-order time-convolutionless (TCL) generator for a generic spin-boson model, accurate up to 4th order in the system-environment coupling parameter, under the assumption that the environmental spectral density is an odd function of frequency. In the case of a semiconductor double-quantum-dot system, our results reveal corrections to the dynamics that may become physically significant in some parameter regimes. Furthermore, we report that the widely used second-order TCL master equation tends to overestimate the non-Markovianity of a dynamics over a large parameter regime. Within the regime of its applicability, our results provide a computational advantage over numerically exact techniques. The accuracy of the fourth-order TCL generator is rigorously benchmarked against specialized analytical calculations done for the Ohmic spectral density with Drude cutoff and against the numerically exact Hierarchical Equations of Motion technique.</p>

            <p>The question of security of practical device-independent protocols against no-signalling adversaries, the ultimate form of cryptographic security, has remained open. A key ingredient is to identify how the entropy in the raw outputs of a Bell test accumulates over $n$ sequential runs (termed time-ordered no-signalling) against a no-signalling adversary. Previous numerical and analytical investigations for small $n$ ($\leq 5$) had suggested that the min-entropy might not accumulate linearly in contrast to the case of quantum adversaries. Here we point out that despite the findings for small $n$, the min-entropy does in fact accumulate linearly for large $n$. We illustrate the difference in randomness accumulation against quantum and no-signalling adversaries with the paradigmatic example of the Chained Bell test for which we analytically derive the min-entropy. Finally, we illustrate the power of the no-signalling adversary by providing a class of attacks that allow an eavesdropper to perfectly guess the outputs of one player in general bipartite Pseudotelepathy games.</p>

            <p>Semiclassical descriptions of the dynamics of a few-level system coupled to a mode of the electromagnetic field which effectively reduce the contribution of the field to a time-dependent term in the Hamiltonian of the few-level system are widely used. For example, such an approach is typically taken in quantum control applications. However, the underlying quantum character of the field will lead to corrections to the semiclassical dynamics which, given sufficient time, can lead to significant changes. Here we develop an approach for calculating these quantum corrections systematically, building on the time-dependent Floquet dynamics that emerges in the semiclassical limit. Using the Rabi model of a spin--field system as an illustrative example, we obtain approximate analytic expressions for the first-order quantum corrections to the semiclassical dynamics of the spin for a range of initial field states. These expressions describe the initial stages of the full quantum dynamics accurately, though they eventually fail for sufficiently long times. Our work has relevance both for understanding the fundamental properties of emergent semiclassical behavior and as a potential tool for assessing corrections to semiclassical control techniques.</p>

            <p>We construct rotated logical states by applying rotation operators to stabilizer states, extending the logical basis and modifying stabilizer generators. Rotation operators affect the effective code distance $d_R$, which decays exponentially with rotation angles $(\theta, \phi)$, influencing error correction performance. We quantify the scaling behavior of logical error rates under circuit-level noise, comparing standard depolarizing (SD) and superconducting-inspired (SI) noise models with small and large rotations. Our findings show that the rotated code scales as $0.68d_R (0.65d_R)$ for SD and $0.81d_R (0.77d_R)$ for SI, with small rotation angles leading to a steeper decay of logical error rates. At a physical error rate $p_{phy}$ of $10^{-4}$, logical errors decrease exponentially with $d_R$, particularly under SI noise, which exhibits stronger suppression. The threshold error rates for rotated logical states are compared with previous results, demonstrating improved resilience against noise. By extending the logical state basis, rotation-based encoding increases error suppression beyond traditional stabilizer codes, offering a promising approach to advancing quantum error correction.</p>

            <p>One of the key challenges in quantum machine learning is finding relevant machine learning tasks with a provable quantum advantage. A natural candidate for this is learning unknown Hamiltonian dynamics. Here, we tackle the supervised learning version of this problem, where we are given random examples of the inputs to the dynamics as classical data, paired with the expectation values of some observable after the time evolution, as corresponding output labels. The task is to replicate the corresponding input-output function. We prove that this task can yield provable exponential classical-quantum learning advantages under common complexity assumptions in natural settings. To design our quantum learning algorithms, we introduce a new method, which we term \textit{\subroutine}~algorithm for parametrized circuit functions, and which may be of independent interest. Furthermore, we discuss the limitations of generalizing our method to arbitrary quantum dynamics while maintaining provable guarantees. We explain that significant generalizations are impossible under certain complexity-theoretic assumptions, but nonetheless, we provide a heuristic kernel method, where we trade-off provable correctness for broader applicability.</p>

Here we give a complete characterization of the set $B_n$ of complex values that $n$-th order invariants can take, resolving some recently proposed conjectures. We show that $B_n$ is equal to the range of invariants arising from pure states described by Gram matrices of circulant form. We show that both ranges are equal to the $n$-th power of the complex unit $n$-gon, and are therefore convex, which provides a simple geometric intuition. Finally, we show that any Bargmann invariant of order $n$ is realizable using either qubit states, or circulant qutrit states.</p>

            <p>Quantum arithmetic computation requires a substantial number of scratch qubits to stay reversible. These operations necessitate qubit and gate resources equivalent to those needed for the larger of the input or output registers due to state encoding. Quantum Hamiltonian Computing (QHC) introduces a novel approach by encoding input for logic operations within a single rotating quantum gate. This innovation reduces the required qubit register $ N $ to the size of the output states $ O $, where $ N = \log_2 O $. Leveraging QHC principles, we present reversible half-adder and full-adder circuits that compress the standard Toffoli + CNOT layout [Vedral et al., PRA, 54, 11, (1996)] from three-qubit and four-qubit formats for the Quantum half-adder circuit and five sequential Fredkin gates using five qubits [Moutinho et al., PRX Energy 2, 033002 (2023)] for full-adder circuit; into a two-qubit, 4$\times $4 Hilbert space. This scheme, presented here, is optimized for classical logic evaluated on quantum hardware, which due to unitary evolution can bypass classical CMOS energy limitations to certain degree. Although we avoid superposition of input and output states in this manuscript, this remains feasible in principle. We see the best application for QHC in finding the minimal qubit and gate resources needed to evaluate any truth table, advancing FPGA capabilities using integrated quantum circuits or photonics.</p>

            <p>A key challenge in fault-tolerant quantum computing is synthesising and optimising circuits in a noisy environment, as traditional techniques often fail to account for the effect of noise on circuits. In this work, we propose a framework for designing fault-tolerant quantum circuits that are correct by construction. The framework starts with idealised specifications of fault-tolerant gadgets and refines them using provably sound basic transformations. To reason about manipulating circuits while preserving their error correction properties, we define fault equivalence; two circuits are considered fault-equivalent if all undetectable faults on one circuit have a corresponding fault on the other. This guarantees that the effect of undetectable faults on both circuits is the same. We argue that fault equivalence is a concept that is already implicitly present in the literature. Many problems, such as state preparation and syndrome extraction, can be naturally expressed as finding an implementable circuit that is fault-equivalent to an idealised specification. To utilize fault equivalence in a computationally tractable manner, we adapt the ZX calculus, a diagrammatic language for quantum computing. We restrict its rewrite system to not only preserve the underlying linear map but also fault equivalence, i.e. the circuit's behaviour under noise. Enabled by our framework, we verify, optimise and synthesise new and efficient circuits for syndrome extraction and cat state preparation. We anticipate that fault equivalence can capture and unify different approaches in fault-tolerant quantum computing, paving the way for an end-to-end circuit compilation framework.</p>

            <h2>Comparison of spin-qubit architectures for quantum error-correcting codes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mauricio Gutiérrez, Juan S. Rojas-Arias, David Obando, Chien-Yuan Chang</p>
            <p>We investigate the performance of two quantum error-correcting codes, the surface code and the Bacon-Shor code, for implementation with spin qubits in silicon. In each case, we construct a logical qubit using a planar array of quantum dots, exploring two encoding schemes: one based solely on single-electron Zeeman qubits (Loss-DiVincenzo qubits), and a hybrid approach combining Zeeman and singlet-triplet qubits. For both codes, we evaluate key performance metrics, including logical state preparation fidelity and cycle-level error correction performance, using state-of-the-art experimental parameters. Our results show that the hybrid encoding consistently outperforms the pure Zeeman-qubit implementation. By identifying the dominant error mechanisms that limit quantum error correction performance, our study highlights concrete targets for improving spin qubit hardware and provides a path toward scalable fault-tolerant architectures. In particular, we find that the logical error rate is not limited by memory errors, but rather by gate errors, especially 1- and 2-qubit gate errors.</p>

            <h2>Tighter Error Bounds for the qDRIFT Algorithm</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> I.J. David, I. Sinayskiy, F. Petruccione</p>
            <p>Randomized algorithms such as qDRIFT provide an efficient framework for quantum simulation by sampling terms from a decomposition of the system's generator. However, existing error bounds for qDRIFT scale quadratically with the norm of the generator, limiting their efficiency for large-scale closed or open quantum system simulation. In this work, we refine the qDRIFT error bound by incorporating Jensen's inequality and a careful treatment of the integral form of the error. This yields an improved scaling that significantly reduces the number of steps required to reach a fixed simulation accuracy. Our result applies to both closed and open quantum systems, and we explicitly recover the improved bound in the Hamiltonian case. To demonstrate the practical impact of this refinement, we apply it to three settings: quantum chemistry simulations, dissipative transverse field Ising models, and Hamiltonian encoding of classical data for quantum machine learning. In each case, our bound leads to a substantial reduction in gate counts, highlighting its broad utility in enhancing randomized simulation techniques.</p>

            <h2>High-precision Quantum Phase Estimation on a Trapped-ion Quantum Computer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrew Tranter, Duncan Gowland, Kentaro Yamamoto, Michelle Sze, David Muñoz Ramo</p>
            <p>Emergent quantum computing technologies are widely expected to provide novel approaches in the simulation of quantum chemistry. Despite rapid improvements in the scale and fidelity of quantum computers, high resource requirements make the execution of quantum chemistry experiments challenging. Typical experiments are limited in the number of qubits used, incur a substantial shot cost, or require complex architecture-specific optimization and error mitigation techniques. In this paper, we propose a conceptually simple benchmarking approach involving the use of multi-ancilla quantum phase estimation. Our approach is restricted to very small chemical systems, and does not scale favorably beyond molecular systems that can be described with $2$ qubits; however, this restriction allows us to generate circuits that scale quadratically in gate count with the number of qubits in the readout register. This enables the execution of quantum chemistry circuits that act on many qubits, while producing meaningful results with limited shot counts. We use this technique (with $200$ shots per experiment) to calculate the ground state energy of molecular hydrogen to $50$ bits of precision ($8.9 \times 10^{-16}$ hartree) on a $56$-qubit trapped-ion quantum computer, negating Trotter error. Including Trotter error, we obtain between $32$ and $36$ bits of precision ($1.5 * 10^{-10}$ and $6.0 * 10^{-11}$ hartree respectively), vastly exceeding chemical accuracy ($1.6 * 10^{-3}$ hartree) against Full Configuration Interaction. We consider application of the approach to deeper circuits, and discuss potential as a benchmark task for near-term quantum devices.</p>

            <h2>Positional numeral systems over polyadic rings</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Steven Duplij</p>
            <p>We construct positional numeral systems that work natively over nonderived polyadic $\left( m,n\right) $-rings whose addition takes $m$ arguments and multiplication takes $n$. In such rings, the length of an admissible additive word and a multiplicative tower are not arbitrary (as in the binary case), but "quantized". Our main contributions are the following. Existence: every commutative $\left( m,n\right) $-ring admits a base-$p$ place-value expansion that respects the word length constraint in terms of numbers of operation compositions $\ell_{mult}=\ell_{add}(m-1)+1$. Lower bound: the minimum number of digits is greater than or equal to the arity of addition $m$. Representability gap: for $m,n\geq3$ only a proper subset of ring elements possess finite expansions, characterized by congruence-class arity shape invariants $I^{(m)}$ and $J^{(n)}$. Mixed-base "polyadic clocks": allowing a different base at each position enlarges the design space quadratically in the digit count. Catalogues: explicit tables for the integer rings $\mathbb{Z}_{4,3}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_{6,5}$ illustrate how ordinary integers lift to distinct polyadic variables. These results lay the groundwork for faster arity-aware arithmetic, exotic coding schemes, and hardware that exploits operations beyond the binary pair.</p>

            <p>This work explores the implications of assuming time symmetry and applying bridge-type, time-symmetric temporal boundary conditions to deterministic laws of nature with random components. The analysis, drawing on the works of Kolmogorov and Anderson, leads to two forms of governing equations, referred to here as symmetric and antisymmetric. These equations account for the emergence of characteristics associated with conventional thermodynamics, the arrow of time, and a form of antecedent causality. The directional properties of time arise from the mathematical structure of Markov bridges, without requiring any postulates that impose a preferred direction of time.</p>

            <h2>Breakdown of the thermodynamic limit in quantum spin and dimer models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jeet Shah, Laura Shou, Jeremy Shuler, Victor Galitski</p>
            <p>The thermodynamic limit is foundational to statistical mechanics, underlying our understanding of many-body phases. It assumes that, as the system size grows infinitely at fixed density of particles, unambiguous macroscopic phases emerge that are independent of the system's boundary shape. We present explicit quantum spin and dimer Hamiltonians whose ground states violate this principle. Our construction relies on the previous mathematical work on classical dimers on the Aztec diamond and the square-octagon fortress, where geometry-dependent phase behaviors are observed in the infinite-size limit. We reverse engineer quantum spin Hamiltonians on the square and the square-octagon lattices whose ground states at the Rokhsar-Kivelson points are described by classical dimer coverings. On diamond-shaped domains, we find macroscopic boundary regions exhibiting distinct quantum phases from those on square-shaped domains. We study the nature of these phases by calculating the dimer-dimer and vison correlators and adapt Kasteleyn matrix based analytical and numerical methods for computing the vison correlator, which are significantly more efficient than standard Monte Carlo techniques. Our results show that the square-octagon lattice supports a single gapped short-range entangled phase, with exponentially decaying dimer correlators and a constant vison correlator. When the same model is considered on a diamond-shaped domain, an additional ordered phase emerges near the corners, where the dimers are in a staggered pattern.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Divij Gupta, Brian Swingle</p>
            <p>The kicked Ising model has been studied extensively as a model of quantum chaos. Bertini, Kos, and Prosen studied the system in the thermodynamic limit, finding an analytic expression for the spectral form factor, $K(t)$, at the self-dual point with periodic boundary conditions. The spectral form factor is the 2nd moment of the trace of the time evolution operator, and we study the higher moments of this random variable in the kicked Ising model. A previous study of these higher moments by Flack, Bertini, and Prosen showed that, surprisingly, the trace behaves like a real Gaussian random variable when the system has periodic boundary conditions at the self dual point. By contrast, we investigate the model with open boundary conditions at the self dual point and find that the trace of the time evolution operator behaves as a complex Gaussian random variable as expected from random matrix universality based on the circular orthogonal ensemble. This result highlights a surprisingly strong effect of boundary conditions on the statistics of the trace. We also study a generalization of the spectral form factor known as the Loschmidt spectral form factor and present results for different boundary conditions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruoxi Zhu, Zifan Zhou, Dustin Greenwood, Jason Bonacum, David D. Smith, Selim M. Shahriar</p>
            <p>Recently, it has been shown that a slow-light augmented unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer (SLAUMZI) can be used to enhance significantly the sensitivity of measuring the frequency shift of a laser, compared to the conventional technique of heterodyning with a reference laser. Here, we show that a similar enhancement can be realized using a slow-light augmented Fabry-Perot Cavity (SLAFPC), due to the fact that an FPC is inherently unbalanced, since different bounces of the field traverse different path lengths before interfering with the other bounces. We show how the degree of enhancement in sensitivity depends on the spectral width of the laser and the finesse of the FPC. We also show how the sensitivity enhancement factor (SEF) for the SLAFPC is much larger than the same for the SLAUMZI for comparable conditions and the same group index, under lossless conditions. In general, the effect of the loss caused by the medium that produces the slow-light process is more prominent for the SLAFPC than the SLAUMZI. However, if the attenuation per pass can be kept low enough while producing a high group index, using cold atoms for generating the slow-light effect, for example, then the SEF for the SLAFPC can be much higher than that for the SLAUMZI. For potentially realizable conditions, we show that an SEF of ~1.4*10^5 can be achieved using a SLAFPC.</p>

            <h2>Effects of acceleration on interatomic interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shijing Cheng, Wenting Zhou, Hongwei Yu</p>
            <p>The Unruh effect establishes a fundamental equivalence between acceleration and thermality by demonstrating that a uniformly accelerated ground-state detector undergoes excitation as if immersed in a thermal bath. In this paper, we investigate how acceleration influences the interaction between two ground-state atoms that are synchronously and uniformly accelerated in vacuum with proper acceleration $a$ and coupled to a fluctuating electromagnetic field. We find that the resulting interaction potential comprises both diagonal components $(\delta E)^{jk}$ with $j=k$, which are present in both inertial and acceleration cases, and off-diagonal components $(\delta E)^{jk}$ with $j\neq k$, which arise exclusively due to acceleration and vanish in the inertial case. The dependence of each component on acceleration and interatomic separation $L$ generally differs. For small accelerations, the leading-order diagonal components of the van der Waals (vdW) and Casimir-Polder (CP) interaction potentials remain unchanged from their inertial counterparts, exhibiting the standard scaling behaviors $\sim L^{-6}$ and $\sim L^{-7}$, respectively. In contrast, the off-diagonal components scale as $\sim a^2L^{-4}$ in the vdW subregions and $\sim a^2L^{-5}$ in the CP subregion. However, when the acceleration becomes sufficiently large, both diagonal and off-diagonal components of the vdW and CP interaction potentials are significantly modified, giving rise to entirely new interaction behaviors that deviate from those observed in the inertial case, whether in vacuum or thermal environments, indicating a breakdown of the acceleration-thermality equivalence established by the Unruh effect for single detectors.</p>

            <p>Navigation is a very crucial aspect of autonomous vehicle ecosystem which heavily relies on collecting and processing large amounts of data in various states and taking a confident and safe decision to define the next vehicle maneuver. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture based on Quantum Artificial Intelligence by enabling quantum and AI at various levels of navigation decision making and communication process in Autonomous vehicles : Quantum Neural Networks for multimodal sensor fusion, Nav-Q for Quantum reinforcement learning for navigation policy optimization and finally post-quantum cryptographic protocols for secure communication. Quantum neural networks uses quantum amplitude encoding to fuse data from various sensors like LiDAR, radar, camera, GPS and weather etc., This approach gives a unified quantum state representation between heterogeneous sensor modalities. Nav-Q module processes the fused quantum states through variational quantum circuits to learn optimal navigation policies under swift dynamic and complex conditions. Finally, post quantum cryptographic protocols are used to secure communication channels for both within vehicle communication and V2X (Vehicle to Everything) communications and thus secures the autonomous vehicle communication from both classical and quantum security threats. Thus, the proposed framework addresses fundamental challenges in autonomous vehicles navigation by providing quantum performance and future proof security.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ricardo Y. Díaz-Bonifaz, Carlos Ramírez</p>
            <p>In this work we analyze infinite graphene nanoribbons subjected to non-uniform magnetic fields that produce topological domain walls in the quantum Hall regime. We show how the proximity between edge states from neighboring domains modifies the band structure due to the state coupling near the domain walls. The proximity-induced band deformations produce phenomena such as bulk-like dispersion that coexist with Landau levels and valley-polarized current paths. It is shown that edge state coupling can be enhanced by continuously varying the magnetic field between two non-trivial topological phases. The mechanism by which neighboring edge states modify the band structure is addressed by tracking their wave-functions over isolated bands and by analyzing the magnetic confinement potential near the domain wall. By calculating the local current density, we show that the coexistence of topological edge states with bulk-like dispersion can lead to the appearance of anti-chirality, in which co-propagating currents appear in the edges while the rest of the nanoribbon is occupied with bulk states. The appearance of anti-chirality is justified by comparing the proposed non-uniform magnetic field profile with an anti-chiral modified Haldane model.</p>

The optical centrifuge is created by rapidly rotating the linear polarization of the tightly focused optical field used to form an optical trap. We show that nanorotors, formed by anisotropic nanoparticles levitated within the trap, can be accelerated to well-defined rotational rates in excess of 100 MHz over durations of hundreds of microseconds. The initial conditions required for stable acceleration, based on optical trap properties and the anisotropic susceptibility of the nanorotor are established, and confirmed by numerical simulations. We also present initial experiments that have developed tools for the rapid angular acceleration of the polarization vector of the linearly polarized beam that is required to create the centrifuge. We show that over the acceleration durations in the 100 $\upmu$s range, high rotational speeds could be achieved in modest vacuum.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adway Kumar Das</p>
            <p>$\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry is ubiquitous in quantum mechanical systems where it drives various phase transitions and emergent physics. To understand the role of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry in the thermalization of a local observable in a disordered system, we consider random symmetric centrosymmetric (SC) matrices where the exchange symmetry is conserved. Such a conservation law splits the Hilbert space into decoupled subspaces such that the energy spectrum of a SC matrix is a superposition of two pure spectra. After discussing the known results on the correlations of such mixed spectrum, we consider different initial states and analytically compute the entire time evolution of their survival probability and associated timescales. We show that there exist certain initial states which do not decay over a very long timescales such that a measure zero fraction of random SC matrices exhibit spontaneous symmetry breaking. Later, we show that thermalization is violated for a generic local observable in case of the SC matrices, where the generalized Gibbs ensemble accurately captures the equilibrium expectation values.</p>

Whereas the skin effect is known to manifest itself in quantum dynamics in the form of chiral damping, it has remained less clear what impact the boundary modes may have. Here we derive experimentally accessible signatures of the boundary modes. We also establish clear criteria, based on the effective generalized Brillouin zone, that determine when bulk and boundary effects can be dynamically discerned using the Liouvillian separation gap. This leads to telltale signatures in both stable regimes -- where particle number remains finite -- and in the unstable regimes -- where a macroscopic boundary mode population occurs.</p>

            <p>Disorder can be applied to transform conducting to insulating states by localizing individual quantum particles. The interplay between disorder and interactions in many-particle systems leads to a richer tapestry of quantum phase transitions. Here, we report the measurement in an ultracold lattice gas of a disorder-induced transition from a state with small disorder-independent compressibility to a state for which compressibility increases with disorder. At zero temperature this is the transition from a Mott insulator (MI) to a Bose glass (BG), both of which are insulating states. This transformation is observed using measurements of core compressibility. By determining how double occupancy changes with atom number, we identify the threshold disorder strength required to switch from disorder-independent MI-like to disorder-dependent BG-like compressible behavior.</p>

            <p>Merely by existing, all physical systems contain information, and physical dynamics transforms and processes that information. This note investigates the information processing power of living systems. Living systems harvest free energy from the sun, from geothermal sources, and from each other. They then use that free energy to drive the complex set of chemical interactions that underlie life. All molecules -- be they simple molecules such as water, or complex molecules such as DNA -- register information via their chemical composition. When these molecules undergo chemical reactions, that information is transformed and processed. These chemical transformations can be thought of as elementary logical operations: such bio-ops include the absorption of a photon in a chromophore during photosynthesis, the formation or breaking of covalent, hydrogen, and van der Waals bonds in the process of metabolism and reproduction, or the release of a neurotransmitter molecule when a synapse fires in the brain. This paper estimates the total number of bio-ops that have been, and are being performed, by life on earth. We find that the current number of bio-ops performed by all life on earth is around $10^{33}-10^{35}$ bio-ops per second. The cells in an individual human being perform around $10^{20}-10^{22}$ bio-ops per second, comparable to the information processing power of all the computers, cell phones, and server farms on earth. Depending on how one defines a neural operation, at most a few percent of human bio-ops take place in the firing of neurons and synapses in the brain. Over the course of life on earth, about $10^{50}-10^{52}$ bio-ops have taken place.</p>

            <p>Quantum computers represent a new computational paradigm with steadily improving hardware capabilities.

We investigate two quantum machine learning approaches, Neural Projected Quantum Kernels (NPQKs) and Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs), and find that both achieve classification performance comparable to classical machine learning methods across a wide energy range. By introducing a moment-of-inertia-based encoding scheme and a novel preprocessing approach, we enable efficient and scalable learning with large neutrino astronomy datasets. Tested on both simulators and the IBM Strasbourg quantum processor, the NPQK achieves a testing accuracy near 80 percent, with robust results above 1 TeV and close agreement between simulation and hardware performance. A simulated QCNN achieves approximately a 70 percent accuracy over the same energy range. These results underscore the promise of quantum machine learning for neutrino astronomy, paving the way for future advances as quantum hardware matures.</p>

            <h2>Obtaining continuum physics from dynamical simulations of Hamiltonian lattice gauge theories</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christopher F. Kane, Siddharth Hariprakash, Christian W. Bauer</p>
            <p>Taking the continuum limit is essential for extracting physical observables from quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories. Achieving the correct continuum limit requires careful control of all systematic uncertainties, including those arising from approximate implementations of the time evolution operator. In this work, we review existing approaches based on renormalization techniques, and point out their limitations. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a new general framework -- the Statistically-Bounded Time Evolution (SBTE) protocol -- for rigorously controlling the impact of approximate time evolution on the continuum limit. The central insight is that, since exact time evolution introduces no UV divergences, errors from approximate evolution can be treated as a source of systematic uncertainty that can be neglected if reduced below the working statistical uncertainty. We show that, using the SBTE protocol, which prescribes driving the approximate time evolution error below the working statistical uncertainty, leads to a simplified renormalization procedure. Furthermore, we show that, due to the existence of rigorous error bounds, one can guarantee a priori that such errors are negligible and do not affect the continuum limit. Ultimately, our protocol lays the foundation for performing systematic and fair comparisons between different simulation algorithms for lattice gauge theory simulations.</p>
