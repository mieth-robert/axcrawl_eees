            <h2>Towards Accurate Mixed Quantum Classical Simulations of Vibrational Polaritonic Chemistry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muhammad R. Hasyim, Arkajit Mandal, David R. Reichman</p>
            <p>Interest in vibrational polaritonic chemistry, where ground-state chemical kinetics are modified via confined optical modes in a cavity, has surged in recent years. Although models have been developed to understand cavity-modified reactions, fully quantum mechanical simulations remain out of reach for the collective regime that involves many molecules, a critical aspect of the phenomenon. Mixed quantum-classical (MQC) simulations offer a scalable alternative, but their accuracy requires testing and potential improvements even in the single-molecule limit. In this work, we take this step by first introducing the mapping approach to surface hopping (MASH) to address the limitations of traditional MQC methods. Second, we incorporate a quantum treatment of the cavity mode, moving beyond the classical approximations often employed in previous studies. Results for a single-molecule model of vibrational polaritonic chemistry show that combining MASH with a quantum cavity mode yields the most accurate rates. However, this scheme may produce different long-time population dynamics at zero coupling depending on whether the cavity mode is quantized; a problem known as size-inconsistency in MASH. We address this problem proposing the $\epsilon$-MASH approach, which forbids hopping between states with negligible nonadiabatic couplings (NACs). Combining MASH with a quantum cavity mode thus provides a promising approach for scalable and accurate MQC simulations in the collective regime.</p>

            <h2>Real-Field Hong-Ou-Mandel Interference of Indistinguishable Coherent Photons via Long Optical Injection-Locking over 50 km Fiber</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seoyeon Yang, Danbi Kim, Hansol Jeong, Han Seb Moon</p>
            <p>Measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD) has garnered significant attention for its potential to enable security-loophole-free quantum communication. Successful MDI-QKD protocols rely on performing a two-photon Bell-state measurement at an intermediate node, with a high-visibility Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference pattern between two independent coherent photons being crucial. In this study, we present a novel approach for developing indistinguishable coherent photon sources over 50 km of optical fiber in a real-world setting. We introduce the long optical injection-locking (long-OIL) technique, which enables frequency locking between two long-distance coherent photons beyond the coherence length of the master laser. Using the long-OIL technique, we achieved time-resolved HOM interference with a visibility of 48(2)%, approaching the theoretical 50% limit for two independent continuous-wave coherent photons. Our results demonstrate that the long-OIL platform is a promising solution for MDI-QKD with repeaterless secret key capacity.</p>

            <p>The quantum nonlinear Maxwell-Bloch equations for the two-level active medium single-mode laser are solved without adiabatic elimination of the medium polarization in the LED regime, when the population fluctuation spectrum is much narrower than the radiation field and polarization spectra.

            <h2>Quantum stochastic communication via high-dimensional entanglement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chao Zhang, Jia-Le Miao, Xiao-Min Hu, Jef Pauwels, Yu Guo, Chuan-Feng Li, Guang-Can Guo, Armin Tavakoli, Bi-Heng Liu</p>
            <p>Entanglement has the ability to enhance the transmission of classical information over a quantum channel. However, fully harvesting this advantage typically requires complex entangling measurements, which are challenging to implement and scale with the system's size. In this work, we consider a natural quantum information primitive in which the message to be communicated is selected stochastically. We introduce a protocol that leverages high-dimensional entanglement to perform this task perfectly, without requiring quantum interference between particles at the measurement station. We experimentally demonstrate the protocol's scalability in an optical setup using 8-dimensional entanglement and multi-outcome detection, providing a practical solution for stochastic communication and a robust method for certifying the dimensionality of entanglement in communication experiments.</p>

            <h2>Deterministic quantum teleportation of a path-encoded state using entangled photons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akshai T. Krishnan, Kanad Sengupta, S. P. Dinesh, C. M. Chandrashekar</p>
            <p>Quantum teleportation enables a way to transmit an arbitrary qubit state from one place to an other. A standard scheme for teleportation in optical setup involve three photons, an entangled photon pair and a photon carrying quantum state to be teleported. The interaction between the photons in the scheme makes quantum teleportation probabilistic. Here we demonstrate a deterministic teleportation of an arbitrary qubit state using only a polarization entangled photon pair in a linear optical setup. By introducing the path degree of freedom to one of the entangled photon and encoding the arbitrary qubit state into it, we demonstrate 100\% Bell State Measurement (BSM) outcome. This enables a deterministic teleportation of a qubit state in an optical scheme with high fidelity. We report an average teleportation fidelity of 88.00%. The dependency of fidelity on the visibility of single-photon interferometer used for path qubit state shows the possibility of further improving the fidelity of quantum teleportation.</p>

            <h2>Vibrationally Assisted Exciton Transfer in Open Quantum Systems with Long-Range Interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Diego Fallas Padilla, Visal So, Abhishek Menon, Roman Zhuravel, Han Pu, Guido Pagano</p>
            <p>The interplay between coherence and system-environment interactions is at the basis of a wide range of phenomena, from quantum information processing to charge and energy transfer in molecular systems, biomolecules, and photochemical materials. In this work, we use a Frenkel-exciton model with long-range interacting qubits coupled to a damped collective bosonic mode to investigate vibrationally assisted transfer processes in donor-acceptor systems featuring internal substructures analogous to light-harvesting complexes. We find that certain delocalized excitonic states maximize the transfer rate and that the entanglement is preserved during the dissipative transfer over a wide range of parameters. We investigate the transfer reduction by static disorder and by finite temperature and study how transfer efficiency scales as a function of the number of dimerized monomers and the component number of each monomer, finding which excitonic states lead to optimal transfer. Finally, we provide a realistic experimental setting to realize this model in analog trapped-ion quantum simulators. Analog quantum simulation of systems comprising many and increasingly complex monomers could offer valuable insights into the design of light-harvesting materials, particularly in the non-perturbative intermediate parameter regime examined in this study, where classical simulation methods are resource-intensive.</p>

            <h2>Quantum noise spectroscopy of superconducting critical dynamics and vortex fluctuations in a high-temperature cuprate</h2>

            <p>Characterizing the low-energy dynamics of quantum materials is crucial to our understanding of strongly correlated electronic states. However, extracting universal dynamical features requires resolving correlations at both low energy and momentum. Here, we introduce nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond as a novel and powerful quantum sensing platform of superconducting materials. We demonstrate the strengths of our approach by probing several low-energy phenomena in high-$T_c$ cuprate Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ (BSCCO) -- gapless quasiparticle excitations, critical fluctuations at the metal-superconductor transition and kinetics of vortices. In the absence of an applied magnetic field, we find a sharp reduction in the NV relaxation time ($T_1$) near the critical temperature $T_c\approx90~$K, attributed to supercurrent-fluctuation induced magnetic noise. Crucially, the temperature-scaling of the noise near criticality deviates from the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) mean-field prediction and reflects critical order parameter fluctuations, allowing us to determine both static and dynamical critical exponents for the transition. When a small field is applied, we detect a broad and asymmetric reduction of $T_1$ near $T_c$, indicating significant field-induced smearing of the transition. By analyzing the scaling of the BSCCO-induced relaxation rate with the field strength, we unveil evidence in favor of a vortex liquid phase. Finally, deep inside the superconducting phase, we employ NV decoherence ($T_2$) spectroscopy to observe strong magnetic fluctuations in the low-frequency regime, suggesting the presence of complex vortex-solid fluctuations. Our results establish NV-based noise spectroscopy as a versatile platform for probing dynamical phenomena in superconductors, with frequency and length scales complementary to existing techniques.</p>

            <h2>Quantum anomalous Hall domains in a Quenched Topological Mott Insulator</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lara Ulčakar, Gal Lemut, Tomaž Rejec, Jernej Mravlje</p>
            <p>We study an interacting spinless quadratic band touching model that realizes a topological Mott insulating state. We quench the interaction from a value corresponding to the nematic insulator to that of the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) ordered phase. We perform time-dependent Hartree-Fock simulations and show that after the quench the system realizes an excited Dirac semimetal state, which is however unstable and spontaneously evolves to a state with inhomogeneous nematic and QAH order parameters. The modulations form a stripe pattern that grows exponentially with time until the local Chern marker reaches unity. The alternating QAH order defines a domain structure with boundaries that host chiral sublattice currents.</p>

            <h2>Bright Heralded Single-Photon Source Saturating Theoretical Single-photon Purity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haoyang Wang, Huihong Yuan, Qiang Zeng, Lai Zhou, Haiqiang Ma, Zhiliang Yuan</p>
            <p>Single-photon source is the cornerstone for modern quantum information processing. The present work derives the theoretical limit of single-photon purity for general parametric heralded single-photon sources, and subsequently demonstrates a bright, gigahertz-pulsed heralded source with the purity saturating the limit. By stimulating spontaneous four-wave mixing effect in the silicon spiral waveguide, this on-chip source is measured to have a coincidence rate exceeding 1.5~MHz at a coincidence-to-accidental ratio (CAR) of 16.77 in the photon pair correlation experiment. The single-photon purity of this source, quantified by the heralded auto-correlation function $g^{(2)}_\text{h}(0)$, is measured by a heralded Hanbury Brown--Twiss setup to reach the theoretical limit with the lowest value of $0.00094 \pm 0.00002$ obtained at a coincidence rate of 0.8~kHz and a CAR of 2220. The performance improvements are attributed to effective spectral filtering suppressing the noise as well as the coherent pump condition helped by optical injection locking. The reported results provide a reliable standard for benchmarking heralded single-photon sources and present a state-of-the-art heralded source for quantum information processing.</p>

            <h2>Chiral-cat-state generation via the Sagnac-Fizeau effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Hong Liu, Xian-Li Yin, Hui Jing, Le-Man Kuang, Jie-Qiao Liao</p>
            <p>Chiral quantum state generation is an interesting topic in quantum physics and quantum information science. Here we propose an approach for generating chiral cat states in a spinning resonator supporting both the clockwise (CW) and counterclockwise (CCW) traveling modes, which are dispersively coupled to a two-level atom. The physical mechanism for the chiral-cat-state generation is based on the Sagnac-Fizeau effect. Concretely, when the resonator is rotating, the CW and CCW modes have different frequency detuning with respect to the atomic transition frequency and hence the atomic-state-dependent rotating angular velocities for the CW and CCW modes in phase space are different. This mode-dependent evolution leads to a chirality mechanism in the state generation. Based on the mode-dependent conditional rotation evolution and atomic projection measurement at proper time, we achieve the separate generation of cat states in the CW mode and coherent states in the CCW mode. We also investigate quantum coherence properties of the generated states by examining their Wigner functions. In addition, the influence of the system dissipations on the state generation in the open-system case is investigated. Our work will provide some insights into the development of chiral optical devices and nonreciprocal photonics.</p>

            <h2>Probing the nonclassical dynamics of a quantum particle in a gravitational field</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martin Plávala, Stefan Nimmrichter, Matthias Kleinmann</p>
            <p>In quantum mechanics, the time evolution of particles is given by the Schrödinger equation. It is valid in a nonrelativistic regime where the interactions with the particle can be modelled by a potential and quantised fields are not required. This has been verified in countless experiments when the interaction is of electromagnetic origin, but also corrections due to the quantised field are readily observed. When the interaction is due to gravity, then one cannot expect to see effects of the quantised field in current-technology Earth-bound experiments. However, this does not yet guarantee that in the accessible regime, the time evolution is accurately given by the Schrödinger equation. Here we propose to measure the effects of an asymmetric mass configuration on a quantum particle in an interferometer. For this setup we show that with parameters within experimental reach, one can be sensitive to possible deviations from the Schrödinger equation, beyond the already verified lowest-order regime. Performing this experiment will hence directly test the nonclassical behaviour of a quantum particle in the gravitational field.</p>

            <h2>Shortcuts to Analog Preparation of Non-Equilibrium Quantum Lakes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nik O. Gjonbalaj, Rahul Sahay, Susanne F. Yelin</p>
            <p>The dynamical preparation of exotic many-body quantum states is a persistent goal of analog quantum simulation, often limited by experimental coherence times. Recently, it was shown that fast, non-adiabatic Hamiltonian parameter sweeps can create finite-size ``lakes'' of quantum order in certain settings, independent of what is present in the ground state phase diagram. Here, we show that going further out of equilibrium via external driving can substantially accelerate the preparation of these quantum lakes. Concretely, when lakes can be prepared, existing counterdiabatic driving techniques -- originally designed to target the ground state -- instead naturally target the lakes state. We demonstrate this both for an illustrative single qutrit and a model of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Rydberg quantum spin liquid. In the latter case, we construct experimental drive sequences that accelerate preparation by almost an order of magnitude at fixed laser power. We conclude by using a Landau-Ginzburg model to provide a semi-classical picture for how our method accelerates state preparation.</p>

            <h2>Emulation of satellite up-link quantum communication with entangled photons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas Jaeken, Alexander Pickston, Faris Redza, Thomas Jennewein, Alessandro Fedrizzi</p>
            <p>Quantum communication rates in terrestrial quantum networks are fundamentally limited by fibre loss, even in the presence of quantum repeaters. Satellites offer a solution for long-distance communication, with the most commonly explored scenario involving prepare-and-measure protocols connecting from orbit to a trusted-node ground station via free-space down-links. In contrast, up-link scenarios allow for entanglement to be distributed between a satellite and remote end users in terrestrial networks, eliminating any trust requirement on the ground station. Here we demonstrate an ultra-bright source of far-non-degenerate entangled photons and perform quantum key distribution in emulated high-loss satellite scenarios. With a loss profile corresponding to that of one of the pioneering Micius up-link experiments, and a terrestrial end user separated by 10~km of telecom fibre we achieve secure key bit accumulation of 5.2~kbit in a single emulated overpass in the asymptotic limit. Our results confirm the viability of upcoming low-Earth orbit receiver satellite missions.</p>

            <h2>Page Curve and Entanglement Dynamics in an Interacting Fermionic Chain</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rishabh Jha, Salvatore R. Manmana, Stefan Kehrein</p>
            <p>Generic non-equilibrium many-body systems display a linear growth of bipartite entanglement entropy in time, followed by a volume law saturation. In stark contrast, the Page curve dynamics of black hole physics shows that the entropy peaks at the Page time $t_{\text{Page}}$ and then decreases to zero. Here, we investigate such Page-like behavior of the von Neumann entropy in a model of strongly correlated spinless fermions in a typical system-environment setup, and characterize the properties of the Page curve dynamics in the presence of interactions using numerically exact matrix product states methods. The two phases of growth, namely the linear growth and the bending down, are shown to be separated by a non-analyticity in the min-entropy before $t_{\text{Page}}$, which separates two different quantum phases, realized as the respective ground states of the corresponding entanglement (or equivalently, modular) Hamiltonian. We confirm and generalize, by introducing interactions, the findings of \href{this https URL}{Phys. Rev. B 109, 224308 (2024)} for a free spinless fermionic chain where the corresponding entanglement Hamiltonian undergoes a quantum phase transition at the point of non-analyticity. However, in the presence of interactions, a scaling analysis gives a non-zero critical time for the non-analyticity in the thermodynamic limit only for weak to intermediate interaction strengths, while the dynamics leading to the non-analyticity becomes \textit{instantaneous} for interactions large enough. We present a physical picture explaining these findings.</p>

            <h2>Rapid comprehensive characterization of biphoton spatial-polarization hyperentanglement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cheng Li, Girish Kulkarni, Isaac Soward, Yingwen Zhang, Jeremy Upham, Duncan England, Andrei Nomerotski, Ebrahim Karimi, Robert Boyd</p>
            <p>Hyperentanglement, which refers to entanglement across more than one degree of freedom (DoF), is a valuable resource in photonic quantum information technology. However, the lack of efficient characterization schemes hinders its quantitative study and application potential. Here, we present a rapid quantitative characterization of spatial-polarization hyperentangled biphoton state produced from spontaneous parametric down-conversion. We first demonstrate rapid certification of the hyperentanglement dimensionality with a cumulative acquisition time of only 17 minutes. In particular, we verify transverse spatial entanglement through a violation of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen criterion with a minimum conditional uncertainty product of $(0.11\pm0.05)\hbar$ and certify the entanglement dimensionality to be at least 148. Next, by performing spatially-resolved polarization state tomography of the entire field, we demonstrate the generation of an entire class of near-maximally polarization-entangled states with an average concurrence of $0.8303\pm0.0004$. Together, the results reveal a total dimensionality of at least 251, which is the highest dimensionality reported for hyperentanglement. These measurements quantitatively resolve the influence of the spatial correlations of the down-converted photons and the angular spectrum of the pump beam on the polarization entanglement. Our study lays important groundwork for further exploiting the high dimensionality and cross-DoF correlations in hyperentangled states for future quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>We report an enhanced sensitivity for detecting linear perturbations near hybrid (doubly degenerated) exceptional-diabolic (HED) singular points in a four mode bosonic system. The sensitivity enhancement is attributed to a singular response function, with the pole order determining the scaling of estimation error. At HED singular points, the error scaling exhibits a twofold improvement over non-HED singular points. The ultimate bound on estimation error is derived via quantum Fisher information, with heterodyne detection identified as the measurement achieving this optimal scaling.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gershon Kurizki, Nilakantha Meher, Tomáš Opatrný</p>
            <p>The impact of quantum mechanics on thermodynamics, particularly on the principles and designs of heat machines (HM), has been limited by the incompatibility of quantum coherent evolution with the dissipative, open-system nature of all existing HM and their basic structure, which has not been radically changed since Carnot. We have recently proposed a paradigm change whereby conventional HM functionality is replaced by that of few-mode coherent, closed systems with nonlinear, e.g. cross-Kerr, inter-mode couplings. These couplings allow us to coherently filter incident thermal noise, transforming it into a resource of work and information. Current technological advances enable heat engines, noise sensors or microscopes based on such designs to operate with thermal noise sources of few photons. This paradigm shift opens a path towards radically new understanding and exploitation of the relation between coherent, quantum or classical, evolution and thermodynamic behavior.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yunxiao Zhang, Xuan Tang, Xueshi Guo, Liang Cui, Xiaoying Li, Z. Y. Ou</p>
            <p>Interference effects are usually observed by intensity measurement. Path indistinguishability by quantum complementarity principle requires projection of the interfering fields into a common indistinguishable mode before detection. On the other hand, the essence of wave interference is the addition of amplitudes of the interfering fields. Therefore, if amplitudes can be directly measured and added, interference can occur even though the interfering fields are in well-distinguishable modes. Here, we make a comprehensive study in both theory and experiment of a technique by homodyne measurement of field amplitudes to reveal interference. This works for both classical and quantum fields even though there exists distinguishability in the interfering paths of light. This directly challenges complementarity principle. We present a resolution of this issue from the viewpoint of measurement that emphasizes either particle or wave. This technique is particularly useful for recovering interference in unbalanced interferometers with path-imbalance beyond coherence length of the input field and can be applied to remote sensing to extend applicable range. Since the amplitude-based interference phenomena studied here are fundamentally different from the traditional intenisty-based interference phenomena, our approach leads to a new paradigm to study coherence between optical fields.</p>

We show that thermal occupation may pin the bipolarons for ion crystals at finite temperature. Our scheme can be used to study and illustrate the emergence of mobile bipolarons as a function of temperature.</p>

Specifically, by varying the molecular distribution, we demonstrate that different configurations characterized by geometrical frustration, long-range power law hopping processes, and non-local gauge fields can be achieved. Our results thus represent a powerful and alternative approach to perform an accurate Hamiltonian engineering of quantum systems with non trivial coupling structures.</p>

            <h2>Deterministic photonic entanglement arising from non-Abelian quantum holonomy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aniruddha Bhattacharya, Chandra Raman</p>
            <p>Realizing deterministic, high-fidelity entangling interactions--of the kind that can be utilized for efficient quantum information processing--between photons remains an elusive goal. Here, we address this long-standing issue by devising a protocol for creating and manipulating highly-entangled superpositions of well-controlled states of light by using an on-chip photonic system that has recently been shown to implement three-dimensional, non-Abelian quantum holonomy. Our calculations indicate that a subset of such entangled superpositions are maximally-entangled, "volume-law" states, and that the underlying entanglement can be distilled and purified for applications in quantum science. Crucially, we generalize this approach to demonstrate the potentiality of deterministically entangling two arbitrarily high, $N$-dimensional quantum systems, by formally establishing a deep connection between the matrix representations of the unitary quantum holonomy--within energy-degenerate subspaces in which the total excitation number is conserved--and the $\left(2j+1\right)$-dimensional irreducible representations of the rotation operator, where $j = \left(N-1\right)/2$ and $N \geq 2$. Specifically, our protocol deterministically entangles spatially localized modes that are not only distinguishable but are also individually accessible and amenable to state preparation and measurement, and therefore, we envisage that this entangling mechanism could be utilized for deterministic quantum information processing with light.</p>

We develop a polaron master equation theory for incorporating the unavoidable exciton-phonon coupling and investigate the role of phonon-mediated processes and phonon-bath temperature on the degree of entanglement. We show that the phonon-coupling introduces the one-photon and two-photon incoherent processes, as well as the cross-coupling between the two exciton states. It is shown that the phonon-mediated coupling along with the ac-Stark shift and multiphoton emission significantly degrade the entanglement at higher temperatures. Finally, we consider a BBM92 quantum key distribution protocol to investigate the qubit error rate for the given degree of entanglement.</p>

            <h2>Quantum fluctuation theorem in a curved spacetime</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marcos L. W. Basso, Jonas Maziero, Lucas Chibebe Céleri</p>
            <p>The interplay between thermodynamics, general relativity and quantum mechanics has long intrigued researchers. Recently, important advances have been obtained in thermodynamics, mainly regarding its application to the quantum domain through fluctuation theorems. In this letter, we apply Fermi normal coordinates to report a fully general relativistic detailed quantum fluctuation theorem based on the two point measurement scheme. We demonstrate how the spacetime curvature can produce entropy in a localized quantum system moving in a general spacetime. The example of a quantum harmonic oscillator living in an expanding universe is presented. This result implies that entropy production is strongly observer dependent and deeply connects the arrow of time with the causal structure of the spacetime.</p>

            <h2>Quantum theory of surface lattice resonances</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michael Reitz, Stephan van den Wildenberg, Arghadip Koner, George C. Schatz, Joel Yuen-Zhou</p>
            <p>The collective interactions of nanoparticles arranged in periodic structures give rise to high-$Q$ in-plane diffractive modes known as surface lattice resonances (SLRs). While these resonances and their broader implications have been extensively studied within the framework of classical electrodynamics and linear response theory, a quantum optical theory capable of describing the dynamics of these structures, especially in the presence of material nonlinearities, beyond the use of \textit{ad hoc} few-mode approximations is largely missing. To this end, we consider here a lattice of metallic nanoparticles coupled to the background electromagnetic field and derive the quantum input-output relations within the electric dipole approximation. As a first application, we discuss coupling of the nanoparticle array to an external array of emitters and illustrate how the formalism can be extended to molecular optomechanics. Specifically, we show how the high $Q$-factors provided by SLRs can facilitate coupling between the nanoparticle array and collective vibrational modes. Finally, we examine a scenario in which the metallic nanoparticles themselves are replaced with saturable excitonic emitters, illustrating how the nonlinearity of the emitters can be used to switch the SLR condition between different electronic transitions. Our work provides a seamless framework to rigorously model SLR phenomena with quantum emitters without resorting to phenomenological treatments of either the electromagnetic environment or the material degrees of freedom.</p>

Furthermore, we demonstrate that entanglement cannot be generated by performing arbitrary frequency-dependent squeezing on the input optical field.

            <p>Optomechanical systems subjected to environmental noise give rise to rich physical phenomena. We investigate entanglement between a mechanical oscillator and the reflected coherent optical field in a general, not necessarily Markovian environment. For the input optical field, we consider stationary Gaussian states and frequency dependent squeezing. We demonstrate that for a coherent laser drive, either unsqueezed or squeezed in a frequency-independent manner, optomechanical entanglement is destroyed after a threshold that depends only on the environmental noises -- independent of the coherent coupling between the oscillator and the optical field, or the squeeze factor. In this way, we have found a universal entangling-disentangling transition. We also show that for a configuration in which the oscillator and the reflected field are separable, entanglement cannot be generated by incorporating frequency-dependent squeezing in the optical field.</p>

            <p>Confining electromagnetic fields inside an optical cavity can enhance the light-matter coupling between quantum materials embedded inside the cavity and the confined photon fields. When the interaction between the matter and the photon fields is strong enough, even the quantum vacuum field fluctuations of the photons confined in the cavity can alter the properties of the cavity-embedded solid-state materials at equilibrium and room temperature. This approach to engineering materials with light avoids fundamental issues of laser-induced transient matter states. To clearly differentiate this field from phenomena in driven systems, we call this emerging field cavity materials engineering. In this review, we first present theoretical frameworks, especially, ab initio methods, for describing light-matter interactions in solid-state materials embedded inside a realistic optical cavity. Next, we overview a few experimental breakthroughs in this domain, detailing how the ground state properties of materials can be altered within such confined photonic environments. Moreover, we discuss state-of-the-art theoretical proposals for tailoring material properties within cavities. Finally, we outline the key challenges and promising avenues for future research in this exciting field.</p>

            <h2>Microscopic Theory of Polariton Group Velocity Renormalization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenxiang Ying, Benjamin X. K. Chng, Milan Delor, Pengfei Huo</p>
            <p>Cavity exciton-polaritons exhibit ballistic transport and can achieve a distance of 100 $\mu $m in one picosecond. This ballistic transport significantly enhances mobility compared to that of bare excitons, which often move diffusively and become the bottleneck for energy conversion and transfer devices. Despite being robustly reproduced in experiments and simulations, there is no comprehensive microscopic theory addressing the group velocity of polariton transport, and its renormalization due to phonon scattering while still preserving this ballistic behavior. In this work, we develop a microscopic theory to describe the group velocity renormalization using a finite-temperature Green's function approach. Utilizing the generalized Holstein-Tavis-Cummings Hamiltonian, we analytically derive an expression for the group velocity renormalization and find that it is caused by phonon-mediated transitions from the lower polariton (LP) states to the dark states, then scattering from dark states back to LP. The dark states do not have to be populated in this process, serving as the virtual state for super-exchange (especially true for a large light-matter detuning). The theory predicts that the magnitude of group velocity renormalization scales linearly with the phonon bath reorganization energy under weak coupling conditions (perturbative regime for exciton-phonon coupling) and also linearly depends on the temperature in the high-temperature regime. These predictions are numerically verified using quantum dynamics simulations, demonstrating quantitative agreement. Our findings provide theoretical insights and a predictive analytical framework that advance the understanding and design of cavity-modified semiconductors and molecular ensembles, opening new avenues for engineered polaritonic devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Davide Li Calsi, Sumit Chaudhary, JinHyeock Choi, Marc Geitz, Janis Nötzel</p>
            <p>Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) systems are infamously known for their high demand on hardware, their extremely low key generation rates and their lack of security resulting from a need for trusted nodes which is implied by the absence of quantum repeaters. While they theoretically offer unlimited security, they are therefore practically limited in several regards. In this work we focus on the lack of options to guarantee an end-to-end security service with the currently available technology and infrastructure and propose a novel protocol. We find that one of the stumbling stones on the path towards an end-to-end security service guaranteed by quantum key distribution may be removed by using this protocol. Our proposal combines several parallel instances of twinfield QKD followed by classical postprocessing and communication to allow Alice and Bob to share a secret key. This hybrid approach improves the key rate and range w.r.t. to previous QKD approaches at a contained cost in security. We show that a coalition of intermediary nodes between Alice and Bob is needed to break the new scheme, sharply outperforming the trusted node approach in terms of security. Furthermore, the protocols do not require complex quantum measurements on Alice and Bob's sides, thus being truly end-to-end.</p>

            <p>The objective to be minimized in the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) has a restricted form, which allows a specialized sequential minimal optimization (SMO) that requires only a few observations in each iteration. However, the SMO iteration is still costly due to the observation noise -- one observation at a point typically requires averaging over hundreds to thousands of repeated quantum measurement shots for achieving a reasonable noise level. In this paper, we propose an adaptive cost control method, named subspace in confident region (SubsCoRe), for SMO. SubsCoRe uses the Gaussian process (GP) surrogate, and requires it to have low uncertainty over the subspace being updated, so that optimization in each iteration is performed with guaranteed accuracy. The adaptive cost control is performed by first setting the required accuracy according to the progress of the optimization, and then choosing the minimum number of measurement shots and their distribution such that the required accuracy is satisfied. We demonstrate that SubsCoRe significantly improves the efficiency of SMO, and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

            <h2>Reducing the sampling complexity of energy estimation in quantum many-body systems using empirical variance information</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander Gresch, Uğur Tepe, Martin Kliesch</p>
            <p>We consider the problem of estimating the energy of a quantum state preparation for a given Hamiltonian in Pauli decomposition. For various quantum algorithms, in particular in the context of quantum chemistry, it is crucial to have energy estimates with error bounds, as captured by guarantees on the problem's sampling complexity. In particular, when limited to Pauli basis measurements, the smallest sampling complexity guarantee comes from a simple single-shot estimator via a straightforward argument based on Hoeffding's inequality. In this work, we construct an adaptive estimator using the state's actual variance. Technically, our estimation method is based on the Empirical Bernstein stopping (EBS) algorithm and grouping schemes, and we provide a rigorous tail bound, which leverages the state's empirical variance. In a numerical benchmark of estimating ground-state energies of several Hamiltonians, we demonstrate that EBS consistently improves upon elementary readout guarantees up to one order of magnitude.</p>

            <p>Tensor network formalisms have emerged as powerful tools for simulating quantum state evolution. While widely applied in the study of optical quantum circuits, such as Boson Sampling, existing tensor network approaches fail to address the complexity mismatch between tensor contractions and the calculation of photon-counting probability amplitudes. Here, we present an alternative tensor network framework, the operator-basis Matrix Product State (MPS), which exploits the input-output relations of quantum optical circuits encoded in the unitary interferometer matrix. Our approach bridges the complexity gap by enabling the computation of the permanent -- central to Boson Sampling -- with the same computational complexity as the best known classical algorithm based on a graphical representation of the operator-basis MPS that we introduce. Furthermore, we exploit the flexibility of tensor networks to extend our formalism to incorporate partial distinguishability and photon loss, two key imperfections in practical interferometry experiments. This work offers a significant step forward in the simulation of large-scale quantum optical systems and the understanding of their computational complexity.</p>

            <p>Solid-state quantum sensors based on ensembles of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have emerged as powerful tools for precise sensing applications. Nuclear spin sensors are particularly well-suited for applications requiring long coherence times, such as inertial sensing, but remain underexplored due to control complexity and limited optical readout efficiency. In this work, we propose cooperative cavity quantum electrodynamic (cQED) coupling to achieve efficient nuclear spin readout. Unlike previous cQED methods used to enhance electron spin readout, here we employ two-field interference in the NV hyperfine subspace to directly probe the nuclear spin transitions. We model the nuclear spin NV-cQED system (nNV-cQED) and observe several distinct regimes, including electromagnetically induced transparency, masing without inversion, and oscillatory behavior. We then evaluate the nNV-cQED system as an inertial sensor, indicating a rotation sensitivity improved by three orders of magnitude compared to previous solid-state spin demonstrations. Furthermore, we show that the NV electron spin can be simultaneously used as a comagnetometer, and the four crystallographic axes of NVs can be employed for vector resolution in a single nNV-cQED system. These results showcase the applications of two-field interference using the nNV-cQED platform, providing critical insights into the manipulation and control of quantum states in hybrid NV systems and unlocking new possibilities for high-performance quantum sensing.</p>

Furthermore, we analyze these experiments within the framework of an updated quantum complementarity principle, which applies to specific quantum state preparations and remains consistent with the foundational principles of quantum mechanics.

            <p>Quantum computers have the potential to revolutionise our understanding of the microscopic behaviour of materials and chemical processes by enabling high-accuracy electronic structure calculations to scale more efficiently than is possible using classical computers. Current quantum computing hardware devices suffer from the dual challenges of noise and cost, which raises the question of what practical value these devices might offer before full fault tolerance is achieved and economies of scale enable cheaper access. Here we examine the practical value of noisy quantum computers as tools for high-accuracy electronic structure, by using a Quantinuum ion-trap quantum computer to predict the ionisation potential of helium. By combining a series of techniques suited for use with current hardware including qubit-efficient encoding coupled with chemical insight, low-cost variational optimisation with hardware-adapted quantum circuits, and moments-based corrections, we obtain an ionisation potential of 24.5536 (+0.0011, -0.0005) eV, which agrees with the experimentally measured value to within true chemical accuracy, and with high statistical confidence. The methods employed here can be generalised to predict other properties and expand our understanding of the value that might be provided by near-term quantum computers.</p>

            <p>Quantum Cramer-Rao (QCR) bound is attached to a particular nonclassical state, therefore appropriate choice of the probe state is of the key importance to enhance sensitivity beyond classical one. Since the work of C.M. Caves (Phys. Rev. D 23 1693 (1981)) Mach-Zehnder (MZ) interferometry operates with single-mode squeezed vacuum (SMSV) light coupled with a coherent state. We report the gain sensitivity of the phase-dependent MZ interferometer by more than 10 dB compared to the original result (Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 073601 (2008)) by using SMSV state with squeezing <10 dB from which a certain number of photons was initially subtracted. The gain sensitivity is also observed when measuring the difference of output intensities of the SMSV state with squeezing <3 dB from which 2,4,6 photons are subtracted and large coherent state. Overall, subtracting photons from the initially weakly squeezed light can prove to be a more efficient strategy in the quantum MZ interferometry compared to highly squeezed SMSV state generation.</p>

We show that the waveguide-coupled nitrogen-vacancy centers exhibit comparable spin coherence properties as that of nitrogen-vacancy centers in pristine diamond using time-domain optically detected magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Waveguide-enhanced magnetic field sensing is demonstrated in a fiber-coupled integrated photonic chip, where probing an increased volume of high-density spins results in 63 this http URL$^{-1/2}$ of DC-magnetic field sensitivity and 20 this http URL$^{-1/2}$ of AC magnetic field sensitivity.

            <p>Analyzing the kinetics of biological processes plays a significant role in understanding fundamental cellular functions. Many physics-based technologies used to study such processes are limited by the shot noise inherent to the coherent states of light. These technologies can greatly benefit by leveraging quantum probes to improve the sensitivity of measurements in cellular biology. Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) technique has been used effectively to achieve label-free, real-time measurements of protein binding kinetics, which constitutes an important biological phenomenon occurring near the cell membrane. Here, we demonstrate the integration of this technique with the two-mode bright squeezed state having fewer fluctuations as compared to the coherent state to improve the sensitivity of measurement in studying a protein-gold adsorption process. We show 4dB of squeezing as we record the signal-to-noise ratio as the function of time and it is maintained throughout the kinetic process. The quantum advantage as shown in terms of squeezing is achieved despite the total absorption of 74% from the source until the final detection after the sensor. Overall, we provide the most practical setup for improving the sensitivity of the time-dependent measurements involved in various biological processes at the molecular level.</p>

            <p>We investigate the role of quantum entanglement and coherence in suppressing radiation and explore its implications for dark matter. Using Dicke's framework, we demonstrate that entangled states in a gas at thermal equilibrium can lead to subradiance, trapping energy in dark quantum states and reducing radiation intensity. Applying this to the 21 cm line in dark matter halos, we find that quantum coherence renders the gas effectively dark. Moreover, entanglement results in a vanishing collision cross-section, consistent with the collisionless nature of dark matter observed in systems like the bullet cluster. We also show that absorption of incident radiation can exceed levels predicted by Beer's law, which holds only in the absence of coherence. These findings suggest that quantum entanglement and coherence may explain the non-luminous behavior of matter in dark matter halos, offering a novel perspective on dark matter and advancing the understanding of astrophysical radiative processes.</p>

Here we show theoretically that supersolids -- despite their self-induced character -- feature all the standard properties of bosonic Josephson junction arrays, including macroscopic quantum self-trapping. We focus on the harmonically trapped dipolar supersolids of interest for current experiments, and show that they can be described with a generalized Josephson model that takes into account spatial inhomogeneities. Our work shades new light on the dynamics of supersolids and opens the way to the study of a novel class of Josephson junctions.</p>

            <p>We introduce Super Quantum Mechanics (SQM) as a theory that considers states in Hilbert space subject to multiple quadratic constraints. Traditional quantum mechanics corresponds to a single quadratic constraint of wavefunction normalization. In its simplest form, SQM considers states in the form of unitary operators, where the quadratic constraints are conditions of unitarity. In this case, the stationary SQM problem is a quantum inverse problem with multiple applications in machine learning and artificial intelligence. The SQM stationary problem is equivalent to a new algebraic problem that we address in this paper. The SQM non-stationary problem considers the evolution of a quantum system, distinct from the explicit time dependence of the Hamiltonian, $H(t)$. Several options for the SQM dynamic equation are considered, and quantum circuits of 2D type are introduced, which transform one quantum system into another. Although no known physical process currently describes such dynamics, this approach naturally bridges direct and inverse quantum mechanics problems, allowing for the development of a new type of computer algorithm. Beyond computer modeling, the developed theory could be directly applied if or when a physical process capable of solving an inverse quantum problem in a single measurement act (analogous to wavefunction measurement in traditional quantum mechanics) is discovered in the future.</p>

We quantify the clock's precision while measuring the power dissipated by the DQD and, separately, the charge sensor in both direct-current and radio-frequency readout modes. This allows us to probe the thermodynamic cost of creating ticks microscopically and recording them macroscopically, which we refer to as the quantum-to-classical transition. Our experiment is the first to explore the interplay between the entropy produced by a microscopic clockwork and its macroscopic measurement apparatus. We show that the latter contribution not only dwarfs the former but also unlocks greatly increased precision, because the measurement record can be exploited to optimally estimate time even when the DQD is at equilibrium. Our results suggest that the entropy produced by the amplification and measurement of a clock's ticks, which has often been ignored in the literature, is the most important and fundamental thermodynamic cost of timekeeping at the quantum scale.</p>

            <h2>Optimizing lossy state preparation for quantum sensing using Hamiltonian engineering</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bharath Hebbe Madhusudhana</p>
            <p>One of the most prominent platforms for demonstrating quantum sensing below the standard quantum limit is the spinor Bose-Einstein condensate. While a quantum advantage using several tens of thousands of atoms has been demonstrated in this platform, it faces an important challenge: atom loss. Atom loss is a Markovian error process modelled by Lindblad jump operators, and a no-go theorem, which we also show here, stating that the loss of atoms in all spin components reduces the quantum advantage to a constant factor. Here, we show that this no-go theorem can be circumvented if we constrain atom losses to a single spin component. Moreover, we show that in this case, the maximum quantum Fisher information with $N$ atoms scales as $N^{3/2}$, establishing that a scalable quantum advantage can be achieved despite atom loss. Although Lindblad jump operators are generally non-Hermitian and non-invertible, we use their Moore-Penrose inverse to develop a framework for constructing several states with this scaling of Fisher information in the presence of losses. We use Hamiltonian engineering with realistic Hamiltonians to develop experimental protocols for preparing these states. Finally, we discuss possible experimental techniques to constrain the losses to a single spin mode.</p>

            <h2>Extended analysis of distillation and purification of squeezed states of light</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jaromír Fiurášek, Stephan Grebien, Roman Schnabel</p>
            <p>Squeezed states of light are one of the most important fundamental resources for quantum optics, optical quantum information processing and quantum sensing. Recently, it has been experimentally demonstrated that the squeezing of single-mode squeezed vacuum states can be enhanced by probabilistic two-photon subtraction. A further enhancement of the squeezing is subsequently possible by heralded Gaussification that distills a Gaussian state from the de-Gaussified two-photon subtracted state. Here we provide an extended theoretical analysis of squeezing distillation and purification. We consider a more general scheme in which photon subtraction is combined with a weak coherent displacement. This more flexible scheme allows to enhance squeezing for arbitrary input squeezing value. Moreover, if the modified two-photon subtraction operation is properly chosen, then arbitrary strong squeezing can be distilled by subsequent Gaussification. We go beyond pure states and show that the combination of photon subtraction and heralded Gaussification cannot suppress losses that have affected the input state. To overcome this limitation, we propose an alternative de-Gaussifying operation based on a Fock-state filter that removes the single-photon state. With this de-Gaussifying operation and subsequent re-Gaussification, pure single-mode squeezed states can be distilled from a large class of mixed input states. Interestingly, we have found that squeezing distillation by two-photon subtraction is closely related to certain methods for generating Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) states, which are crucial for optical quantum computing.</p>

            <p>Entangled states of photons form the backbone of many quantum technologies. Due to the lack of effective photon-photon interactions, the generation of these states is typically probabilistic. In the prevailing but fundamentally limited generation technique, known as postselection, the target photons are measured destructively in the generation process. By contrast, in the alternative approach -- heralded state generation -- the successful creation of a desired state is verified by the detection of ancillary photons. Heralded state generation is superior to postselection in several critical ways: It enables free usage of the prepared states, allows for the success probability to be arbitrarily increased via multiplexing, and provides a scalable route to quantum information processing using photons. Here, we review theoretical proposals and experimental realizations of heralded entangled photonic state generation, as well as the impact of realistic experimental errors. We then discuss the wide-ranging applications of these states for quantum technologies, including resource states in linear optical quantum computing, entanglement swapping for repeater networks, fundamental physics, and quantum metrology.</p>

            <p>Unlike other quantum hardware, photonic quantum architectures can produce millions of qubits from a single device. However, controlling photonic qubits remains challenging, even at small scales, due to their weak interactions, making non-deterministic gates in linear optics unavoidable. Nevertheless, a single photon can readily spread over multiple modes and create entanglement within the multiple modes deterministically. Rudolph's concept of third quantization leverages this feature by evolving multiple single-photons into multiple modes, distributing them uniformly and randomly to different parties, and creating multipartite entanglement without interactions between photons or non-deterministic gates. This method requires only classical communication and deterministic entanglement within multi-mode single-photon states and enables universal quantum computing. The multipartite entanglement generated within the third quantization framework is nearly deterministic, where ``deterministic'' is achieved in the asymptotic limit of a large system size. In this work, we propose a near-term experiment using antimony donor in a silicon chip to realize third quantization. Utilizing the eight energy levels of antimony, one can generate two eight-mode single-photon states independently and distribute them to parties. This enables a random multipartite Bell-state experiment, achieving a Bell state with an upper-bound efficiency of 87.5% among 56 random pairs without non-deterministic entangling gates. This approach opens alternative pathways for silicon-based photonic quantum computing.</p>

            <p>Ensembles of dipolar emitters which couple collectively to the radiation field display sub- and superradiance. These terms refer to a reduction or an enhancement of photon emission rates due to the interference of emission channels. Arrays of trapped neutral atoms constitute a promising platform for harnessing this phenomenon in technological applications, e.g. for excitation storage, single-photon switches and mirrors. However, vibrational motion of the atoms within their traps leads to position fluctuations that entangle the motion and the internal atomic degrees of freedom, which is expected to affect the collective photon emission. We develop here a theory for collective atom-light coupling in the presence of this quantized motion within the Lamb-Dicke limit. We show the existence of sub- and superradiant states, which are hybrids of electronic and vibrational excitations and explore their properties for analytically and numerically efficiently solvable cases.</p>

Recently, superradiant self organized phases for ultracold atomic gases inside a cavity, pumped by a blue detuned optical lattice, have been observed. Here, we explore the formation of quantum many-body phases with strongly interacting bosonic atoms inside an optical cavity, subject to transverse blue detuned pumping. We analyze the interplay between superradiant self-organization with superfluid and Mott insulator phases, without the need of including higher lying bands, as the Wannier functions are dynamically linked to the cavity light via backaction. We observe different kinds of structural phase transitions driven by the light inside the cavity and the interplay with atomic collisions. We observe the mode softening at the critical points in the quantum phase transitions which can be measured in future experiments.</p>

            <p>The electronic and emission properties of correlated multi-particle states are studied theoretically using ${\bf k}\cdot{\bf p}$ and the configuration interaction methods on a well-known and measured GaAs/AlGaAs quantum dots as a test system. The convergence of the calculated energies and radiative lifetimes of Coulomb correlated exciton, biexciton, positive and negative trions to experimentally observed values is reached when the electron-electron and hole-hole exchange interactions are neglected. That unexpected and striking result uncovers a rich structure of multi-particle states in the studied system, which is further quantitatively compared to published measurements in the literature, obtaining astonishingly good agreement. It is proposed that in real experiments the neglected electron-electron and hole-hole exchange interactions are emitted as acoustic phonons during the radiative recombination of the ground state of complexes, leading to the observation of polaronic multi-particle states. Analysis of their energy spectra provides a direct and measurable insight into the Coulomb correlation, being interesting both on the fundamental level and as possible experimentally tunable property in a wide variety of solid-state systems, in particular associated with quantum computing.</p>

            <p>We investigate the universal fluctuations of localized wavefunction in the Fock space of two interacting particles in one-dimensional disordered systems, focusing on the interplay between random potentials and random long-range interactions. By mapping the system onto a directed polymer problem, we show that random potentials alone produce correlated energies for the sites in the Fock space, giving rise to the fluctuation growth exponent 1/2. Introducing random long-range interactions alters these correlations and drives the system's fluctuations into the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class in (1+1)D with the exponent 1/3. To validate the universality of the observed fluctuation scaling, we study a complex directed polymer model with competing point and columnar disorder. Our results confirm that columnar disorder corresponds to on-site energies in the Fock space from the random potentials, while point disorder models the effects of random long-range interactions between the two particles. These findings provide new insights into the Fock-space perspective for examining disordered quantum many-body systems, and emphasize the critical role of disorder structure in determining the universality class of fluctuations in localized quantum systems.</p>

            <p>The superposition principle provides us the opportunity to unfold many surprising facts. One such fact leads to the generation of entanglement which may allow one to teleport an unknown quantum state from one location to another. We try to understand the role of superposition in the process of quantum teleportation. We consider, within the scenario of quantum teleportation, a set-up where the sender and the receiver are in a superposed situation of using a maximally entangled state and not using any entangled state in the teleportation protocol, controlled by a qubit. We address two distinct protocols: in the first case, the sender and the receiver do nothing when they do not have the authority to use entanglement, while in the second case, they still use classical communication even if they do not use entanglement. After accomplishing the protocols, we operate a Hadamard gate on the control qubit, measure the control qubit's state, and consider the outcome corresponding to a particular state of the control. We compare the protocol's fidelity with the maximum fidelity achievable through classical resources only. In particular, we provide conditions to achieve nonclassical fidelity in teleportation, in the presence of the control qubit. To explore if there is any quantum advantage (advantage of superposition present in the control qubit), we compare the fidelities of the control qubit-based protocols with the fidelity achieved in a situation where the two parties are in a classical mixture of using and not using the maximally entangled state. We observe that there exists a wide range of parameters defining the initial state of the control qubit for which our protocols provide quantum advantage. To analyse the role of superposition quantitatively, we discuss whether the amount of quantum advantage can be expressed in terms of quantum coherence present in the state of the control qubit.</p>

            <h2>Quantum complexity phase transitions in monitored random circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryotaro Suzuki, Jonas Haferkamp, Jens Eisert, Philippe Faist</p>
            <p>Recently, the dynamics of quantum systems that involve both unitary evolution and quantum measurements have attracted attention due to the exotic phenomenon of measurement-induced phase transitions. The latter refers to a sudden change in a property of a state of $n$ qubits, such as its entanglement entropy, depending on the rate at which individual qubits are measured. At the same time, quantum complexity emerged as a key quantity for the identification of complex behaviour in quantum many-body dynamics. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of the quantum state complexity in monitored random circuits, where $n$ qubits evolve according to a random unitary circuit and are individually measured with a fixed probability at each time step. We find that the evolution of the exact quantum state complexity undergoes a phase transition when changing the measurement rate. Below a critical measurement rate, the complexity grows at least linearly in time until saturating to a value $e^{\Omega(n)}$. Above, the complexity does not exceed $\operatorname{poly}(n)$. In our proof, we make use of percolation theory to find paths along which an exponentially long quantum computation can be run below the critical rate, and to identify events where the state complexity is reset to zero above the critical rate. We lower bound the exact state complexity in the former regime using recently developed techniques from algebraic geometry. Our results combine quantum complexity growth, phase transitions, and computation with measurements to help understand the behavior of monitored random circuits and to make progress towards determining the computational power of measurements in many-body systems.</p>

            <p>One of the demanding frontiers in ultracold quantum science is identifying laser cooling schemes for complex atoms and molecules out of their vast spectra of internal states. Motivated by the prospect of expanding the set of available ultracold molecules for applications in fundamental physics, chemistry, astrochemistry, and quantum simulation, we propose and demonstrate an automated graph-based search approach for viable laser cooling schemes. The method is time efficient, reproduces the results of previous manual searches, and reveals a plethora of new potential laser cooling schemes. We discover laser cooling schemes for YO, C$_2$, OH$^+$, CN, and CO$_2$, including surprising schemes that start from highly excited states or do not rely on a strong main transition. A central insight of this work is that the reinterpretation of quantum states and transitions between them as a graph can dramatically enhance the ability to identify new quantum control schemes for complex quantum systems. As such, this approach will also apply to complex atoms and, in fact, any complex many-body quantum system with a discrete spectrum of internal states.</p>

            <p>The number of excitations in a large quantum system (harmonic oscillator or qudit) can be measured in a quantum nondemolition manner using a dispersively coupled qubit. It typically requires a series of qubit pulses that encode various binary questions about the photon number. Recently, a method based on the fluorescence measurement of a qubit driven by a train of identical pulses was introduced to track the photon number in a cavity, hence simplifying its monitoring and raising interesting questions about the measurement backaction of this scheme. A first realization with superconducting circuits demonstrated how the average number of photons could be measured in this way. Here we present an experiment that reaches single-shot photocounting and number tracking owing to a cavity decay rate 4 orders of magnitude smaller than both the dispersive coupling rate and the qubit emission rate. An innovative notch filter and pogo-pin-based galvanic contact makes possible these seemingly incompatible features. The qubit dynamics under the pulse train is characterized. We observe quantum jumps by monitoring the photon number via the qubit fluorescence as photons leave the cavity one at a time. Additionally, we extract the measurement rate and induced dephasing rate and compare them to theoretical models. Our method could be applied to quantum error correction protocols on bosonic codes or qudits.</p>

            <p>By formulating the axioms of quantum mechanics, von Neumann also laid the foundations of a "quantum probability theory". As such, it is regarded a generalization of the "classical probability theory" due to Kolmogorov. Outside of quantum physics, however, Kolmogorov's axioms enjoy universal applicability. This raises the question of whether quantum physics indeed requires such a generalization of our conception of probability or if von Neumann's axiomatization of quantum mechanics was contingent on the absence of a general theory of probability in the 1920s. This work argues in favor of the latter position. In particular, it shows how to construct a mathematically rigorous theory for non-relativistic $N$-body quantum systems subject to a time-independent scalar potential, which is based on Kolmogorov's axioms and physically natural random variables. Though this theory is provably distinct from its quantum mechanical analog, it nonetheless reproduces central predictions of the latter. Further work may make an empirical comparison possible. Moreover, the approach can in principle be adapted to other classes of quantum-mechanical models. Part II of this series discusses the empirical violation of Bell inequalities in the context of this approach. Part III addresses the projection postulate and the question of measurement.</p>

            <p>Hamiltonian encoding is a methodology for revealing the mechanism behind the dynamics governing controlled quantum systems. In this paper, following Mitra and Rabitz [Phys. Rev. A 67, 033407 (2003)], we define mechanism via pathways of eigenstates that describe the evolution of the system, where each pathway is associated with a complex-valued amplitude corresponding to a term in the Dyson series. The evolution of the system is determined by the constructive and destructive interference of these pathway amplitudes. Pathways with similar attributes can be grouped together into pathway classes. The amplitudes of pathway classes are computed by modulating the Hamiltonian matrix elements and decoding the subsequent evolution of the system rather than by direct computation of the individual terms in the Dyson series. The original implementation of Hamiltonian encoding was computationally intensive and became prohibitively expensive in large quantum systems. This paper presents two new encoding algorithms that calculate the amplitudes of pathway classes by using techniques from graph theory and algebraic topology to exploit patterns in the set of allowed transitions, greatly reducing the number of matrix elements that need to be modulated. These new algorithms provide an exponential decrease in both computation time and memory utilization with respect to the Hilbert space dimension of the system. To demonstrate the use of these techniques, they are applied to two illustrative state-to-state transition problems.</p>

            <p>Fracton models host unconventional topological orders in three and higher dimensions and provide promising candidates for quantum memory platforms. Understanding their robustness against quantum fluctuations is an important task but also poses great challenges due to the lack of efficient numerical tools. In this work, we establish neural quantum states (NQS) as new tools to study phase transitions in these models. Exact and efficient parametrizations are derived for three prototypical fracton codes -- the checkerboard and X-cube model, as well as Haah's code -- both in terms of a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) and a correlation-enhanced RBM. We then adapt the correlation-enhanced RBM architecture to a perturbed checkerboard model and reveal its strong first-order phase transition between the fracton phase and a trivial field-polarizing phase. To this end, we simulate this highly entangled system on lattices of up to 512 qubits with high accuracy, representing a cutting-edge application of variational neural-network methods. In addition, we reproduce the phase transition of the X-cube model previously obtained with quantum Monte Carlo and high-order series expansion methods. Our work demonstrates the remarkable potential of NQS in studying complicated three-dimensional problems and highlights physics-oriented constructions of NQS architectures.</p>

However, executing quantum algorithms of practical computational advantage requires further improvements in the fidelities of qubit operations, which are currently limited by the energy relaxation and dephasing times of the qubits. Here, we report our measurement results of a high-coherence transmon qubit with energy relaxation and echo dephasing times surpassing those in the existing literature. We measure a qubit frequency of 2.9 GHz, an energy relaxation time with a median of 425 us and a maximum of (666 +/- 33) us, and an echo dephasing time with a median of 541 us and a maximum of (1057 +/- 138) us. We report in detail our design, fabrication process, and measurement setup to facilitate the reproduction and wide adoption of high-coherence transmon qubits in the academia and industry.</p>

            <h2>Strong-to-weak spontaneous breaking of 1-form symmetry and intrinsically mixed topological order</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Carolyn Zhang, Yichen Xu, Jian-Hao Zhang, Cenke Xu, Zhen Bi, Zhu-Xi Luo</p>
            <p>Topological orders in 2+1d are spontaneous symmetry-breaking (SSB) phases of 1-form symmetries in pure states. The notion of symmetry is further enriched in the context of mixed states, where a symmetry can be either ``strong" or ``weak". In this work, we apply a Rényi-2 version of the proposed equivalence relation in [Sang, Lessa, Mong, Grover, Wang, & Hsieh, to appear] on density matrices that is slightly finer than two-way channel connectivity. This equivalence relation distinguishes general 1-form strong-to-weak SSB (SW-SSB) states from phases containing pure states, and therefore labels SW-SSB states as ``intrinsically mixed". According to our equivalence relation, two states are equivalent if and only if they are connected to each other by finite Lindbladian evolution that maintains continuously varying, finite Rényi-2 Markov length. We then examine a natural setting for finding such density matrices: disordered ensembles. Specifically, we study the toric code with various types of disorders and show that in each case, the ensemble of ground states corresponding to different disorder realizations form a density matrix with different strong and weak SSB patterns of 1-form symmetries, including SW-SSB. Furthermore we show by perturbative calculations that these disordered ensembles form stable ``phases" in the sense that they exist over a finite parameter range, according to our equivalence relation.</p>

            <p>We examine the onset and resilience of emergent time periodicity in a few-body all-to-all interacting Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, where one of the constituents is locally in contact with a thermal bath. Employing both a collision model framework and a suitable time-continuous description, we show that stable time-periodic behavior can only be exhibited when the bath acts as a purely dissipative channel. We assess the role that the microscopic interactions within the system play, establishing that for the all-to-all model the introduction of temperature leads to a melting of the emergent time periodicity, in contrast to stable long-time behavior which can be maintained for nearest neighbor $XXZ$ type interactions.</p>

            <h2>High-performance conditional-driving gate for Kerr parametric oscillator qubits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hiroomi Chono, Hayato Goto</p>
            <p>Kerr parametric oscillators (KPOs), two-photon driven Kerr-nonlinear resonators, can stably hold coherent states with opposite-sign amplitudes and are promising devices for quantum computing. Recently, we have theoretically proposed a two-qubit gate $R_{zz}$ for highly detuned KPOs and called it a conditional-driving gate [Chono $\textit{et al}$., Phys. Rev. Res. $\textbf{4}$, 043054 (2022)]. In this study, analyzing its superconducting-circuit model and deriving a corresponding static model, we find that an AC-Zeeman shift due to the flux pulse for the gate operation largely affects the gate performance. This effect becomes a more aggravating factor with shorter gate times, leading to an increase in the error rate. We thus propose a method to cancel this undesirable effect. Furthermore, through the use of shortcuts to adiabaticity and the optimization of flux pulses, we numerically demonstrate a conditional-driving gate with average fidelity exceeding 99.9$\%$ twice faster than that without the proposed method.</p>

            <h2>Optimal State Preparation for Logical Arrays on Zoned Neutral Atom Quantum Computers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yannick Stade, Ludwig Schmid, Lukas Burgholzer, Robert Wille</p>
            <p>Quantum computing promises to solve problems previously deemed infeasible. However, high error rates necessitate quantum error correction for practical applications. Seminal experiments with zoned neutral atom architectures have shown remarkable potential for fault-tolerant quantum computing. To fully harness their potential, efficient software solutions are vital. A key aspect of quantum error correction is the initialization of physical qubits representing a logical qubit in a highly entangled state. This process, known as state preparation, is the foundation of most quantum error correction codes and, hence, a crucial step towards fault-tolerant quantum computing. Generating a schedule of target-specific instructions to perform the state preparation is highly complex. First software tools exist but are not suitable for the zoned neutral atom architectures. This work addresses this gap by leveraging the computational power of SMT solvers and generating minimal schedules for the state preparation of logical arrays. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that actively utilizing zones to shield idling qubits consistently results in higher fidelities than solutions disregarding these zones.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xoel Sixto, Álvaro Navarrete, Margarida Pereira, Guillermo Currás-Lorenzo, Kiyoshi Tamaki, Marcos Curty</p>
            <p>Most security proofs of quantum key distribution (QKD) assume that there is no unwanted information leakage about the state preparation process. However, this assumption is impossible to guarantee in practice, as QKD systems can leak information to the channel due to device imperfections or the active action of an eavesdropper. Here, we solve this pressing issue by introducing a security proof in the presence of information leakage from all state preparation settings for arguably the most popular QKD scheme, namely the decoy-state BB84 protocol. The proof requires minimal experimental characterization, as only a single parameter related to the isolation of the source needs to be determined, thus providing a clear path for bridging the gap between theory and practice. Moreover, if information about the state of the side channels is available, this can be readily incorporated into the analysis to further improve the resulting performance.</p>

            <p>Quantum cryptographic conferencing (QCC) allows sharing secret keys among multiple distant users and plays a crucial role in quantum networks. Because of the fragility and low generation rate of genuine multipartite entangled states required in QCC, realizing and extending QCC with the entanglement-based protocol is challenging. Measurement-device-independent (MDI) QCC, which removes all detector side channels, is a feasible long-distance quantum communication scheme to practically generate multipartite correlation with multiphoton projection measurement. Here we experimentally realize the three-user MDIQCC protocol with four-intensity decoy-state method, in which we employ the polarization encoding and the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state projection measurement. Our work demonstrates the experimental feasibility of the MDI QCC, which lays the foundation for the future realization of quantum networks with multipartite communication tasks.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Wave Simulation with Sources and Loss Functions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cyrill Bösch, Malte Schade, Giacomo Aloisi, Andreas Fichtner</p>
            <p>We present a quantum algorithmic framework for simulating linear, anti-Hermitian (lossless) wave equations in heterogeneous, anisotropic, and time-independent media. This framework encompasses a broad class of wave equations, including the acoustic wave equation, Maxwell$'$s equations and the elastic wave equation. Our formulation is compatible with standard numerical discretization schemes and allows for the efficient implementation of multiple practically relevant time- and space-dependent sources. Furthermore, we demonstrate that subspace energies can be extracted and wave fields compared through an $l_2$ loss function, achieving optimal precision scaling with the number of samples taken. Additionally, we introduce techniques for incorporating boundary conditions and linear constraints that preserve the anti-Hermitian nature of the equations. Leveraging the Hamiltonian simulation algorithm, our framework achieves a quartic speed-up over classical solvers in 3D simulations, under conditions of sufficiently global measurements and compactly supported sources and initial conditions. This quartic speed-up is optimal for time-domain solutions, as the Hamiltonian of the discretized wave equations has local couplings. In summary, our framework provides a versatile approach for simulating wave equations on quantum computers, offering substantial speed-ups over state-of-the-art classical methods.</p>

            <h2>Wave function evolution from source to detection and the measurement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Li Hua Yu</p>
            <p>We analyze the evolution of a particle wave function when it propagates through free space in the longitudinal z-direction from a thin entrance slit to a detector behind a thin exit slit parallel to the horizontal y-axis. We consider an extra aperture slit between the two slits to probe the evolution of the wave function and close the aperture slit starting from wide open until the detection counting rate in a repeated experiment drops to half. When all the slits are long and thin, the 1D Schroedinger equation gives the wave function evolution until the final detection. The width of the aperture slit in the vertical x-direction depends on the z-position of the slit providing an approximate description of the wave function evolution. The width of the function characterizing this dependence starts from the entrance slit. It grows wider until it reaches a maximum and then shrinks narrower and finally collapses into the exit slit where the particle is detected. Thus the envelope of this function has a spindle shape with its pointed ends at the two slits. Hence it is very different from the well-known wave function of the Schroedinger equation with the initial condition at the entrance slit, which is narrow only at the beginning, then grows wider until it reaches the exit slit, where it is much larger than the slit width. However, the phase information is lost because the aperture slit distorts the wave function. To keep the phase information, we replace the aperture slit with a thin pin (parallel to the y-axis) that blocks the wave function. We then study its perturbative effect on the counting rate of the detector. This analysis provides a function to probe the process of the wave function collapse right before the detection. We show this function is real-valued, with amplitude and phase information, and is closely related to the wave function.</p>

            <h2>Spectral Properties Versus Magic Generation in $T$-doped Random Clifford Circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dominik Szombathy, Angelo Valli, Cătălin Paşcu Moca, János Asbóth, Lóránt Farkas, Tibor Rakovszky, Gergely Zaránd</p>
            <p>We study the emergence of complexity in deep random $N$-qubit $T$-gate doped Clifford circuits, as reflected in their spectral properties and in magic generation, characterized by the stabilizer Rényi entropy distribution and the non-stabilizing power of the circuit. For pure (undoped) Clifford circuits, a unique periodic orbit structure in the space of Pauli strings implies peculiar spectral correlations and level statistics with large degeneracies. $T$-gate doping induces an exponentially fast transition to chaotic behavior, described by random matrix theory. We compare these complexity indicators with magic generation properties of the Clifford+$T$ ensemble, and determine the distribution of magic, as well as the average non-stabilizing power of the quantum circuit ensemble. In the dilute limit, $N_T \ll N$, magic generation is governed by single-qubit behavior. Magic is generated in approximate quanta, increases approximately linearly with the number of $T$-gates, $N_T$, and displays a discrete distribution for small $N_T$. At $N_T\approx N$, the distribution becomes quasi-continuous, and for $N_T\gg N$ it converges to that of Haar-random unitaries, and averages to a finite magic density, $m_2$, $\lim_{N\to\infty} \langle m_2 \rangle_\text{Haar} = 1$. This is in contrast to the spectral transition, where ${\cal O} (1)$ $T$-gates suffice to remove spectral degeneracies and to induce a transition to chaotic behavior in the thermodynamic limit. Magic is therefore a more sensitive indicator of complexity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nivaldo A. Lemos</p>
            <p>``The unphysicality of Hilbert spaces'' by Carcassi, Calderón and Aidala (arXiv:2308.06669v3) is a thoughtful dissection of the mathematical structure of quantum mechanics that seeks to pinpoint difficulties inherent in postulating that the physical states are elements of a Hilbert space. Its pivotal charge against Hilbert spaces is that by a change of variables, which is a change-of-basis unitary transformation, one ``can map states with finite expectation values to those with infinite ones''. In the present comment it is shown that this statement is incorrect and the source of the error is spotted. In consequence, the purported example of a time evolution that makes ``the expectation value oscillate from finite to infinite in finite time" is also faulty, and the assertion that Hilbert spaces ``turn a potential infinity into an actual infinity'' is unsubstantiated. Two other objections to Hilbert spaces on physical grounds, both technically correct, are the isomorphism of separable Hilbert spaces and the unavoidable existence of infinite-expectation-value states. The former is of little relevance but the latter remains an issue without a fully satisfactory solution, although the evidence so far is that it is physically innocuous. All in all, while the authors' thesis that Hilbert spaces must be given up ought to be taken seriously, it seems insufficiently supported to be convincing.</p>

            <p>A constant number of random Clifford measurements allows the classical shadow protocol to perform Direct Fidelity Estimation (DFE) with high precision. However, estimating properties of an unknown quantum state is expected to be more feasible with random Pauli measurements than with random Clifford measurements in the near future. Inspired by the importance sampling technique applied to sampling Pauli measurements for DFE, we show that similar strategies can be derived from classical shadows. Specifically, we describe efficient methods using Pauli measurements to perform DFE with GHZ and W states, establishing tighter bounds ($\approx \times 14.22$ for GHZ, $\approx \times 16$ for W) on the number of measurements required for desired precision.</p>

We find good agreement between the experiments and a linearized theoretical model.

            <p>Macroscopic entanglement, as critical quantum resources in quantum information science, has been extensively studied in coherent optomechanics over the past decades. However, entanglement in dissipative optomechanics, where the cavity linewidth is dependent on the position of the mechanical resonator, remains unexplored. In this work, we study quantum entanglement in a dissipative optomechanics, realized by a Michelson-Sagnac interferometer and a movable membrane. Such dissipative optomechanics allows to switch coherent and dissipative optomechanical coupling at will. With reliable parameters, we demonstrate that the steady-state mechanical displacement exhibits a nonlinear (linear) dependence on the driving power with coherent (dissipative) coupling. Further, we show that quantum entanglement generated by dissipative coupling is significantly stronger and more noise-tolerant than that generated by coherent coupling. When both the coherent and dissipative couplings are simultaneously considered, entanglement is instead weakened due to quantum interference. Our result indicates that dissipative optomechanical coupling may be a promising path to engineer strong and noise-tolerant quantum entanglement.</p>

Our study successfully employs TNs to solve linear elasticity equations with billions of degrees of freedom, achieving exponential reductions in both memory usage and computational time. These results demonstrate the practical viability of TNs as a powerful classical backend for executing quantum-inspired algorithms with significant efficiency gains.

            <p>The precise one-shot characterisation of operational tasks in classical and quantum information theory relies on different forms of smooth entropic quantities. A particularly important connection is between the hypothesis testing relative entropy and the smoothed max-relative entropy, which together govern many operational settings. We first strengthen this connection into a type of equivalence: we show that the hypothesis testing relative entropy is equivalent to a variant of the smooth max-relative entropy based on the information spectrum divergence, which can be alternatively understood as a measured smooth max-relative entropy. Furthermore, we improve a fundamental lemma due to Datta and Renner that connects the different variants of the smoothed max-relative entropy, introducing a modified proof technique based on matrix geometric means and a tightened gentle measurement lemma. We use the unveiled connections and tools to strictly improve on previously known one-shot bounds and duality relations between the smooth max-relative entropy and the hypothesis testing relative entropy, sharpening also bounds that connect the max-relative entropy with Rényi divergences.</p>

            <p>In the present study, we consider the hydrogen atom confined within an impenetrable infinite cylindrical cavity of radius $\rho_{0}$ in the presence of a constant magnetic field ${\bf B} = B\,\hat{\bf z}$ oriented along the main cylinder's axis. In the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, anchoring the nucleus to the geometric center of the cylinder, a physically meaningful 3-parametric trial function is used to determine the ground state energy $E$ of the system. This trial function incorporates the exact symmetries and key limiting behaviors of the problem explicitly. In particular, it does not treat the Coulomb potential nor the magnetic interaction as a \textit{perturbation}. The novel inclusion of a variational cut-off factor $\big(1 - \big(\frac{\rho}{\rho_0}\big)^\nu\big)$, $\nu \geq 1$, appears to represent a significant improvement compared to the non-variational cut-off factors commonly employed in the literature. A phenomenon of a sharp change of $\nu-$behavior for small magnetic fields $B \lesssim 0.45\,a.u.$ with fixed radius $\rho_0 \approx 2\,a.u.$ is indicated. The dependence of the total energy $E=E(\rho_0,\,B)$ and the binding energy $E_b=E_b(\rho_0,\,B)$ on the cavity radius $\rho_0 \in [0.8,\,5] \,a.u.$ and the magnetic field strength $B\in [0,\,1]\, a.u.$ is presented in detail. The expectation values $\langle \rho \rangle$ and $\langle|z| \rangle$, and the Shannon entropy in position space are computed to provide additional insights into the system's localization.

            <p>A group of techniques known by the general name of single-molecule localization microscopy reaches a nanometer-scale spatial resolution of point light emitters, well below the diffraction limit of the traditional microscopy. The key feature of these techniques is blinking, alternation of bright and dark states, of each emitter so that no more than one emitter is bright within the width of the point-spread function of the microscope during a time sufficient for its localization. We give a formulation of the optical part of these techniques in terms of quantum metrology, where the limit of precision is determined by the Fisher information on the emitters positions contained in the measurement data. We show that the advantage in resolution provided by making the emitters blink is a consequence of the fundamental property of Fisher information, its convexity. In particular, we prove the weak matrix convexity and the trace convexity of the Fisher information matrix -- two fundamental results in the multiparameter estimation theory. We show also that the advantage in information is inherent to the quantum state of light itself before the measurement and is related to the convexity of the quantum Fisher information matrix.</p>

            <p>Chromatic quantum contextuality is a criterion for quantum nonclassicality characterized by (hyper)graph coloring constraints. By examining the 3-uniform Yu-Oh hypergraph -- a configuration of quantum observables -- we prove its chromatic number exceeds the classical three-color limit. This result establishes chromatic contextuality as a distinct form of quantum nonclassicality, diverging from Kochen-Specker-type arguments that rely on the absence of two-valued states. Crucially, the Yu-Oh hypergraph exhibits this behavior even when separable two-valued states exist, demonstrating that chromatic contextuality operates independently of traditional noncontextuality violations. Our findings underscore hypergraph coloring as a powerful framework for identifying quantum signatures, enriching the understanding of contextuality beyond conventional paradigms.</p>

            <p>We investigate the charging dynamics of a frequency-modulated quantum battery (QB) placed within a dissipative cavity environment. Our study focuses on the interaction of such a battery under both weak and strong coupling regimes, employing a model in which the quantum battery and charger are represented as frequency-modulated qubits indirectly coupled through a zero-temperature environment. It is demonstrated that both the modulation frequency and amplitude are crucial for optimizing the charging process and the ergotropy of the quantum battery. Specifically, high-amplitude, low-frequency modulation significantly enhances charging performance and work extraction in the strong coupling regime. As an intriguing result, it is deduced that modulation at very low frequencies leads to the emergence of energy storage and work extraction in the weak coupling regime. Such a result can never be achieved without modulation in the weak coupling regime. These results highlight the importance of adjusting modulation parameters to optimize the performance of quantum batteries for real-world applications in quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>Variational Quantum Eigensolvers (VQEs) are a powerful class of hybrid quantum-classical algorithms designed to approximate the ground state of a quantum system described by its Hamiltonian. VQEs hold promise for various applications, including lattice field theory. However, the inherent noise of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices poses a significant challenge for running VQEs as these algorithms are particularly susceptible to noise, e.g., measurement shot noise and hardware noise. In a recent work, it was proposed to enhance the classical optimization of VQEs with Gaussian Processes (GPs) and Bayesian Optimization, as these machine-learning techniques are well-suited for handling noisy data. In these proceedings, we provide additional insights into this new algorithm and present further numerical experiments. In particular, we examine the impact of hardware noise and error mitigation on the algorithm's performance. We validate the algorithm using classical simulations of quantum hardware, including hardware noise benchmarks, which have not been considered in previous works. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that GP-enhanced algorithms can outperform state-of-the-art baselines, laying the foundation for future research on deploying these techniques to real quantum hardware and lattice field theory setups.</p>

            <p>We show that iteration of a few ( $\sim N^{1/4}$) unitary steps of Grover's algorithm suffices to perfectly prepare a Dicke state of $N$ atoms in a cavity. We also show that a few subsequent Grover steps can be employed to generate GHZ and Cat states. The Grover iteration is physically realized by global qubit rotations and by the phase shift of single photons reflected on the cavity. Our protocols are deterministic and require no individual addressing of the atoms. A detailed error analysis accounting for spatial mode matching of the photon to the cavity, spontaneous emission, mirror scattering, and the finite bandwidth of the photon mode is used to predict the fidelity of the prepared states as a function of system parameters and atom-cavity cooperativity. The fidelity can be increased by heralding on detection of the reflected photon.</p>

            <h2>Fidelity Strange Correlators for Average Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jian-Hao Zhang, Yang Qi, Zhen Bi</p>
            <p>Topological phases in open quantum systems have become an exciting area of research, driven by the rising importance of noisy intermediate-scale quantum platforms. The concept of Average Symmetry-Protected Topological (ASPT) phases extends symmetry-protected topological phases to quantum systems affected by disorder or decoherence. To identify nontrivial ASPT states, we introduce a "fidelity strange correlator" (FSC), which operates directly on a single bulk density matrix without boundaries. For nontrivial ASPT phases in one and two dimensions, we show that the FSC reveals long-range or power-law behavior. In several two-dimensional examples, we establish a link between the FSC and certain non-local correlation functions in statistical loop models with quantum corrections, enabling us to derive exact scaling exponents for the FSC. In addition, we discuss methods to measure the FSC using classical shadow tomography. Our work lays the groundwork for identifying these intriguing topological phases of matter in open quantum systems, both numerically and experimentally.</p>

            <p>Anisotropy endows topological aspects in optical systems and furnishes a platform to explore non-Hermitian physics, which can be harnessed for the polarization-selective amplification of light. Here, we show a zero-threshold Raman laser can be achieved in an anisotropic optical microcavity via polarization-controlled optical pumping. A loss-gain mechanism between two polarized Stokes modes arises naturally via polarization-dependent stimulated scattering and anisotropic Raman gain of the active layered material inside the microcavity. A Parity-Time (PT) symmetric Hamiltonian has been proposed to explain the emergence of a single polarization mode, essential for achieving a zero-threshold lasing condition. Additionally, intensity correlation measurements of the Stokes modes validate the coherence properties of the emitted light. Our realization of the zero-threshold Raman laser in anisotropic microcavity can open up a new research direction exploring non-Hermitian and topological aspects of light in anisotropic two-dimensional materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shi-Yuan Ma, Tianyu Wang, Jérémie Laydevant, Logan G. Wright, Peter L. McMahon</p>
            <p>Energy efficiency in computation is ultimately limited by noise, with quantum limits setting the fundamental noise floor. Analog physical neural networks hold promise for improved energy efficiency compared to digital electronic neural networks. However, they are typically operated in a relatively high-power regime so that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is large, and the noise can be treated as a perturbation. We study optical neural networks where all layers except the last are operated in the limit that each neuron can be activated by just a single photon, and as a result the noise on neuron activations is no longer merely perturbative. We show that by using a physics-based probabilistic model of the neuron activations in training, it is possible to perform accurate machine-learning inference in spite of the extremely high shot noise (SNR ~ 1). We experimentally demonstrated MNIST handwritten-digit classification with a test accuracy of 98% using an optical neural network with a hidden layer operating in the single-photon regime; the optical energy used to perform the classification corresponds to just 0.038 photons per multiply-accumulate (MAC) operation. Our physics-aware stochastic training approach might also prove useful with non-optical ultra-low-power hardware.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Márton Naszódi, Zsombor Szilágyi, Mihály Weiner</p>
            <p>Motivated by general probability theory, we say that the set $S$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is \emph{antipodal of rank $k$}, if for any $k+1$ elements $q_1,\ldots q_{k+1}\in S$, there is an affine map from $\mathrm{conv}(S)$ to the $k$-dimensional simplex $\Delta_k$ that maps $q_1,\ldots q_{k+1}$ bijectively onto the $k+1$ vertices of $\Delta_k$. For $k=1$, it coincides with the well-studied notion of (pairwise) antipodality introduced by Klee. We consider the following natural generalization of Klee's problem on antipodal sets: What is the maximum size of an antipodal set of rank $k$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$? We present a geometric characterization of antipodal sets of rank $k$ and adapting the argument of Danzer and Grünbaum originally developed for the $k=1$ case, we prove an upper bound which is exponential in the dimension. We show that this problem can be connected to a classical question in computer science on finding perfect hashes, and it provides a lower bound on the maximum size, which is also exponential in the dimension. By connecting rank-$k$ antipodality to $k$-neighborly polytopes, we obtain another upper bound when $k>d/2$.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Antonio M. García-García, Lucas Sá, Jacobus J. M. Verbaarschot, Can Yin</p>
            <p>The identification, description, and classification of topological features is an engine of discovery and innovation in several fields of physics. This research encompasses a broad variety of systems, from the integer and fractional Chern insulators in condensed matter, to protected states in complex photonic lattices in optics, and the structure of the QCD vacuum. Here, we introduce another playground for topology: the dissipative dynamics of pseudo-Hermitian many-body quantum systems. For that purpose, we study two different systems, the dissipative Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, and a quantum chaotic dephasing spin chain. For the two different many-body models, we find the same topological features for a wide range of parameters suggesting that they are universal. In the SYK model, we identify four universality classes, related to pseudo-Hermiticity, characterized by a rectangular block representation of the vectorized Liouvillian that is directly related to the existence of an anomalous trace of the unitary operator implementing fermionic exchange. As a consequence of this rectangularization, we identify a topological index $\nu$ that only depends on symmetry. Another distinct consequence of the rectangularization is the observation, for any coupling to the bath, of purely real topological modes in the Liouvillian. The level statistics of these real modes agree with that of the corresponding random matrix ensemble and therefore can be employed to characterize the four topological symmetry classes. In the limit of weak coupling to the bath, topological modes govern the approach to equilibrium, which may enable a direct path for experimental confirmation of topology in dissipative many-body quantum chaotic systems.</p>

            <p>We systematically study gapless edge modes corresponding to $\mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases of two-dimensional three-state Potts paramagnets on a triangular lattice. First, we derive microscopic lattice models for the gapless edge and, using the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) approach, investigate the finite-size scaling of the low-lying excitation spectrum and the entanglement entropy. Based on the obtained results, we identify the universality class of the critical edge, namely the corresponding conformal field theory and the central charge. Finally, we discuss the inherent symmetries of the edge models and the emergent winding number symmetry. As a result, one-dimensional chains with this symmetry form a model that supports gapless excitations due to its tricritical symmetry. Numerically, we show that low-energy states in the continuous limit of the edge model can be described by conformal field theory (CFT) with central charge $c=1$, given by the coset $SU_k(3)/SU_k(2)$ CFT at level k=1.</p>

We find that the experiment has the best sensitivity to the gauge coupling when the gauge boson is within the mass range of $0.01\,$eV to $10\,$eV, which is an interesting mass region for the Féeton dark matter. This opens up a new avenue for the measurement of new physics at small scale below millimeter.</p>

            <p>We consider a fermionic quantum system exchanging particles with an environment at a fixed temperature and study its reduced evolution by means of a Redfield-I equation with time-dependent (non-Markovian) coefficients. We find that the description can be efficiently reduced to a standard-form Redfield-II equation, however, with a time-dependent effective bath temperature obeying a universal law. At early times, after the system and environment start in a product state, the effective temperature appears to be very high, yet eventually it settles down towards the true environment value. In this way, we obtain a time-local master equation, offering high accuracy at all times and preserving the crucial properties of the density matrix. It includes non-Markovian relaxation processes beyond the secular approximation and time-averaging methods and can be further applied to various types of Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad equations. We derive the theory from first principles and discuss its application using a simple example of a single quantum dot.</p>

            <p>Quantum systems with SU($N$) symmetry are paradigmatic settings for quantum many-body physics. They have been studied for the insights they provide into complex materials and their ability to stabilize exotic ground states. Ultracold alkaline-earth atoms were predicted to exhibit SU($N$) symmetry for $N=2I+1=1,2,\ldots,10$, where $I$ is the nuclear spin. Subsequent experiments have revealed rich many-body physics. However, alkaline-earth atoms realize this symmetry only for fermions with repulsive interactions. In this paper, we predict that ultracold molecules shielded from destructive collisions with static electric fields or microwaves exhibit SU($N$) symmetry, which holds because deviations of the s-wave scattering length from the spin-free values are only about 3\% for CaF with static-field shielding and are estimated to be even smaller for bialkali molecules. They open the door to $N$ as large as $32$ for bosons and $36$ for fermions. They offer important features unachievable with atoms, including bosonic systems and attractive interactions.</p>

The observed weak temperature dependence of the detector's performance in the sub-kelvin range fully confirms its phase-diffusion mode of operation. On the other hand, these results show that inevitable thermal fluctuations are not the main source of the detector noise. Consequently, there is still a room to optimize the detector's performance. These results are important for axion search experiments in the range of 5-25 GHz (20-100 $\mu$eV).</p>

            <p>The competition between unitary quantum dynamics and dissipative stochastic effects, as emerging from continuous-monitoring processes, can culminate in measurement-induced phase transitions. Here, a many-body system abruptly passes, when exceeding a critical measurement rate, from a highly entangled phase to a low-entanglement one. We consider a different perspective on entanglement phase transitions and explore whether these can emerge when the measurement process itself is modified, while keeping the measurement rate fixed. To illustrate this idea, we consider a noninteracting fermionic system and focus on diffusive detection processes. Through extensive numerical simulations, we show that, upon varying a suitable \textit{unraveling parameter} -- interpolating between measurements of different quadrature operators -- the system displays a transition from a phase with area-law entanglement to one where entanglement scales logarithmically with the system size. Our findings may be relevant for tailoring quantum correlations in noisy quantum devices and for conceiving optimal classical simulation strategies.</p>

It provides the foundation to discern van der Waals and induction energies as well as the role of anisotropy and different stacking patterns when computing dispersive interactions in systems. Calculated results for binding energies in benchmarked materials and layered materials, such as graphite, hBN, and MoS$_2$ give encouraging comparisons with available experimental data. Strategies for broadened computational descriptions of dispersive interactions are also discussed. Our investigation aims at stimulating new experimental studies to measure van der Waals energies in a wider range of materials, especially in layered systems.</p>

            <p>Enhanced experimental capabilities to control nonlocal and power-law decaying interactions are currently fuelling intense research in the domain of quantum many-body physics. Compared to their counterparts with short-ranged interactions, long-range interacting systems display novel physics, such as nonlinear light cones for the propagation of information or inequivalent thermodynamic ensembles. In this work, we consider generic long-range open quantum systems in arbitrary dimensions and focus on the so-called strong long-range regime. We prove that in the thermodynamic limit local properties, captured by reduced quantum states, are described by an emergent non-interacting theory. Here, the dynamics factorizes and the individual constituents of the system evolve independently such that no correlations are generated over time. In this sense, long-range interacting systems are locally non-interacting. This has significant implications for their relaxation behavior, for instance in relation to the emergence of long-lived quasi-stationary states or to the absence of thermalization.</p>

            <p>We investigate the topological phases of the Haldane model on the Sierpiński gasket. As a consequence of the fractal geometry, multiple fractal gaps arise. Additionally, a flat band appears, and due to a complex next-nearest neighbour hopping, this band splits and multiple topological flux-induced gaps emerge. Owing to the fractal nature of the model, conventional momentum-space topological invariants cannot be used. Therefore, we characterise the system's topology in terms of a real-space Chern number. In addition, we verify the robustness of the topological states to disorder. Finally, we present phase diagrams for both a fractal gap and a flux-induced gap. Previous work on a similar system claims that fractality "squeezes" the well-known Haldane phase diagram. However, this result arises because a doubled system was considered with two Sierpiński gaskets glued together. We consider only a single copy of the Sierpiński gasket, keeping global self-similarity. In contrast with these previous results, we find intricate and complex patterns in the phase diagram of this single fractal. Our work shows that the fractality of the model greatly influences the phase space of these structures, and can drive topological phases in the multitude of fractal and flux-induced gaps, providing a richer platform than a conventional integer dimensional geometry.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Friedrich Hübner, Eric Vernier, Lorenzo Piroli</p>
            <p>Quantum circuits make it possible to simulate the continuous-time dynamics of a many-body Hamiltonian by implementing discrete Trotter steps of duration $\tau$. However, when $\tau$ is sufficiently large, the discrete dynamics exhibit qualitative differences compared to the original evolution, potentially displaying novel features and many-body effects. We study an interesting example of this phenomenon, by considering the integrable Trotterization of a prototypical integrable model, the XXZ Heisenberg spin chain. We focus on the well-known bipartition protocol, where two halves of a large system are prepared in different macrostates and suddenly joined together, yielding non-trivial nonequilibrium dynamics. Building upon recent results and adapting the generalized hydrodynamics (GHD) of integrable models, we develop an exact large-scale description of an explicit one-dimensional quantum-circuit setting, where the input left and right qubits are initialized in two distinct product states. We explore the phenomenology predicted by the GHD equations, which depend on the Trotter step and the gate parameters. In some phases of the parameter space, we show that the quantum-circuit large-scale dynamics is qualitatively different compared to the continuous-time evolution. In particular, we find that a single microscopic defect at the junction, such as the addition of a single qubit, may change the nonequilibrium macrostate appearing at late time.</p>

            <p>We outline a fundamentally quantum description of bosonic dark matter (DM) from which the conventional classical-wave picture emerges in the limit $m \ll 10~\textrm{eV}$. As appropriate for a quantum system, we start from the density matrix which encodes the full information regarding the possible measurements we could make of DM and their fluctuations. Following fundamental results in quantum optics, we argue that for DM it is most likely that the density matrix takes the explicitly mixed form of a Gaussian over the basis of coherent states. Deviations from this would generate non-Gaussian fluctuations in DM observables, allowing a direct probe of the quantum state of DM. Our quantum optics inspired approach allows us to rigorously define and interpret various quantities that are often only described heuristically, such as the coherence time or length. The formalism further provides a continuous description of DM through the wave-particle transition, which we exploit to study how density fluctuations over various physical scales evolve between the two limits and to reveal the unique behavior of DM near the boundary of the wave and particle descriptions.</p>

            <p>Open systems that are weakly coupled to a thermal environment and driven by fast, periodically oscillating fields are commonly assumed to approach an equilibrium-like steady state with respect to a truncated Floquet-Magnus Hamiltonian. Using a general argument based on Fermi's golden rule, we show that such Floquet-Gibbs states emerge naturally in periodically modulated Rydberg atomic systems, whose lab-frame Hamiltonian is a quasiperiodic function of time. Our approach applies as long as the inherent Bohr frequencies of the system, the modulation frequency and the frequency of the driving laser, which is necessary to uphold high-lying Rydberg excitations, are well separated. To corroborate our analytical results, we analyze a realistic model of up to five interacting Rydberg atoms with periodically changing detuning. We demonstrate numerically that the second-order Floquet-Gibbs state of this system is essentially indistinguishable from the steady state of the corresponding Redfield equation if the modulation and driving frequencies are sufficiently large.</p>

Thus, by virtue of the argued completeness of the contraction map proof method, the problem of finding all holographic entropy inequalities is equivalent to the problem of finding all contraction maps, which we translate to a problem of finding all image graph partial cubes. We give an algorithmic solution to this problem and characterize the complexity of our method. We also demonstrate interesting by-products, most notably, a procedure to generate candidate quantum entropy inequalities.</p>

            <p>Superconductor-normal material-superconductor (SNS) junctions are being integrated into microwave circuits for fundamental and applied research goals. The short junction limit is a common simplifying assumption for experiments with SNS junctions, but this limit constrains how small the nonlinearity of the microwave circuit can be. Here, we show that a finite length of the weak link strongly suppresses the nonlinearity compared to its zero-length limit -- the suppression can be up to a factor of ten even when the length remains shorter than the induced coherence length. We tie this behavior to the nonanalytic dependence of nonlinearity on length, which the critical current does not exhibit. Further, we identify additional experimentally observable consequences of nonzero length, and we conjecture that anharmonicity is bounded between zero and a maximally negative value for any non-interacting Josephson junction in the presence of time-reversal symmetry. We promote SNS junction length as a useful parameter for designing weakly nonlinear microwave circuits.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we consider the time evolution of entanglement asymmetry of the black hole radiation in the Hayden-Preskill thought experiment. We assume the black hole is initially in a mixed state since it is entangled with the early radiation. Alice throws a diary maximally entangled with a reference system into the black hole. After the black hole has absorbed the diary, Bob tries to recover the information that Alice thought should be destroyed by the black hole. In this protocol, we found that a $U(1)$ symmetry of the radiation emerges before a certain transition time (the time when the vanishing entanglement asymmetry begins to grow). This emergent symmetry is exact in the thermodynamic limit and can be characterized by the vanishing entanglement asymmetry of the radiation. The transition time depends on the initial entropy and the size of the diary. What's more, when the initial state of the black hole is maximally mixed, this emergent symmetry survives during the whole procedure of the black hole radiation. We successfully explained this novel phenomenon using the decoupling inequality.</p>

            <p>This paper introduces the concept of a generating set for stochastic matrices -- a subset of matrices whose repeated composition generates the entire set. Understanding such generating sets requires specifying the "indivisible elements" and "building blocks" within the set, which serve as fundamental components of the generation process. Expanding upon prior studies, we develop a framework that formalizes divisibility in the context of stochastic matrices. We provide a sufficient condition for divisibility that is shown to be necessary in dimension $n=3$, while for $n=2$, all stochastic matrices are shown to be divisible. Using these results, we construct generating sets for dimensions 2 and 3 by specifying the indivisible elements, and, importantly, we give an upper bound for the number of factors required from the generating set to produce the entire semigroup.</p>

            <h2>Structure of Quantum Mean Force Gibbs States for Coupled Harmonic Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joonhyun Yeo, Haena Shim</p>
            <p>An open quantum system interacting with a heat bath at given temperature is expected to reach the mean force Gibbs (MFG) state as a steady state. The MFG state is given by tracing out the bath degrees of freedom from the equilibrium Gibbs state of the total system plus bath. When the interaction between the system and the bath is not negligible, it is different from the usual system Gibbs state obtained from the system Hamiltonian only. Using the path integral method, we present the exact MFG state for a coupled system of quantum harmonic oscillators in contact with multiple thermal baths at the same temperature. We develop a nonperturbative method to calculate the covariances with respect to the MFG state. By comparing them with those obtained from the system Gibbs state, we find that the effect of coupling to the bath decays exponentially as a function of the distance from the system-bath boundary. This is similar to the skin effect found recently for a quantum spin chain interacting with an environment. Using the exact results, we also investigate the ultrastrong coupling limit where the coupling between the system and the bath gets arbitrarily large and make a connection with the recent result found for a general quantum system.</p>

            <h2>Metric Field as Emergence of Hilbert Space</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maysam Yousefian, Mehrdad Farhoudi</p>
            <p>First, we explain some ambiguities of spacetime and metric field as fundamental concepts. Then, from the Unruh effect point of view and using the Gelfand-Naimark-Segal construction, we construct an operator as a quanta of acceleration that we call quantum acceleration operator (QAO). Thereupon, we investigate the relation between the vacuum of two different frames in the Minkowski space. Also, we show that the vacuum of each accelerated frame in the Minkowski space can be obtained by applying such a QAO to the Minkowski vacuum. Furthermore, utilizing these QAOs, we augment the Hilbert space and then extract the metric field of a general frame of the Minkowski spacetime. In this approach, these concepts emerge from the Hilbert space through the constructed QAOs. Accordingly, such an augmented Hilbert space includes quantum field theory in a general frame and can be considered as a fundamental concept instead of the classical metric field and the standard Hilbert space.</p>

            <h2>Brickwall One-Loop Determinant: Spectral Statistics & Krylov Complexity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hyun-Sik Jeong, Arnab Kundu, Juan F. Pedraza</p>
            <p>We investigate quantum chaotic features of the brickwall model, which is obtained by introducing a stretched horizon -- a Dirichlet wall placed outside the event horizon -- within the BTZ geometry. This simple yet effective model has been shown to capture key properties of quantum black holes and is motivated by the stringy fuzzball proposal. We analyze the dynamics of both scalar and fermionic probe fields, deriving their normal mode spectra with Gaussian-distributed boundary conditions on the stretched horizon. By interpreting these normal modes as energy eigenvalues, we examine spectral statistics, including level spacing distributions, the spectral form factor, and Krylov state complexity as diagnostics for quantum chaos. Our results show that the brickwall model exhibits features consistent with random matrix theory across various ensembles as the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution is varied. Specifically, we observe Wigner-Dyson distributions, a linear ramp in the spectral form factor, and a characteristic peak in Krylov complexity, all without the need for a classical interior geometry. We also demonstrate that non-vanishing spectral rigidity alone is sufficient to produce a peak in Krylov complexity, without requiring Wigner-Dyson level repulsion. Finally, we identify signatures of integrability at extreme values of the Dirichlet boundary condition parameter.</p>

            <h2>A posteriori error estimates for the Lindblad master equation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paul-Louis Etienney, Rémi Robin, Pierre Rouchon</p>
            <p>We are interested in the simulation of open quantum systems governed by the Lindblad master equation in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. To simulate the solution of this equation, the standard approach involves two sequential approximations: first, we truncate the Hilbert space to derive a differential equation in a finite-dimensional subspace. Then, we use discrete time-step to obtain a numerical solution to the finite-dimensional evolution. In this paper, we establish bounds for these two approximations that can be explicitely computed to guarantee the accuracy of the numerical results. Through numerical examples, we demonstrate the efficiency of our method, empirically highlighting the tightness of the upper bound. While adaptive time-stepping is already a common practice in the time discretization of the Lindblad equation, we extend this approach by showing how to dynamically adjust the truncation of the Hilbert space. This enables fully adaptive simulations of the density matrix. For large-scale simulations, this approach significantly reduces computational time and relieves users of the challenge of selecting an appropriate truncation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ying Chen, Paul Griffin, Paolo Recchia, Zhou Lei, Hongrui Zhang</p>
            <p>Recovery rate prediction plays a pivotal role in bond investment strategies, enhancing risk assessment, optimizing portfolio allocation, improving pricing accuracy, and supporting effective credit risk management. However, forecasting faces challenges like high-dimensional features, small sample sizes, and overfitting. We propose a hybrid Quantum Machine Learning model incorporating Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PQC) within a neural network framework. PQCs inherently preserve unitarity, avoiding computationally costly orthogonality constraints, while amplitude encoding enables exponential data compression, reducing qubit requirements logarithmically. Applied to a global dataset of 1,725 observations (1996-2023), our method achieved superior accuracy (RMSE 0.228) compared to classical neural networks (0.246) and quantum models with angle encoding (0.242), with efficient computation times. This work highlights the potential of hybrid quantum-classical architectures in advancing recovery rate forecasting.</p>

            <h2>The foot, the fan, and the cuprate phase diagram: Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Subir Sachdev</p>
            <p>A Fermi liquid with a `large' Fermi surface (FL) can have a quantum phase transition to a spin density wave state (SDW) with reconstructed `small' Fermi pockets. Both FL and SDW phases obey the Luttinger constraints on the volume enclosed by the Fermi surfaces. The critical spin fluctuations lead to spin-singlet $d$-wave pairing, as observed in the cuprates. Studies of the influence of spatial disorder on the SDW-FL quantum phase transition predict an extended quantum-critical Griffiths-type phase at low temperatures on the large Fermi surface side. These computations agree with the `foot' seen in transport, and recent low temperature neutron scattering observations on La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$. However, this theory cannot explain the higher temperature pseudogap and the `fan' of strange metal of the hole-doped cuprates. Here we need to consider underlying Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions without symmetry breaking. Then the small Fermi surface phase does not obey the Luttinger constraint, and is instead a `fractionalized Fermi liquid' (FL*). A theory of FL* in single band models describes photoemission observations in the pseudogap phase. The field theory for FL*-FL quantum phase transition in the presence of spatial disorder is mapped to a form which can be analyzed using the methods of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. Such an analysis successfully describes linear-in-temperature resistivity, optical conductivity and thermopower observations. The confinement crossover connecting these lower and higher temperature descriptions is also discussed.</p>

            <p>The development of color centers in silicon enables scalable quantum technologies by combining telecom-wavelength emission and compatibility with mature silicon fabrication. However, large-scale integration requires precise control of each emitter's optical transition to generate indistinguishable photons for quantum networking. Here, we demonstrate a foundry-fabricated photonic integrated circuit (PIC) combining suspended silicon waveguides with a microelectromechanical (MEMS) cantilever to apply local strain and spectrally tune individual G-centers. Applying up to 35 V between the cantilever and the substrate induces a reversible wavelength shift of the zero-phonon line exceeding 100 pm, with no loss in brightness. Moreover, by modeling the strain-induced shifts with a `digital twin' physical model, we achieve vertical localization of color centers with sub-3 nm vertical resolution, directly correlating their spatial position, dipole orientation, and spectral behavior. This method enables on-demand, low-power control of emission spectrum and nanoscale localization of color centers, advancing quantum networks on a foundry-compatible platform.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kamil Khadiev, Aliya Khadieva, Zeyu Chen, Junde Wu</p>
            <p>In the paper, we consider quantum circuits for Quantum fingerprinting (quantum hashing) and quantum Fourier transform (QFT) algorithms. Quantum fingerprinting (quantum hashing) is a well-known technique for comparing large objects using small images. The QFT algorithm is a very popular technique used in many algorithms. We present a generic method for constructing quantum circuits for these algorithms for quantum devices with restrictions. Many quantum devices (for example, based on superconductors) have restrictions on applying two-qubit gates. The restrictions are presented by a qubits connection graph. Typically, researchers consider only the linear nearest neighbor (LNN) architecture, but current devices have more complex graphs. We present a method for arbitrary connected graphs that minimizes the number of CNOT gates in the circuit. The heuristic version of the method is fast enough and works with $O(n^5)$ time complexity, where $n$ is the number of qubits. The certain version of the algorithm has an exponential time complexity that is $O(n^22^n)$. We compare quantum circuits built by our algorithm with quantum circuits optimized for specific graphs that are Linear-nearest-neighbor (LNN) architecture, ``sun'' (a cycle with tails, presented by 16-qubit IBMQ device) and ``two joint suns'' (two joint cycles with tails, presented by 27-qubit IBMQ device). Our generic method gives similar results with little bit more CNOT gates. At the same time, our method allows us to construct a circuit for arbitrary connected graphs.</p>

            <h2>Bridging Entanglement and Magic Resources through Operator Space</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Neil Dowling, Kavan Modi, Gregory A. L. White</p>
            <p>Local operator entanglement (LOE) dictates the complexity of simulating Heisenberg evolution using tensor network methods, and serves as strong dynamical signature of quantum chaos. We show that LOE is also sensitive to how non-Clifford a unitary is: its magic resources. In particular, we prove that LOE is always upper-bound by three distinct magic monotones: $T$-count, unitary nullity, and operator stabilizer Rényi entropy. Moreover, in the average case for large, random circuits, LOE and magic monotones approximately coincide. Our results imply that an operator evolution that is expensive to simulate using tensor network methods must also be inefficient using both stabilizer and Pauli truncation methods. A direct corollary of our bounds is that any quantum chaotic dynamics cannot be simulated classically. Entanglement in operator space therefore measures a unified picture of non-classical resources, in stark contrast to the Schrödinger picture.</p>

We also show that a few subsequent Grover steps can be employed to generate GHZ and Cat states. The Grover iteration is physically realized by global qubit rotations and by the phase shift of single photons reflected on the cavity. Our protocols are deterministic and require no individual addressing of the atoms. A detailed error analysis accounting for spatial mode matching of the photon to the cavity, spontaneous emission, mirror scattering, and the finite bandwidth of the photon mode is used to predict the fidelity of the prepared states as a function of system parameters and atom-cavity cooperativity. The fidelity can be increased by heralding on detection of the reflected photon.</p>

            <p>Cathodoluminescence spectroscopy has recently emerged as a novel platform for nanoscale control of nonclassical features of light. Here, we propose a theoretical model for cathodoluminescence from a multi-level quantum emitter. Employing a master equation approach and treating the electron-beam excitation as an incoherent broadband field source, we show that quantum interference can arise between the different relaxation pathways. The induced-interference can significantly modify the time-dependent spectra resulting in the enhancement or suppression of cathodoluminescence. We find that the excitation rate, initial state of the emitter, and excited level spacing play a crucial role in determining the influence of interference. Our findings shed light on electron-beam-induced quantum interference in cathodoluminescence and provides a theoretical basis for exploring quantum optical phenomena in electron-driven multi-level systems.</p>

We consider a one-photon input pulse and show some optimal scenarios, where exact formulas and numerical results are obtained for the absorption probabilities and the optimal pulse shapes. In particular, if the external loss dominates the internal loss of the cavity, we find the optimal cooperativity for different parameters and identify cases where absorption with a success probability larger than $99%$ is achieved.</p>

            <p>Artificial magnetic fields break time-reversal symmetry in engineered materials--also known as metamaterials, enabling robust, topological transport of neutral excitations, much like electronic conduction edge channels in the integer quantum Hall effect. We experimentally demonstrate the emergence of quantum-Hall-like chiral edge states in optomechanical resonator networks. Synthetic magnetic fields for phononic excitations are induced through laser drives, while cavity optomechanical control allows full reconfigurability of the effective metamaterial response of the networks, including programming of magnetic fluxes in multiple resonator plaquettes. By tuning the interplay between network connectivity and magnetic fields, we demonstrate both flux-sensitive and flux-insensitive localized mechanical states. Scaling up the system creates spectral features that are precursors to Hofstadter butterfly spectra. Site-resolved spectroscopy reveals edge-bulk separation, with stationary phononic distributions signaling chiral edge modes. We directly probe those edge modes in transport measurements to demonstrate a unidirectional acoustic channel. This work unlocks new ways of controlling topological phononic phases at the nanoscale with applications in noise management and information processing.</p>

Previous work proposed that such a pump could be realized with a strongly-driven superconducting qubit coupled to a cavity. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that the proposed hierarchy of energy scales and drive frequencies can be realized using a transmon qubit. We develop an experimental toolkit to realize the adiabatic driving field required for energy pumping using coordinated frequency modulation of the transmon and amplitude modulation of an applied resonant microwave drive. With this toolkit, we measure adiabatic evolution of the qubit under the applied field for times comparable to $T_1$, which far exceed the bare qubit dephasing time. This result paves the way for direct experimental observation of topological energy pumping.</p>

            <p>Quantum computing with superconducting circuits relies on high-fidelity driven nonlinear processes. An ideal quantum nonlinearity would selectively activate desired coherent processes at high strength, without activating parasitic mixing products or introducing additional decoherence. The wide bandwidth of the Josephson nonlinearity makes this difficult, with undesired drive-induced transitions and decoherence limiting qubit readout, gates, couplers and amplifiers. Significant strides have been recently made into building better `quantum mixers', with promise being shown by Kerr-free three-wave mixers that suppress driven frequency shifts, and balanced quantum mixers that explicitly forbid a significant fraction of parasitic processes. We propose a novel mixer that combines both these strengths, with engineered selection rules that make it essentially linear (not just Kerr-free) when idle, and activate clean parametric processes even when driven at high strength. Further, its ideal Hamiltonian is simple to analyze analytically, and we show that this ideal behavior is first-order insensitive to dominant experimental imperfections. We expect this mixer to allow significant advances in high-Q control, readout, and amplification.</p>

The harmonic oscillator is in a quantum superposition of two frequencies and only one of these states can excite the trapped particle via resonance. Once the excited particle is detected, the quantum state of the oscillator is collapsed, which can be observed as the sudden disappearance of the superposition of oscillator frequencies. Thus, the sudden decoherence, which is only triggered by particle detection, can be a smoking gun evidence of gravity-induced entanglement. Since the probability of particle excitation increases linearly with time, the total probability is multiplied by repeating experiments. We will also discuss experimental implementations using optomechanics.</p>

            <p>The preparation of highly entangled states involving multiparticle systems is of crucial importance in quantum physics, playing a fundamental role in exploring the nature of quantum mechanics and offering essential quantum resources for nascent quantum technologies that surpass classical limits. Here we present how to generate and manipulate tripartite entangled state of photons, phonons, and magnons within a hybrid cavity magnomechanical system. It is shown that by simultaneously applying two coherent driving fields to this system in opposite input directions, it enables a coherent and effective way to regulate the magnomechanical interaction by tuning the phase difference of the driving fields. Based on this feature, it is found that the tripartite entanglement also becomes phase-dependent and can be enhanced for certain phase difference. More interestingly, it is shown that the robustness of tripartite entanglement against environmental thermal noises can also be improved by choosing proper phase difference of the driving fields. Our findings open up a promising way to manipulate and protect fragile tripartite entanglement, which is applicable to a wide range of quantum protocols that require multipartite entangled resources such as quantum communication and quantum metrology.</p>

This direct CCZ gate is implemented by simultaneously leveraging two tunable couplers interspersed between three qubits to enable three-qubit interactions, achieving an average final state fidelity of $97.94\%$ and a process fidelity of $93.54\%$. This high fidelity cannot be achieved through a simple combination of single- and two-qubit gate sequences from processors with similar performance levels. Our experiments also verify that multi-layer direct implementation of the CCZ gate exhibits lower leakage compared to decomposed gate approaches. To further showcase the versatility of our approach, we construct a Toffoli gate by combining the CCZ gate with Hadamard gates. As a showcase, we utilize the CCZ gate as an oracle to implement the Grover search algorithm on three qubits, demonstrating high performance with the target probability amplitude significantly enhanced after two iterations. These results highlight the advantage of our approach, and facilitate the implementation of complex quantum circuits.</p>

            <p>Out-of-equilibrium phases in many-body systems constitute a new paradigm in quantum matter - they exhibit dynamical properties that may otherwise be forbidden by equilibrium thermodynamics. Among these non-equilibrium phases are periodically driven (Floquet) systems [1-5], that are generically difficult to simulate classically due to their high entanglement. Using an array of superconducting qubits, we realize a Floquet topologically ordered state theoretically proposed in Ref. [6], image the characteristic dynamics of its chiral edge modes, and characterize its emergent anyonic excitations. Devising an interferometric algorithm allows us to introduce and measure a bulk topological invariant to probe the dynamical transmutation of anyons for system sizes up to 58 qubits. Our work demonstrates that quantum processors can provide key insights into the thus-far largely unexplored landscape of highly entangled non-equilibrium phases of matter.</p>

            <h2>The Floquet central spin model: A platform to realize eternal time crystals, entanglement steering, and multiparameter metrology</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hillol Biswas, Sayan Choudhury</p>
            <p>We propose and characterize protocols to realize eternal discrete time crystals (DTCs) in the periodically driven central spin model. These eternal DTCs exhibit perfect periodic revivals of the initial state at a time $mnT$ (where $n>1$ and $\{m,n\} \in \mathbb{Z}$), when the Ising interaction strength, $\lambda$ between the central spin and the satellite spins is tuned to certain values. The combination of perfect initial-state revival and time-translation-symmetry breaking leads to infinitely long-lived oscillations of the stroboscopic magnetization and the entanglement entropy in these DTCs even for a finite number of satellite spins. We analytically determine the conditions for the existence of these eternal DTCs and prove that the system exhibits eternal period-doubling oscillations ($n=2$) when $\lambda = 2 \pi$ for an arbitrary number of satellite spins. Furthermore, we propose a protocol to realize eternal higher-order(HO)-DTCs ($n>2$) by tuning $\lambda$ to $\pi$. Intriguingly, this protocol naturally steers the system through an entangled trajectory, thereby leading to the generation of maximally entangled Bell-cat states during the dynamical evolution of the HO-DTC. Finally, we demonstrate that these HO-DTCs can serve as a resource for Heisenberg-limited multiparameter sensing.</p>

            <p>The open Tavis-Cummings model consists of $N$ quantum emitters interacting with a common cavity mode, accounts for losses and decoherence, and is frequently explored for quantum information processing and designing quantum devices. As $N$ increases, it becomes harder to simulate the open Tavis-Cummings model using traditional methods. To address this problem, we implement two quantum algorithms for simulating the dynamics of this model in the inhomogenous, non-resonant regime, with up to three excitations in the cavity. We show that the implemented algorithms have gate complexities that scale polynomially, as $O(N^2)$ and $O(N^3)$. One of these algorithms is the sampling-based wave matrix Lindbladization algorithm, for which we propose two protocols to implement its system-independent fixed interaction, resolving key open questions of [Patel and Wilde, Open Sys. & Info. Dyn., 30:2350014 (2023)]. Furthermore, we benchmark our results against a classical differential equation solver and demonstrate the ability to simulate classically intractable systems.</p>

            <h2>Sample Classification using Machine Learning-Assisted Entangled Two-Photon Absorption</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Áulide Martínez-Tapia, Roberto de J. León-Montiel</p>
            <p>Entangled two-photon absorption (eTPA) has been recognized as a potentially powerful tool for the implementation of ultra-sensitive spectroscopy. Unfortunately, there exists a general agreement in the quantum optics community that experimental eTPA signals, particularly those obtained from molecular solutions, are extremely weak. Consequently, obtaining spectroscopic information about an arbitrary sample via conventional methods rapidly becomes an unrealistic endeavor. To address this problem, we introduce an experimental scheme that reduces the amount of data needed to identify and classify unknown samples via their electronic structure. Our proposed method makes use of machine learning (ML) to extract information about the number of intermediate levels that participate in the two-photon excitation of the absorbing medium. This is achieved by training artificial neural networks (ANNs) with various eTPA signals where the delay between the absorbed photons is externally controlled. Inspired by multiple experimental studies of eTPA, we consider model systems comprising one to four intermediate levels, whose energies are randomly chosen from four different intermediate-level band gaps, namely: $\Delta\lambda = 10$, $20$, $30$, and $40$ nm. Within these band gaps, and with the goal of testing the efficiency of our artificial intelligence algorithms, we make use of three different wavelength spacing $1$, $0.5$ and $0.1$ nm. We find that for a proper entanglement time between the absorbed photons, classification average efficiencies exceed 99$\%$ for all configurations. Our results demonstrate the potential of artificial neural networks for facilitating the experimental implementation of eTPA spectroscopy.</p>

            <p>Quantum simulations of many-body systems are among the most promising applications of quantum computers. In particular, models based on strongly-correlated fermions are central to our understanding of quantum chemistry and materials problems, and can lead to exotic, topological phases of matter. However, due to the non-local nature of fermions, such models are challenging to simulate with qubit devices. Here we realize a digital quantum simulation architecture for two-dimensional fermionic systems based on reconfigurable atom arrays. We utilize a fermion-to-qubit mapping based on Kitaev's model on a honeycomb lattice, in which fermionic statistics are encoded using long-range entangled states. We prepare these states efficiently using measurement and feedforward, realize subsequent fermionic evolution through Floquet engineering with tunable entangling gates interspersed with atom rearrangement, and improve results with built-in error detection. Leveraging this fermion description of the Kitaev spin model, we efficiently prepare topological states across its complex phase diagram and verify the non-Abelian spin liquid phase by evaluating an odd Chern number. We further explore this two-dimensional fermion system by realizing tunable dynamics and directly probing fermion exchange statistics. Finally, we simulate strong interactions and study dynamics of the Fermi-Hubbard model on a square lattice. These results pave the way for digital quantum simulations of complex fermionic systems for materials science, chemistry, and high-energy physics.</p>

            <h2>Gravitational waves decohere quantum superpositions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Flynn Linton, Shubhanshu Tiwari</p>
            <p>In this work, we study the decoherence of a quantum spatial superposition of a massive body created by an observer, Alice, that is subject to a short burst of gravitational radiation. We consider gravitational wave bursts with a simple oscillatory waveform and step-function memory waveform. Using a local description of the decoherence, we obtain an analytic estimate of the number of soft gravitons radiated by Alice's state. Moreover, we decompose her decoherence into contributions from the oscillatory and memory waveforms. We show that Alice's state decoheres proportional to the memory of the gravitational radiation she emits. To leading order, our calculation using a local description of the decoherence agrees with the decoherence caused by her radiating quadrupole. In general, the oscillatory contributions are strongly dependent on the phase of the burst when it is switched off. This work serves as a step towards understanding the interplay between quantum mechanical systems and gravity by demonstrating the role gravitational waves and the memory effect have in the loss of coherence of quantum superpositions. We also briefly investigate the electromagnetic analogue of this gedankenexperiment, in which Alice is subject to a burst of electromagnetic radiation, and discuss its correspondence to the gravitational case.</p>

            <p>Boron vacancies in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are among the most extensively studied optically active spin defects in van der Waals crystals, due to their promising potential to develop two-dimensional (2D) quantum sensors. In this letter, we demonstrate the tunability of the charge state of boron vacancies in ultrathin hBN layers, revealing a transition from the optically active singly negatively charged state to the optically inactive doubly negatively charged state when sandwiched between graphene electrodes. Notably, there is a photoluminescence quenching of a few percent upon the application of a bias voltage between the electrodes. Our findings emphasize the critical importance of considering the charge state of optically active defects in 2D materials, while also showing that the negatively charged boron vacancy remains robust against external perpendicular electric fields. This stability makes it a promising candidate for integration into various van der Waals heterostructures.</p>

            <p>Tensor-network methods are valuable Hamiltonian-simulation methods which enable probing dynamics of strongly-interacting quantum-many-body systems, including gauge theories, without encountering sign problems. They also have the potential to inform efficient quantum-simulation algorithms of the same theories.

The LSH framework has been demonstrated to be advantageous in Hamiltonian simulation of non-Abelian gauge theories. It is applicable to varying gauge groups [SU(2) and SU(3)], boundary conditions, and in higher dimensions. In this work, we report on progress in achieving the continuum limit of the static observables in a SU(2) gauge theory in (1+1) D and pushing the boundary of dynamical studies. The current toolbox can be applied to studying scattering processes in this model. It can also be straightforwardly generalized to (2+1)D given the simplified constraints in an LSH framework.</p>

            <p>Quantum many-body scarring (QMBS) is an intriguing mechanism of weak ergodicity breaking that has recently spurred significant attention. Particularly prominent in Abelian lattice gauge theories (LGTs), an open question is whether QMBS nontrivially arises in non-Abelian LGTs. Here, we present evidence of robust QMBS in a non-Abelian SU(2) LGT with dynamical matter. Starting in product states that require little experimental overhead, we show that prominent QMBS arises for certain quenches, facilitated through meson and baryon-antibaryon excitations, highlighting its non-Abelian nature. The uncovered scarred dynamics manifests as long-lived coherent oscillations in experimentally accessible local observables as well as prominent revivals in the state fidelity. Our findings bring QMBS to the realm of non-Abelian LGTs, highlighting the intimate connection between scarring and gauge symmetry, and are amenable for observation in a recently proposed trapped-ion qudit quantum computer.</p>

            <h2>Theory of Irreversibility in Quantum Many-Body Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Takato Yoshimura, Lucas Sá</p>
            <p>We address the longstanding challenge in quantum many-body theory of reconciling unitary dynamics with irreversible relaxation. In classical chaos, the unitary evolution operator develops Ruelle-Pollicott (RP) resonances inside the unit circle in the continuum limit, leading to mixing. In the semiclassical limit, chaotic single-particle quantum systems relax with the same RP resonances. In contrast, the theory of quantum many-body RP resonances and their link to irreversibility remain underdeveloped. Here, we relate the spectral form factor to the sum of autocorrelation functions and, in generic many-body lattice systems without conservation laws, argue that all quantum many-body RP resonances converge inside the unit disk, highlighting the role of nonunitary and the thermodynamic limit. While we conjecture this picture to be general, we analytically prove the emergence of irreversibility in the random phase model (RPM), a paradigmatic Floquet quantum circuit model, in the limit of large local Hilbert space dimension. To this end, we couple it to local environments and compute the exact time evolution of autocorrelation functions, the dissipative form factor, and out-of-time-order correlation functions (OTOCs). Although valid for any dissipation strength, we then focus on weak dissipation to clarify the origin of irreversibility in unitary systems. When the dissipationless limit is taken after the thermodynamic limit, the unitary quantum map develops an infinite tower of decaying RP resonances -- chaotic systems display so-called anomalous relaxation. We also show that the OTOC in the RPM can undergo a two-stage relaxation and that during the second stage, the approach to the stationary value is again controlled by the leading RP resonance.

Color centers with telecom-band transitions and long spin coherence times are suitable candidates for long-distance entanglement distribution.

Here, we develop a silicon photonics platform consisting of arrays of bus-coupled cavities. The coupling to a common bus waveguide enables simultaneous access to individually addressable cavity-enhanced T center arrays. We demonstrate frequency-multiplexed operation of two T centers in separate photonic crystal cavities. In addition, we investigate the cavity enhancement of a T center through hybridized modes formed between physically distant cavities. Our results show that bus-coupled arrays of cavity-enhanced color centers could enable efficient on-chip and long-distance entanglement distribution.</p>

            <p>The measurement of a superconducting qubit is implemented by coupling it to a resonator. The common choice is transverse coupling, which, in the dispersive approximation, introduces an interaction term which enables the measurement. This cross-Kerr term provides a qubit-state dependent dispersive shift in the resonator frequency with the device parameters chosen carefully to get sufficient signal while minimizing Purcell decay of the qubit. We introduce a two-mode circuit, nicknamed quantromon, with two orthogonal modes implementing a qubit and a resonator. Unlike before, where the coupling term emerges as a perturbative expansion, the quantromon has intrinsic cross-Kerr coupling by design. Our experiments implemented in a hybrid 2D-3D cQED architecture demonstrate some unique features of the quantromon like weak dependence of the dispersive shift on the qubit-resonator detuning and intrinsic Purcell protection. In a tunable qubit-frequency device, we show that the dispersive shift ($2\chi/2\pi$) changes by only $0.8$ MHz while the qubit-resonator detuning ($\Delta/2\pi$) is varied between $0.398$ GHz - $3.288$ GHz. We also demonstrate Purcell protection in a second device where we tune the orthogonality between the two modes. Finally, we demonstrate a single-shot readout fidelity of $98.3\%$ without using a parametric amplifier which is comparable to the state-of-the-art and suggests a potential simplification of the measurement circuitry for scaling up quantum processors.</p>

            <p>We investigate the charging dynamics of a frequency-modulated quantum battery (QB) placed within a dissipative cavity environment. Our study focuses on the interaction of such a battery under both weak and strong coupling regimes, employing a model in which the quantum battery and charger are represented as frequency-modulated qubits indirectly coupled through a zero-temperature environment. It is demonstrated that both the modulation frequency and amplitude are crucial for optimizing the charging process and the ergotropy of the quantum battery. Specifically, high-amplitude, low-frequency modulation significantly enhances charging performance and work extraction in the strong coupling regime. As an intriguing result, it is deduced that modulation at very low frequencies leads to the emergence of energy storage and work extraction in the weak coupling regime. Such a result can never be achieved without modulation in the weak coupling regime. These results highlight the importance of adjusting modulation parameters to optimize the performance of quantum batteries for real-world applications in quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>Color centers are among the most promising candidates for quantum information processing. Central requirements for their practical applications include controlled and efficient local activation in nanophotonic devices and identical spectral features. However, producing color centers in a controlled and reliable way is inherently challenging due to the lack of comprehensive theoretical insights into their formation and the difficulty of streamlining the generation process for rapid in-situ optimization. We address these challenges by developing an end-to-end first-principles model that captures the underlying formation process of color centers. Emitters are activated through laser annealing, which allows for in-situ creation and the possibility of model-based control. Notably, our model enables the estimation of the emitters' inhomogeneous broadening down to 16 GHz in bare silicon, which translates into the creation of emitters with highly similar spectral properties. Finally, we address the challenge of in-situ deterministic activation of color centers in nanophotonic devices by going beyond bare silicon and demonstrating successful laser writing in photonic crystal optical cavities. These results lay the foundation for deterministic and large-scale integration of color centers within quantum photonic platforms.</p>

            <p>A nonlocal quantum approach is presented to polarimetry, leveraging the phenomenon of entanglement in photon pairs to enhance the precision in sample property determination. By employing two distinct channels, one containing the sample of interest and the other serving as a reference, the conditions are explored under which the inherent correlation between entangled photons can increase measurement sensitivity. Specifically, we calculate the quantum Fisher information (QFI) and compare the accuracy and sensitivity for the cases of single sample channel versus two channel quantum state tomography measurements. The theoretical results are verified by experimental analysis. The theoretical and experimental framework demonstrates that the nonlocal strategy enables enhanced precision and accuracy in extracting information about sample characteristics more than the local measurements. Depending on the chosen estimators and noise channels present, theoretical and experimental results show that noise-induced bias decreases the precision for the estimated parameter. Such a quantum-enhanced nonlocal polarimetry holds promise for advancing diverse fields including material science, biomedical imaging, and remote sensing, via high-precision measurements through quantum entanglement.</p>

Our results suggest that indistinguishability among photons scattered off a quantum dot is inherently insensitive to the driving laser's detuning, as straightforwardly predicted by the resonance fluorescence model that systematically treats all scattered photons as spontaneous emission.</p>

            <p>Interacting fermionic chains exhibit extended regions of topological degeneracy of their ground states as a result of the presence of Majorana or parafermionic zero modes localized at the edges. In the opposite limit of infinite temperature, the corresponding non-integrable spin chains, obtained via generalized Jordan-Wigner mapping, are known to host so-called Almost Strong Zero Modes, which are long-lived with respect to any bulk excitations. Here, we study the fairly unexplored territory that bridges these two extreme cases of zero and infinite temperature. We blend two established techniques for states, the Lanczos series expansion and a tensor network ansatz, uplifting them to the level of operator algebra. This allows us to efficiently simulate large system sizes for arbitrarily long timescales and to extract the temperature-dependent decay rates. We observe that for the Kitaev-Hubbard model, the decay rate of the edge mode depends exponentially on the inverse temperature $\beta$, and on an effective energy scale $\Delta_{\rm eff}$ that is greater than the thermodynamic gap of the system $\Delta$.</p>

            <p>Quantum information scrambling describes the rapid spread of initially localized information across an entire quantum many-body system through entanglement generation. Once scrambled, the original local information becomes encoded globally, inaccessible from any single subsystem. In this work, we introduce a protocol that enables information scrambling into the past, allowing decoding even before the original information is generated. This protocol is achieved by simulating a closed timelike curve (a theoretical construct in which particles can traverse backward in time) using probabilistic methods. Remarkably, we find that stronger scrambling dynamics enhance the fidelity of the decoding process. We further present a quantum circuit design and experimentally implement our protocol on cloud-based Quantinuum and IBM quantum computers. Our approach illuminates a unique quantum task: retrieving information encoded in the future without altering the past.</p>

            <p>We draw analogies between protected superconducting qubits and bosonic qubits by studying the fluxonium Hamiltonian in its Fock basis. The mean-field phase diagram of fluxonium (at the sweet spot) is identified, with a region in parameter space that is characterized by $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetry-broken ground states. In the heavy fluxonium limit, these ground states are well approximated by squeezed coherent states in a Fock basis (corresponding to persistent current states with definite flux but indefinite charge), and simple expressions are provided for them in terms of the circuit parameters. We study the noise bias in fluxonium via a universal Lindblad master equation and find that the bit-flip rate is exponentially small in $E_j/(k_B T)$, while the phase-flip rate does not get worse with this ratio. Analogous behavior is found in $\cos(2 \theta)$ qubits. We discuss first steps towards generating an Ising interaction between protected superconducting qubits on a two-dimensional lattice, with the aim of achieving a passive quantum memory by coupling a static Hamiltonian to a generic thermal bath.</p>

Exploring the diatomic molecule LiNa as a first benchmark system, our investigation showcases the robustness with respect to molecular vibration, and the ability to address and manipulate each of the two nuclear spins independently, simply by adjusting the repetition rate of a pulsed laser.

            <p>Harnessing quantum phenomena in energy storage systems offers an opportunity to introduce a new generation of batteries with quantum-enhanced performance. Until now, the quantum battery has largely remained a theoretical concept, with little progress towards experimental realisation, due to the challenges in quantum coherent control. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a scalable room-temperature quantum battery with a multi-layered organic-microcavity design. We show that it exhibits superextensive charging, metastabilisation of stored energy, and generates superextensive electrical power, the latter an unpredicted phenomenon. The combination of these properties in a single device is the first demonstration of the full cycle of a quantum battery, laying the framework for future designs.</p>

            <h2>Criteria for optimal entanglement-assisted long baseline imaging protocols</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yujie Zhang, Thomas Jennewein</p>
            <p>Quantum-entanglement-assisted telescopy protocol have been proposed and studied as a means to extend the baseline of optical interferometric telescopes. However, determining the optimality of specific quantum-assisted protocols remains an open question. We introduce a new framework for systematically characterizing different entanglement-assisted telescopy protocols by integrating tools from quantum metrology with the superselection rule (SSR) established in quantum information theory. We demonstrate that the estimation of interference fringes in a quantum telescopy can be objectively quantified and compared using the quantum Fisher information under the SSR constraint. Our framework demonstrates that interference fringe estimation in quantum telescopy can be objectively evaluated and compared using the quantum Fisher information under the SSR constraint. This approach defines the fundamental limits of astronomical estimation problems with finite entanglement resources. Building on this foundation, we propose new entanglement-assisted protocols that outperform previously known methods. Moreover, we show that these protocols are compatible with linear optical technology and could inspire the development of improved quantum telescopy schemes for near-term, lossy, repeater-less quantum networks.</p>

            <h2>High-fidelity QND readout and measurement back-action in a Tantalum-based high-coherence fluxonium qubit</h2>

            <p>Implementing a precise measurement of the quantum state of a qubit is very critical for building a practical quantum processor as it plays an important role in state initialization and quantum error correction. While the transmon qubit has been the most commonly used design in small to medium-scale processors, the fluxonium qubit is emerging as a strong alternative with the potential for high-fidelity gate operation as a result of the high anharmonicity and high coherence achievable due to its unique design. Here, we explore the measurement characteristics of a tantalum-based high-coherence fluxonium qubit and demonstrate single-shot measurement fidelity (assignment fidelity) of 96.2% and 97.8% without and with the use of a Josephson Parametric Amplifier respectively. We study the back-action of the measurement photons on the qubit and measure a QND (repeatability) fidelity of 99.6%. We find that the measurement fidelity and QND nature are limited by state-mixing errors and our results suggest that a careful study of measurement-induced transitions in the fluxonium is needed to further optimize the readout performance.</p>

            <h2>Photon statistics of time dependent electronic excitation of spin injected quantum dots</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chiran Wijesundara, Jeffrey Carvalho, Yuan Lu, Tim Thomay</p>
            <p>The time dynamics of spin-injected, electrically contacted quantum dots were investigated with a focus on the time evolution of photon statistics. Photon statistics can provide insights into whether the device functions as an effective single-photon emitter or exhibits higher-order emissions. Through these investigations, we found that the shape of the electrical excitation pulse has a direct impact on photon statistics. Specifically, the rising edge of the pulse corresponds to a significantly higher number of higher-order photon states, which decay much faster than single photons associated with the falling edge of the electrical pulse. This relationship implies that the pulse shape can be tailored to optimize the device as either a better single-photon source or a generator of higher-order photon states, with potential applications in creating deterministic higher-order photon Fock states. The ability to easily modify the pulse shape is a unique feature of electrically excited quantum dots.</p>

            <h2>Electron dynamics induced by quantum cat-state light</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shohei Imai, Atsushi Ono, Naoto Tsuji</p>
            <p>We present an effective theory for describing electron dynamics driven by an optical external field in a Schrödinger's cat state. We show that the electron density matrix evolves as an average over trajectories $\{\rho_\alpha\}$ weighted by the Sudarshan--Glauber $P$ distribution $P(\alpha)$ in the weak light--matter coupling regime. Each trajectory obeys an equation of motion, $\mathrm{i} \partial_t\rho_\alpha=\mathcal{H}_{\alpha} \rho_\alpha-\rho_\alpha\mathcal{H}_{\alpha}$, where an effective Hamiltonian $\mathcal{H}_{\alpha}$ becomes non-Hermitian due to quantum interference of light. The optical quantum interference is transferred to electrons through the asymmetric action between the ket and bra state vectors in $\rho_{\alpha}$. This non-Hermitian dynamics differs from the conventional one observed in open quantum systems, described by $\mathrm{i} \partial_t\rho=\mathcal{H}\rho-\rho \mathcal{H}^\dagger$, which has complex conjugation in the second term. We confirm that the results of the effective theory agree with those of full electron--photon system simulations for the few-electron Dicke model, demonstrating experimental accessibility to exotic non-Hermitian dynamics.</p>

            <p>Radiative linewidth of a two-level emitter (TLE) ultimately determines the bandwidth it can offer for quantum information processing. However, no prior experiment has so far been performed to examine the effect of driving detuning on indistinguishability of photons scattered off a TLE, a parameter that is crucial for photonic quantum computing. Here, we perform post-selective two-photon interference experiments between mutually-detuned resonance fluorescence signals from an InAs quantum dot embedded in a micropillar cavity. Our results suggest that indistinguishability among photons scattered off a quantum dot is inherently insensitive to the driving laser's detuning, as straightforwardly predicted by the resonance fluorescence model that systematically treats all scattered photons as spontaneous emission.</p>

            <h2>Robust purely optical signatures of Floquet-Bloch states in crystals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vishal Tiwari, Ignacio Franco</p>
            <p>Strong light-matter interactions enable triggering on-demand novel functionalities in materials. For periodically driven solids, the Floquet-Bloch states have emerged as the natural states to characterize the physical properties of these non-equilibrium systems. However, robust signatures of the Floquet-Bloch states are needed as common experimental conditions, such as pulsed laser excitation and dissipative many-body dynamics can disrupt their formation and survival. Here, we identify a tell-tale signature of Floquet-Bloch states in the linear optical response of laser-dressed solids that remains prominent even in the presence of strong spectral congestion of bulk matter. To do so, we introduce a computationally efficient strategy to finally capture the response properties of realistic laser-dressed solids, and use it to compute the optical absorption of ZnO using a model of full-dimensionality. The computations reveal intense, spectrally isolated, absorption/stimulated emission features at mid-infrared energies present for a wide range of laser-driving conditions that arise due to the hybridization of the Floquet-Bloch states. As such, these spectral features open a purely optical pathway to investigate the birth and survival of Floquet-Bloch states while avoiding the experimental challenges of fully reconstructing the band structure.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maxim Sukharev, Joseph E. Subotnik, Abraham Nitzan</p>
            <p>Understanding the quantum dynamics of strongly coupled molecule-cavity systems remains a significant challenge in molecular polaritonics. This work develops a comprehensive self-consistent model simulating electromagnetic interactions of diatomic molecules with quantum ro-vibrational degrees of freedom in resonant optical cavities. The approach employs an efficient numerical methodology to solve coupled Schrodinger-Maxwell equations in real space-time, enabling three-dimensional simulations through a novel molecular mapping technique. The study investigates relaxation dynamics of an ensemble of molecules following intense resonant pump excitation in Fabry-Perot cavities and at three-dimensional plasmonic metasurfaces. The simulations reveal dramatically modified relaxation pathways inside cavities compared to free space, characterized by persistent molecular alignment arising from cavity-induced rotational pumping. They also indicate the presence of a previously unreported relaxation stabilization mechanism driven by dephasing of the collective molecular-cavity mode. Additionally, the study demonstrates that strong molecular coupling significantly modifies the circular dichroism spectra of chiral metasurfaces, suggesting new opportunities for controlling light-matter interactions in quantum optical systems.</p>

            <p>A novel approach is proposed to analyze a rather vast counter-rotating Hamiltonian interaction in the context of cavity quantum electrodynamics. The method relies upon the supersymmetric mapping of the corresponding rotating interaction and allows the analysis of the dynamics in the counter-rotating system in a fully general and exact analytical manner. Intriguing features of the counter-rotating system are revealed through the simple supersymmetric transformation. In turn, such interesting attributes have an important range of potential technological applications. In this way, supersymmetry emerges as a useful tool to both connect and construct exactly solvable photonic systems in cavity quantum electrodynamics, and more generally in quantum optics, as well as to analyze the corresponding physical consequences and their possible technology implementations.</p>

            <p>The realization and control of collective effects in quantum emitter ensembles have predominantly focused on small, ordered systems, leaving their extension to larger, more complex configurations as a significant challenge. Quantum photonic platforms, with their engineered Green's functions and integration of advanced solid-state quantum emitters, provide opportunities to explore new regimes of light-matter interaction beyond the scope of atomic systems. In this study, we examine the interaction of quantum emitters embedded within a thin dielectric layer. Our results reveal that the guided optical modes of the dielectric layer mediate extended-range interactions between emitters, enabling both total and directional superradiance in arrays spanning several wavelengths. Additionally, the extended interaction range facilitated by the dielectric layer supports Dicke superradiance in regimes where collective effects cannot be obtained in a homogeneous environment. This work uncovers a distinctive interplay between environmental dimensionality and collective quantum dynamics, paving the way for exploring novel many-body quantum optical phenomena in engineered photonic environments.</p>

We apply our model to the case of multi-photon interference from independent sources and analyze the consequences of mode mismatch in various instances that occur in quantum networking including entanglement swapping, quantum key distribution, quantum sensing, quantum optical classification, and photonic quantum computing.</p>

            <p>Quantum chemistry is among the most promising applications of quantum computing, offering the potential to solve complex electronic structure problems more efficiently than classical approaches. A critical component of any quantum algorithm is the measurement step, where the desired properties are extracted from a quantum computer. This review focuses on recent advancements in quantum measurement techniques tailored for quantum chemistry, particularly within the second quantized framework suitable for current and near-term quantum hardware. We provide a comprehensive overview of measurement strategies developed primarily for the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and its derivatives. These strategies address the inherent challenges posed by complexity of the electronic Hamiltonian operator. Additionally, we examine methods for estimating excited states and one- and two-electron properties, extending the applicability of quantum algorithms to broader chemical phenomena. Key aspects of the review include approaches for constructing measurement operators with reduced classical preprocessing and quantum implementation costs, techniques to minimize the number of measurements required for a given accuracy, and error mitigation strategies that leverage symmetries and other properties of the measurement operators. Furthermore, we explore measurement schemes rooted in Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE), which are expected to become viable with the advent of fault-tolerant quantum computing. This review emphasizes foundational concepts and methodologies rather than numerical benchmarks, serving as a resource for researchers aiming to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of quantum measurements in quantum chemistry.</p>

            <p>Electron spins coupled with optical transitions in solids stand out as a promising platform for developing spin-based quantum technologies. Recently, hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) - a layered Van der Waals (vdW) crystal, has emerged as a promising host for optically addressable spin systems. However, to date, on-demand generation of isolated single photon emitters with pre-determined spin transitions has remained elusive. Here, we report on a single step, thermal processing of hBN flakes that produces high density, narrowband, quantum emitters with optically active spin transitions. Remarkably, over 25% of the emitters exhibit a clear signature of an optical spin readout at room temperature, surpassing all previously reported results by an order of magnitude. The generated spin defect complexes exhibit both S = 1 and S = 1/2 transitions, which are explained by charge transfer from strongly to weakly coupled spin pairs. Our work advances the understanding of spin complexes in hBN and paves the way for single spin - photon interfaces in layered vdW materials with applications in quantum sensing and information processing.</p>

The results show that this scheme endows the magnon more flexibility to choose different mechanisms, under the condition of maintaining the system stable.

            <p>Entanglement distribution across remote distances is critical for many quantum applications. Currently, the de facto approach for remote entanglement distribution relies on optical fiber for on-the-ground entanglement distribution. However, the fiber-based approach is incapable of global-scale entanglement distribution due to intrinsic limitations. This paper investigates a new hybrid ground-satellite quantum network architecture (QuESat) for global-scale entanglement distribution, integrating an on-the-ground fiber network with a global-scale passive optical network built with low-Earth-orbit satellites. The satellite network provides dynamic construction of photon lightpaths based on near-vacuum beam guides constructed via adjustable arrays of lenses, forwarding photons from one ground station to another with very high efficiency over long distances compared to using fiber. To assess the feasibility and effectiveness of QuESat for global communication, we formulate lightpath provisioning and entanglement distribution problems, considering the orbital dynamics of satellites and the time-varying entanglement demands from ground users. A two-stage algorithm is developed to dynamically configure the beam guides and distribute entanglements, respectively. The algorithm combines randomized and deterministic rounding for lightpath provisioning to enable global connectivity, with optimal entanglement swapping for distributing entanglements to meet users' demands. By developing a ground-satellite quantum network simulator, QuESat achieves multi-fold improvements compared to repeater networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lexin Ding, Eduard Matito, Christian Schilling</p>
            <p>Chemical bonding is a nonlocal phenomenon that binds atoms into molecules. Its ubiquitous presence in chemistry, however, stands in stark contrast to its ambiguous definition and the lack of a universal perspective for its understanding. In this work, we rationalize and characterize chemical bonding through the lens of an equally nonlocal concept from quantum information, the orbital entanglement. We introduce maximally entangled atomic orbitals (MEAOs) whose entanglement pattern is shown to recover both Lewis (two-center) and beyond-Lewis (multicenter) structures, with multipartite entanglement serving as a comprehensive index of bond strength. Our unifying framework for bonding analyses is effective not only for equilibrium geometries but also for transition states in chemical reactions and complex phenomena such as aromaticity. It also has the potential to elevate the Hilbert space atomic partitioning to match the prevalent real-space partitioning in the theory of atoms in molecules. Accordingly, our work opens new pathways for understanding fuzzy chemical concepts using rigorous, quantitative descriptors from quantum information.</p>

            <p>Dissipation usually plays a negative role in quantum metrological technologies, which aim to improve measurement precision by leveraging quantum effects that are vulnerable to environment-induced decoherence. Recently, it has been demonstrated that dissipation can actually be used as a favorable resource for enhancing the susceptibility of signal detection. However, demonstrations of such enhancement for detecting physical quantities in open quantum systems are still lacking. Here we propose and demonstrate a protocol for realizing such non-Hermitian quantum sensors for probing the coupling between a qubit and a resonator subjecting to energy dissipations. The excitation-number conversion associated with the no-jump evolution trajectory enables removal of the noisy outcomes with quantum jumps, implementing the exceptional point (EP), where the Rabi splitting exhibits a divergent behavior in response to a tiny variation of the effective coupling. The sensitivity enhancement near the EP is confirmed by both theoretical calculation and experimental measurement.</p>

            <p>Two-photon interference from an InAs/InAlGaAs quantum dot (QD) emitting in the telecom C-band with a raw two-photon interference visibility of $V_{HOM}=(71.9\pm0.2)$ % is demonstrated. This is achieved by a two-fold approach: an improvement of the molecular beam epitaxial growth for better QDs, and integration of the QDs into an optical circular Bragg grating resonator for a Purcell enhancement of the radiative decay rate. The quantum optical properties of the fabricated device are studied by means of time-correlated single-photon counting under quasi-resonant excitation of the charged exciton line. A reduced lifetime of $T_1=(257.5\pm0.2)$ ps is found corresponding to a Purcell factor of $F_P\geqq(4.7\pm0.5)$. Pronounced anti-bunching of the second-order autocorrelation function at zero time delay $g^{(2)} (0)=(0.0307\pm0.0004)$ confirms the single-photon emission character. The two-photon interference is demonstrated with an unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer in Hong-Ou-Mandel configuration. We discuss strategies how to further improve the indistinguishability, and provide a survey of the state-of-the art.</p>

            <p>Collision models have attracted significant attention in recent years due to their versatility to simulate open quantum systems in different dynamical regimes. They have been used to study various interesting phenomena such as the dynamical emergence of non-Markovian memory effects and the spontaneous establishment of synchronization in open quantum systems. In such models, the repeated pairwise interactions between the system and the environment and also the possible coupling between different environmental units are typically modeled using the coherent partial-swap (PSWAP) operation as it is known to be a universal homogenizer. In this study, we investigate the dynamical behavior of incoherent collision models, where the interactions between different units are modeled by the incoherent controlled-swap (CSWAP) operation, which is also a universal homogenizer. Even though the asymptotic dynamics of the open system in case of both coherent and incoherent swap interactions appear to be identical, its transient dynamics turns out to be significantly different. Here we present a comparative analysis of the consequences of having coherent or incoherent couplings in collision models, namely, PSWAP or CSWAP interactions respectively, for the emergence of memory effects for a single qubit system and for the onset synchronization between a pair of qubits, both of which are strictly determined by the transient dynamics of the open system.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Krishan Saraswat</p>
            <p>We explore constraints that arise from associating an entanglement wedge (EW) to subregions of a cutoff boundary at a finite distance in AdS/CFT, using a subcritical end-of-the-world (ETW) brane acting as the cutoff. In particular, we consider the case of two intervals in the holographic dual to a BCFT, with one interval $A$ located at the asymptotic boundary and the second interval $B$ located on the ETW brane. We discuss in detail subtleties that arise near the RT end-points when defining the EW for this configuration, particularly in the connected phase. Entanglement wedge nesting (EWN) requires that $\mathcal{W}_E(A) \cup \mathcal{W}_E(B) \subseteq \mathcal{W}_E(A\cup B)$. We demonstrate that already in the simplest example of an AdS$_3$ bulk geometry, EWN can be violated even if $A$ and $B$ are spacelike separated through the bulk and instead we must require the stronger condition that $\mathcal{W}_E(A)$ be spacelike separated from $\mathcal{W}_E(B)$, which highlights the non-local nature of the cutoff theory. Our prescription to associate EWs to subregions on the ETW brane is different from the restricted maximin procedure in arXiv:2008.07022 but will agree within the subset of parameter space where EWN is respected. Additionally, we study EWN in a two sided BTZ black hole geometry with an ETW brane in one of the exteriors. In the BTZ black hole example we find that our condition for EWN disallows configurations where the RT surface goes from the brane to the black hole singularity.</p>

            <p>Electrides as a unique class of emerging materials exhibit fascinating properties and hold important significance for understanding the matter under extreme conditions, which is characterized by valence electrons localized into the interstitial space as quasi-atoms (ISQs). In this work, using crystal structure prediction and first-principles calculations, we identified seven stable phases of Mg-Li that are electride with novel electronic properties under high pressure. Among them, MgLi10 is a semiconductor with a band gap of 0.22 eV; and Pm-3m MgLi is superconductor with a superconducting transition temperature of 22.8 K. The important role played by the localization degree of ISQ in the superconducting transition temperature of these electrides is revealed by systematic comparison of Mg-Li with other Li-rich electride superconductors. Furthermore, we proved that Pm-3m MgLi and Pnma MgLi also have distinct topological behavior with metallic surface states and the non-zero $Z_2$ invariant. The simultaneous coexistence of superconductivity, electronic band topology and electride property in the same structure of Pm-3m MgLi and Pnma MgLi demonstrates the feasibility of realizing multi-quantum phases in a single material, which will stimulate further research in these interdisciplinary fields.</p>

            <h2>Eigenstate solutions of the Fermi-Hubbard model via symmetry-enhanced variational quantum eigensolver</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shaohui Yao, Wenyu Wang</p>
            <p>The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), as a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm, is an important tool for effective quantum computing in the current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. However, the traditional hardware-efficient ansatz without taking into account symmetries requires more computational resources to explore the unnecessary regions in the Hilbert space. The conventional Subspace-Search VQE (SSVQE) algorithm, which can calculate excited states, is also unable to effectively handle degenerate states since the loss function only contains the expectation value of the Hamiltonian. In this study, the energy eigenstates of the one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model with two lattice sites and the two-dimensional Hubbard model with four lattice sites are calculated. By incorporating symmetries into the quantum circuits and loss function, we find that both the ground state and excited state calculations are improved greatly compared to the case without symmetries. The enhancement in excited state calculations is particularly significant. This is because quantum circuits that conserve the particle number are used, and appropriate penalty terms are added to the loss function, enabling the optimization process to correctly identify degenerate states. The results are verified through repeated simulations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sebastian Miles, Francesco Zatelli, A. Mert Bozkurt, Michael Wimmer, Chun-Xiao Liu</p>
            <p>Exchanging the positions of two non-Abelian anyons transforms between many-body wavefunctions within a degenerate ground-state manifold. This behavior is fundamentally distinct from fermions, bosons and Abelian anyons. Recently, quantum dot-superconductor arrays have emerged as a promising platform for creating topological Kitaev chains that can host non-Abelian Majorana zero modes. In this work, we propose a minimal braiding setup in a linear array of quantum dots consisting of two minimal Kitaev chains coupled through an ancillary, normal quantum dot. We focus on the physical effects that are peculiar to quantum dot devices, such as interdot Coulomb repulsion and residual single electron tunneling. We find that the errors caused by either of these effects can be efficiently mitigated by optimal control of the ancillary quantum dot that mediates the exchange of the non-Abelian anyons. Moreover, we propose experimentally accessible methods to find this optimal operating regime and predict signatures of a successful Majorana braiding experiment.</p>

            <h2>Advancing Quantum Otto Engine Performance via Additional Magnetic Field and Effective Negative Temperature</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arghya Maity, Aditi Sen De</p>
            <p>We formulate a protocol for a four-stroke quantum Otto engine that is capable of achieving superior performance when operating between two thermal reservoirs: one at a positive spin temperature and the other at an effective negative spin temperature. We adopt a protocol that encompasses a rotating magnetic field in the (x, y)-plane, as well as an additional magnetic field in the (z)-direction that possesses distinct strengths. Consequently, we acquire the capability to manipulate the strength of the magnetic field autonomously in both directions during dynamics. We report that by precisely adjusting the strength and the direction of the magnetic field in the (z)-direction and manipulating other relevant system parameters, we can effectively enhance the transition probability and hence the efficiency of the engine as well which can not be achieved without the additional magnetic field, although the impact is not ubiquitous. Additionally, another important significance of our model is that these engines operate within an extended operational domain, reaching into temperature ranges where the effective negative temperature-based quantum Otto engines operating only on the rotational magnetic field in the (x,y) plane, are unable to function. Specifically, we identify a threshold value for the magnetic field, dependent on the driving time, at which an improvement in efficiency is observed. We propose that this advantage may arise from the system exhibiting greater coherence with respect to the driving time, which we evaluate using the l1-norm coherence measure. Another noteworthy aspect is that the advantage in efficiency gained from the additional magnetic field continues to surpass that of the protocol without the field, even in the presence of impurities in the magnetic field having a specific range of disorder strengths.</p>

            <h2>A Polynomial Time Quantum Algorithm for Exponentially Large Scale Nonlinear Differential Equations via Hamiltonian Simulation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu Tanaka, Keisuke Fujii</p>
            <p>Quantum computers have the potential to efficiently solve a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which play a crucial role in various industries and scientific fields. However, it remains unclear which system of nonlinear ODEs, and under what assumptions, can achieve exponential speedup using quantum computers. In this work, we introduce a class of systems of nonlinear ODEs that can be efficiently solved on quantum computers, where the efficiency is defined as solving the system with computational complexity of $O(T {\rm log}(N) {\rm polylog}(1/\epsilon))$, where $T$ is the evolution time, $\epsilon$ is the allowed error, and $N$ is the number of variables in the system. Specifically, we employ the Koopman-von Neumann linearization to map the system of nonlinear ODEs to Hamiltonian dynamics and find conditions where the norm of the mapped Hamiltonian is preserved and the Hamiltonian is sparse. This allows us to use the optimal Hamiltonian simulation technique for solving the nonlinear ODEs with $O({\rm log}(N))$ overhead. Furthermore, we show that the nonlinear ODEs include a wide range of systems of nonlinear ODEs, such as the nonlinear harmonic oscillators and the short-range Kuramoto model. Since this is the first concrete example of solving systems of nonlinear ODEs with exponential quantum speedup by the Koopman-von Neumann linearization, these findings contribute significantly to the application of quantum computers in solving nonlinear problems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Debkanta Ghosh, Keshav Das Agarwal, Pritam Halder, Aditi Sen De</p>
            <p>The cluster state acquired by evolving the nearest-neighbor (NN) Ising model from a completely separable state is the resource for measurement-based quantum computation. Instead of an NN system, a variable-range power law interacting Ising model can generate a genuine multipartite entangled (GME) weighted graph state (WGS) that may reveal intrinsic characteristics of the evolving Hamiltonian. We establish that the pattern of generalized geometric measure (GGM) in the evolved state with an arbitrary number of qubits is sensitive to fall-off rates and the range of interactions of the evolving Hamiltonian. We report that the time-derivative and time-averaged GGM at a particular time can detect the transition points present in the fall-off rates of the interaction strength, separating different regions, namely long-range, quasi-local and local ones in one- and two-dimensional lattices with deformation. Moreover, we illustrate that in the quasi-local and local regimes, there exists a minimum coordination number in the evolving Ising model for a fixed total number of qubits which can mimic the GGM of the long-range model. In order to achieve a finite-size subsystem from the entire system, we design a local measurement strategy that allows a WGS of an arbitrary number of qubits to be reduced to a local unitarily equivalent WGS having fewer qubits with modified weights.</p>

            <h2>Measurement events relative to temporal quantum reference frames</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ladina Hausmann, Alexander Schmidhuber, Esteban Castro-Ruiz</p>
            <p>The Page-Wootters formalism is a proposal for reconciling the background-dependent, quantum-mechanical notion of time with the background independence of general relativity. However, the physical meaning of this framework remains debated. In this work, we compare two consistent approaches to the Page-Wootters formalism to clarify the operational meaning of evolution and measurements with respect to a temporal quantum reference frame. The so-called "twirled observable" approach implements measurements as operators that are invariant with respect to the Hamiltonian constraint. The "purified measurement" approach instead models measurements dynamically by modifying the constraint itself. While both approaches agree in the limit of ideal clocks, a natural generalization of the purified measurement approach to the case of non-ideal, finite-resource clocks yields a radically different picture. We discuss the physical origin of this discrepancy and argue that these approaches describe operationally distinct situations. Moreover, we show that, for non-ideal clocks, the purified measurement approach yields a time non-local evolution equation, which can lead to non-unitary evolution. Moreover, it implies a fundamental limitation to the operational definition of the temporal order of events. Nevertheless, unitarity and definite temporal order can be restored if we assume that time is discrete.</p>

            <p>The quantum rotor is one of the simplest model systems in quantum mechanics, but only in recent years has theoretical work revealed general fundamental scaling laws for its decoherence. For example, a superposition of orientations decoheres at a rate proportional to the sine squared of the angle between them. Here we observe scaling laws for rotational decoherence dynamics for the first time, using a 4-micrometer diameter planar rotor composed of two Paul-trapped ions. We prepare the rotational motion of the ion crystal into superpositions of angular momentum with well-defined differences ranging from 1-3 $\hbar$, and measure the rate of decoherence. We also tune the system-environment interaction strength by introducing resonant electric field noise. The observed scaling relationships for decoherence are in excellent agreement with recent theoretical work, and are directly relevant to the growing development of rotor-based quantum applications.</p>

            <h2>Orthogonality Broadcasting and Quantum Position Verification</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ian George, Rene Allerstorfer, Philip Verduyn Lunel, Eric Chitambar</p>
            <p>The no-cloning theorem leads to information-theoretic security in various quantum cryptographic protocols. However, this security typically derives from a possibly weaker property that classical information encoded in certain quantum states cannot be broadcast. To formally capture this property, we introduce the study of "orthogonality broadcasting." When attempting to broadcast the orthogonality of two different qubit bases, we establish that the power of classical and quantum communication is equivalent. However, quantum communication is shown to be strictly more powerful for broadcasting orthogonality in higher dimensions. We then relate orthogonality broadcasting to quantum position verification and provide a new method for establishing error bounds in the no pre-shared entanglement model that can address protocols previous methods could not. Our key technical contribution is an uncertainty relation that uses the geometric relation of the states that undergo broadcasting rather than the non-commutative aspect of the final measurements.</p>

            <h2>Exact, Average, and Broken Symmetries in a Simple Adaptive Monitored Circuit</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhi Li, Zhu-Xi Luo</p>
            <p>Symmetry is a powerful tool for understanding phases of matter in equilibrium. Quantum circuits with measurements have recently emerged as a platform for novel states of matter intrinsically out of equilibrium. Can symmetry be used as an organizing principle for these novel states, their phases and phase transitions? In this work, we give an affirmative answer to this question in a simple adaptive monitored circuit, which hosts an ordering transition in addition to a separate entanglement transition, upon tuning a single parameter. Starting from a symmetry-breaking initial state, depending on the tuning parameter, the steady state could (i) remain symmetry-broken, (ii) exhibit the average symmetry in the ensemble of trajectories, or (iii) exhibit the exact symmetry for each trajectory. The ordering transition is mapped to the transition in a classical majority vote model, described by the Ising universality class, while the entanglement transition lies in the percolation class. Numerical simulations are further presented to support the analytical understandings.</p>

            <h2>Efficient explicit gate construction of block-encoding for Hamiltonians needed for simulating partial differential equations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nikita Guseynov, Xiajie Huang, Nana Liu</p>
            <p>One of the most promising applications of quantum computers is solving partial differential equations (PDEs). By using the Schrodingerisation technique - which converts non-conservative PDEs into Schrodinger equations - the problem can be reduced to Hamiltonian simulations. The particular class of Hamiltonians we consider is shown to be sufficient for simulating almost any linear PDE. In particular, these Hamiltonians consist of discretizations of polynomial products and sums of position and momentum operators. This paper addresses an important gap by efficiently loading these Hamiltonians into the quantum computer through block-encoding. The construction is explicit and efficient in terms of one- and two-qubit operations, forming a fundamental building block for constructing the unitary evolution operator for that class of Hamiltonians. The proposed algorithm demonstrates a squared logarithmic scaling with respect to the spatial partitioning size, offering a polynomial speedup over classical finite-difference methods in the context of spatial partitioning for PDE solving. Furthermore, the algorithm is extended to the multi-dimensional case, achieving an exponential acceleration with respect to the number of dimensions, alleviating the curse of dimensionality problem. This work provides an essential foundation for developing explicit and efficient quantum circuits for PDEs, Hamiltonian simulations, and ground state and thermal state preparation.</p>

            <p>We investigate the impact of asymmetric perturbations on the perfect transmission resonances (PTRs) of one-dimensional finite periodic systems. With no perturbations, the scattering region consists of $N$ identical cells, and the transmission spectrum exhibits at least $N-1$ PTRs in each pass band of the Bloch dispersion of the unit cell. By introducing a perturbation, the periodic structure is broken, which \textit{a priori} results in the elimination of all PTRs. However, we demonstrate that PTRs can still arise under asymmetric perturbations when the unperturbed system possesses mirror symmetry, utilizing the $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry of the unperturbed reflectionless eigenvalue problem. We also reveal an intriguing connection between two seemingly independent PTRs that lies in the symmetry of the unperturbed unit cell: If one PTR is preserved, then a dual one is necessarily also preserved. Our findings offer insights for the design of, for example, a robust antireflection setup at multiple wavelengths or all-optical diode devices.</p>

In this paper we resolve this discrepancy for some of the perturbations, by developing a second-order perturbation theory on top of a nonlinear dissipative Lindbladian. Following this scheme, we derive an analytical expression for the exponentially small bit-flip rate due to single-photon loss, which shows good agreement with numerical simulations. We also apply our scheme to other perturbations, such as frequency detuning and the Z gate, and find the corresponding bit-flip rates, which also show good agreement with the numerical simulation.</p>

            <p>The uncertainty relations (URs) of two arbitrary Hermitian and non-Hermitian incompatible operators represented by the product of variances have been confirmed theoretically and experimentally in various physical systems. However, the lower bound of the product uncertainty inequality can be null even for two non-commuting operators, i.e., a trivial case. Therefore, for two incompatible operators over the measured system state, the associated URs regarding the sum of variances are valid in a state-dependent manner, and the lower bound is guaranteed to be nontrivial. Although the sum URs formulated for Hermitian and unitary operators have been affirmed, the general forms for arbitrary non-Hermitian operators have not yet been investigated. This study presents the sum URs for non-Hermitian operators acting on system states using an appropriate Hilbert-space metric. The compatible forms of our sum inequalities with the conventional quantum mechanics are also provided via the G-metric formalism. Concrete examples illustrate the validity of the proposed sum URs in both PT-symmetric and PT-broken phases. The developed methods and results can help give an in-depth understanding of the usefulness of G-metric formalism in non-Hermitian quantum mechanics and the sum URs of incompatible operators within.</p>

            <p>Quantum channel capacities give the fundamental performance limits for information flow over a communication channel. However, the prevalence of superadditivity is a major obstacle to understanding capacities, both quantitatively and conceptually. In contrast, examples exhibiting additivity, though relatively rare, offer crucial insights into the origins of nonadditivity and form the basis of our strongest upper bounds on capacity. Degradable channels, whose coherent information is provably additive, stand out as among the few classes of channels for which the quantum capacity is exactly computable. In this paper, we introduce two families of non-degradable channels whose coherent information remains additive, making their quantum capacities tractable. First, we demonstrate that channels capable of ``outperforming" their environment, under conditions weaker than degradability, can exhibit either strong or weak additivity of coherent information. Second, we explore a complementary construction that modifies a channel to preserve coherent information additivity while destroying the ``outperforming" property. We analyze how structural constraints guarantee strong and weak additivity and investigate how relaxing these constraints leads to the failure of strong additivity, with weak additivity potentially persisting.</p>

            <p>Building large-scale quantum computers requires an interqubit-coupling scheme with a high on-off ratio to avoid unwanted crosstalk coming from residual coupling and to enable fast multi-qubit operations. We propose a $ZZ$-coupling scheme for two Kerr-cat qubits with a frequency-tunable coupler. By making four relevant states of the two Kerr-cat qubits quadruply degenerate, we can switch off the $ZZ$ coupling. By partially lifting the level degeneracy, we can switch it on. We theoretically show that an experimentally feasible circuit model suppresses the residual $ZZ$ coupling. Moreover, our circuit can realize $R_{ZZ}(-\pi/2)$-gate fidelity higher than $99.9\%$ within $18$ ns when decoherence is ignored. Our model includes the first-order terms in expansion beyond the rotating-wave approximation.</p>

In classical models such as deep neural networks, large chains of dot products do indeed cause errors injected by an attacker to propagate or accumulate. But what about quantum models? We hypothesise that, in quantum machine learning, error propagation is limited for two reasons. The first is that data, which is encoded in quantum computing, is in terms of qubits that are confined to the Bloch sphere. Second, quantum information processing happens via the application of unitary operators, which preserve norms. Testing this hypothesis, we investigate how extensive error propagation and, thus, poisoning attacks affect quantum machine learning.</p>

This is a natural relaxation of unclonable encryption (UE), inspired by the recent work of Nehoran and Zhandry (ITCS 2024), who showed a computational separation between the no-cloning and no-telegraphing principles. In this work, we define and construct UTE information-theoretically in the plain model. Building off this, we give several applications of UTE and study the interplay of UTE with UE and well-studied tasks in quantum state learning, yielding the following contributions: - A construction of collusion-resistant UTE from plain secret-key encryption, which we then show denies the existence of hyper-efficient shadow tomography (HEST). By building a relaxation of collusion-resistant UTE, we show the impossibility of HEST assuming only pseudorandom state generators (which may not imply one-way functions). This almost unconditionally answers an open inquiry of Aaronson (STOC 2018). - A construction of UTE from a one-shot message authentication code in the classical oracle model, such that there is an explicit attack that breaks UE security for an unbounded polynomial number of decryptors. - A construction of everlasting secure collusion-resistant UTE, where the decryptor adversary can run in unbounded time, in the quantum random oracle model (QROM), and formal evidence that a construction in the plain model is a challenging task. We leverage this construction to show that HEST with unbounded post-processing time is impossible in the QROM. - Constructions of secret sharing resilient to joint and unbounded classical leakage and untelegraphable functional encryption.</p>

            <p>Classical simulation of quantum physics is a central approach to investigating physical phenomena. Quantum computers enhance computational capabilities beyond those of classical resources, but it remains unclear to what extent existing limited quantum computers can contribute to this enhancement. In this work, we explore a new hybrid, efficient quantum-classical representation of quantum states, the multiple-basis representation. This representation consists of a linear combination of states that are sparse in some given and different bases, specified by quantum circuits. Such representation is particularly appealing when considering depth-limited quantum circuits within reach of current hardware. We analyze the expressivity of multiple-basis representation states depending on the classical simulability of their quantum circuits. In particular, we show that multiple-basis representation states include, but are not restricted to, both matrix-product states and stabilizer states. Furthermore, we find cases in which this representation can be used, namely approximation of ground states, simulation of deeper computations by specifying bases with shallow circuits, and a tomographical protocol to describe states as multiple-basis representations. We envision this work to open the path of simultaneous use of several hardware-friendly bases, a natural description of hybrid computational methods accessible for near-term hardware.</p>

            <p>The quantum stochastic drift protocol, also known as qDRIFT, has become a popular algorithm for implementing time-evolution of quantum systems using randomised compiling. In this work we develop qFLO, a higher order randomised algorithm for time-evolution. To estimate an observable expectation value at time $T$ to precision $\epsilon$, we show it is sufficient to use circuit depths of $O(T^2\log(1/\epsilon))$ -- an exponential improvement over standard qDRIFT requirements with respect to $\epsilon$. The protocol achieves this using $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ repeated runs of the standard qDRIFT protocol combined with classical post-processing in the form of Richardson extrapolation. Notably, it requires no ancillary qubits or additional control gates making it especially promising for near-term quantum devices. Furthermore, it is well-conditioned and inherits many desirable properties of randomly compiled simulation methods, including circuit depths that do not explicitly depend on the number of terms in the Hamiltonian.</p>

In the paper it is argued that the operator $H^{(IC)}$ (and the like) can only be interpreted as a manifestly unphysical, singular IEP limit of a hypothetical one-parametric family of certain standard quantum Hamiltonians.

            <p>We investigate the dissipative quench dynamics in a family of two-band fermionic systems by linearly ramping the staggered on-site energy. In the Lindblad formalism, we present an analytical solution in the presence of uniform loss or loss difference on bipartite lattices, which tells that dissipation exponentially suppresses the Kibble-Zurek (KZ) scaling behavior and the quantum jump term of the dissipation is responsible for the anti-KZ (AKZ) behavior. Interestingly, we find two different scaling behaviors at the limit of loss difference. Both scaling behaviors arise from the gapless Liouvillian. But one is accompanied by impulse stage rendered by the criticality of the system, so that it is ascribed to the universal KZ scaling law. Another depends on the dissipation strength and there is no impulse stage in it. We also point out a convenient way to observe the two new scaling behaviors by counting the number of residual particles in the end, since it is immune to the influence of AKZ behavior. We illustrate our findings through the prototypical one-dimensional Rice-Mele model first. Then, in the one-dimensional Shockley model and the two-dimensional Haldane model for Chern insulators, we show that the two scaling behaviors can appear together or separately with appropriate quench protocols.</p>

            <p>Optically-addressable spin qubits form the foundation of a new generation of emerging nanoscale sensors. The engineering of these sensors has mainly focused on solid-state systems such as the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond. However, NVs are restricted in their ability to interface with biomolecules due to their bulky diamond host. Meanwhile, fluorescent proteins have become the gold standard in bioimaging, as they are genetically encodable and easily integrated with biomolecules. While fluorescent proteins have been suggested to possess a metastable triplet state, they have not been investigated as qubit sensors. Here, we realize an optically-addressable spin qubit in the Enhanced Yellow Fluorescent Protein (EYFP) enabled by a novel spin-readout technique. A near-infrared laser pulse allows for triggered readout of the triplet state with up to 44% spin contrast. Using coherent microwave control of the EYFP spin at liquid-nitrogen temperatures, we measure a spin-lattice relaxation time of $(141 \pm 5)\, \mathrm{\mu s}$, a $(16 \pm 2)\, \mathrm{\mu s}$ coherence time under Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) decoupling, and a predicted oscillating (AC) magnetic field sensitivity with an upper bound of $183 \, \mathrm{fT}\, \mathrm{mol}^{1/2}\, \mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$. We express the qubit in mammalian cells, maintaining contrast and coherent control despite the complex intracellular environment. Finally, we demonstrate optically-detected magnetic resonance at room temperature in aqueous solution with contrast up to 3%, and measure a static (DC) field sensitivity with an upper bound of $93 \, \mathrm{pT}\, \mathrm{mol}^{1/2}\, \mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$. Our results establish fluorescent proteins as a powerful new qubit sensor platform and pave the way for applications in the life sciences that are out of reach for solid-state technologies.</p>

            <h2>Learning Feedback Mechanisms for Measurement-Based Variational Quantum State Preparation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Alcalde Puente, Matteo Rizzi</p>
            <p>This work introduces a self-learning protocol that incorporates measurement and feedback into variational quantum circuits for efficient quantum state preparation. By combining projective measurements with conditional feedback, the protocol learns state preparation strategies that extend beyond unitary-only methods, leveraging measurement-based shortcuts to reduce circuit depth. Using the spin-1 Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki state as a benchmark, the protocol learns high-fidelity state preparation by overcoming a family of measurement induced local minima through adjustments of parameter update frequencies and ancilla regularization. Despite these efforts, optimization remains challenging due to the highly non-convex landscapes inherent to variational circuits. The approach is extended to larger systems using translationally invariant ansätze and recurrent neural networks for feedback, demonstrating scalability. Additionally, the successful preparation of a specific AKLT state with desired edge modes highlights the potential to discover new state preparation protocols where none currently exist. These results indicate that integrating measurement and feedback into variational quantum algorithms provides a promising framework for quantum state preparation.</p>

            <h2>Strong and weak symmetries and their spontaneous symmetry breaking in mixed states emerging from the quantum Ising model under multiple decoherence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Takahiro Orito, Yoshihito Kuno, Ikuo Ichinose</p>
            <p>Discovering and categorizing quantum orders in mixed many-body systems are currently one of the most important problems. Specific types of decoherence applied to typical quantum many-body states can induce a novel kind of mixed state accompanying characteristic symmetry orders, which has no counterparts in pure many-body states. We study phenomena generated by interplay between two types of decoherence applied to the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model (TFIM). We show that in the doubled Hilbert space formalism, the decoherence can be described by filtering operation applied to matrix product states (MPS) defined in the doubled Hilbert system. The filtering operation induces specific deformation of the MPS, which approximates the ground state of a certain parent Hamiltonian in the doubled Hilbert space. In the present case, such a parent Hamiltonian is the quantum Ashkin-Teller model, having a rich phase diagram with a critical lines and quantum phase transitions. By investigating the deformed MPS, we find various types of mixed states emergent from the ground states of the TFIM, and clarify phase transitions between them. In that study, strong and weak $Z_2$ symmetries play an important role, for which we introduce efficient order parameters, such as Rényi-2 correlators, entanglement entropy, etc., in the doubled Hilbert space.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shaowei Du, Shuheng Liu, Frank E. S. Steinhoff, Giuseppe Vitagliano</p>
            <p>We follow recent works analyzing precision bounds to the estimation of multiple parameters generated by a unitary evolution with non-commuting Hamiltonians that form a closed algebra. We consider the $3$-parameter estimation of SU(2) and SU(1,1) unitaries and investigate the scaling of the precision in a pragmatic framework where the estimation is performed via the so-called method of moments, consisting in the estimation of phases via expectation values of time-evolved observables, which we restrict to be the first two moments of the Hamiltonian generators. We consider optimal or close-to-optimal initial states, that can be obtained by maximizing the quantum Fisher information matrix, and analyze the maximal precision achievable from measuring only the first two moments of the generators. As a result, we find that in our context with limited resources accessible, the twin-Fock state emerges as the best probe state, that allows the estimation of two out of the three parameters with Heisenberg precision scaling. Moreover, in other practical scenarios with less limitations we identify useful probe states that can in principle achieve Heisenberg scaling for the three parameters considered.</p>

            <h2>Measurement-based quantum computation utilizing the graph states of Bose-Einstein condensates and continuous variables</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Genji Fujii</p>
            <p>Measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) is a protocol for quantum computation that represents a model distinct from the circuit-based approach. MBQC has been proposed not only for qubits but also for qudits, continuous-variable (CV) qubits, and Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) qubits. In qubit-based MBQC, arbitrary rotations on the Bloch sphere can be performed by measuring a graph state. This naturally raises the question of whether arbitrary rotations on the Bloch sphere can similarly be achieved through measurements in other types of quantum bits. We have demonstrated that this can indeed be realized for BECs qubits by considering composite graph states involving CV qubits and BECs qubits.</p>

            <h2>Noise-Mitigated Variational Quantum Eigensolver with Pre-training and Zero-Noise Extrapolation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wanqi Sun, Jungang Xu, Chenghua Duan</p>
            <p>As a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm, the variational quantum eigensolver is widely applied in quantum chemistry simulations, especially in computing the electronic structure of complex molecular systems. However, on existing noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, some factors such as quantum decoherence, measurement errors, and gate operation imprecisions are unavoidable. To overcome these challenges, this study proposes an efficient noise-mitigating variational quantum eigensolver for accurate computation of molecular ground state energies in noisy environments. We design the quantum circuit with reference to the structure of matrix product states and utilize it to pre-train the circuit parameters, which ensures circuit stability and mitigates fluctuations caused by initialization. We also employ zero-noise extrapolation to mitigate quantum noise and combine it with neural networks to improve the accuracy of the noise-fitting function, which significantly eliminates noise interference. Furthermore, we implement an intelligent grouping strategy for measuring Hamiltonian Pauli strings, which not only reduces measurement errors but also improves sampling efficiency. We perform numerical simulations to solve the ground state energy of the $H_4$ molecule by using MindSpore Quantum framework, and the results demonstrate that our algorithm can constrain noise errors within the range of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-2}) \sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-1})$, outperforming mainstream variational quantum eigensolvers. This work provides a new strategy for high-precision quantum chemistry calculations on near-term noisy quantum hardware. The updated code is available at this https URL or this https URL.</p>

            <p>Topological quantum computing holding global anti-interference ability is realized by braiding some anyons, such as well-known Fibonacci anyons. Here, based on $SO(3)_2$ theory we obtain a total of 6 anyon models utilizing F-matrices, R-symbols, and fusion rules of metaplectic this http URL obtain the elementary braided matrices (EBMs) by means of unconventional encoding. After braid $X$ and $X'$, we insert a pair of $Z$ anyons into they to ensure that the initial order of anyons remains unchanged. In this process only fusion is required, and measurement is not necessary. Three of them $\{V_3^{113}, V_3^{131}, V_1^{133}\}$ are studied in detail. We study systematically the compilation of these three models through EBMs obtained analytically. For one-qubit case, the classical H- and T-gate can be well constructed using the genetic algorithm enhanced Solovay-Kitaev algorithm (GA-enhanced SKA) by $\{V_3^{113}, V_3^{131}, V_1^{133}\}$. The obtained accuracy of the H/T-gate by $\{V_3^{113}, V_1^{133}\}$ is slightly inferior to the corresponding gates of the Fibonacci anyon model, but it also can meet the requirements of fault-tolerant quantum computing, $V^3_131$ giving the best performance of these four models. For the two-qubit case, we use the exhaustive method for short lengths and the GA for long lengths to obtain braidword for $\{V_3^{113}, V_3^{131}, V_1^{133}\}$ models. The resulting matrices can well approximate the local equivalence class of the CNOT-gate, while demonstrating a much smaller error than the Fibonacci model, especially for the $V_3^{113}$.</p>

            <h2>Non-Markovian Noise Mitigation: Practical Implementation, Error Analysis, and the Role of Environment Spectral Properties</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ke Wang, Xiantao Li</p>
            <p>Quantum error mitigation(QEM), an error suppression strategy without the need for additional ancilla qubits for noisy intermediate-scale quantum~(NISQ) devices, presents a promising avenue for realizing quantum speedups of quantum computing algorithms on current quantum devices. However, prior investigations have predominantly been focused on Markovian noise. In this paper, we propose a non-Markovian Noise Mitigation(NMNM) method by extending the probabilistic error cancellation (PEC) method in the QEM framework to treat non-Markovian noise. We present the derivation of a time-local quantum master equation where the decoherence coefficients are directly obtained from bath correlation functions(BCFs), key properties of a non-Markovian environment that will make the error mitigation algorithms environment-aware. We further establish a direct connection between the overall approximation error and sampling overhead of QEM and the spectral property of the environment. Numerical simulations performed on a spin-boson model further validate the efficacy of our approach.</p>

            <h2>On-the-Spot Loading of Single-Atom Traps</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mark IJspeert, Naomi Holland, Benjamin Yuen, Axel Kuhn</p>
            <p>Reconfigurable arrays of trapped single atoms are an excellent platform for the simulation of many-body physics and the realisation of high-fidelity quantum gates. The confinement of atoms is often achieved with focussed laser beams acting as optical dipole-force traps that allow for both static and dynamic positioning of atoms. In these traps, light-assisted collisions -- enhancing the two-atom loss rate -- ensure that single atom occupation of traps can be realised. However, the time-averaged probability of trapping a single atom is limited to $0.5$ when loading directly from a surrounding cloud of laser-cooled atoms, preventing deterministic filling of large arrays. In this work, we demonstrate that increasing the depth of a static, optical dipole trap enables the transition from fast loading on a timescale of $2.1\,$s to an extended trap lifetime of $7.9\,$s. This method demonstrates an achievable filling ratio of $(79\pm2)\,\%$ without the need of rearranging atoms to fill vacant traps.</p>

            <p>Entanglement distribution in quantum networks will enable next-generation technologies for quantum-secured communications, distributed quantum computing and sensing. Future quantum networks will require dense connectivity, allowing multiple users to share entanglement in a reconfigurable and multiplexed manner, while long-distance connections are established through the teleportation of entanglement, or entanglement swapping. While several recent works have demonstrated fully connected, local multi-user networks based on multiplexing, extending this to a global network architecture of interconnected local networks remains an outstanding challenge. Here we demonstrate the next stage in the evolution of multiplexed quantum networks: a prototype global reconfigurable network where entanglement is routed and teleported in a flexible and multiplexed manner between two local multi-user networks composed of four users each. At the heart of our network is a programmable 8x8-dimensional multi-port circuit that harnesses the natural mode-mixing process inside a multi-mode fibre to implement on-demand high-dimensional operations on two independent photons carrying eight transverse-spatial modes. Our circuit design allows us to break away from the limited planar geometry and bypass the control and fabrication challenges of conventional integrated photonic platforms. Our demonstration showcases the potential of this architecture for enabling large-scale, global quantum networks that offer versatile connectivity while being fully compatible with an existing communications infrastructure.</p>

            <p>Microscopic Schr{ö}dinger cat states are generated from quantum correlated fields using a probabilistic heralding photon subtraction event. Subsequent quantum state tomography provides complete information about the state with typical photon numbers of the order of one. Another approach strives for a larger number of quantum-correlated photons by conditioning the measurement analysis on events with exactly this number of photons. Here, we present a new approach to derive measurement data of quantum correlated states with average quantum-correlated photon numbers significantly larger than one. We produce an ensemble of a heralded, photon-subtracted squeezed vacuum state of light. We split the states at a balanced beam splitter and simultaneously measure a pair of orthogonal field quadratures at the outputs using tomographic `Q-function homodyne detection' (QHD). The final act is probabilistic two-copy data post-processing aiming for data from a new state with larger photon number. Evaluating the final tomographic data as that of a grown microscopic Schr{ö}dinger cat state shows that the probabilistic post-processing increased the photon number of $|\alpha_0|^2 \approx 1.2$ to $|\alpha_2|^2 \approx 6.8$. Our concept for obtaining tomographic measurement data of mesoscopic non-classical states that never existed might be a turning point in measurement-based quantum technology.</p>

            <p>The non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm (AB) cage is a unique localization phenomenon that confines all possible excitations. This confinement leads to fully flat spectra in momentum space, which are typically accompanied with the degeneracy with various types. Classifying the degeneracy type is crucial for studying the dynamical properties of the non-Hermitian AB cage, but the methods for such classification and their physical connections remain not very clear. Here, we construct a non-Hermitian AB cage in a bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) system with various types of degenerate flat bands (DFBs). Using the transfer matrix, we demonstrate the localization mechanism for the formation of AB cage and derive the minimal polynomial in mathematics for classifying the degeneracy types of DFBs, thus providing comprehensive understanding of the correspondence among the degeneracy type of DFBs, the minimal polynomial, and the transfer matrix. With such correspondence, we propose a scheme to realize highly degenerate flat bands.</p>

            <p>Model optomechanical systems with photon-vibration interactions linear, quadratic, and cubic in mechanical displacements are studied under conditions for adiabatic elimination of the photon field. The opportunity of transformation of effective potential describing the dynamics of the mechanical resonator from single-well to double-well is demonstrated.

Quasiperiodic oscillations of the mechanical resonator in the case (i) are replaced by chaotic ones when the cases (ii) or (iii) are realized. It is interesting that in the presence of all three interactions, the chaotic behavior of the mechanical oscillator becomes quasi-periodic. However, increasing the power of the modulation field again leads to chaos.</p>

In this study, we leverage the capabilities of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) for conducting quantum many-body calculations.

This has resulted in a tenfold speedup compared to CPU-based computation for a Monte Carlo algorithm. By using a supercell structure and simulating the FPGA architecture on a CPU with High-Level Synthesis, we achieve $O(1)$ scaling for the time of one sweep, regardless of the overall system size. We also demonstrate, for the first time, the utilization of FPGA to accelerate a typical tensor network algorithm for many-body ground state calculations. Additionally, we show that the current FPGA computing acceleration is on par with that of multi-threaded GPU parallel processing.

            <p>The Lindblad quantum master equation is one of the central approaches to the physics of open quantum systems. In particular, boundary driving enables the study of transport, where a steady state emerges in the long-time limit, which features a constant current and a characteristic density profile. While the Lindblad equation complements other approaches to transport in closed quantum systems, it has become clear that a connection between closed and open systems exists in certain cases. Here, we build on this connection for magnetization transport in the spin-1/2 XXZ chain with and without integrability-breaking perturbations. Specifically, we study the question whether the time evolution of the open quantum system can be described on the basis of classical correlation functions, as generated by the Hamiltonian equations of motion for real vectors. By comparing to exact numerical simulations of the Lindblad equation, we find a good accuracy of such a description for a range of model parameters, which is consistent with previous studies on closed systems. While this agreement is an interesting physical observation, it also suggests that classical mechanics can be used to solve the Lindblad equation for comparatively large system sizes, which lie outside the possibilities of a quantum mechanical treatment. We also point out counterexamples and limitations for the quantitative extraction of transport coefficients. Remarkably, our classical approach to large open systems allows to detect superdiffusion at the isotropic point.</p>

            <p>Predicting quantum operator matrices such as Hamiltonian, overlap, and density matrices in the density functional theory (DFT) framework is crucial for material science. Current methods often focus on individual operators and struggle with efficiency and scalability for large systems. Here we introduce a novel deep learning model, SLEM (strictly localized equivariant message-passing) for predicting multiple quantum operators, that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while dramatically improving computational efficiency. SLEM's key innovation is its strict locality-based design for equivariant representations of quantum tensors while preserving physical symmetries. This enables complex many-body dependency without expanding the effective receptive field, leading to superior data efficiency and transferability. Using an innovative SO(2) convolution and invariant overlap parameterization, SLEM reduces the computational complexity of high-order tensor products and is therefore capable of handling systems requiring the $f$ and $g$ orbitals in their basis sets. We demonstrate SLEM's capabilities across diverse 2D and 3D materials, achieving high accuracy even with limited training data. SLEM's design facilitates efficient parallelization, potentially extending DFT simulations to systems with device-level sizes, opening new possibilities for large-scale quantum simulations and high-throughput materials discovery.</p>

            <p>Coherence, which represents the superposition of orthogonal states, is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics and can also be precisely defined within quantum resource theory. Thus exploring quantum coherence in neutrino oscillations can not only help in examining the intrinsic quantum nature but can also explore their potential applications in quantum information technologies. Previous studies on quantum coherence have focused on neutrino flavor oscillations (FO). However, FO imply that neutrinos have mass and this can lead to the generation of a tiny but finite magnetic dipole moment of neutrinos through quantum loop diagrams at higher orders of perturbative expansion of the interaction. This electromagnetic property of neutrinos can induce spin flavor oscillations (SFO) in the presence of an external magnetic field and hence is expected to enrich the study of coherence. In this work, we investigate quantum coherence in neutrino SFO with three flavor mixing within the interstellar as well as intergalactic magnetic fields, quantified by the $l_1$ norm and the relative entropy of coherence, and express these measures in terms of neutrino SFO probabilities. For FO, coherence measures can sustain higher values (say, within 50% of the maximum) over distances of several kilometers, which are relevant for terrestrial experiments like reactor and accelerator neutrinos. However, for SFO, we find that the coherence scale can extend to astrophysical distances, spanning from kiloparsecs to gigaparsecs.</p>

In holographic tweezer array experiments, an optical tweezer generated by a spatial light modulator (SLM) usually is used as a static tweezer array.

So, intensity equalization is an essential prerequisite for preparing a many-body system with individually controlled atoms. Here, we report an intensity equalization algorithm. In particular, we observe the non-uniformity of the tweezer array is below 1.1% when the array size is larger than 1000. Our analysis shows that by optimizing the hardware performance of the optical system, this uniformity could be further improved. Our work offers the opportunities for large-scale quantum computation and simulation with reconfigurable atom arrays.</p>

            <p>We show that matter-wave diffraction off a single standing laser wave can be used as an accurate measurement scheme for photophysical molecular parameters. These include state-dependent optical polarizabilities and photon-absorption cross sections, the relaxation rates for fluorescence, internal conversion, and intersystem crossing, as well as ionization or cleavage probabilities. We discuss how the different photophysical processes manifest as features of the interference pattern, and we determine the accuracy of molecular parameters estimated from a realistic measurement with finite particle numbers. The analysis is based on an analytic calculation in Wigner representation, which accounts for the laser-induced coherent and incoherent dynamics, for the finite longitudinal and transverse coherence in the matter-wave beam, the gravitational and Coriolis acceleration, and an imperfect standing laser wave.</p>

            <h2>Role of intermediate resonances in attosecond photoelectron interferometry in neon</h2>

            <p>Attosecond photoelectron interferometry based on the combination of an attosecond pulse train and a synchronized infrared field is a fundamental technique for the temporal characterization of attosecond waveforms and for the investigation of electron dynamics in the photoionization process. In this approach, the comb of extreme ultraviolet harmonics typically lies above the ionization threshold of the target under investigation, thus releasing a photoelectron by single-photon absorption. The interaction of the outgoing photoelectron with the infrared pulse results in the absorption or emission of infrared photons, thereby creating additional peaks in the photoelectron spectrum, referred to as sidebands. While, in the absence of resonances in the first ionization step, the phases imparted on the photoionization process evolve smoothly with the photon energy, the presence of intermediate resonances imprints a large additional phase on the outgoing photoelectron wave packet. In this work, using a comb of harmonics below and above the ionization threshold of neon, we investigate the effect of intermediate bound excited states on attosecond photoelectron interferometry. We show that the phase of the oscillations of the sidebands and their angular distributions are strongly affected by such resonances. By slightly tuning the photon energies of the extreme ultraviolet harmonics, we show how the contributions of selected resonances can be enhanced or suppressed.</p>

            <h2>From scale-free to Anderson localization: a size-dependent transition</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Burcu Yılmaz, Cem Yuce, Ceyhun Bulutay</p>
            <p>Scale-free localization in non-Hermitian systems is a distinctive type of localization where the localization length of certain eigenstates, known as scale-free localized (SFL) states, scales proportionally with the system size. Unlike skin states, where the localization length is independent of the system size, SFL states maintain a spatial profile that remains invariant as the system size changes. We consider a model involving a single non-Hermitian impurity in an otherwise Hermitian one-dimensional lattice. Introducing disorder into this system transforms SFL states into Anderson-localized states. In contrast to the Hatano-Nelson model, where disorder typically leads to the localization of skin states and a size-independent Anderson transition, the scale-free localization in our model causes a size-dependent Anderson transition.</p>

            <h2>Proof of absence of local conserved quantities in two- and higher-dimensional quantum Ising models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuuya Chiba</p>
            <p>We prove that the Ising models with transverse and longitudinal fields on the hypercubic lattices with dimensions higher than one have no local conserved quantities other than the Hamiltonian. This holds for any value of the longitudinal field, including zero, as far as the transverse field and the Ising interactions are nonzero. The conserved quantity considered here is ``local'' in a very weak sense: it can be written as a linear combination of operators whose side lengths of the supports in one direction do not exceed half the system size, while the side lengths in the other directions are arbitrary. We also prove that the above result holds even in the ladder system. Our results extend the recently developed technique of the proof of absence of local conserved quantities in one-dimensional systems to higher dimensions and to the ladder.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Antonio M. García-García, Chang Liu, Lucas Sá, Jacobus J. M. Verbaarschot, Jie-ping Zheng</p>
            <p>The growth of information scrambling, captured by out-of-time-order correlation functions (OTOCs), is a central indicator of the nature of many-body quantum dynamics. Here, we compute analytically the complete time dependence of the OTOC for an integrable Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, $N$ Majoranas with random two-body interactions of infinite range, coupled to a Markovian bath at finite temperature. In the limit of no coupling to the bath, the time evolution of scrambling experiences different stages. For $t \lesssim \sqrt{N}$, after an initial polynomial growth, the OTOC approaches saturation in a power-law fashion with oscillations superimposed. At $t \sim \sqrt{N}$, the OTOC reverses trend and starts to decrease linearly in time. The reason for this linear decrease is that, despite being a subleading $1/N$ effect, the OTOC in this region is governed by the spectral form factor of the antisymmetric couplings of the SYK model. The linear decrease stops at $t \sim 2N$, the Heisenberg time, where saturation occurs. The effect of the environment is an overall exponential decay of the OTOC for times longer than the inverse of the coupling strength to the bath. The oscillations at $t \lesssim \sqrt{N}$ indicate lack of thermalization -- a desired feature for a better performance of quantum information devices.</p>

            <h2>Theory of Valley Splitting in Si/SiGe Spin-Qubits: Interplay of Strain, Resonances and Random Alloy Disorder</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abel Thayil, Lasse Ermoneit, Markus Kantner</p>
            <p>Electron spin-qubits in silicon-germanium (SiGe) heterostructures are a major candidate for the realization of scalable quantum computers. A critical challenge in strained Si/SiGe quantum wells (QWs) is the existence of two nearly degenerate valley states at the conduction band minimum that can lead to leakage of quantum information. To address this issue, various strategies have been explored to enhance the valley splitting (i.e., the energy gap between the two low-energy conduction band minima), such as sharp interfaces, oscillating germanium concentrations in the QW (known as wiggle well) and shear strain engineering. In this work, we develop a comprehensive envelope-function theory augmented by empirical nonlocal pseudopotential theory to incorporate the effects of alloy disorder, strain, and non-trivial resonances arising from interaction between valley states across different Brillouin zones. We apply our model to analyze common epitaxial profiles studied in the literature with a focus on wiggle well type structures and compare our results with previous work. Our framework provides an efficient tool for quantifying the interplay of these effects on the valley splitting, enabling complex epitaxial profile optimization in future work.</p>

            <p>The demand for artificially generated data for the development, training and testing of new algorithms is omnipresent. Quantum computing (QC), does offer the hope that its inherent probabilistic functionality can be utilised in this field of generative artificial intelligence. In this study, we use quantum-classical hybrid generative adversarial networks (QuGANs) to artificially generate graphs of shipping routes. We create a training dataset based on real shipping data and investigate to what extent QuGANs are able to learn and reproduce inherent distributions and geometric features of this data. We compare hybrid QuGANs with classical Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), with a special focus on their parameter efficiency. Our results indicate that QuGANs are indeed able to quickly learn and represent underlying geometric properties and distributions, although they seem to have difficulties in introducing variance into the sampled data. Compared to classical GANs of greater size, measured in the number of parameters used, some QuGANs show similar result quality. Our reference to concrete use cases, such as the generation of shipping data, provides an illustrative example and demonstrate the potential and diversity in which QC can be used.</p>

            <p>Efficient, low-noise, and high-bandwidth transduction between optical and microwave photons is key to long-range quantum communication between distant superconducting quantum processors. Recent demonstrations of microwave-optical transduction using the broadband direct electro-optic (Pockels) effect in optical thin films made of AlN or LiNbO$_3$ have shown promise. To improve efficiency and added noise, materials with larger Pockels coefficients, such as the soft ferroelectrics BaTiO$_3$ or SrTiO$_3$, are required. However, these materials require adapted designs and fabrication approaches due to their nonlinear and, in some cases, hysteretic electro-optic response. Here, we engineer an on-chip, triply resonant transducer comprising low-loss BaTiO$_3$-on-SiO$_2$ waveguides monolithically integrated with a superconducting microwave resonator made of Nb. We demonstrate bidirectional microwave-optical transduction and reach total off-chip efficiencies of $1\times10^{-6}$ using pulsed pumping. Our novel device concept permits in-situ poling of the ferroelectric material without introducing excess microwave loss, using a fully subtractive fabrication process with superconducting air bridges. In addition, we investigate optically induced heating, revealing fast thermalization and quasiparticle resilience of the microwave resonator. Our transducer concept and fabrication process are applicable to other materials with a large bias-induced Pockels effect and pave the way for efficient, low-power quantum interconnects.</p>

            <p>Principal component analysis is commonly used for dimensionality reduction, feature extraction, denoising, and visualization. The most commonly used principal component analysis method is based upon optimization of the L2-norm, however, the L2-norm is known to exaggerate the contribution of errors and outliers. When optimizing over the L1-norm, the components generated are known to exhibit robustness or resistance to outliers in the data. The L1-norm components can be solved for with a binary optimization problem. Previously, L1-BF has been used to solve the binary optimization for multiple components simultaneously. In this paper we propose QAPCA, a new method for finding principal components using quantum annealing hardware which will optimize over the robust L1-norm. The conditions required for convergence of the annealing problem are discussed. The potential speedup when using quantum annealing is demonstrated through complexity analysis and experimental results. To showcase performance against classical principal component analysis techniques experiments upon synthetic Gaussian data, a fault detection scenario and breast cancer diagnostic data are studied. We find that the reconstruction error when using QAPCA is comparable to that when using L1-BF.</p>

            <p>Preparing fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states represents a key challenge for quantum simulators. While small Laughlin-type states have been realized by manipulating two atoms or two photons, scaling up these settings to larger ensembles stands as an impractical task using existing methods and protocols. In this work, we propose to use optimal-control methods to substantially accelerate the preparation of small Laughlin-type states, and demonstrate that the resulting protocols are also well suited to realize larger FQH states under realistic preparation times. Our schemes are specifically built on the recent optical-lattice experiment [Leonard et al., Nature (2023)], and consist in optimizing very few control parameters: the tunneling amplitudes and linear gradients along the two directions of the lattice. We demonstrate the robustness of our optimal-control schemes against control errors and disorder, and discuss their advantages over existing preparation methods. Our work paves the way to the efficient realization of strongly-correlated topological states in quantum-engineered systems.</p>

            <h2>v-representability and Hohenberg-Kohn theorem for non-interacting Schr\"odinger operators with distributional potentials in the one-dimensional torus</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thiago Carvalho Corso</p>
            <p>In this paper, we show that the ground-state density of any non-interacting Schrödinger operator on the one-dimensional torus with potentials in a certain class of distributions is strictly positive. This result together with recent results from [Sutter el al (2024), J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 57 475202] provides a complete characterization of the set of non-interacting v-representable densities on the torus. Moreover, we prove that, for said class of non-interacting Schrödinger operators with distributional potentials, the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem holds, i.e., the external potential is uniquely determined by the ground-state density. In particular, the density-to-potential Kohn-Sham map is single-valued, and the non-interacting Lieb functional is differentiable at every point in this space of $v$-representable densities. These results contribute to establishing a solid mathematical foundation for the Kohn-Sham scheme in this simplified setting.</p>

            <p>We introduce a visual representation for generating entangled-based quantum effects under pre- and post- selected states that allows us to reveal equivalence between seemingly different quantum effects. We show how to realize entangled quantum systems of an arbitrary number of qubits from a single or pre-specified number of physical particles. We then show that a variation of the quantum Cheshire cat experiment and Hardy's paradox are equivalent and propose a class of experiments that generalizes both experiments. We show that the weak values of the products of projection operators allow us to get the weak value of each projection operator, implying that the weak value of the product of projection operators includes the entire information about the weak values in the system. In nature, interactions can only be acted between a pair of particles. We show how to realize quantum systems of multiwise interacted qubits, i.e., interactions that come in groups of n>2 qubits. In this way, we are able to propose unique quantum systems that consist of interacted groups of entangled states. The proposed framework opens the door toward a new way to explore quantum systems of entangled particles and quantum phenomena that emerge from such a general setting.</p>

            <p>Noise remains a fundamental challenge in quantum computing, significantly affecting pulse fidelity and overall circuit performance. This paper introduces an adaptive algorithm for pulse-level quantum error mitigation, designed to enhance fidelity by dynamically responding to noise conditions without modifying circuit gates. By targeting pulse parameters directly, this method reduces the impact of various noise sources, improving algorithm resilience in quantum circuits. We show the latter by applying our protocol to Grover's and Deutsch-Jozsa algorithms. Experimental results show that this pulse-level strategy provides a flexible and efficient solution for increasing fidelity during the noisy execution of quantum circuits. Our work contributes to advancements in error mitigation techniques, essential for robust quantum computing.</p>

            <p>We discuss Bell nonlocality in quantum networks with unreliable sources. Our main result is a condition on the observed data which ensures that inconclusive events can be safely discarded, without introducing any loophole. More formally, we characterize the fair-sampling property for measurements in a network. When all measurements are fair-sampling, we show that the post-selection of conclusive outcomes does not compromise the assumption of source independence, hence avoiding the detection loophole. Furthermore, we show that in some cases, the fair-sampling property can in fact be guaranteed based only on observed data. To show this, we prove that saturation of the Finner inequality provides a self-test of the underlying quantum model. We illustrate the relevance of our results by demonstrating an improvement in device-independent randomness generation for a photonic Bell test with a probabilistic source and for the triangle network.</p>

            <p>We proposed a theoretical scheme to investigate how to generate the nonreciprocal bipartite entanglement between cavity mode and vibrational modes in a molecular cavity optomechanical system. Our system consists of $\mathcal{N}$ molecules within a spinning whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) resonator whose vibrations can be strongly entangled with an auxiliary cavity and plasmonic cavity. We find that nonreciprocal photon-vibration entanglement and nonreciprocal vibration-vibration entanglement can exist in our system at high temperatures. These nonreciprocal entanglements are induced by the Sagnac-Fizeau effect. The two types of nonreciprocal entanglements can be enhanced by spinning the WGM resonator in the CCW direction. This ensures that the optical photon is driven by blue-detuned driving field. Moreover, we find that the vibration-vibration entanglement can be greatly enhanced as the number of the molecules increases. Our work finds applications in quantum information transmission</p>

            <p>Determining a beam's full trajectory requires tracking both its position and momentum (angular) information. However, the product of position and momentum uncertainty in a simultaneous measurement of the two parameters is bound by the Heisenberg uncertainty limit (HUL).

We show that quantum entanglement can be exploited to achieve a beam tracking accuracy beyond the HUL in a simultaneous measurement. Moreover, with existing detection technologies, it is already possible to achieve near real-time beam tracking capabilities at the single-photon level. The technique also exhibits high resilience to background influences, with negligible reduction in tracking accuracy even when subjected to a disruptive beam that is significantly brighter than SPDC.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joshua M. Lewis, Lincoln D. Carr</p>
            <p>Until now multiscale quantum problems have appeared to be out of reach at the many-body level relevant to strongly correlated materials and current quantum information devices. In fact, they can be modeled with $q$-th order fractional derivatives, as we demonstrate in this work, treating classical and quantum phase transitions in a fractional Ising model for $0 < q \leq 2$ ($q = 2$ is the usual Ising model). We show that fractional derivatives not only enable continuous tuning of critical exponents such as $\nu$, $\delta$, and $\eta$, but also define the Hausdorff dimension $H_D$ of the system tied geometrically to the anomalous dimension $\eta$. We discover that for classical systems, $H_D$ is precisely equal to the fractional order $q$. In contrast, for quantum systems, $H_D$ deviates from this direct equivalence, scaling more gradually, driven by additional degrees of freedom introduced by quantum fluctuations. These results reveal how fractional derivatives fundamentally modify the fractal geometry of many-body interactions, directly influencing the universal symmetries of the system and overcoming traditional dimensional restrictions on phase transitions. Specifically, we find that for $q < 1$ in the classical regime and $q < 2$ in the quantum regime, fractional interactions allow phase transitions in one dimension. This work establishes fractional derivatives as a powerful tool for engineering critical behavior, offering new insights into the geometry of multiscale systems and opening avenues for exploring tunable quantum materials on NISQ devices.</p>

            <p>For the quantum error correction (QEC) and noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) algorithms to function with high efficiency, the raw fidelity of quantum logic gates on physical qubits needs to satisfy strict requirement. The neutral atom quantum computing equipped with Rydberg blockade gates has made impressive progress recently, which makes it worthwhile to explore its potential in the two-qubit entangling gates, including Controlled-PHASE gate and in particular the CZ gate. Provided the quantum coherence is well preserved, improving the fidelity of Rydberg blockade gates calls for special mechanisms to deal with adverse effects caused by realistic experimental conditions. Here the heralded very-high-fidelity Rydberg blockade Controlled-PHASE gate is designed to address these issues, which contains self-correction and projection as the key steps. This trailblazing method can be built on the basis of the previously established buffer-atom-mediated gate, and a special form of symmetry under PT transformation plays a crucial role in the process. We further analyze the performance with respect to a few typical sources of imperfections. This procedure can also be regarded as quantum hardware error correction or mitigation. While this paper by itself does not cover every single subtle issue and still contains many over-simplifications, we find it reasonable to anticipate very-high-fidelity two-qubit quantum logic gate operated in the sense of heralded but probabilistic, whose gate error can reduce to the level of $10^{-4}$--$10^{-6}$ or even lower with reasonably high possibilities.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ming-Jie Liang, Tao Chen, Zheng-Yuan Xue</p>
            <p>Quantum information is very fragile to environmental- and operational-induced imperfections. Therefore, the construction of practical quantum computers needs the quantum error correction technique to protect quantum information. Particularly, encode a logical qubit into the large Hilbert space of an oscillator is a hardware-efficient way of correcting quantum errors. In this strategy, selective number-dependent arbitrary phase (SNAP) gates are vital for universal quantum control. However, the quality of SNAP gates is considerably limited by the small coupling-induced non-linearity of the oscillator. Here, to resolve this limitation, we propose a robust scheme based on quantum optimal control via the functional theory, by designing an appropriate trajectory for a target operation. Besides, we combine the geometric phase approach with our trajectory design scheme to minimize the decoherence effect, by shortening the gate-time. Numerical simulation shows that both errors can be significantly mitigated and the robustness of the geometric gate against both $X$ and $Z$ errors can be maintained. Therefore, our scheme provides a promising alternative for fault-tolerant quantum computation.</p>

However, the performance of these networks can be significantly affected by the quantum noise inherent in NISQ devices. In this paper, we conduct an extensive comparative analysis of various HQNN algorithms, namely Quantum Convolution Neural Network (QCNN), Quanvolutional Neural Network (QuanNN), and Quantum Transfer Learning (QTL), for image classification tasks. We evaluate the performance of each algorithm across quantum circuits with different entangling structures, variations in layer count, and optimal placement in the architecture. Subsequently, we select the highest-performing architectures and assess their robustness against noise influence by introducing quantum gate noise through Phase Flip, Bit Flip, Phase Damping, Amplitude Damping, and the Depolarizing Channel. Our results reveal that the top-performing models exhibit varying resilience to different noise gates. However, in most scenarios, the QuanNN demonstrates greater robustness across various quantum noise channels, consistently outperforming other models.

Then we derive bound states by subtracting the states corresponding to Bethe ansatz solutions from the entire two-excitation Hilbert space, and construct the two-photon scattering matrix (S-matrix) by using Bethe ansatz eigenstates and bound states. We further study the properties of output states, which include both the scattering and bound states, for arbitrarily incident two-photon states by using a concrete example. We find that the oscillation period of the scattering states and decay rates of the bound states strongly depend on the distance between two coupling points. Moreover, we find that the two-photon correlation in the bound states can be enhanced by changing such distance when the total energy of two incident photons equals to two times of single photon resonance energy. We also generalize our study to the case that the giant atom is coupled to the waveguide via $N$ coupling points. We obtain all the eigenstates and eigenvalues of the scattering matrix and construct the S-matrix. Comparing with the case of the two coupling points, we find the photon correlation can be further enhanced by increasing the number of the coupling points for the same incident states when the distance of any two nearest neighbor coupling points is half of the wavelength.</p>

            <h2>Dynamics and Spectral Response of linear-quadratic optomechanical interaction: Effects of pure dephasing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alejandro R. Urzúa</p>
            <p>In this manuscript, the decoherence dynamics and spectral response of an optomechanical system, with linear and quadratic couplings, is addressed. The decoherence considered arises from pure dephasing, described by the Milburn stochastic evolution of the Schrödinger equation. In the first part of the manuscript, it is shown how the decoherence rate influences the evolution of the number of phonons, and the quadrature of the mechanical resonator. In the second part of the manuscript, an attempt to look at the spectral response of the mechanical part of the system is given using non-stationary spectroscopy. It is emphasized the response of the resonator in its equilibrium position when a single photon excitation in the cavity field is prepared. Coherent states are also considered in the cavity field and the mechanical resonator. Results and discussion comparing the inclusions of the linear, quadratic, and linear-quadratic couplings are given.</p>

            <p>We present an end-to-end workflow for superconducting qubit readout that embeds co-designed Neural Networks (NNs) into the Quantum Instrumentation Control Kit (QICK). Capitalizing on the custom firmware and software of the QICK platform, which is built on Xilinx RFSoC FPGAs, we aim to leverage machine learning (ML) to address critical challenges in qubit readout accuracy and scalability. The workflow utilizes the hls4ml package and employs quantization-aware training to translate ML models into hardware-efficient FPGA implementations via user-friendly Python APIs. We experimentally demonstrate the design, optimization, and integration of an ML algorithm for single transmon qubit readout, achieving 96% single-shot fidelity with a latency of 32ns and less than 16% FPGA look-up table resource utilization. Our results offer the community an accessible workflow to advance ML-driven readout and adaptive control in quantum information processing applications.</p>

            <p>Pressure is a key parameter for tuning or revealing superconductivity in materials and compounds. Many measurements of superconducting phase transition temperatures have been conducted using diamond anvil cells (DACs), which provide a wide pressure range and enable concomitant microscopic structural characterization of the sample. However, the inherently small sample volumes in DACs complicate the unambiguous detection of the Meissner effect, the hallmark of superconductivity. Recently, the Meissner effect in superconductors within a DAC was successfully demonstrated using diamond nitrogen-vacancy (N-V) widefield magnetometry, a non-invasive optical technique. In this work, we show that N-V magnetometry can also map superconductivity with micrometer resolution. We apply this technique to a microcrystal of HgBa$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{8+\delta}$ (Hg-1223) mercury-based cuprate superconductor under 4 GPa of pressure. The method is capable to detect the magnetic field expulsion and heterogeneities in the sample, visible in a set of characteristic parameters as the local critical temperature $T_{c}$. Flux pinning zones are identified through flux trapping maps. This approach could enable detailed investigations of superconductivity of a broad range of materials under high-pressure conditions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thore Gerlach, Loong Kuan Lee, Frédéric Barbaresco, Nico Piatkowski</p>
            <p>Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) focuses on determining conflict-free paths for multiple agents navigating through a shared space to reach specified goal locations. This problem becomes computationally challenging, particularly when handling large numbers of agents, as frequently encountered in practical applications like coordinating autonomous vehicles. Quantum computing (QC) is a promising candidate in overcoming such limits. However, current quantum hardware is still in its infancy and thus limited in terms of computing power and error robustness. In this work, we present the first optimal hybrid quantum-classical MAPF algorithm which is based on branch-and-cut-and-prize. QC is integrated by iteratively solving QUBO problems, based on conflict graphs. Experiments on actual quantum hardware and results on benchmark data suggest that our approach dominates previous QUBO formulations and baseline MAPF solvers.</p>

            <p>In semiconductor hole spin qubits, low magnetic field ($B$) operation extends the coherence time ($T_\mathrm{2}^*$) but proportionally reduces the gate speed. In contrast, singlet-triplet (ST) qubits are primarily controlled by the exchange interaction ($J$) and can thus maintain high gate speeds even at low $B$. However, a large $J$ introduces a significant charge component to the qubit, rendering ST qubits more vulnerable to charge noise when driven. Here, we demonstrate a highly coherent ST hole spin qubit in germanium, operating at both low $B$ and low $J$. By modulating $J$, we achieve resonant driving of the ST qubit, obtaining an average gate fidelity of $99.68\%$ and a coherence time of $T_\mathrm{2}^*=1.9\,\mu$s. Moreover, by applying the resonant drive continuously, we realize a dressed ST qubit with a tenfold increase in coherence time ($T_\mathrm{2\rho}^*=20.3\,\mu$s). Frequency modulation of the driving signal enables universal control, with an average gate fidelity of $99.64\%$. Our results demonstrate the potential for extending coherence times while preserving high-fidelity control of germanium-based ST qubits, paving the way for more efficient operations in semiconductor-based quantum processors.</p>

            <h2>A Non-perturbative General Approximation Scheme (NGAS) for Interacting Quantum Systems with Perturbation Theory for Arbitrary Strength of Interaction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bimal P. Mahapatra, Noubihary Pradhan</p>
            <p>A non-perturbative general approximation scheme (NGAS) is presented which is potentially applicable for arbitrary strength of interaction in quantum theory. The scheme utilizes an input Hamiltonian, which is exactly solvable. The effects of interaction are incorporated into this input Hamiltonian through a non-linear feedback mechanism by imposing self-consistency conditions. The method is nonperturbative, yet improvable in a new formulation of perturbation theory, designated as: mean field perturbation theory (MFPT). We apply the scheme to anharmonic interactions in one dimension employing the harmonic-approximation and obtain uniformly accurate results by Borel summation, for the quartic-, sextic-, octic-anharmonic oscillators and to the quartic double-well oscillator (QDWO) for {\emph{arbitrary strength of coupling}}. The {\it{flexibility}} of the scheme to the choice of the input is demonstrated by producing results of comparable accuracy by employing the infinite-square Hamiltonian as input. Application to the {\lambda}{\phi}^4-quantum field theory leads to the equivalence of the present method to the Gaussian-effective potential approach in the harmonic approximation. Additionally,however the underlying condensate structure of the effective vacuum is shown to emerge and the instability of the perturbative ground state is established. The results for the QDWO may be contrasted with those from the standard formulation of perturbation theory , where Borel-summation {\it{fails}} for any value of the coupling strength.</p>

            <h2>Particle exchange statistics beyond fermions and bosons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiyuan Wang, Kaden R. A. Hazzard</p>
            <p>It is commonly believed that there are only two types of particle exchange statistics in quantum mechanics, fermions and bosons, with the exception of anyons in two dimension. In principle, a second exception known as parastatistics, which extends outside of two dimensions, has been considered but was believed to be physically equivalent to fermions and bosons. In this paper we show that nontrivial parastatistics inequivalent to either fermions or bosons can exist in physical systems. These new types of identical particles obey generalized exclusion principles, leading to exotic free-particle thermodynamics distinct from any system of free fermions and bosons. We formulate our theory by developing a second quantization of paraparticles, which naturally includes exactly solvable non-interacting theories, and incorporates physical constraints such as locality. We then construct a family of exactly solvable quantum spin models in one and two dimensions where free paraparticles emerge as quasiparticle excitations, and their exchange statistics can be physically observed and is notably distinct from fermions and bosons. This demonstrates the possibility of a new type of quasiparticle in condensed matter systems, and, more speculatively, the potential for previously unconsidered types of elementary particles.</p>

            <h2>Can increasing the size and flexibility of a molecule reduce decoherence and prolong charge migration?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alan Scheidegger, Nikolay V. Golubev, Jiri J. L. Vanicek</p>
            <p>Coherent superposition of electronic states, created by ionizing a molecule, can initiate ultrafast dynamics of the electron density. Correlation between nuclear and electron motions, however, typically dissipates the electronic coherence in only a few femtoseconds, especially in larger and more flexible molecules. We, therefore, use ab initio semiclassical dynamics to study decoherence in a sequence of analogous organic molecules of increasing size and find, surprisingly, that extending the carbon skeleton in propynal analogs slows down decoherence and prolongs charge migration. To elucidate this observation, we decompose the overall decoherence into contributions from individual vibrational modes and show that: (1) The initial decay of electronic coherence is caused by high- and intermediate-frequency vibrations via momentum separation of nuclear wavepackets evolving on different electronic surfaces. (2) At later times, the coherence disappears completely due to the increasing position separation in the low-frequency modes. (3) In agreement with another study, we observe that only normal modes that preserve the symmetry of the molecule induce decoherence. All together, we justify the enhanced charge migration by a combination of increased hole-mixing and the disappearance of decoherence contributions from specific vibrational modes: CO stretching in butynal and various H rockings in pentynal.</p>

            <p>Levitated nanoparticles are a promising platform for sensing applications and for macroscopic quantum experiments. While the nanoparticles' motional temperatures can be reduced to near absolute zero, their uncontrolled internal degrees of freedom remain much hotter, inevitably leading to the emission of heat radiation. The decoherence and motional heating caused by this thermal emission process is still poorly understood beyond the case of the center-of-mass motion of point particles. Here, we present the master equation describing the impact of heat radiation on the motional quantum state of arbitrarily sized and shaped dielectric rigid rotors. It predicts the localization of spatio-orientational superpositions only based on the bulk material properties and the particle geometry. A counter-intuitive and experimentally relevant implication of the presented theory is that orientational superpositions of optically isotropic bodies are not protected by their symmetry, even in the small-particle limit.</p>

The FSWT perturbatively eliminates the oscillatory components in the driven Hamiltonian by solving operator-valued Sylvester equations with systematic approximations. It goes beyond various high-frequency expansion methods commonly used in Floquet theory, as we demonstrate with the example of the driven Fermi-Hubbard model. In the limit of high driving frequencies, the FSWT Hamiltonian reduces to the widely used Floquet-Magnus result. We anticipate this method will be useful for designing Rydberg multi-qubit gates, controlling correlated hopping in quantum simulations in optical lattices, and describing multi-orbital and long-range interacting systems driven in-gap.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lennart Bittel, Francesco Anna Mele, Antonio Anna Mele, Salvatore Tirone, Ludovico Lami</p>
            <p>Gaussian states of bosonic quantum systems enjoy numerous technological applications and are ubiquitous in nature. Their significance lies in their simplicity, which in turn rests on the fact that they are uniquely determined by two experimentally accessible quantities, their first and second moments. But what if these moments are only known approximately, as is inevitable in any realistic experiment? What is the resulting error on the Gaussian state itself, as measured by the most operationally meaningful metric for distinguishing quantum states, namely, the trace distance? In this work, we fully resolve this question by demonstrating that if the first and second moments are known up to an error $\varepsilon$, the trace distance error on the state also scales as $\varepsilon$, and this functional dependence is optimal. To prove this, we establish tight bounds on the trace distance between two Gaussian states in terms of the norm distance of their first and second moments. As an application, we improve existing bounds on the sample complexity of tomography of Gaussian states.</p>

            <p>Khovanov homology is a topological knot invariant that categorifies the Jones polynomial, recognizes the unknot, and is conjectured to appear as an observable in $4D$ supersymmetric Yang--Mills theory. Despite its rich mathematical and physical significance, the computational complexity of Khovanov homology remains largely unknown. To address this challenge, this work initiates the study of efficient quantum algorithms for Khovanov homology. We provide simple proofs that increasingly accurate additive approximations to the ranks of Khovanov homology are DQC1-hard, BQP-hard, and #P-hard, respectively. For the first two approximation regimes, we propose a novel quantum algorithm. Our algorithm is efficient provided the corresponding Hodge Laplacian thermalizes in polynomial time and has a sufficiently large spectral gap, for which we give numerical and analytical evidence. Our approach introduces a pre-thermalization procedure that allows our quantum algorithm to succeed even if the Betti numbers of Khovanov homology are much smaller than the dimensions of the corresponding chain spaces, overcoming a limitation of prior quantum homology algorithms. We introduce novel connections between Khovanov homology and graph theory to derive analytic lower bounds on the spectral gap.</p>

            <p>Quantum computing is an emerging technology that has seen significant software and hardware improvements in recent years. Executing a quantum program requires the compilation of its quantum circuit for a target Quantum Processing Unit (QPU). Various methods for qubit mapping, gate synthesis, and optimization of quantum circuits have been proposed and implemented in compilers. These compilers try to generate a quantum circuit that leads to the best execution quality - a criterion that is usually approximated by figures of merit such as the number of (two-qubit) gates, the circuit depth, expected fidelity, or estimated success probability. However, it is often unclear how well these figures of merit represent the actual execution quality on a QPU. In this work, we investigate the correlation between established figures of merit and actual execution quality on real machines - revealing that the correlation is weaker than anticipated and that more complex figures of merit are not necessarily more accurate. Motivated by this finding, we propose an improved figure of merit (based on a machine learning approach) that can be used to predict the expected execution quality of a quantum circuit for a chosen QPU without actually executing it. The employed machine learning model reveals the influence of various circuit features on generating high correlation scores. The proposed figure of merit demonstrates a strong correlation and outperforms all previous ones in a case study - achieving an average correlation improvement of 49%.</p>

The latter is widely used for image segmentation tasks such as medical imaging and autonomous driving. Our numerical analysis indicates that the Qu-Net can achieve superior segmentation performance compared to a U-Net baseline. These results highlight the potential of QuFeX to enhance deep neural networks by leveraging hybrid computational paradigms, providing a path towards a robust framework for real-world applications requiring precise feature extraction.</p>

            <p>Understanding the effects of noise on quantum computations is fundamental to the development of quantum hardware and quantum algorithms. Simulation tools are essential for quantitatively modelling these effects, yet unless artificial restrictions are placed on the circuit or noise model, accurately modelling noisy quantum computations is an extremely challenging task due to unfavourable scaling of required computational resources. Tensor network methods offer a viable solution for simulating computations that generate limited entanglement or that have noise models which yield low gate fidelities. However, in the most interesting regime of entangling circuits (with high gate fidelities) relevant for error correction and mitigation tensor network simulations often achieve poor accuracy. In this work we develop and numerically test a method for significantly improving the accuracy of tensor network simulations of noisy quantum circuits in the low-noise (i.e. high gate-fidelity) regime. Our method comes with the advantages that it (i) allows for the simulation of quantum circuits under generic types of noise model, (ii) is especially tailored to the low-noise regime, and (iii) retains the benefits of tensor network scaling, enabling efficient simulations of large numbers of qubits. We build upon the observations that adding extra noise to a quantum circuit makes it easier to simulate with tensor networks, and that the results can later be reliably extrapolated back to the low-noise regime of interest. These observations form the basis for a novel emulation technique that we call non-zero noise extrapolation, in analogy to the quantum error mitigation technique of zero-noise extrapolation.</p>

            <p>Accurately describing strongly correlated systems with affordable quantum resources remains a central challenge for quantum chemistry applications on near and intermediate-term quantum computers. The localized active space self-consistent field (LASSCF) approximates the complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) by generating active space-based wave functions within specific fragments while treating interfragment correlation with mean-field approach, hence is computationally less expensive. Hardware-efficient ansatzes (HEA) offer affordable and shallower circuits, yet they often fail to capture the necessary correlation. Previously, Jastrow-factor-inspired non-unitary qubit operators were proposed to use with HEA for variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) calculations (nuVQE), as they do not increase circuit depths and recover correlation beyond the mean-field level for Hartree-Fock initial states. Here, we explore running nuVQE with LASSCF as the initial state. The method, named LAS-nuVQE, is shown to recover interfragment correlations, reach chemical accuracy with a small number of gates (<70) in both H4 and square cyclobutadiene. To further address the inherent symmetry-breaking in HEA, we implemented spin-constrained LAS-nuVQE to extend the capabilities of HEA further and show spin-pure results for square cyclobutadiene. We mitigate the increased measurement overhead of nuVQE via Pauli grouping and shot-frugal sampling, reducing measurement costs by up to two orders of magnitude compared to ungrouped operator, and show that one can achieve better accuracy with a small number of shots (10^3-4) per one expectation value calculation compared to noiseless simulations with one or two orders of magnitude more shots. Finally, wall clock time estimates show that, with our measurement mitigation protocols, nuVQE becomes a cheaper and more accurate alternative than VQE with HEA.</p>

            <p>While universal quantum computers remain under development, analog quantum simulators offer a powerful alternative for understanding complex systems in condensed matter, chemistry, and high-energy physics. One compelling application is the characterization of real-time lattice gauge theories (LGTs). LGTs are nonperturbative tools, utilizing discretized spacetime to describe gauge-invariant models. They hold immense potential for understanding fundamental physics but require enforcing local constraints analogous to electromagnetism's Gauss's Law. These constraints, which arise from gauge symmetries and dictate the form of the interaction between matter and gauge fields, are a significant challenge for simulators to enforce. Implementing these constraints at the hardware level in analog simulations is crucial. This requires realizing multibody interactions between matter and gauge-field elements, enabling them to evolve together while suppressing unwanted two-body interactions that violate the gauge symmetry. In this paper, we propose and implement a novel parametrically activated three-qubit interaction within a circuit quantum electrodynamics architecture. We experimentally demonstrate a minimal $U(1)$ spin-1/2 model with a time evolution that intrinsically satisfies Gauss's law in the system. This design serves as the foundational block for simulating LGTs on a superconducting photonic lattice.</p>

            <p>Boson sampling stands out as a promising approach toward experimental demonstration of quantum computational advantage. However, the presence of physical noise in near-term experiments hinders the realization of the quantum computational advantage with boson sampling. Since physical noise in near-term boson sampling devices is inevitable, precise characterization of the boundary of noise rates where the classical intractability of boson sampling is maintained is crucial for quantum computational advantage using near-term devices. In this work, we identify the level of partial distinguishability noise that upholds the classical intractability of boson sampling. We find that boson sampling with on average $O(\log N)$ number of distinguishable photons out of $N$ input photons maintains the equivalent complexity to the ideal boson sampling case. By providing strong complexity theoretical evidence of the classical intractability of noisy boson sampling, we expect that our findings will enable one to ultimately demonstrate quantum computational advantage with noisy boson sampling experiments in the near future.</p>

            <p>Entanglement asymmetry has emerged as a novel tool for characterizing symmetry breaking in quantum many-body systems. In this Letter, we investigate how symmetry is dynamically broken through the lens of entanglement asymmetry in two distinct scenarios: a non-symmetric random quantum circuit and a non-symmetric Hamiltonian quench, with a particular focus on U(1) symmetry. In the former case, the symmetry is first broken and then restored while in the latter case, symmetry remains broken in the subsystem at late times, aligning with the concept of quantum thermalization. Entanglement asymmetry growth exhibits unexpected overshooting behavior at early times in both contexts. We also consider dynamics of non-symmetric initial states under the symmetry-breaking evolution. Due to the competition of symmetry-breaking in both the initial state and Hamiltonian, the early-time entanglement asymmetry displays two qualitatively different behaviors. Furthermore, quantum Mpemba effects remain evident despite the presence of weak symmetry-breaking in both settings.</p>

            <p>Intensity correlations between neighboring pulses open a prevalent yet often overlooked security loophole in decoy-state quantum key distribution (QKD). As a solution, we present and experimentally demonstrate an intensity-correlation-tolerant QKD protocol that mitigates the negative effect that this phenomenon has on the secret key rate according to existing security analyses. Compared to previous approaches, our method significantly enhances the robustness against correlations, notably improving both the maximum transmission distances and the achievable secret key rates across different scenarios. By relaxing constraints on correlation parameters, our protocol enables practical devices to counter intensity correlations. We experimentally demonstrate this first practical solution that directly overcomes this security vulnerability, establish the feasibility and efficacy of our proposal, taking a major step towards loophole-free and high-performance QKD.</p>

            <h2>Characterization and Optimization of Tunable Couplers via Adiabatic Control in Superconducting Circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xuan Zhang, Xu Zhang, Changling Chen, Kai Tang, Kangyuan Yi, Kai Luo, Zheshu Xie, Yuanzhen Chen, Tongxing Yan</p>
            <p>In the pursuit of scalable superconducting quantum computing, tunable couplers have emerged as a pivotal component, offering the flexibility required for complex quantum operations of high performance. In most current architectures of superconducting quantum chips, such couplers are not equipped with dedicated readout circuits to reduce complexity in both design and operation. However, this strategy poses challenges in precise characterization, calibration, and control of the couplers. In this work, we develop a hardware-efficient and robust technique based on adiabatic control to address the above issue. The critical ingredient of this technique is adiabatic swap (aSWAP) operation between a tunable coupler and nearby qubits. Using this technique, we have characterized and calibrated tunable couplers in our chips and achieved straightforward and precise control over these couplers. For example, we have demonstrated the calibration and correction of the flux distortion of couplers. In addition, we have also expanded this technique to tune the dispersive shift between a frequency-fixed qubit and its readout resonator over a wide range.</p>

            <h2>Nonreciprocal interactions induce frequency shifts in superradiant lasers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tobias Nadolny, Matteo Brunelli, Christoph Bruder</p>
            <p>Superradiant lasers, which consist of incoherently driven atoms coupled to a lossy cavity, are a promising source of coherent light due to their stable frequency and superior narrow linewidth. We show that when a fraction of the atoms is not driven, a shift in the lasing frequency and a broadening of the linewidth occur, limiting the performance of a superradiant laser. We explain this behavior by identifying nonreciprocal interactions between driven and undriven atoms, i.e., competing alignment and antialignment of their dipoles. Our results have implications for the realization of superradiant lasers, establishing the relevance of nonreciprocal phenomena for quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>On-demand generation of single photons from solid-state quantum emitters is a key building block for future quantum networks, particularly quantum key distribution (QKD) systems, by enabling higher secure key rates (SKR) and lower quantum bit error rates (QBER).

The results show a sifted key rate (SiKR) of 17.5 kbps with a QBER of 6.49 % at a dynamic polarization encoding rate of 40 MHz. Finite-key analysis yields a SKR of 7 kbps, as one of the highest SKR obtained for any room-temperature single photon source. Our results highlight the potential of hBN defects in advancing quantum communication technologies.</p>

            <h2>Effects of valley splitting on resonant-tunneling readout of spin qubits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tetsufumi Tanamoto, Keiji Ono</p>
            <p>The effect of valley splitting on the readout of qubit states is theoretically investigated in a three-quantum-dot (QD) system. A single unit of the three-QD system consists of qubit-QDs and a channel-QD that is connected to a conventional transistor. The nonlinear source--drain current characteristics under resonant-tunneling effects are used to distinguish different qubit states. Using nonequilibrium Green functions, the current formula for the three-QD system is derived when each QD has two valley energy levels. Two valley states in each QD are considered to be affected by variations in the fabrication process. We found that when valley splitting is smaller than Zeeman splitting, the current nonlinearity can improve the readout, provided that the nonuniformity of the valley energy levels is small. Conversely, when the valley splitting is larger than the Zeeman splitting, the nonuniformity degraded the readout. In both cases, we showed that there are regions where the measurement time $t_{\rm meas}$ is much less than the decoherence time $t_{\rm dec}$ such that $t_{\rm dec}/t_{\rm meas}>100$. This suggests that less than 1\% measurement error is anticipated, which opens up the possibility for implementing surface codes even in the presence of valley splitting.</p>

            <p>Artificial Kitaev chains have emerged as a promising platform for realizing topological quantum computing. Once the chains are formed and the Majorana zero modes are braided/fused, reading out the parity of the chains is essential for further verifying the non-Abelian property of the Majorana zero modes. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of using a superconducting transmon qubit, which incorporates an end of a four-site quantum dot-superconductor chain based on a Ge/Si nanowire, to directly detect the singlet/doublet state, and thus the parity of the entire chain. We also demonstrate that for multiple-dot chains there are two types of 0-{\pi} transitions between different charging states: the parity-flip 0-{\pi} transition and the parity-preserved 0-{\pi} transition. Furthermore, we show that the inter-dot coupling, hence the strengths of cross Andreev reflection and elastic cotunneling of electrons, can be adjusted by local electrostatic gating in chains fabricated on Ge/Si core-shell nanowires. Our exploration would be helpful for the ultimate realization of topological quantum computing based on artificial Kitaev chains.</p>

            <h2>Spin coupling is all you need: Encoding strong electron correlation in molecules on quantum computers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Marti-Dafcik, Hugh G. A. Burton, David P. Tew</p>
            <p>The performance of quantum algorithms for eigenvalue problems, such as computing Hamiltonian spectra, depends strongly on the overlap of the initial wavefunction and the target eigenvector. In a basis of Slater determinants, the representation of energy eigenstates of systems with $N$ strongly correlated electrons requires a number of determinants that scales exponentially with $N$. On classical processors, this restricts simulations to systems where $N$ is small. Here, we show that quantum computers can efficiently simulate strongly correlated molecular systems by directly encoding the dominant entanglement structure in the form of spin-coupled initial states. This avoids resorting to expensive classical or quantum state preparation heuristics and instead exploits symmetries in the wavefunction. We provide quantum circuits for deterministic preparation of a family of spin eigenfunctions with ${N \choose N/2}$ Slater determinants with depth $\mathcal{O}(N)$ and $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ local gates. Their use as highly entangled initial states in quantum algorithms reduces the total runtime of quantum phase estimation and related fault-tolerant methods by orders of magnitude. Furthermore, we assess the application of spin-coupled wavefunctions as initial states for several heuristic quantum algorithms, namely the variational quantum eigensolver, adiabatic state preparation, and different versions of quantum subspace diagonalization (QSD) including QSD based on real-time-evolved states. We also propose a novel QSD algorithm that exploits states obtained through adaptive quantum eigensolvers. For all algorithms, we demonstrate that using spin-coupled initial states drastically reduces the quantum resources required to simulate strongly correlated ground and excited states. Our work provides a crucial component for enabling scalable quantum simulation of classically challenging electronic systems.</p>

            <p>Spins and oscillators are foundational to much of physics and applied sciences. For quantum information, a spin 1/2 exemplifies the most basic unit, a qubit. High angular momentum spins (HAMSs) and harmonic oscillators provide multi-level manifolds (e.g., qudits) which have the potential for hardware-efficient protected encodings of quantum information and simulation of many-body quantum systems. In this work, we demonstrate a new quantum control protocol that conceptually merges these disparate hardware platforms. Namely, we show how to modify a harmonic oscillator on-demand to implement a continuous range of generators associated to resonant driving of a harmonic qudit, which we can interpret as accomplishing linear and nonlinear control over a harmonic HAMS degree of freedom. The spin-like dynamics are verified by demonstration of linear spin coherent (SU(2)) rotations, nonlinear spin control, and comparison to other manifolds like simply-truncated oscillators. Our scheme allows the first universal control of such a harmonic qudit encoding: we use linear operations to accomplish four logical gates, and further show that nonlinear harmonicity-preserving operations complete the logical gate set. Our results show how motion on a closed Hilbert space can be useful for quantum information processing and opens the door to superconducting circuit simulations of higher angular momentum quantum magnetism.</p>

            <h2>Recovery of Quantum Correlations using Machine Learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Edward W. Steele, Donald R. Reising, Tian Li</p>
            <p>Quantum sources with strong correlations are essential but delicate resources in quantum information science and engineering. Decoherence and loss are the primary factors that degrade nonclassical quantum correlations, with scattering playing a role in both processes. In this work, we present a method that leverages Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a machine learning technique known for its effectiveness in time-series prediction, to mitigate the detrimental impact of scattering in quantum systems. Our setup involves generating two-mode squeezed light via four-wave mixing in warm rubidium vapor, with one mode subjected to a scatterer to disrupt quantum correlations. Mutual information and intensity-difference squeezing between the two modes are used as metrics for quantum correlations. We demonstrate a 74.7~\% recovery of mutual information and 87.7~\% recovery of two-mode squeezing, despite significant photon loss that would otherwise eliminate quantum correlations. This approach marks a significant step toward recovering quantum correlations from random disruptions without the need for hardware modifications, paving the way for practical applications of quantum protocols.</p>

            <p>We present a scalable, robust approach to creating quantum programs of arbitrary size and complexity. The approach is based on the true abstraction of the problem. The quantum program is expressed in terms of a high-level model together with constraints and objectives on the final program. Advanced synthesis algorithms transform the model into a low-level quantum program that meets the user's specification and is directed at a stipulated hardware. This separation of description from implementation is essential for scale. The technology adapts electronic design automation methods to quantum computing, finding feasible implementations in a virtually unlimited functional space. The results show clear superiority over the compilation and transpilation methods used today. We expect that this technological approach will take over and prevail as quantum software become more demanding, complex, and essential.</p>

            <h2>Knowledge-dependent optimal Gaussian strategies for phase estimation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ricard Ravell Rodríguez, Simon Morelli</p>
            <p>When estimating an unknown phase rotation of a continuous-variable system with homodyne detection, the optimal probe state strongly depends on the value of the estimated parameter. In this article, we identify the optimal pure single-mode Gaussian probe states depending on the knowledge of the estimated phase parameter before the measurement. We find that for a large prior uncertainty, the optimal probe states are close to coherent states, a result in line with findings from noisy parameter estimation. But with increasingly precise estimates of the parameter it becomes beneficial to put more of the available energy into the squeezing of the probe state. Surprisingly, there is a clear jump, where the optimal probe state changes abruptly to a squeezed vacuum state, which maximizes the Fisher information for this estimation task. We use our results to study repeated measurements and compare different methods to adapt the probe state based on the changing knowledge of the parameter according to the previous findings.</p>

            <h2>Topological Phases with Average Symmetries: the Decohered, the Disordered, and the Intrinsic</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruochen Ma, Jian-Hao Zhang, Zhen Bi, Meng Cheng, Chong Wang</p>
            <p>Global symmetries greatly enrich the landscape of topological quantum phases, playing an essential role from topological insulators to fractional quantum Hall effect. Topological phases in mixed quantum states, originating from \textit{decoherence} in open quantum systems or \textit{disorders} in imperfect crystalline solids, have recently garnered significant interest. Unlike pure states, mixed quantum states can exhibit \textit{average symmetries} -- symmetries that keep the total ensemble invariant but not on each individual state. In this work, we present a systematic classification and characterization of average symmetry-protected topological (ASPT) phases applicable to generic symmetry groups, encompassing both average and exact symmetries, for bosonic and fermionic systems. Moreover, we formulate the theory of average symmetry-enriched topological (ASET) orders in disordered bosonic systems. Our systematic approach helps clarify nuanced issues in previous literature and uncovers compelling new physics. Notably, we discover that (1) the definition and classification of ASPT phases in decohered and disordered systems exhibit subtle differences; (2) despite these differences, ASPT phases in both settings can be classified and characterized under a unified framework of defect decoration and spectral sequence; (3) this systematic classification uncovers a plethora of ASPT phases that are \textit{intrinsically mixed}, implying they can exclusively manifest in decohered or disordered systems where part of the symmetry is average; (4) similarly for ASET, we find intrinsically disordered phases exhibiting exotic anyon behaviors -- the ground states of such phases necessarily contain localized anyons, with gapless (yet still localized) excitation spectral.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shu Hamanaka, Kohei Kawabata</p>
            <p>The non-Hermitian skin effect, anomalous localization of an extensive number of eigenstates induced by nonreciprocal dissipation, plays a pivotal role in non-Hermitian topology and significantly influences the open quantum dynamics. However, its genuinely quantum characterization in many-body systems has yet to be developed. Here, we elucidate that the skin effect manifests itself as multifractality in the many-body Hilbert space. This multifractality does not accompany the single-particle skin effect and hence is intrinsic to the many-body skin effect. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the many-body skin effect coexists with spectral statistics of random matrices, in contrast to multifractality associated with the many-body localization, which necessitates the absence of ergodicity. We also illustrate multifractality caused by the Liouvillian skin effect in Markovian open quantum systems. Our work establishes a defining characterization of the non-Hermitian skin effect and uncovers a fundamental relationship between multifractality and ergodicity in open quantum many-body systems.</p>

We quantify the entanglement by using numerical lower bounds for the GME concurrence, as well as by analytically deriving the GME concurrence in regions where the RDM is of rank two.

            <p>As we enter the quantum utility era, the computing paradigm shifts toward quantum-centric computing, where multiple quantum processors collaborate with classical computers, exemplified by platforms like IBM Quantum and Amazon Braket. In this paradigm, efficient resource management is crucial; however, unlike classical computing, quantum processors face significant challenges due to noise, which raises fidelity concerns in quantum applications. Compounding this issue, the noise characteristics across different quantum processors are inherently heterogeneous, making resource optimization even more complex. Existing resource management strategies primarily focus on mapping and scheduling jobs to these heterogeneous backends, which leads to some jobs suffering extremely low fidelity. Targeting quantum optimization jobs (e.g., VQC, VQE, QAOA) - one of the most promising quantum applications in the NISQ era, we hypothesize that running the later stages of a job on a high-fidelity quantum processor can significantly enhance overall fidelity. To validate this hypothesis, we use the VQE as a case study and propose a novel and efficient Genetic Algorithm-based scheduling framework with the consideration of job splitting. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach maintains high fidelity across all jobs and significantly improves system throughput. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm shows excellent scalability with respect to the number of quantum processors and the volume of jobs, making it a robust solution for emerging quantum computing platforms.</p>

            <p>Robust quantum control is crucial for realizing practical quantum technologies. Energy landscape shaping offers an alternative to conventional dynamic control, providing theoretically enhanced robustness and simplifying implementation for certain applications. This work demonstrates the feasibility of robust energy landscape control in a practical implementation with ultracold atoms. We leverage a digital mirror device (DMD) to shape optical potentials, creating complex energy landscapes. To achieve a desired objective, such as efficient quantum state transfer, we formulate a novel hybrid optimization approach that effectively handles both continuous (laser power) and discrete (DMD pixel activation) control parameters. This approach combines constrained quasi-Newton methods with surrogate models for efficient exploration of the vast parameter space. Furthermore, we introduce a framework for analyzing the robustness of the resulting control schemes against experimental uncertainties. By modeling uncertainties as structured perturbations, we systematically assess controller performance and identify robust solutions. We apply these techniques to maximize spin transfer in a chain of trapped atoms, achieving high-fidelity control while maintaining robustness. Our findings provide insights into the experimental viability of controlled spin transfer in cold atom systems. More broadly, the presented optimization and robustness analysis methods apply to a wide range of quantum control problems, offering a toolkit for designing and evaluating robust controllers in complex experimental settings.</p>

This is done through a Rabi driven qubit which is coupled to both modes via sideband driving tones. The outcome of the method is the initialization of the memory mode at any required coherent state. Simulations are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique, along with a comparison to an existing coupling method. Our simulations predict an improvement of an order of magnitude in initialization times compared to existing methods.</p>

            <p>We present an all-silicon source of near-infrared linearly-polarized single photons, fabricated by nanoscale positioning of a color center in a silicon-on-insulator microcavity. The color center consists of a single W center, created at a well-defined position by Si$^{+}$ ion implantation through a 150 nm-diameter nanohole in a mask. A circular Bragg grating cavity resonant with the W's zero-phonon line at 1217 nm is fabricated at the same location as the nanohole. Under above-gap continuous-wave excitation, a very clean photon antibunching behavior ($g{^2} \leq 0.06$) is observed over the entire power range, which highlights the absence of parasitic emitters. Purcell-enhancement of W's zero-phonon emission provides both a record-high photoluminescence count rate among Si color centers (ca $1.2 \times 10^{6}$ counts/s) and apparent Debye-Waller factor around 99%. We also demonstrate the triggered emission of single photons with 93% purity under weak pulsed laser excitation. At high pulsed laser power, we reveal a detrimental effect of repumping processes, that could be mitigated using selective pumping schemes in the future. These results represent a major step towards on-demand sources of indistinguishable near-infrared single photons within silicon photonics chips.</p>

            <h2>Unconventional and robust light-matter interactions based on the non-Hermitian skin effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lei Du, Anton Frisk Kockum</p>
            <p>Lattice models featuring the non-Hermitian skin effect have attracted rapidly growing interest due to their nontrivial spectral topology and the exotic field dynamics they enable. Such non-Hermitian lattices provide a promising paradigm for engineering exotic light-matter interactions which benefit from the intrinsic chirality and unconventional (non-Bloch) band theory. Here we study a series of unconventional light-matter interactions between quantum emitters and the prototypical Hatano--Nelson model, and briefly discuss the case with an extended lattice model dubbed the bosonic Kitaev chain. We focus on the robustness of the dynamics against various imperfections and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. We consider both small emitters, which interact with the lattice at single sites, and giant emitters coupling at multiple sites. The latter exhibit an exclusive amplification mechanism, which we find enables decoherence-free dynamics even in the presence of extra dissipation in the system. The protection from dissipation arises from the cooperation of the non-Hermiticity and the self-interference effect, and is therefore lacking for small emitters. These results not only provide deeper insights into the interplay of non-Hermiticity and various interference effects, but also have potential applications in engineering exotic spin Hamiltonians and quantum networks.</p>

            <p>In recent decades, significant progress has been made in construction and study of individual quantum systems consisting of the basic single matter and energy particles, i.e., atoms and photons, which show great potentials in quantum computation and communication. Here, we demonstrate that the quadruply-bonded Mo$_2$ unit of the complex can trap photons of visible light under ambient conditions, producing intense local electromagnetic (EM) field that features squeezed states, photon antibunching, and vacuum Rabi splitting. Our results show that both the electronic and vibrational states of the Mo$_2$ molecule are modified by coherent coupling with the scattered photons of the Mo$_2$ unit, as evidenced by the Rabi doublet4 and the Mollow triplet in the incoherent resonance fluorescence and the Raman spectra. The Mo$_2$ molecule, acting as an independent emitter-resonator integrated quantum system, allows optical experiments to be conducted in free space, enabling fundamental quantum phenomena to be observed through conventional spectroscopic instrumentation. This provides a new platform for study of field effects and quantum electrodynamics (QED) in the optical domain. The insights gained from this study advance our understanding in metal-metal bond chemistry, molecular physics and quantum optics, with applications in quantum information processing, optoelectronic devices and control of chemical reactivity.</p>

            <h2>A Coherence-Protection Scheme for Quantum Sensors Based on Ultra-Shallow Single Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers in Diamond</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anton Pershin, András Tárkányi, Vladimir Verkhovlyuk, Viktor Ivády, Adam Gali</p>
            <p>Recent advances in the engineering of diamond surfaces make it possible to stabilize the charge state of 7-30 nanometers deep nitrogen-vacancy (NV) quantum sensors in diamond and to remove the charge noise at the surface principally. However, it is still a challenge to simultaneously increase the action volume of the quantum sensor by placing NV centers 0.5-2 nanometers deep and to maintain their favorable spin coherence properties which are limited by the magnetic noise from the fluctuating nuclear spins of the surface termination of diamond. Here we show by means of first principles simulations that leveraging the interplay of the surface-induced strain and small constant magnetic fields, the spin coherence times of the ultra-shallow 1-nanometer deep NV center can be significantly enhanced near the spin-phonon limited regime at room temperature in $^{12}$C enriched diamonds. We demonstrate that our protocol is beneficial to $\sim$10-nanometers deep NV centers in natural diamond too where the variable coherence properties of the center to the direction of the small constant magnetic fields establish vector magnetometry at the nanoscale.</p>

            <h2>Soft symmetries of topological orders</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryohei Kobayashi, Maissam Barkeshli</p>
            <p>(2+1)D topological orders possess emergent symmetries given by a group $\text{Aut}(\mathcal{C})$, which consists of the braided tensor autoequivalences of the modular tensor category $\mathcal{C}$ that describes the anyons. In this paper we discuss cases where $\text{Aut}(\mathcal{C})$ has elements that neither permute anyons nor are associated to any symmetry fractionalization but are still non-trivial, which we refer to as soft symmetries. We point out that one can construct topological defects corresponding to such exotic symmetry actions by decorating with a certain class of gauged SPT states that cannot be distinguished by their torus partition function. This gives a physical interpretation to work by Davydov on soft braided tensor autoequivalences. This has a number of important implications for the classification of gapped boundaries, non-invertible spontaneous symmetry breaking, and the general classification of symmetry-enriched topological phases of matter. We also demonstrate analogous phenomena in higher dimensions, such as (3+1)D gauge theory with gauge group given by the quaternion group $Q_8$.</p>

            <h2>Quantum-Enhanced Conformal Methods for Multi-Output Uncertainty: A Holistic Exploration and Experimental Analysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emre Tasar</p>
            <p>In this paper, we propose a unified approach to harness quantum conformal methods for multi-output distributions, with a particular emphasis on two experimental paradigms: (i) a standard 2-qubit circuit scenario producing a four-dimensional outcome distribution, and (ii) a multi-basis measurement setting that concatenates measurement probabilities in different bases (Z, X, Y) into a twelve-dimensional output space. By combining a multioutput regression model (e.g., random forests) with distributional conformal prediction, we validate coverage and interval-set sizes on both simulated quantum data and multi-basis measurement data. Our results confirm that classical conformal prediction can effectively provide coverage guarantees even when the target probabilities derive from inherently quantum processes. Such synergy opens the door to next-generation quantum-classical hybrid frameworks, providing both improved interpretability and rigorous coverage for quantum machine learning tasks.

            <h2>Optimal control in phase space applied to minimal-time transfer of thermal atoms in optical traps</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Omar Morandi, Sara Nicoletti, Vladislav Gavryusev, Leonardo Fallani</p>
            <p>We present an optimal control procedure for the non-adiabatic transport of ultracold neutral thermal atoms in optical tweezers arranged in a one-dimensional array, with focus on reaching minimal transfer time. The particle dynamics are modeled first using a classical approach through the Liouville equation and second through the quantum Wigner equation to include quantum effects. Both methods account for typical experimental noise described as stochastic effects through Fokker-Planck terms. The optimal control process is initialized with a trajectory computed for a single classical particle and determines the phase-space path that minimizes transport time and ensures high transport fidelity to the target trap. This approach provides the fastest and most efficient method for relocating atoms from an initial configuration to a desired target arrangement, minimizing time and energy costs while ensuring high fidelity. Such an approach may be highly valuable to initialize large atom arrays for quantum simulation or computation experiments.</p>

            <h2>Perfect, Pretty Good and Optimized Quantum State Transfer in Transmon qubit chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pablo Serra, Alejandro Ferrón, Omar Osenda</p>
            <p>Chains of transmon qubits are considered promising systems to implement different quantum information tasks. In particular as channels that perform high-quality quantum state transfer. We study how changing the interaction strength between the chain qubits allows us to obtain perfect or pretty good state transfer and present explicit analytic expressions for their transmission fidelity. For particular values of the interactions between the qubits, transmon chains are equivalent to generalized SSH chains and show the traditional traits observed in chains with topological states, localized states at the extremes of the chain, and eigenvalues that lie inside the spectral gap. Consequently, we study the quantum state transfer on chains with dimerized interactions, looking for chains with fast transfer times. We show that, in many cases, asking for fast transfer times results in chains with dimerized interactions that do not have topological states.</p>

            <p>Quantum networking and computing technologies demand scalable hardware with high-speed control for large systems of quantum devices. Solid-state platforms have emerged as promising candidates, offering scalable fabrication for a wide range of qubits. Architectures based on spin-photon interfaces allow for highly-connected quantum networks over photonic links, enabling entanglement distribution for quantum networking and distributed quantum computing protocols. With the potential to address these demands, optically-active spin defects in silicon are one proposed platform for building quantum technologies. Here, we electrically excite the silicon T centre in integrated optoelectronic devices that combine nanophotonic waveguides and cavities with p-i-n diodes. We observe single-photon electroluminescence from a cavity-coupled T centre with $g^{(2)}(0)=0.05(2)$. Further, we use the electrically-triggered emission to herald the electron spin state, initializing it with $92(8)\%$ fidelity. This shows, for the first time, electrically-injected single-photon emission from a silicon colour centre and a new method of electrically-triggered spin initialization. These findings present a new telecommunications band light source for silicon and a highly parallel control method for T centre quantum processors, advancing the T centre as a versatile defect for scalable quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>In conventional architectures of superconducting quantum computers, each qubit is connected to its own control line, leading to a commensurate increase in the number of microwave lines as the system scales. Frequency-multiplexed qubit-control addresses this problem by enabling multiple qubits to share a single microwave line. However, it can cause unwanted excitation of non-target qubits, especially when the detuning between qubits is smaller than the pulse bandwidth. Here, we propose a selective-excitation-pulse (SEP) technique that suppresses unwanted excitations by shaping a drive pulse to create null points at non-target qubit frequencies. In a proof-of-concept experiment with three fixed-frequency transmon qubits, we demonstrate that the SEP technique achieves single-qubit gate fidelities comparable to those obtained with conventional Gaussian pulses while effectively suppressing unwanted excitations in non-target qubits. These results highlight the SEP technique as a promising tool for enhancing frequency-multiplexed qubit-control.</p>

            <h2>Quantifying Quantum Steering with Limited Resources: A Semi-supervised Machine Learning Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yansa Lu, Zhihua Chen, Zhihao Ma, Shao-Ming Fei</p>
            <p>Quantum steering, an intermediate quantum correlation lying between entanglement and nonlocality, has emerged as a critical quantum resource for a variety of quantum information processing tasks such as quantum key distribution and true randomness generation. The ability to detect and quantify quantum steering is crucial for these applications. Semi-definite programming (SDP) has proven to be a valuable tool to quantify quantum steering. However, the challenge lies in the fact that the optimal measurement strategy is not priori known, making it time-consuming to compute the steerable measure for any given quantum state. Furthermore, the utilization of SDP requires full information of the quantum state, necessitating quantum state tomography, which can be complex and resource-consuming. In this work, we utilize the semi-supervised self-training model to estimate the steerable weight, a pivotal measure of quantum steering. The model can be trained using a limited amount of labeled data, thus reducing the time for labeling. The features are constructed by the probabilities derived by performing three sets of projective measurements under arbitrary local unitary transformations on the target states, circumventing the need for quantum tomography. The model demonstrates robust generalization capabilities and can achieve high levels of precision with limited resources.</p>

            <h2>Quantum error mitigation in optimized circuits for particle-density correlations in real-time dynamics of the Schwinger model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Domenico Pomarico, Mahul Pandey, Riccardo Cioli, Federico Dell'Anna, Saverio Pascazio, Francesco V. Pepe, Paolo Facchi, Elisa Ercolessi</p>
            <p>Quantum computing gives direct access to the study of real-time dynamics of quantum many-body systems. In principle, it is possible to directly calculate non-equal-time correlation functions, from which one can detect interesting phenomena, such as the presence of quantum scars or dynamical quantum phase transitions. In practice, these calculations are strongly affected by noise, due to the complexity of the required quantum circuits. As a testbed for the evaluation of real-time evolution of observables and correlations, the dynamics of the Zn Schwinger model in a one dimensional lattice is considered. To control the computational cost, we adopt a quantum-classical strategy that reduces the dimensionality of the system by restricting the dynamics to the Dirac vacuum sector and optimizes the embedding into a qubit model by minimizing the number of three-qubit gates. We derive a digital circuit implementation of the time-evolution of particle-density correlation operators and their correlation, comparing results from exact evolution, bare noisy simulations and simulations with different error mitigation techniques. For the evolution of the particle-density operators we also perform runs on a physical IBM quantum device.</p>

            <p>We design a phase-sensitive Rydberg-atom interferometry by implementing Floquet electromagnetically induced transparency (FEIT). The FEIT mixes the sidebands of a Rydberg state induced by a MHz radio frequency (RF) field and recombines them into FEIT bands. The FEIT bands act as screens to present the interference between paths with different phases, which are transitions between the sidebands and excited states. This interferometry can measure the phase of a MHz RF field without a local RF reference field. A phase reference is supplied to the atoms via a periodic electrical signal in the FEIT. We demonstrate that the MHz RF phase is measured over a full range of $2\pi$, and $10^{-4}$ rad accuracy is achieved. Moreover, the RF amplitude can also be measured with higher accuracy than the traditional EIT-based scheme.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qiying Pan, Fuhua Li, Hong-Mei Zou, Zijin Liang</p>
            <p>In this work, the quantum coherence of a V-type atom in a dissipative cavity under detuning and weak measurement reversal is studied using methods such as the Fano theorem, the Schrodinger equation and the l1 norm of coherence. The atomic density operator is derived, and the coherences of different initial states are investigated in detail under parameters including spontaneously generated interference (SGI), atom-reservoir coupling, weak measurement reversal and detuning between the atom and the cavity. The results indicate that, the strong coupling can induce coherence sudden death (CSD) and coherence sudden birth (CSB), and the non-zero SGI parameter only induces CSB but the detuning may avoid CSD and CSB. Moreover, both detuning and weak measurement reversal have positive effects on protecting and generating quantum coherence, but the weak measurement has a negative effect. The non-zero SGI parameter has positive effects on declining and generating of quantum coherence. In particular, the maximal coherent state can be very effectively protected and the coherent state can be prepared if all parameters are selected appropriately. Physical interpretations are also provided for these results.</p>

            <h2>Disentanglement--induced bistability in a magnetic resonator</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eyal Buks</p>
            <p>Multi--stability in the response of a ferrimagnetic spin resonator to an externally applied driving is experimentally studied. The observed multi--stability cannot be derived from any master equation that linearly depends on the spins' reduced density operator. Traditionally, the nonlinearity that is required in order to theoretically account for the observed multi--stability is introduced by implementing the method of Bosonization. Here, an alternative explanation, which is based on the hypothesis that disentanglement spontaneously occurs in quantum systems is explored. According to this hypothesis, time evolution is governed by a master equation having an added nonlinear term, which deterministically generates disentanglement. Experimental results are compared with predictions derived from both competing theoretical models. It is found that better agreement with data is obtained from the disentanglement--based model. This finding, together with a difficulty to justify the Bosonization--based model, indirectly support the spontaneous disentanglement hypothesis.</p>

            <p>The optomagnomechanical system, which involves flexible nonlinearities, is one of the promising physical platforms for studying the preparation and manipulation of quantum entanglements, as well as the construction of hybrid quantum networks. A scheme for entanglement enhancement and quadripartite entanglement generation is proposed, based on a cascaded optomagnomechanical system. On the one hand, optomicrowave and optomagnonic entanglements within the two subsystems are investigated, and their parameter dependence, such as detuning, decay, coupling strength, and transmission efficiency, is discussed. On the other hand, the parameter conditions for achieving optimal optomicrowave and optomagnonic quadripartite entanglements are also obtained. The results show that significant enhancement of optomicrowave and optomagnonic entanglements in the second cavity can be obtained in a certain range of parameters. Under optimized parameter conditions, optomicrowave and optomagnonic quadripartite entanglements can be generated throughout the entire cascaded system. This research provides a theoretical basis for the manipulation of quantum entanglement, the transmission of the magnon's state, and the construction of hybrid quantum networks involving different physical systems.</p>

            <p>We investigate the application of the quantum Zeno effect (QZE) for the preparation of non-Gaussian states in optomechanical systems. By frequently monitoring the system, the QZE can suppress transitions away from desired subspaces of states. We show that this enables the preparation of states in qubit subspaces even in the presence of noise and decoherence. Through analytical and numerical analysis, we demonstrate that QZE-based protocols can significantly improve the robustness of state preparation of qubit states in continuous variable architectures. Our results extend the utility of the QZE beyond discrete systems, highlighting its potential for enhancing quantum control in more complex quantum information processing environments. These findings offer a promising approach for achieving reliable non-Gaussian states in optomechanical systems, with implications for the development of photonic quantum computing and quantum sensing.</p>

            <p>Classical polarizable approaches have become the gold standard for simulating complex systems and processes in the condensed phase. These methods describe intrinsically dissipative polarizable media, requiring a formal definition within the framework of open quantum systems. We present a Hamiltonian formulation for the quantum dynamics of polarizable sources based on a generalized theory of the damped harmonic oscillator, using pseudo-boson theory to characterize their coherent state dynamics. Exploiting the phase space formulation of quantum mechanics and the integrability of quadratic Hamiltonians, we derive a self-consistent relation for the emitted electric field of the polarizable medium under the semiclassical approximation, based on exact formulas for medium polarization. Finally, we derive the master equation describing the open dynamics of a quantum system interacting with the quantum polarizable medium, along with analytical expressions for correlation functions calculated over arbitrary Gaussian states.</p>

In the same way that classical computers only realised their full potential with the emergence of the internet, a fully realised quantum internet is the net stage of evolution for quantum computation.

            <p>The transport of quantum states is a crucial aspect of information processing systems, facilitating operations such as quantum key distribution and inter-component communication within quantum computers. Most quantum networks rely on symmetries to achieve an efficient state transfer. A straightforward way to design such networks is to use spatial symmetries, which severely limits the design space. Our work takes a novel approach to designing photonic networks that do not exhibit any conventional spatial symmetries, yet nevertheless support an efficient transfer of quantum states. Paradoxically, while a perfect transfer efficiency is technically unattainable in these networks, a fidelity arbitrarily close to unity is always reached within a finite time of evolution. Key to this approach are so-called latent, or 'hidden', symmetries, which are embodied in the spectral properties of the network. Latent symmetries substantially expand the design space of quantum networks and hold significant potential for applications in quantum cryptography and secure state transfer. We experimentally realize such a nine-site latent-symmetric network and successfully observe state transfer between two sites with a measured fidelity of 75%. Furthermore, by launching a two-photon state, we show that quantum interference is preserved by the network. This demonstrates that the latent symmetries enable efficient quantum state transfer, while offering greater flexibility in designing quantum networks.</p>

            <p>Decoherence is a manifestation of the coupling of a system with its environment. The resulting loss of information can hamper the functioning of quantum devices, hence the need of understanding its origin and dynamics. Decoherence can stem from entanglement, but it can also be classical in nature. Indeed, methods have been developed to understand whether qubit-environment entanglement (QEE) is actually present in some important classes of quantum channels - pure dephasing. Their practicality resides in the fact they only require accessing the system qubit. In this article we show an implementation of this technique in a photonic quantum channel simulator via a scheme that has been tailored to the system under study. By controlling the input state of the environment in our simulation, we can check the occurrence of qubit environment entanglement in simple, yet insightful test cases. Our results showcase the usefulness and experimental relevance of the QEE witnessing technique.</p>

            <h2>Practical scheme for efficient distillation of GHZ states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Áron Rozgonyi, Gábor Széchenyi, Orsolya Kálmán, Tamás Kiss</p>
            <p>We develop an efficient local operation and classical communication (LOCC) scheme for the distillation of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states from tripartite systems subjected to both coherent and incoherent errors. The proposed method employs an iterative process that applies a postselection-based non-linear transformation to increase the entanglement of 3-qubit states. In contrast to traditional distillation protocols that require an exponential number of initial states as a resource, our method achieves subexponential convergence towards a pure GHZ state. The proposed scheme is practical in the sense that it employs a small set of relatively simple unitary operations and projective measurements in the computational basis. We systematically develop a double-iteration protocol by providing a mathematical framework for the transformation processes involved, emphasizing the role of unitary operations in correcting arbitrary small errors in the initial states. Through analytical derivations and numerical simulations, we demonstrate the protocol's ability to progressively eliminate noise and improve fidelity over subsequent iterations. Significantly, our protocol not only corrects for small arbitrary distortions in the GHZ states but also maintains operational simplicity, making it feasible for practical quantum computing applications.</p>

            <p>Random exchanges of energy arise naturally in stochastic systems. As a consequence, apparent violations of the second law of thermodynamics can occur, as it holds true on average. Here we investigate the occurrence of these apparent violations -- termed free lunches -- in a quantum-classical system comprised of levitated nanoparticles exchanging energy via the Coulomb interaction. We consider different initial states for the quantum system, and how these exert work and fluctuations upon the classical particle affecting the probability of free lunches. With that, we initiate the study of hybrid quantum-classical systems through the lens of stochastic thermodynamics.</p>

            <h2>Decoherence of Schr\"odinger cat states in light of wave/particle duality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Th. K. Mavrogordatos</p>
            <p>We challenge the standard picture of decohering Schrödinger cat states as an ensemble average obeying a Lindblad master equation, brought about locally from an irreversible interaction with an environment. We generate self-consistent collections of pure system states correlated with specific environmental records, corresponding to the function of the wave-particle correlator first introduced in Carmichael {\it et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. 85, 1855 (2000)]. In the spirit of Carmichael {\it et al.} [Coherent States: Past, Present and Future, pp. 75--91, World Scientific (1994)], we find that the complementary unravelings evince a pronounced disparity when the ``position'' and ``momentum'' of the damped cavity mode -- an explicitly open quantum system -- are measured. Intensity-field correlations may largely deviate from a monotonic decay, while Wigner functions of the cavity state display contrasting manifestations of quantum interference when conditioned on photon counts sampling a continuous photocurrent. In turn, the conditional photodetection events mark the contextual diffusion of both the net charge generated at the homodyne detector, and the electromagnetic field amplitude in the resonator.</p>

            <h2>Measured Hockey-Stick Divergence and its Applications to Quantum Pufferfish Privacy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Theshani Nuradha, Vishal Singh, Mark M. Wilde</p>
            <p>The hockey-stick divergence is a fundamental quantity characterizing several statistical privacy frameworks that ensure privacy for classical and quantum data. In such quantum privacy frameworks, the adversary is allowed to perform all possible measurements. However, in practice, there are typically limitations to the set of measurements that can be performed. To this end, here, we comprehensively analyze the measured hockey-stick divergence under several classes of practically relevant measurement classes. We prove several of its properties, including data processing and convexity. We show that it is efficiently computable by semi-definite programming for some classes of measurements and can be analytically evaluated for Werner and isotropic states. Notably, we show that the measured hockey-stick divergence characterizes optimal privacy parameters in the quantum pufferfish privacy framework. With this connection and the developed technical tools, we enable methods to quantify and audit privacy for several practically relevant settings. Lastly, we introduce the measured hockey-stick divergence of channels and explore its applications in ensuring privacy for channels.</p>

            <p>We discuss the low-energy properties of binary superfluids with density-dependent interactions. Adding an intra-species coupling that induces an explicit soft symmetry-breaking, we determine the background pressure and we show that the low-energy spectrum consists of a massless Nambu- Goldstone boson and a massive (pseudo) Nambu-Goldstone boson. When the background velocities of the two superfluids are transonic, the system is characterized by two distinct acoustic horizons: the hydrodynamic analogue of the black hole event horizon. The Hawking-like emission occurring at these horizons produces an effective friction on the fluids. We compute the viscosity-to-entropy ratios close to the two acoustic horizons, finding that the emission of pseudo Nambu-Goldstone bosons violates the bound conjectured by Kovtun, Son and Starinet.</p>

            <p>Principal component analysis is commonly used for dimensionality reduction, feature extraction, denoising, and visualization. The most commonly used principal component analysis method is based upon optimization of the L2-norm, however, the L2-norm is known to exaggerate the contribution of errors and outliers. When optimizing over the L1-norm, the components generated are known to exhibit robustness or resistance to outliers in the data. The L1-norm components can be solved for with a binary optimization problem. Previously, L1-BF has been used to solve the binary optimization for multiple components simultaneously. In this paper we propose QAPCA, a new method for finding principal components using quantum annealing hardware which will optimize over the robust L1-norm. The conditions required for convergence of the annealing problem are discussed. The potential speedup when using quantum annealing is demonstrated through complexity analysis and experimental results. To showcase performance against classical principal component analysis techniques experiments upon synthetic Gaussian data, a fault detection scenario and breast cancer diagnostic data are studied. We find that the reconstruction error when using QAPCA is comparable to that when using L1-BF.</p>

            <p>Dirac-like band crossings are paradigms in condensed matter systems to emulate high-energy physics phenomena. They are associated with two aspects: gap and tilting. The ability to design sign-changing gap gives rise to band topology, whereas the tilting of band crossings which is a gateway for large gravity-like effects remains uncharted. In this work, we introduce an experimental platform to realize tilted Dirac-like microwave cone in large-scale superconducting circuit lattices. The direction and magnitude of the tilt can be controlled by engineering the axially preferred second neighbor coupling. We demonstrate three lattices with 731-site LC resonator featuring tilt values of up to 59% of relative difference in the opposite-direction group velocities. This is obtained by reconstructing the density of states (DOS) of measured microwave resonance frequencies. Harnessing the tilt of Dirac-like band crossings lays the foundation for weaving the fabric of an emergent solid-state spacetime.</p>

            <h2>Poincare invariant interaction between two Dirac particles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Juan Barandiaran, Martin Rivas</p>
            <p>The spinning electron-electron interaction is described in classical terms by means of two possible classical interactions: The instantaneous Coulomb interaction between the charge centers of both particles and the Poincaré invariant interaction developed in a previous work. The numerical integrations are performed with several Mathematica notebooks that are available for the interested readers in the reference Section. One difference of these interactions is that the Poincaré invariant interaction does not satisfy the action-reaction principle in the synchronous description and, therefore, there is no conservation of the mechanical linear momentum. It is the total linear momentum of the system what is conserved. In this synchronous description the interaction is not mediated by the retarded fields but is described in terms of the instantaneous positions, velocities and accelerations of the center of charge of both particles. In the Poincaré invariant description the net binding force that holds linked two Dirac particles is stronger than in the Coulomb case, thus forming a stable spin 1 system of 2 Dirac particles. This bosonic state of spin 1 does not correspond to a Cooper pair because the separation between the centers of mass of the Dirac particles is below Compton's wavelength, smaller than the correlation distance of the Cooper pair. Since the Poincaré invariant interaction is relativistically invariant it can be used for analyzing high energy scattering processes.</p>

Most principles in the DF are well aligned to the ideal, except for the misalignment in 'intellectual property' (IP) and 'dual use', revealing the precarious balance of well intended policy suggestions and effective outcomes. Additionally, there is an overemphasis placed on the principal of societal relevance in the DF, risking overseeing other principles in the future steering of the ELSPI. The present situation is in moderate alignment with the principles, however trending to misalignment on IP and international collaboration due to QI commercialization and the push for geopolitical sovereignty. For continued success of a responsible quantum internet, we recommend further investigation on the prevention of dual use quantum internet applications, closer involvement of commercial entities in ELSPI ideation, continued recognition of base-layer technology research and stakeholder education on QI applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Keiran Lewellen, Rohit Mukherjee, Haoyu Guo, Saswata Roy, Valla Fatemi, Debanjan Chowdhury</p>
            <p>Floquet engineering is a powerful method that can be used to modify the properties of interacting many-body Hamiltonians via the application of periodic time-dependent drives. Here we consider the physics of an inductively shunted superconducting Josephson junction in the presence of Floquet drives in the fluxonium regime and beyond, which we dub the frozonium artificial atom. We find that in the vicinity of special ratios of the drive amplitude and frequency, the many-body dynamics can be tuned to that of an effectively linear bosonic oscillator, with additional nonlinear corrections that are suppressed in higher powers of the drive frequency. By analyzing the inverse participation ratios between the time-evolved frozonium wavefunctions and the eigenbasis of a linear oscillator, we demonstrate the ability to achieve a novel dynamical control using a combination of numerical exact diagonalization and Floquet-Magnus expansion. We discuss the physics of resonances between quasi-energy states induced by the drive, and ways to mitigate their effects. We also highlight the enhanced protection of frozonium against external sources of noise present in experimental setups. This work lays the foundation for future applications in quantum memory and bosonic quantum control using superconducting circuits.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shih-Yu Chang</p>
            <p>Matrix inequalities play a pivotal role in mathematics, generalizing scalar inequalities and providing insights into linear operator structures. However, the widely used Löwner ordering, which relies on real-valued eigenvalues, is limited to Hermitian matrices, restricting its applicability to non-Hermitian systems increasingly relevant in fields like non-Hermitian physics. To overcome this, we develop a total ordering relation for complex numbers, enabling comparisons of the spectral components of general matrices with complex eigenvalues. Building on this, we introduce the Spectral and Nilpotent Ordering (SNO), a partial order for arbitrary matrices of the same dimensions. We further establish a theoretical framework for majorization ordering with complex-valued functions, which aids in refining SNO and analyzing spectral components. An additional result is the extension of the Schur--Ostrowski criterion to the complex domain. Moreover, we characterize Jordan blocks of matrix functions using a generalized dominance order for nilpotent components, facilitating systematic analysis of non-diagonalizable matrices. Finally, we derive monotonicity and convexity conditions for functions under the SNO framework, laying a new mathematical foundation for advancing matrix analysis.</p>

By studying their trajectories in the holographic bulk, we ultimately find that these threads should correspond precisely to perfect geodesics in the bulk, making kinematic space a tailor-made language for describing the thread game. Furthermore, it turns out that the thread game has a quantum circuit interpretation, where each thread plays the role of a wire. Therefore, kinematic space can be regarded as the ``input board" of the holographic quantum circuit characterizing the entanglement structure of the spacetime. Based on this understanding, we also present a nice explanation of holographic complexity in the language of kinematic space.</p>

            <p>Preparing fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states represents a key challenge for quantum simulators. While small Laughlin-type states have been realized by manipulating two atoms or two photons, scaling up these settings to larger ensembles stands as an impractical task using existing methods and protocols. In this work, we propose to use optimal-control methods to substantially accelerate the preparation of small Laughlin-type states, and demonstrate that the resulting protocols are also well suited to realize larger FQH states under realistic preparation times. Our schemes are specifically built on the recent optical-lattice experiment [Leonard et al., Nature (2023)], and consist in optimizing very few control parameters: the tunneling amplitudes and linear gradients along the two directions of the lattice. We demonstrate the robustness of our optimal-control schemes against control errors and disorder, and discuss their advantages over existing preparation methods. Our work paves the way to the efficient realization of strongly-correlated topological states in quantum-engineered systems.</p>

Prior to InAs molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) deposition, an ordered square array of nanoholes is formed at the GaAs pre-patterned surface following in situ etching with atomic hydrogen. A low substrate temperature is maintained during the whole process in order to avoid pattern smoothing. Our results show that the density and dimensions of the nanoholes on the GaAs surface determine InAs QD size, nucleation site and InAs dose necessary for their formation. As a function of the geometrical parameters of the nanohole array, we can obtain either ordered 2D arrays of separated QD, closely packed QD or localized areas for QD formation.</p>

            <p>In this work, we study the correlation between entanglement and the negative sign problem in quantum Monte Carlo for the simulation of low-dimensional strongly correlated quantum many body systems. Entanglement entropy characterizes the difficulty of many-body simulation with tensor network state related methods, while the average sign measures the difficulty in many-body simulation for a variety of quantum Monte Carlo methods. Although there exist cases where one type of method works better than the other, it is desirable to find the possible correlation between entanglement and average sign for general hard strongly correlated systems regarding computational complexity. We take the doped two-dimensional Hubbard model as an example and numerically calculate the doping evolution of both the entanglement in the ground state with Density Matrix Renormalization Group and the average sign in the Auxiliary Field Quantum Monte Carlo simulation at low temperature. The results show that they are indeed correlated. The entanglement entropy (average sign) shows a peak (dip) around 20% doping, indicating that it is the difficult region for both methods. The vicinity of 20% doping is also the most intriguing region in both the Hubbard model and cuprate high-Tc superconductors where competing states with close energy intertwine with each other. Recognizing the correlation between entanglement and average sign provides new insight into our understanding of the difficulty in the simulation of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <p>This thesis develops advanced Tensor Network (TN) methods to address Hamiltonian Lattice Gauge Theories (LGTs), overcoming limitations in real-time dynamics and finite-density regimes. A novel dressed-site formalism is introduced, enabling efficient truncation of gauge fields while preserving gauge invariance for both Abelian and non-Abelian theories. This formalism is successfully applied to SU(2) Yang-Mills LGTs in two dimensions, providing the first TN simulations of this system and revealing critical aspects of its phase diagram and non-equilibrium behavior, such as a Quantum Many-Body (QMB) scarring dynamics. A generalization of the dressed-site formalism is proposed through a new fermion-to-qubit mapping for general lattice fermion theories, revealing powerful for classical and quantum simulations. Numerical innovations, including the use of optimal space-filling curves such as the Hilbert curve to preserve locality in high-dimensional simulations, further enhance the efficiency of these methods. Together with high-performance computing techniques, these advances open current and future development pathways toward optimized, efficient, and faster simulations on scales comparable to Monte Carlo state-of-the-art.</p>

            <p>Interacting fermionic chains exhibit extended regions of topological degeneracy of their ground states as a result of the presence of Majorana or parafermionic zero modes localized at the edges. In the opposite limit of infinite temperature, the corresponding non-integrable spin chains, obtained via generalized Jordan-Wigner mapping, are known to host so-called Almost Strong Zero Modes, which are long-lived with respect to any bulk excitations. Here, we study the fairly unexplored territory that bridges these two extreme cases of zero and infinite temperature. We blend two established techniques for states, the Lanczos series expansion and a tensor network ansatz, uplifting them to the level of operator algebra. This allows us to efficiently simulate large system sizes for arbitrarily long timescales and to extract the temperature-dependent decay rates. We observe that for the Kitaev-Hubbard model, the decay rate of the edge mode depends exponentially on the inverse temperature $\beta$, and on an effective energy scale $\Delta_{\rm eff}$ that is greater than the thermodynamic gap of the system $\Delta$.</p>

            <p>Previous attoclock experiments measuring the photoelectron momentum distribution (PMD) via strong-field ionization in an elliptically polarized laser field have shown anomalously large offset angles in the nonadiabatic regime with large Keldysh parameters ($\gamma$). We investigate the process theoretically in the complete range of ellipticity ($\epsilon$) and large range of $\gamma$, employing numerical solutions of time-dependent Schrödinger equation and nonadiabatic classical-trajectory Monte Carlo simulations matched with the under-the-barrier motion via the nonadiabatic strong field approximation. We show the formation of low-energy structures (LES) at any ellipticity value when the Keldysh parameter is sufficiently large. Three regimes of the interaction in the ($\epsilon$-$\gamma$)-space of parameters are identified via the characteristic PMD features. The significant modification of the recollision picture in the nonadiabatic regime, with so-called anomalous and hybrid slow recollisions, is shown to be behind the LES, inducing extreme nonlinear Coulomb bunching in the phase-space in the polarization plane. Our findings elucidate subtle features of the attosecond electron dynamics in strong-field ionization at extreme conditions and indicate limitations on attosecond imaging.</p>

Our approach is based on an analytic continuation of the wavenumber, which yields a mapping from the bulk modes to the edge modes. Phase relations of the eigenfunctions are described by their mapping onto a three-dimensional field of unit vectors. This mapping is studied in detail for a two-band Laplacian model and a Dirac model. The direction of the unit vector identifies the phase relation of the eigenfunctions and enables us to distinguish between the upper band, the lower band and the edge spectrum. Bulk and edge modes are spectrally separated, which results in two transitions from delocalized bulk modes to localized edge modes. These transitions are accompanied by transitions of the phase relations.</p>

            <p>Quasi-one-dimensional (1D) materials can manifest exotic electronic properties in manners that are distinct from the bulk phase or other low-dimensional systems. Helical symmetries in such materials -- e.g., nanotubes with intrinsic or applied twist -- can simultaneously lead to strong electronic correlation and anomalous transport behavior. However, these materials remain underexplored, in part due to computational challenges. Using specialized symmetry-adapted first-principles calculations, we show that mono-layer $P_2C_3$ -- identified in a previous letter to possess ``double Kagome bands'' -- exhibits a number of striking properties when rolled up into phosphorous carbide nanotubes ($P_2C_3$NTs). Both armchair and zigzag $P_2C_3$NTs are stable at room temperature and display a degenerate combination of Dirac points and electronic flat bands at the Fermi level. Notably, these flat bands are highly resilient to elastic deformations. Large strains can transform the nanotube structure from honeycomb-kagome to ``brick-wall'', and trigger multiple quantum phase transitions. Edge states in $P_2C_3$NTs, spin-degeneracy lifting induced by vacancies and dopants, and strain-tunable magnetism are also discussed.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hyun-Myung Chun, Jong-Min Park</p>
            <p>Thermodynamic constraints impose a trade-off between power and efficiency in heat engines, preventing the simultaneous achievement of high power and high efficiency. For classical microscopic engines, explicit inequalities have been discovered, demonstrating the inherent inevitability of this power-efficiency trade-off. However, extensions of these results to quantum engines have so far been limited to cases of slow operation. In this study, we derive a power-efficiency trade-off relation for a paradigmatic quantum engine operating within a finite time, specifically the Otto cycle of a quantum harmonic oscillator. By utilizing a phase-space approach based on quasi-probability representations, we establish a universal trade-off relation applicable to arbitrary time-dependent protocols during the adiabatic processes. Our results reveal that the power of the quantum engine vanishes as the efficiency approaches the quantum mechanical efficiency bound, which is stricter than the Carnot bound. Furthermore, we identify the conditions under which the upper bound is attained, which indicate maximum power is achieved when the generation of quantum coherence is reduced, and the difference in time durations of the isochoric processes increases. These findings are validated through numerical calculations, which confirm their applicability across various types of protocols for heat engine cycles.</p>

We propose and realize a detection scheme, which avoids some of those problems by using multi-tone mixing, where direct usage of the local oscillator at the same frequency is not required. Our scheme is further elaborated on using efficient theoretical methods to predict the performance of the sensor.

            <p>By employing the replica trick we study the impact of the replica parameter $n$ on the modular entropy and the capacity of entanglement in the End of the World (EoW) model and the island model, respectively. For the EoW model, we present $n$-dependent evolution curves of the modular entropy and the capacity of entanglement under both microcanonical and canonical ensembles. In particular, in the canonical ensemble, all quantities decrease as $n$ increases at late times. For the island model, we develop the replica geometry for finite $n$ and re-evaluate the modular entropy and the capacity of entanglement in a two-sided eternal Jackiw-Teitelboim black hole coupled with a thermal bath. In the case of a single island configuration, the modular entropy and capacity of entanglement closely resemble the thermal entropy and the heat capacity, respectively, yielding results analogous to those obtained in the canonical ensemble for the EoW model. The analysis of the results from these two models strongly indicates that in geometries with a greater number of $n$ copies, more connected geometries effectively purify thermal Hawking radiation. In addition, we compare these findings with statistical mechanics and provide an interpretation for the replica parameter $n$. Finally, we generalize the island formula to accommodate the finite $n$ case under this interpretation.</p>

            <p>Providing high-quality, single-crystal diamond (SCD) with a large area is desirable for up-scaling quantum technology applications that rely on color centers in diamond. Growth methods aiming to increase the area of SCD are an active research area. Native color centers offer a sensitive probe for local crystal quality in such novel materials e.g., via their reaction to stress. In this work, we investigate individual native nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in SCD layers manufactured via laterally overgrowing hole arrays in a heteroepitaxially grown large-scale substrate. Heteroepitaxy has become a common tool for growing large SCDs; however, achieving the high crystal quality needed for quantum applications remains a challenge. In the overgrown layer, we identify NV centers with spin-decoherence times in the order of hundreds of microseconds, comparable to high-purity homoepitaxial SCD. We quantify the effective crystal strain in different regions of the overgrown layer, indicating a low stress overall and a stress reduction in the diamond layer above the holes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wim Beenakker, David Venhoek</p>
            <p>We present a method for relating the transition rate of an accelerated Unruh-deWitt detector to the rate of the same detector when stationary in Minkowski space. Furthermore, we show that when using the detector as a model for decay, its transition rate can be related directly to the decay rate obtained from QFT. Combined this provides a straightforward method for calculating the decay rate of accelerated particles to first order in the coupling constants.</p>

            <h2>Density matrices and entropy operator for non-Hermitian quantum mechanics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fabio Bagarello, Francesco Gargano, Lidia Saluto</p>
            <p>In this paper we consider density matrices operator related to non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. In particular, we analyse two natural extensions of what is usually called a density matrix operator (DM), of pure states and of the entropy operator: we first consider those {\em operators} which are simply similar to a standard DM, and then we discuss those which are intertwined with a DM by a third, non invertible, operator, giving rise to waht we call Riesz Density Matrix operator (RDM). After introducing the mathematical framework, we apply the framework to a couple of applications. The first application is related to a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian describing gain and loss phenomena, widely considered in the context of $PT$-quantum mechanics. The second application is related to a finite-dimensional version of the Swanson Hamiltonian, never considered before, and addresses the problem of deriving a milder version of the RDM when exceptional points form in the system.</p>

            <h2>Andreev spin relaxation time in a shadow-evaporated InAs weak link</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haoran Lu, David F. Bofill, Zhenhai Sun, Thomas Kanne, Jesper Nygård, Morten Kjaergaard, Valla Fatemi</p>
            <p>Andreev spin qubits are a new qubit platform that merges superconductivity with semiconductor physics. The mechanisms dominating observed energy relaxation remain unidentified. We report here on three steps taken to address these questions in an InAs nanowire weak link. First, we designed a microwave readout circuit tuned to be directly sensitive to the spin-dependent inductance of the weak link so that higher orbital states are not necessary for readout -- this resulted in larger windows in parameter space in which the spin state properties can be probed. Second, we implemented a successful gap-engineering strategy to mitigate quasiparticle poisoning. Third, the weak link was fabricated by \textit{in situ} shadow evaporation, which has been shown to improve atomic-scale disorder. We show how our design allows characterization of the spin stability and coherence over the full range of magnetic flux and gate voltage of an odd parity bias point. The spin relaxation and dephasing rates are comparable with the best devices previously reported, suggestive that surface atomic-scale disorder and QP poisoning are not linked to spin relaxation in InAs nanowires. Our design strategies are transferrable to novel materials platforms for Andreev qubits such as germanium and carbon.</p>

            <h2>Exact path integrals on half-line in quantum cosmology with a fluid clock and aspects of operator ordering ambiguity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vikramaditya Mondal, Harkirat Singh Sahota, Kinjalk Lochan</p>
            <p>We perform $\textit{exact}$ half-line path integral quantization of flat, homogeneous cosmological models containing a perfect fluid acting as an internal clock, in a $D+1$ dimensional minisuperspace setup. We also discuss certain classes of operator ordering ambiguity inherent in such quantization procedures and argue that a particular ordering prescription in the quantum theory can preserve two symmetries, namely arbitrary lapse rescalings and general covariance, which are already present at the classical level. As a result of this imposition, a large class of quantum Hamiltonians differing by operator ordering produces the same inner products between quantum states. This imposition of the two symmetries of the classical minisuperspace models leads to a unique prescription for writing the quantum Hamiltonian for minisuperspace dimension $D\geq 2$. Interestingly, in the case of $D=1$, the lapse rescaling symmetry is lost in the quantum theory, leading to an essentially ambiguous description of the canonical theory. We provide general proof of this in the context of both canonical quantization and path integrals. We supply concrete examples to validate our findings further.</p>

            <h2>Strain induced topological phase transitions in split and line graphs of bipartite lattices featuring flat bands</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shivam Sharma, Amartya S. Banerjee</p>
            <p>In recent years, materials with topological flat bands have attracted significant attention due to their association with extraordinary transport properties and strongly correlated electrons. This includes phenomena such as high-temperature superconductivity, magnetism, Wigner crystallization, and Mott-insulating behavior. Among these systems, two-dimensional (2D) materials are particularly compelling as they can host electronic states with unique band structures, such as dispersionless states alongside linearly dispersive Dirac cones. In this work, we use tight-binding models to comprehensively investigate a class of 2D lattices that generically support flat bands, and focus on the effects of strain on their electronic and topological properties. The studied lattices are constructed within a unifying graph-theoretic framework, whereupon split-graph and line-graph operations on bipartite square and hexagonal lattices are employed to generate new structures. In the absence of strain, the introduction of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) induces a bulk excitation gap, which transforms flat bands into quasi-flat bands with topologically nontrivial characteristics. By tuning system parameters and external strain, we observe the emergence of directional flat bands, and tilted and semi-Dirac cones. Remarkably, all lattices studied show phase transitions among trivial insulating, semimetallic, and topological phases. Our results highlight the potential of strain engineering as a versatile tool for manipulating electronic and topological phases in a wide variety of 2D materials.</p>

            <p>We report room-temperature observations of $\mathrm{Cu_{Zn}}$-$\mathrm{V_{S}}$ quantum emitters in individual ZnS:Cu nanocrystals (NCs). Using time-gated imaging, we isolate the distinct, $\sim$3-$\mu$s-long, red photoluminescence (PL) emission of $\mathrm{Cu_{Zn}}$-$\mathrm{V_{S}}$ defects, enabling their precise identification and statistical characterization. The emitters exhibit distinct blinking and photon antibunching, consistent with individual NCs containing two to four $\mathrm{Cu_{Zn}}$-$\mathrm{V_{S}}$ defects. The quantum emitters' PL spectra show a pronounced blue shift compared to NC dispersions, likely due to photochemical and charging effects. Emission polarization measurements of quantum emitters are consistent with a $\sigma$-character optical dipole transition and the symmetry of the $\mathrm{Cu_{Zn}}$-$\mathrm{V_{S}}$ defect. These observations motivate further investigation of $\mathrm{Cu_{Zn}}$-$\mathrm{V_{S}}$ defects in ZnS NCs for use in quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>Biphotons and single photons with narrow bandwidths and long coherence times are essential to the realization of long-distance quantum communication (LDQC) and linear optical quantum computing (LOQC). In this Letter, we manipulate the biphoton wave functions of the spontaneous four-wave mixing in a two-level atomic ensemble with a single-laser pump scheme. Our innovative experimental approach enables the generation of biphotons with a sub-MHz bandwidth of 0.36 MHz, a record spectral brightness of $2.28\times10^7$${\rm s}^{-1}{\rm mW}^{-1}{\rm MHz}^{-1}$, and a temporally symmetric wave packet at moderate optical depth. The strong non-classical cross-correlation of the biphotons also enables the observation of heralded sub-MHz-linewidth single photons with a pronounced single-photon nature. The generation of sub-MHz-linewidth biphotons and single photons with a two-level atomic ensembles not only finds applications in quantum repeaters and large cluster states for LDQC and LOQC but also opens up the opportunity to miniaturize the biphoton or single-photon sources for chip-scale quantum technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aman Ullah, Ziqi Hu, Alejandro Gaita-Ariño</p>
            <p>In a three-spin-center system, antiferromagnetic exchange interactions give rise to two ground-state doublets, each state within the doublet exhibiting distinct spin-spectrum chirality. This chirality becomes significant when external perturbations are introduced. We explored, from a theoretical perspective, the presence of spin-chirality in Lanthanide complexes that feature two magnetic centers. The applied electric-potential, couples to the system electric dipole moment ($\mu$), modifying the spin-orbit interaction ($\hat{L}.\hat{S}$). This modification is formally expressed through the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), whose role is to selectively activate one spin state in the doublet pair, as confirmed by computing the scalar spin-chirality ($\chi$). To validate the presence of chiral spin states, we performed spin-dynamics simulations using the Liouville-von Neumann equation within the density matrix formalism. The initial state was prepared as a superposition $1/\sqrt{2}(\rho_{01}+\rho_{10})$, and its time evolution revealed that each state in the doublet acquires a distinct phase, indicating their residence in separate phase spaces. This also demonstrated that the fidelity of the initial prepared state remains stable over an extended period.</p>

            <p>We consider time dynamics of entanglement entropy between a filled fermionic system and an empty reservoir. We consider scenarios (i) where the system is subjected to a dephasing mechanism and the reservoir is clean, thereby emulating expansion of effectively interacting fermions in vacuum, and (ii) where both the system and the reservoir are subjected to dephasing and thereby enabling us to address how the entanglement between the part of the effectively interacting system and its complement evolves in time. We consider two different kinds of quantum trajectory approaches, namely stochastic unitary unraveling and quantum state diffusion. For both protocols, we observe and characterize the full Page curve-like dynamics for the entanglement entropy. Depending on the protocol and the setup, we observe very distinct characteristics of the Page curve and the associated Page time and Page value. We also compute the number of fermions leaking to the reservoir and the associated current and shed light on their plausible connections with entanglement entropy. Our findings are expected to hold for a wide variety of generic interacting quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>Floquet engineering of point-gapped topological superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiang Ji, Hao Geng, Naeem Akhtar, Xiaosen Yang</p>
            <p>Non-Hermitian systems exhibit two distinct topological classifications based on their gap structure: line-gap and point-gap topologies. Although point-gap topology is intrinsic to non-Hermitian systems, its systematic construction remains a challenge. Here, we present the Floquet engineering approach for realizing point-gapped topological superconductors. By combining Floquet theory with particle-hole symmetry (PHS), we show that a point gap hosting robust Majorana edge modes emerges at the overlap of Floquet bands with opposite winding numbers. In the thermodynamic limit, even weak non-Hermiticity opens a point gap from a gapless spectrum, driving a topological phase transition and breaking non-Bloch parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry. This transition is accompanied by the appearance of the Floquet $Z_2$ skin effect. Furthermore, the point-gapped topological phase and the non-Bloch $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry exhibit size-dependent phenomena driven by the critical skin effect. Our work offers a new pathway for exploring the point-gapped topological phases in non-Hermitian systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weicen Dong, Qing-Dong Jiang, Matteo Baggioli</p>
            <p>Topological wave-packet dynamics provide a powerful framework for studying quantum transport in topological materials. However, extending this approach to non-Hermitian quantum systems presents several important challenges, primarily due to ambiguities in defining the Berry phase and the non-unitary evolution of the wave-packets when $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$ symmetry is broken. In this work, we adopt the complex Berry phase definition using the bi-orthogonal formalism and derive the semiclassical equations of motion (EOM) for a wave-packet in a non-Hermitian topological system. Interestingly, we find that the complex Berry curvature introduces both an anomalous velocity and an anomalous force into the semiclassical EOM. To validate the derived EOM, we design a non-Hermitian Haldane model featuring non-reciprocal next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) hopping, where the imbalance in the NNN hopping amplitudes gives rise to an emergent `complex chirality'. We reveal that the real and imaginary components of the complex chirality dictate the signs of both the real and imaginary parts of the complex Berry curvature, as well as the direction and dissipation rate of the edge states. Our analytical findings are confirmed by direct numerical simulations of the wave-packet dynamics. Finally, we suggest a potential experimental realization of this complex Haldane model using a non-Hermitian optical chiral cavity, providing a promising platform for testing our theoretical predictions.</p>

A non-perturbative three quark model light-cone wavefunction predicts significant non-classical correlations associated with the "entanglement negativity" measure for asymmetric and small quark momentum fractions. We perform one step of QCD scale evolution of the entire density matrix, not just its diagonal (dPDF), by computing collinearly divergent corrections due to the emission of a gluon. Finally, we present first qualitative numerical results for single-step scale evolution of quantum entanglement correlations in double quark PDFs. At a higher $Q^2$ scale, the non-classical correlations manifest in the dPDF for nearly symmetric momentum fractions.</p>

            <p>Khovanov homology is a topological knot invariant that categorifies the Jones polynomial, recognizes the unknot, and is conjectured to appear as an observable in $4D$ supersymmetric Yang--Mills theory. Despite its rich mathematical and physical significance, the computational complexity of Khovanov homology remains largely unknown. To address this challenge, this work initiates the study of efficient quantum algorithms for Khovanov homology. We provide simple proofs that increasingly accurate additive approximations to the ranks of Khovanov homology are DQC1-hard, BQP-hard, and #P-hard, respectively. For the first two approximation regimes, we propose a novel quantum algorithm. Our algorithm is efficient provided the corresponding Hodge Laplacian thermalizes in polynomial time and has a sufficiently large spectral gap, for which we give numerical and analytical evidence. Our approach introduces a pre-thermalization procedure that allows our quantum algorithm to succeed even if the Betti numbers of Khovanov homology are much smaller than the dimensions of the corresponding chain spaces, overcoming a limitation of prior quantum homology algorithms. We introduce novel connections between Khovanov homology and graph theory to derive analytic lower bounds on the spectral gap.</p>

            <p>The no-masking theorem says that masking quantum information is impossible in a bipartite scenario. However, there exist schemes to mask quantum states in multipartite systems. In this work, we show that, the joint measurement in the teleportation is really a masking process, when the apparatus is regarded as a quantum participant in the whole system. Based on the view, we present two four-partite maskers and a tripartite masker. One of the former provides a generalization in arbitrary dimension of the four-qubit scheme given by Li and Wang [Phys. Rev. A 98, 062306 (2018)], and the latter is precisely their tripartite scheme. The occupation probabilities and coherence of quantum states are masked in two steps of our schemes. And the information can be extracted naturally in their reverse processes.</p>

Our main result is that ${\sf BPP}^{\sf PP}\subseteq{\sf RwBQP}={\sf CBQP}={\sf AdPostBQP}\subseteq{\sf PSPACE}$. As a byproduct of this result, we show that any problem in ${\sf PostBQP}$ can be solved with only postselections of events that occur with probabilities polynomially close to one. Under the strongly believed assumption that ${\sf BQP}\nsupseteq{\sf SZK}$, or the shortest independent vectors problem cannot be efficiently solved with quantum computers, we also show that a single rewinding operator is sufficient to achieve tasks that are intractable for quantum computation. Finally, we show that rewindable Clifford circuits remain classically simulatable, but rewindable instantaneous quantum polynomial time circuits can solve any problem in ${\sf PP}$.</p>

            <p>Over the past century, a large community within theoretical physics has been seeking a unified framework for quantum gravity. Yet, to date, there is still no experimental evidence of any non-classical features of gravity. While traditional experimental proposals would usually require immensely challenging Planck scale experiments, recent table-top protocols based on low-energy quantum control have opened a new avenue into the investigation of non-classical gravity. An approach that has sparked high interest, both in terms of experimental feasibility and of theoretical implications, is the indirect witnessing of non-classical gravity through the detection of its capacity to act as an entangling channel. Most discussions have been centred on the entanglement generation between two gravitationally coupled massive systems. In this work, we instead examine the entangling capacity of the gravitational interaction between two light pulses. We explain the main experimental and theoretical advantages of having a photonic protocol, and lay out the steps leading to the determination of the entangling phase, using the path integral formalism and linearised gravity. We establish a closed form formula for the entangling phase and provide an estimated order of magnitude of the average photon number required for the generation of appreciable phase. Using statistical analysis, we show how entanglement may be certified with lower phase signal.</p>

We also investigate the effects of pulse distortion using numerical simulations for the case of short pulse duration.

            <p>We present a scalable algorithm for solving the transport equation in two and three spatial dimensions for variable grid sizes and discrete velocities on a fault-tolerant universal quantum computer. As a proof of concept of our quantum transport method (QTM), we describe a full-circuit start-to-end implementation in Qiskit and present numerical results for 2D flows. Our QTM is based on a novel streaming approach which leads to a reduction in the amount of CNOT gates required in comparison to state-of-the-art quantum streaming methods. As a second highlight we present a novel object encoding method, that reduces the complexity of the amount of CNOT gates required to encode walls, which now becomes independent of the size of the wall. Finally we present a novel quantum encoding of the particles' discrete velocities that enables a linear speed-up in the costs of reflecting the velocity of a particle, which now becomes independent of the amount of velocities encoded. Our main contribution is a detailed description of a fail-safe implementation of a quantum algorithm for the reflection step of the transport equation that can be readily implemented on a physical quantum computer. This fail-safe implementation allows for a variety of initial conditions and particle velocities and leads to physically correct behavior around the walls, edges and corners of obstacles. Combining these results we present a novel and fail-safe start-to-end quantum algorithm for the transport equation that can be used for a multitude of flow configurations. We finally show that our approach is quadratic in the amount of qubits necessary to encode the grid and the amount of qubits necessary to encode the discrete velocities in a single spatial dimension, which makes our approach superior to state-of-the-art approaches known in the literature.</p>

            <p>The design of quantum protocols for secure key generation poses many challenges: On the one hand, they need to be practical concerning experimental realisations. On the other hand, their theoretical description must be simple enough to allow for a security proof against all possible attacks. Often, these two requirements are in conflict with each other, and the differential phase shift (DPS) QKD protocol exemplifies these difficulties: It is designed to be implementable with current optical telecommunication technology, which, for this protocol, comes at the cost that many standard security proof techniques do not apply to it. After about 20 years since its invention, this work presents the first full security proof of DPS QKD against general attacks, including finite-size effects. The proof combines techniques from quantum information theory, quantum optics, and relativity. We first give a security proof of a QKD protocol whose security stems from relativistic constraints. We then show that security of DPS QKD can be reduced to security of the relativistic protocol. In addition, we show that coherent attacks on the DPS protocol are, in fact, stronger than collective attacks. Our results have broad implications for the development of secure and reliable quantum communication technologies, as they shed light on the range of applicability of state-of-the-art security proof techniques.</p>

            <h2>On the importance of data encoding in quantum Boltzmann methods</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Merel A. Schalkers, Matthias Möller</p>
            <p>In recent years, quantum Boltzmann methods have gained more and more interest as they might provide a viable path towards solving fluid dynamics problems on quantum computers once this emerging compute technology has matured and fault-tolerant many-qubit systems become available. The major challenge in developing a start-to-end quantum algorithm for the Boltzmann equation consists in encoding relevant data efficiently in quantum bits (qubits) and formulating the streaming, collision and reflection steps as one comprehensive unitary operation. The current literature on quantum Boltzmann methods mostly proposes data encodings and quantum primitives for individual phases of the pipeline assuming that they can be combined to a full algorithm. In this paper we disprove this assumption by showing that for encodings commonly discussed in literature either the collision or the streaming step cannot be unitary. Building on this landmark result we propose a novel encoding in which the number of qubits used to encode the velocity depends on the number of time steps one wishes to simulate, with the upper bound depending on the total number of grid points. In light of the non-unitarity result established for existing encodings, our encoding method is to the best of our knowledge the only one currently known that can be used for a start-to-end quantum Boltzmann solver where both the collision and the streaming step are implemented as a unitary operation. Furthermore our theoretical unitarity result can serve as a guideline on which types of encodings to consider or whether a `stop-and-go' method with repeated measurements and re-initializations is the method of choice.</p>

            <p>Quantum computing poses a threat to contemporary cryptosystems, with advances to a state in which it will cause problems predicted for the next few decades. Many of the proposed cryptosystems designed to be quantum-secure are based on the Shortest Vector Problem and related problems. In this paper we use the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimisation formulation of the Shortest Vector Problem implemented as a quantum Ising model on a simulated Coherent Ising Machine, showing progress towards solving SVP for three variants of the algorithm.</p>

            <h2>Cascaded Multiparameter Quantum Metrology</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gregory Krueper, Lior Cohen, Juliet T. Gopinath</p>
            <p>We present an innovative, platform-independent concept for multiparameter sensing where the measurable parameters are in series, or cascaded, enabling measurements as a function of position. With temporally resolved detection, we show that squeezing can give a quantum enhancement in sensitivity over that of classical states by a factor of $e^{2r}$, where $r \approx 1$ is the squeezing parameter. As an example, we have modeled an interferometer that senses multiple phase shifts along the same path, demonstrating a maximal quantum advantage by combining a coherent state with squeezed vacuum. Further classical modeling with up to 100 phases shows linear scaling potential for adding nodes to the sensor. The approach represents a new paradigm in multiparameter quantum metrology, and can be applied to remote sensing, geophysical surveying, and infrastructure monitoring.</p>

            <h2>Efficient ground-state energy estimation and certification on early fault-tolerant quantum computers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guoming Wang, Daniel Stilck França, Gumaro Rendon, Peter D. Johnson</p>
            <p>A major thrust in quantum algorithm development over the past decade has been the search for the quantum algorithms that will deliver practical quantum advantage first. Today's quantum computers - and even early fault-tolerant quantum computers - are limited in the number of operations they can implement per circuit. We introduce quantum algorithms for ground-state energy estimation (GSEE) that accommodate this design constraint. The first algorithm estimates ground-state energies, offering a quadratic improvement on the ground state overlap parameter compared to other methods in this regime. The second algorithm certifies that the estimated ground-state energy is within a specified error tolerance of the true ground-state energy, addressing the issue of gap estimation that beleaguers several ground state preparation and energy estimation algorithms. We note, however, that the scaling of this certification technique is currently less favorable than that of the GSEE algorithm. To develop the certification algorithm, we propose a novel use of quantum computers to facilitate rejection sampling. After a classical computer generates initial samples, the quantum computer is used to accept or reject these samples, resulting in a set of accepted samples that approximate draws from a target distribution. Although we apply this technique specifically for ground-state energy certification, it may find broader applications. Our work pushes the boundaries of what operation-limited quantum computers can achieve, bringing the prospect of quantum advantage closer to realization.</p>

            <h2>Efficient Simulation of Leakage Errors in Quantum Error Correcting Codes Using Tensor Network Methods</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hidetaka Manabe, Yasunari Suzuki, Andrew S. Darmawan</p>
            <p>Leakage errors, in which a qubit is excited to a level outside the qubit subspace, represent a significant obstacle in the development of robust quantum computers. We present a computationally efficient simulation methodology for studying leakage errors in quantum error correcting codes (QECCs) using tensor network methods, specifically Matrix Product States (MPS). Our approach enables the simulation of various leakage processes, including thermal noise and coherent errors, without approximations (such as the Pauli twirling approximation) that can lead to errors in the estimation of the logical error rate. We apply our method to two QECCs: the one-dimensional (1D) repetition code and a thin $3\times d$ surface code. By leveraging the small amount of entanglement generated during the error correction process, we are able to study large systems, up to a few hundred qudits, over many code cycles. We consider a realistic noise model of leakage relevant to superconducting qubits to evaluate code performance and a variety of leakage removal strategies. Our numerical results suggest that appropriate leakage removal is crucial, especially when the code distance is large.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Davis M. Welakuh, Vasil Rokaj, Michael Ruggenthaler, Angel Rubio</p>
            <p>In this work we investigate the effects that multi-mode photonic environments, e.g., optical cavities, have on the properties of quantum matter. We highlight the importance of the non-perturbative mass renormalization procedure for ab initio quantum electrodynamics simulations and how it connects to common approximations used in polaritonic chemistry and cavity materials engineering. We focus on one-dimensional systems which can be solved exactly for large number of photon modes. First, we apply mass renormalization to free particles. The value of the renormalized mass depends on the details of the photonic environment and on the number of particles. We then show how the multi-mode photon field influences various ground- and excited-state properties of atomic and molecular systems. For instance, we observe the enhancement of particle confinement in the binding potential for the atomic system, and the modification of the potential energy surfaces of the molecular dimer due to photon-mediated long-range interactions. We also highlight how these changes compare to the common free-space mass-renormalization approximation employed in electronic structure theory and quantum chemistry. Since such phenomena are enhanced under strong light-matter coupling in a cavity environment they will become relevant for the emerging fields of polaritonic chemistry and cavity materials engineering.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tristan Hubsch, Djordje Minic, Konstantin Nikolic, Sinisa Pajevic</p>
            <p>We explore the concept of emergent quantum-like theory in complex adaptive systems, and examine in particular the concrete example of such an emergent (or "mock") quantum theory in the Lotka-Volterra system. In general, we investigate the possibility of implementing the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics on classical systems, and what would be the conditions for using such an approach. We start from a standard description of a classical system via Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equation and reduce it to an effective Schrödinger-type equation, with a (mock) Planck constant $\mockbar$, which is system-dependent. The condition for this is that the so-called quantum potential VQ, which is state-dependent, is cancelled out by some additional term in the HJ equation. We consider this additional term to provide for the coupling of the classical system under consideration to the "environment." We assume that a classical system could cancel out the VQ term (at least approximately) by fine tuning to the environment. This might provide a mechanism for establishing a stable, stationary states in (complex) adaptive systems, such as biological systems. In this context we emphasize the state dependent nature of the mock quantum dynamics and we also introduce the new concept of the mock quantum, state dependent, statistical field theory. We also discuss some universal features of the quantum-to-classical as well as the mock-quantum-to-classical transition found in the turbulent phase of the hydrodynamic formulation of our proposal. In this way we reframe the concept of decoherence into the concept of "quantum turbulence," i.e. that the transition between quantum and classical could be defined in analogy to the transition from laminar to turbulent flow in hydrodynamics.</p>

            <h2>Echo-evolution data generation for quantum error mitigation via neural networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> D.V. Babukhin</p>
            <p>Neural networks provide a prospective tool for error mitigation in quantum simulation of physical systems. However, we need both noisy and noise-free data to train neural networks to mitigate errors in quantum computing results. Here, we propose a physics-motivated method to generate training data for quantum error mitigation via neural networks, which does not require classical simulation and target circuit simplification. In particular, we propose to use the echo evolution of a quantum system to collect noisy and noise-free data for training a neural network. Under this method, the initial state evolves forward and backward in time, returning to the initial state at the end of evolution. When run on a noisy quantum processor, the resulting state will be affected by the quantum noise accumulated during evolution. Having a vector of observable values of the initial (noise-free) state and the resulting (noisy) state allows us to compose training data for a neural network. We demonstrate that a feed-forward fully connected neural network trained on echo-evolution-generated data can correct results of forward-in-time evolution. Our findings can enhance the application of neural networks to error mitigation in quantum computing.</p>

            <p>Bosonic codes allow the encoding of a logical qubit in a single component device, utilizing the infinitely large Hilbert space of a harmonic oscillator. In particular, the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill code has recently been demonstrated to be correctable well beyond the break-even point of the best passive encoding in the same system. Current approaches to quantum error correction (QEC) for this system are based on protocols that use feedback, but the response is based only on the latest measurement outcome. In our work, we use the recently proposed Feedback-GRAPE (Gradient Ascent Pulse Engineering with Feedback) method to train a recurrent neural network that provides a QEC scheme based on memory, responding in a non-Markovian way to the full history of previous measurement outcomes, optimizing all subsequent unitary operations. This approach significantly outperforms current strategies and paves the way for more powerful measurement-based QEC protocols.</p>

            <p>Chebyshev polynomials have shown significant promise as an efficient tool for both classical and quantum neural networks to solve linear and nonlinear differential equations. In this work, we adapt and generalize this framework in a quantum machine learning setting for a variety of problems, including the 2D Poisson's equation, second-order linear differential equation, system of differential equations, nonlinear Duffing and Riccati equation. In particular, we propose in the quantum setting a modified Self-Adaptive Physics-Informed Neural Network (SAPINN) approach, where self-adaptive weights are applied to problems with multi-objective loss functions. We further explore capturing correlations in our loss function using a quantum-correlated measurement, resulting in improved accuracy for initial value problems. We analyse also the use of entangling layers and their impact on the solution accuracy for second-order differential equations. The results indicate a promising approach to the near-term evaluation of differential equations on quantum devices.</p>

            <h2>Designing fast quantum gates using optimal control with a reinforcement-learning ansatz</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bijita Sarma, Michael J. Hartmann</p>
            <p>Fast quantum gates are crucial not only for the contemporary era of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices but also for the prospective development of practical fault-tolerant quantum computing. Leakage errors, which arise from data qubits jumping beyond the confines of the computational subspace, are the main challenges in realizing non-adiabatically driven, fast gates. In this work, we propose and illustrate the usefulness of reinforcement learning (RL) to generate fast two-qubit gates in practical multilevel superconducting qubits. In particular, we show that the RL controller offers great effectiveness in finding piecewise constant gate pulse sequences that act on two transmon data qubits coupled by a tunable coupler to generate a controlled-Z (CZ) gate with a gate time of 10 ns and an error rate of $\sim 4\times 10^{-3}$. Using a gradient-based method to solve the same optimization problem often does not achieve high fidelity for such fast gates. However, we show that using the gate pulses discovered by RL as an ansatz for the gradient-based controller can substantially enhance fidelity compared to using RL alone. While for a 10 ns pulse, this improvement is marginal, the combined RL + gradient approach decreases the gate errors below $10^{-4}$ for a gate of length 20 ns.</p>

            <p>Semiconductor single-photon detectors cannot be straightforwardly adapted for the microwave regime, primarily because microwave photons carry far less energy and thus require cryogenic temperatures and specialized architectures. Here, we propose a hybrid spin-optomechanical interface to detect single microwave photons where the microwave photons are coupled to a phononic resonator via piezoelectric actuation. This phononic cavity also acts as a photonic cavity with either a single embedded Silicon-Vacancy (SiV) center in diamond or an ensemble of these centers, bridging optical single-photon detection protocols into the microwave domain. We model the detection process as a communication channel whose capacity is quantified by the mutual information \(I(A;B)\) between the true photon occupancy (A) and the detector outcome (B). Depending on experimentally achievable parameters, simulations predict \(I(A;B)\) in the range \(0.57\,\ln(2)\) to \(0.67\,\ln(2)\), corresponding to true-positive (detection) probabilities above 90\% and false-positive (dark count) probabilities below 10\% per detection interval. These results suggest a viable path to low-noise, high-efficiency single-photon detection at microwave frequencies.</p>

            <p>Entanglement plays a crucial role in the development of quantum-enabled devices. One significant objective is the deterministic creation and distribution of entangled states, achieved, for example, through a mechanical oscillator interacting with confined electromagnetic fields. In this study, we explore a cavity resonator containing a two-sided perfect mirror. Although the mirror separates the cavity modes into two independent confined electromagnetic fields, the radiation pressure interaction gives rise to high-order effective interactions across all subsystems. Depending on the chosen resonant conditions, which are also related to the position of the mirror, we study $2n$-photon entanglement generation and bilateral photon pair emission. Demonstrating the non-classical nature of the mechanical oscillator, we provide a pathway to control these phenomena, opening potential applications in quantum technologies. Looking ahead, similar integrated devices could be used to entangle subsystems across vastly different energy scales, such as microwave and optical photons.</p>

            <h2>On the significance of Wigner's Friend in contexts beyond quantum foundations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Caroline L. Jones, Markus P. Mueller</p>
            <p>There has been a surge of recent interest in the Wigner's Friend paradox, sparking several novel thought experiments and no-go theorems. The main narrative has been that Wigner's Friend highlights a counterintuitive feature that is unique to quantum theory, and which is closely related to the quantum measurement problem. Here, we challenge this view. We argue that the gist of the Wigner's Friend paradox can be reproduced without assuming quantum physics, and that it underlies a much broader class of enigmas in the foundations of physics and philosophy. To show this, we first consider several recently proposed Extended Wigner's Friend scenarios, and demonstrate that some of their implications for the absoluteness of observations can be reproduced by classical thought experiments that involve the duplication of agents. Crucially, some of these classical scenarios are technologically much easier to implement than their quantum counterparts. Then, we argue that the essential structural ingredient of all these scenarios is a feature that we call "Restriction A": essentially, that a physical theory cannot give us a probabilistic description of the observations of all agents. Finally, we argue that this difficulty is at the core of other puzzles in the foundations of physics and philosophy, and demonstrate this explicitly for cosmology's Boltzmann brain problem. Our analysis suggests that Wigner's Friend should be studied in a larger context, addressing a frontier of human knowledge beyond quantum foundations: to obtain reliable predictions for experiments in which these predictions can be privately but not intersubjectively verified.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Javier Navarro, Ricard Ravell Rodríguez, Mikel Sanz</p>
            <p>The Cramér-Rao bound serves as a crucial lower limit for the mean squared error of an estimator in frequentist parameter estimation. Paradoxically, it requires highly accurate prior knowledge of the estimated parameter for constructing the optimal unbiased estimator. In contrast, Bhattacharyya bounds offer a more robust estimation framework with respect to prior accuracy by introducing additional constraints on the estimator. In this work, we examine divergences that arise in the computation of these bounds and establish the conditions under which they remain valid. Notably, we show that when the number of constraints exceeds the number of measurement outcomes, an estimator with finite variance typically does not exist. Furthermore, we systematically investigate the properties of these bounds using paradigmatic examples, comparing them to the Cramér-Rao and Bayesian approaches.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Camille L Latune, Cyril Elouard</p>
            <p>Considering a general microscopic model for a quantum measuring apparatus comprising a quantum probe coupled to a thermal bath, we analyze the energetic resources necessary for the realization of a quantum measurement, which includes the creation of system-apparatus correlations, the irreversible transition to a statistical mixture of definite outcomes, and the apparatus resetting. Crucially, we do not resort to another quantum measurement to capture the emergence of objective measurement results, but rather exploit the properties of the thermal bath which redundantly records the measurement result in its degrees of freedom, naturally implementing the paradigm of quantum Darwinism. In practice, this model allows us to perform a quantitative thermodynamic analysis of the measurement process. From the expression of the second law, we show how the minimal required work depends on the energy variation of the system being measured plus information-theoretic quantities characterizing the performance of the measurement -- efficiency and completeness. Additionally, we show that it is possible to perform a thermodynamically reversible measurement, thus reaching the minimal work expenditure, and provide the corresponding protocol. Finally, for finite-time measurement protocols, we illustrate the increasing work cost induced by rising entropy production inherent in finite-time thermodynamic processes. This highlights an emerging trade-off between velocity of the measurement and work cost, on top of a trade-off between efficiency of the measurement and work cost. We apply those findings to bring new insights in the thermodynamic balance of the measurement-powered quantum engines.</p>

            <p>We propose and analyze a universal method to obtain fast charging of a quantum battery by a driven charger system using controlled, pure dephasing of the charger. While the battery displays coherent underdamped oscillations of energy for weak charger dephasing, the quantum Zeno freezing of the charger energy at high dephasing suppresses the rate of transfer of energy to the battery. Choosing an optimum dephasing rate between the regimes leads to a fast charging of the battery. We illustrate our results with the charger and battery modeled by either two-level systems or harmonic oscillators. Apart from the fast charging, the dephasing also renders the charging performance more robust to detuning between the charger, drive, and battery frequencies for the two-level systems case.</p>

            <p>In the quest for robust and universal quantum devices, the notion of simulation plays a crucial role, both from a theoretical and from an applied perspective. In this work, we go beyond the simulation of quantum channels and quantum measurements, studying what it means to simulate a collection of measurements, which we call a multimeter. To this end, we first explicitly characterize the completely positive transformations between multimeters. However, not all of these transformations correspond to valid simulations, as otherwise we could create any resource from nothing. For example, the set of transformations includes maps that always prepare the same multimeter regardless of the input, which we call trash-and-prepare. From the perspective of an experimenter with a given multimeter as part of a complicated setup, having to discard the multimeter and using a different one instead is undesirable. We give a new definition of multimeter simulations as transformations that are triviality-preserving, i.e., when given a multimeter consisting of trivial measurements they can only produce another trivial multimeter. In the absence of a quantum ancilla, we then characterize the transformations that are triviality-preserving and the transformations that are trash-and-prepare. Finally, we use these characterizations to compare our new definition of multimeter simulation to three existing ones: classical simulations, compression of multimeters, and compatibility-preserving simulations.</p>

            <p>Quantum computing has been pursued with various hardware platforms, and an optical system is one of the most reasonable choices for large-scale computation. In the optical continuous-variable computation scheme, the incorporation of Gaussian gates and a highly non-classical non-Gaussian state enables universal quantum computation. Although basic technologies for Gaussian gates and non-Gaussian state generations have long been developed, these building blocks have not yet been integrated in a scalable fashion. Here, we integrate them to develop a scalable and programmable optical quantum computing platform that can sequentially perform an essential Gaussian gate, the squeezing gate, on a non-Gaussian input state. The key enablers are a loop-based optical circuit with dynamical and programmable controllability and its time-synchronization with the probabilistic non-Gaussian state generation. We verify the deterministic, programmable, and repeatable quantum gates on a typical non-Gaussian state by implementing up to three-step gates. The gates implemented are so high-quality that strong evidence of the states' non-classicalities, negativities of the Wigner functions, are preserved even after multistep gates. This platform is compatible with other non-Gaussian states and can in principle realize large-scale universal quantum computing by incorporating other existing processing technologies.</p>

Our study extends beyond the conventional framework by investigating the generalized angular momentum algebra within the context of Schwinger's oscillator model. This includes a detailed examination of the algebraic structures for combinations of bosonic-bosonic, bosonic-fermionic, and fermionic-fermionic oscillators.

We show that this class of problems can be formulated and structured to take advantage of quantum superposition and solved efficiently using the Deutsch-Jozsa and Grover quantum algorithms. To do so, we extend their functionality to address the unique requirements of how input (sub)sets into the algorithms must be mathematically structured while simultaneously constructing the inputs so that measurement outputs can be interpreted as meaningful properties of the network dynamics.

            <p>Unitary and non-unitary diagonal operators are fundamental building blocks in quantum algorithms with applications in the resolution of partial differential equations, Hamiltonian simulations, the loading of classical data on quantum computers (quantum state preparation) and many others. In this paper, we introduce a general approach to implement unitary and non-unitary diagonal operators with efficient-adjustable-depth quantum circuits. The depth, i.e., the number of layers of quantum gates of the quantum circuit, is reducible with respect either to the width, i.e, the number of ancilla qubits, or to the accuracy between the implemented operator and the target one. While exact methods have an optimal exponential scaling either in terms of size, i.e., the total number of primitive quantum gates, or width, approximate methods prove to be efficient for the class of diagonal operators depending on smooth, at least differentiable, functions. Our approach is general enough to allow any method for diagonal operators to become adjustable-depth or approximate, decreasing the depth of the circuit by increasing its width or its approximation level. This feature offers flexibility and can match with the hardware limitations in coherence time or cumulative gate error. We illustrate these methods by performing quantum state preparation and non-unitary-real-space simulation of the diffusion equation. This simulation paves the way to efficient implementations of stochastic models useful in physics, chemistry, biology, image processing and finance.</p>

            <p>The density classification (DC) task, a computation which maps global density information to local density, is studied using one-dimensional non-unitary quantum cellular automata (QCAs). Two approaches are considered: one that preserves the number density and one that performs majority voting. For number preserving DC, two QCAs are introduced that reach the fixed point solution in a time scaling quadratically with the system size. One of the QCAs is based on a known classical probabilistic cellular automaton which has been studied in the context of DC. The second is a new quantum model that is designed to demonstrate additional quantum features and is restricted to only two-body interactions. Both can be generated by continuous-time Lindblad dynamics. A third QCA is a hybrid rule defined by both discrete-time and continuous-time three-body interactions that is shown to solve the majority voting problem within a time that scales linearly with the system size.</p>

            <h2>Robust photonic quantum gates with large number of waveguide segments</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Khen Cohen, Haim Suchowski, Yaron Oz</p>
            <p>Realizing quantum information processors is challenged by errors and noise across all platforms. While composite segmentation schemes have been proposed in many systems, their application to photonic quantum gates in dual-rail configurations has only recently been demonstrated. However, prior research has been limited to a small number of segments, full noise correlation, and has overlooked the inherent power loss in such designs. Here, we study the fidelity and power loss of composite designs for photonic quantum gates with a high number of segments of varying geometrical widths. Using numerical simulations, we analyze the relationship between gate performance and the number of waveguide segments, accounting for statistical error correlations and variances. Beyond effectively reducing the errors, an asymptotic scaling pattern of quantum gate fidelity and power loss is observed as the number of segments increases. This analysis is examined in Silicon and Lithium Niobate platforms, addressing practical implementation challenges. Our findings demonstrate that optimized multi-segment waveguide geometrical designs significantly enhance the robustness and efficiency of photonic quantum gates, paving the way for more reliable quantum information processors.</p>

            <h2>Momentum exchange method for quantum Boltzmann methods</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Merel A. Schalkers, Matthias Möller</p>
            <p>The past years have seen a surge in quantum algorithms for computational fluid dynamics (CFD). These algorithms have in common that whilst promising a speed-up in the performance of the algorithm, no specific method of measurement has been suggested. This means that while the algorithms presented in the literature may be promising methods for creating the quantum state that represents the final flow field, an efficient measurement strategy is not available. This paper marks the first quantum method proposed to efficiently calculate quantities of interest (QoIs) from a state vector representing the flow field. In particular, we propose a method to calculate the force acting on an object immersed in the fluid using a quantum version of the momentum exchange method (MEM) that is commonly used in lattice Boltzmann methods to determine the drag and lift coefficients. In order to achieve this we furthermore give a scheme that implements bounce back boundary conditions on a quantum computer, as those are the boundary conditions the momentum exchange method is designed for.</p>

            <h2>Sign problem in tensor network contraction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jielun Chen, Jiaqing Jiang, Dominik Hangleiter, Norbert Schuch</p>
            <p>We investigate how the computational difficulty of contracting tensor networks depends on the sign structure of the tensor entries. Using results from computational complexity, we observe that the approximate contraction of tensor networks with only positive entries has lower complexity. This raises the question how this transition in computational complexity manifests itself in the hardness of different contraction schemes. We pursue this question by studying random tensor networks with varying bias towards positive entries. First, we consider contraction via Monte Carlo sampling, and find that the transition from hard to easy occurs when the entries become predominantly positive; this can be seen as a tensor network manifestation of the Quantum Monte Carlo sign problem. Second, we analyze the commonly used contraction based on boundary tensor networks. Its performance is governed by the amount of correlations (entanglement) in the tensor network. Remarkably, we find that the transition from hard to easy (i.e., from a volume law to a boundary law scaling of entanglement) occurs already for a slight bias towards a positive mean, and the earlier the larger the bond dimension is. This is in contrast to both expectations and the behavior found in Monte Carlo contraction. We gain further insight into this early transition from the study of an effective statmech model. Finally, we investigate the computational difficulty of computing expectation values of tensor network wavefunctions, i.e., PEPS, where we find that the complexity of entanglement-based contraction always remains low. We explain this by providing a local transformation which maps PEPS expectation values to a positive-valued tensor network. This not only provides insight into the origin of the observed boundary law entanglement scaling, but also suggests new approaches towards PEPS contraction based on positive decompositions.</p>

            <p>Suspending devices on thin SiN membranes can limit their interaction with the bulk substrate and reduce parasitic capacitance to ground. While suspending devices on membranes is used in many fields including radiation detection using superconducting circuits, there has been less investigation into maximum membrane aspect ratios and achievable suspended device quality, metrics important to establish the applicable scope of the technique. Here, we investigate these metrics by fabricating superconducting coplanar waveguide resonators entirely atop thin ($\sim$110 nm) SiN membranes, where the membrane's shortest length to thickness yields an aspect ratio of approximately $7.4 \times 10^3$. We compare these membrane resonators to on-substrate resonators on the same chip, finding similar internal quality factors $\sim$$10^5$ at single photon levels. Furthermore, we confirm that these membranes do not adversely affect resonator thermalization and conduct further materials characterization. By achieving high quality superconducting circuit devices fully suspended on thin SiN membranes, our results help expand the technique's scope to potential uses including incorporating higher aspect ratio membranes for device suspension and creating larger footprint, high impedance, and high quality devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Roland C. Farrell, Marc Illa, Martin J. Savage</p>
            <p>A framework for simulating the real-time dynamics of composite particles in a simple model of dense matter that is amenable to quantum computers is developed. As a demonstration, we perform classical simulations of heavy-hadrons propagating through a dense medium in the Schwinger model. Measurements of the time-dependent energy and charge density are used to identify mechanisms responsible for energy loss and hadron production (hadronization). A study of entanglement dynamics highlights the importance of quantum coherence between the particles that make up the dense medium. Throughout this work, care is taken to isolate, and remove, phenomena that arise solely from a finite lattice spacing. It is found that signatures of entanglement are more sensitive to lattice artifacts than other observables. Toward quantum simulations, we present an efficient method and the corresponding quantum circuits for preparing ground states in the presence of heavy mesons. These circuits are used to estimate the resources required to simulate in-medium energy loss and hadronization in the Schwinger model using quantum computers.</p>

            <p>We consider quantum systems with energy constraints relative to a reference Hamiltonian. In general, quantum channels and continuous-time dynamics need not satisfy energy conservation. Physically meaningful channels, however, only introduce a finite amount of energy to the system, and continuous-time dynamics only increase the energy gradually over time. We systematically study such "energy-limited" channels and dynamics. For Markovian dynamics, energy-limitedness is equivalent to a single operator inequality in the Heisenberg picture. We observe new submultiplicativity inequalities for the energy-constrained diamond and operator norms and use them to derive new state-dependent continuity bounds for quantum speed limits.</p>

            <p>In this work, the entanglement dynamics of different subsystems such as atom-atom, atom-field and field-field with radiation field in squeezed coherent thermal states for the intensity-dependent double Jaynes-Cummings model (IDDJCM) and double Jaynes-Cummings model (DJCM) are investigated. The effects of both squeezed photons and thermal photons on entanglement dynamics is observed. The main feature of the double Jaynes-Cummings model - entanglement sudden death is observed for every subsystem. The effects of various interactions such as Ising interaction, single photon exchange interaction and dipole-dipole interaction on entanglement dynamics are studied. The effects of detuning, Kerr-nonlinearity on the entanglement dynamics are investigated for every subsystem. It is noticed that proper choice of the interactions parameters, detuning and Kerr-nonlinearity effectively removes entanglement deaths from the dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Decoupling of External and Internal Dynamics in Driven Two-level Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samuel Böhringer, Alexander Friedrich</p>
            <p>We show how a laser driven two-level system including quantized external degrees of freedom for each state can be decoupled into a set of oscillator equations acting only on the external degrees of freedom with operator valued damping representing the detuning. We give a way of characterizing the solvability of this family of problems by appealing to a classical oscillator with time-dependent damping. As a consequence of this classification we (a) obtain analytic and representation-free expressions for Rabi oscillations including external degrees of freedom with and without an external linear potential, (b) show that whenever the detuning operator can be diagonalized (analytically or numerically) the problem decomposes into a set of classical equations and (c) we can use the oscillator equations as a perturbative basis to describe Rabi oscillations in weak but otherwise arbitrary external potentials. Moreover, chirping of the driving fields phase emerges naturally as a means of compensating the Ehrenfest/mean-value part of the detuning operator's dynamics while the presence of driving phase noise leads to a stochastic evolution equation of Langevin type. Lastly, our approach is representation free with respect to the external degrees of freedom and as consequence a suitable representation or basis expansion can be chosen a posteriori depending on the desired application at hand.</p>

            <p>In quantum information processing, two primary research directions have emerged: one based on discrete variables (DV) and the other on the structure of quantum states in a continuous-variable (CV) space. Integrating these two approaches could unlock new potentials, overcoming their respective limitations. Here, we show that such a DV-CV hybrid approach, applied to superconducting Kerr parametric oscillators (KPOs), enables us to entangle a pair of Schrödinger's cat states by two methods. The first involves the entanglement-preserving conversion between Bell states in the Fock-state basis (DV encoding) and those in the cat-state basis (CV encoding). The second method implements a $\sqrt{\textrm{iSWAP}}$ gate between two cat states following the procedure for Fock-state encoding. This simple and fast gate operation completes a universal quantum gate set in a KPO system. Our work offers powerful applications of DV-CV hybridization and marks a first step toward developing a multi-qubit platform based on planar KPO systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> William J. Huggins, Oskar Leimkuhler, Torin F. Stetina, K. Birgitta Whaley</p>
            <p>The quantum simulation of real molecules and materials is one of the most highly anticipated applications of quantum computing. Algorithms for simulating electronic structure using a first-quantized plane wave representation are especially promising due to their asymptotic efficiency. However, previous proposals for preparing initial states for these simulation algorithms scale poorly with the size of the basis set. We address this shortcoming by showing how to efficiently map states defined in a Gaussian type orbital basis to a plane wave basis with a scaling that is logarithmic in the number of plane waves. Our key technical result is a proof that molecular orbitals constructed from Gaussian type basis functions can be compactly represented in a plane wave basis using matrix product states. While we expect that other approaches could achieve the same logarithmic scaling with respect to basis set size, our proposed state preparation technique is also highly efficient in practice. For example, in a series of numerical experiments on small molecules, we find that our approach allows us to prepare an approximation to the Hartree-Fock state using orders of magnitude fewer non-Clifford gates than a naive approach. By resolving the issue of state preparation, our work allows for the first quantum simulation of molecular systems whose end-to-end complexity is truly sublinear in the basis set size.</p>

Moessner, and P. W. Claeys, Phys. Rev. B 111, 014309 (2025)].

            <p>We introduce a cyclic quantum battery model, based on an interacting bipartite system, weakly coupled to a thermal bath. The working cycle of the battery consists of four strokes: system thermalization, disconnection of subsystems, ergotropy extraction, and reconnection. The thermal bath acts as a charger in the thermalization stroke, while ergotropy extraction is possible because the ensuing thermal state is no longer passive after the disconnection stroke. Focusing on the case of two interacting qubits, we show that phase coherence, in the presence of non-trivial correlations between the qubits, can be exploited to reach working regimes with efficiency higher than 50% while providing finite ergotropy. Our protocol is illustrated through a simple and feasible circuit model of a cyclic superconducting quantum battery. Furthermore, we simulate the considered cycle on superconducting IBM quantum machines. The good agreement between the theoretical and simulated results strongly suggests that our scheme for cyclic quantum batteries can be successfully realized in superconducting quantum hardware.</p>

The new schemes require a reduced number of exponentials and thus provide more efficient approximations than other previously published alternatives. They can also be used as basic methods in recursive procedures to increase the order of approximation. We expect this research will improve the efficiency of quantum control protocols, as well as quantum algorithms such as the Zassenhaus-based product formula, Magnus operator-based time-dependent simulation, and product formula schemes with modified potentials.</p>

In the classical case, both the measures and the positive definite kernels are scalar valued. But the non-commutative framework (as motivated by quantum theory) dictates a setting where instead now both the measures (in the form of quantum states), and the positive definite kernels, are operator valued. The non-commutative theory entails a systematic study of positive operator valued measures, abbreviated POVMs. And quantum states (normal states) are indexed by normalized positive trace-class operators. In the non-commutative theory, the parallel to the commutative/scalar valued theory helps us understand entanglement in quantum information. A further implication of our study of the non-commutative framework will entail an interplay between the two cases, scalar valued, vs operator valued.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fanxu Meng, Xiangzhen Zhou, Pengcheng Zhu, Yu Luo</p>
            <p>The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm that shows promise in efficiently solving the MaxCut problem, a representative example of combinatorial optimization. However, its effectiveness heavily depends on the parameter optimization pipeline, where the parameter initialization strategy is nontrivial due to the non-convex and complex optimization landscapes characterized by issues with low-quality local minima. Recent inspiration comes from the diffusion of classical neural network parameters, which has demonstrated that neural network training can benefit from generating good initial parameters through diffusion models. Therefore, in this work, we formulate the problem of finding good initial parameters as a generative task and propose the initial parameter generation scheme through dataset-conditioned pre-trained parameter sampling. Concretely, the generative machine learning model, specifically the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM), is trained to learn the distribution of pretrained parameters conditioned on the graph dataset. Intuitively, our proposed framework aims at effectively distilling knowledge from pre-trained parameters to generate well-performing initial parameters for QAOA. Compared to random parameter initialization, experiments on various-sized Max-Cut problem instances consistently show that our conditional DDPM is capable of improving the approximation ratio by as much as 14.4%, 11.0%, 11.4% and 7.49%, 8.31%, 6.08% on average for random, regular, and Watts-Strogatz graphs, respectively. Additionally, the experimental results also indicate that the conditional DDPM trained on small problem instances can be extrapolated to larger ones, improving the approximation ratio by up to 28.4% and 12.1% on average.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhuo Chen, Guoding Liu, Xiongfeng Ma</p>
            <p>Quantum learning tasks often leverage randomly sampled quantum circuits to characterize unknown systems. An efficient approach known as "circuit reusing," where each circuit is executed multiple times, reduces the cost compared to implementing new circuits. This work investigates the optimal reusing parameter that minimizes the variance of measurement outcomes for a given experimental cost. We establish a theoretical framework connecting the variance of experimental estimators with the reusing parameter R. An optimal R is derived when the implemented circuits and their noise characteristics are known. Additionally, we introduce a near-optimal reusing strategy that is applicable even without prior knowledge of circuits or noise, achieving variances close to the theoretical minimum. To validate our framework, we apply it to randomized benchmarking and analyze the optimal R for various typical noise channels. We further conduct experiments on a superconducting platform, revealing a non-linear relationship between R and the cost, contradicting previous assumptions in the literature. Our theoretical framework successfully incorporates this non-linearity and accurately predicts the experimentally observed optimal R. These findings underscore the broad applicability of our approach to experimental realizations of quantum learning protocols.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sourav Manna, Vaibhav Madhok, Arul Lakshminarayan</p>
            <p>When subject to a non-local unitary evolution, qubits in a quantum circuit become increasingly entangled. Conversely, measurements applied to individual qubits lead to their disentanglement from the collective system. The extent of entanglement reduction depends on the frequency of local projective measurements. A delicate balance emerges between unitary evolution, which enhances entanglement, and measurements which diminish it. In the thermodynamic limit, there is a phase transition from volume law entanglement to area law entanglement at a critical value of measurement frequency. This phenomenon, occurring in hybrid quantum circuits with both unitary gates and measurements, is termed as measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT). We study the behavior of MIPT in circuits comprising of two qubit unitary gates parameterized by Cartan decomposition. We show that the entangling power and gate typicality of the two-qubit local unitaries employed in the circuit can be used to explain the behavior of global bipartite entanglement the circuit can sustain. When the two qubit gate throughout the circuit is the identity and measurements are the sole driver of the entanglement behavior, we obtain analytical estimate for the entanglement entropy that shows remarkable agreement with numerical simulations. We also find that the entangling power and gate typicality enable the classification of the two-qubit unitaries by different universality classes of phase transitions that can occur in the hybrid circuit. For all unitaries in a particular universality class, the transition from volume to area law of entanglement occurs with same exponent that characterizes the phase transition.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Felix Burt, Kuan-Cheng Chen, Kin Leung</p>
            <p>Distributed quantum computing (DQC) is a new paradigm aimed at scaling up quantum computing via the interconnection of smaller quantum processing units (QPUs). Shared entanglement allows teleportation of both states and gates between QPUs. This leads to an attractive horizontal scaling of quantum processing power, which comes at the expense of the additional time and noise introduced by entanglement sharing protocols. Consequently, methods for partitioning quantum circuits across multiple QPUs should aim to minimise the amount of entanglement-based communication required between distributed QPUs. Existing protocols tend to focus primarily on optimising entanglement costs for gate teleportation or state teleportation to cover operations between QPUs, rather than both at the same time. The most general form of the problem should treat gate and state teleportation on the same footing, allowing minimal cost circuit partitions through a combination of the two. This work introduces a graph-based formulation which allows joint optimisation of gate and state teleportation cost, including extensions of gate teleportation which group gates together for distribution using common resources. The formulation permits low e-bit cost for a variety of circuit types. Using a basic genetic algorithm, improved performance over state-of-the-art methods is obtained in terms of both average e-bit cost and time scaling.</p>

The curvature depends on the sum of the weighted degrees of nodes in graphs constructed by raising the weights in $G(V, E)$ to the second and fourth powers. It also depends on the sum of the products of the weights of edges forming squares in graph $G(V, E)$. The torsion in addition is related to the sum of the products of the weights of edges in graph $G(V, E)$ forming triangles $S_3$. Geometric properties of quantum graph states and the sum of the weighted degrees of nodes have been calculated with quantum programming on IBM's quantum computer for the case of a spin chain.</p>

            <p>Quantum computers must achieve large-scale, fault-tolerant operation to deliver on their promise of transformational processing power [1-4]. This will require thousands or millions of high-fidelity quantum gates and similar numbers of qubits [5]. Demonstrations using neutral-atom qubits trapped and manipulated by lasers have shown that this modality can provide high two-qubit gate (CZ) fidelities and scalable operation [6-13]. However, the gates in these demonstrations are driven by lasers that do not resolve individual qubits, with universal computation enabled by physical mid-circuit shuttling of the qubits. This relatively slow operation may greatly extend runtimes for useful, large-scale computation. Here we demonstrate a universal neutral-atom quantum computer with gate rates limited by optical switching times, rather than shuttling, by individually addressing tightly focused laser beams at an array of single atoms. We achieve CZ fidelity of 99.35(4)% and local single-qubit RZ gate fidelity of 99.902(8)%. Moreover, we demonstrate non-destructive readout of alkali-atom qubits with 0.9(3)% loss, which boosts operational speed. This technique also enables us to measure a state-of-the-art CZ fidelity of 99.73(3)% when excluding atom-loss events, which may be mitigated through erasure conversion. Our results represent a critical step towards large-scale, fault-tolerant neutral-atom quantum computers that can execute computations on practical timescales.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammad Haidar, Olivier Adjoua, Siwar Baddredine, Alberto Peruzzo, Jean-Philip Piquemal</p>
            <p>Due to their non-iterative nature, fixed Unitary Coupled-Cluster (UCC) ansätze are attractive for performing quantum chemistry Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) computations as they avoid pre-circuit measurements on a quantum computer. However, achieving chemical accuracy for strongly correlated systems with UCC requires further inclusion of higher-order fermionic excitations beyond triples increasing circuit depth. We introduce $k$-NI-DUCC, a fixed and Non-iterative Disentangled Unitary Coupled-Cluster compact ansatz, based on specific $"k"$ sets of "qubit" excitations, eliminating the needs for fermionic-type excitations. These elements scale linearly ($\mathcal{O}(n)$) by leveraging Lie algebraic structures, with $n$ being the number of qubits. The key excitations are screened through specific selection criteria, including the enforcement of all symmetries, to ensure the construction of a robust set of generators. NI-DUCC employs $"k"$ products of the exponential of $\mathcal{O}(n)$- anti-Hermitian Pauli operators, where each operator has a length $p$. This results in a fewer two-qubit CNOT gates circuit, $\mathcal{O}(knp)$, suitable for hardware implementations. Tested on LiH, H$_6$ and BeH$_2$, NI-DUCC-VQE achieves both chemical accuracy and rapid convergence even for molecules deviating significantly from equilibrium. It is hardware-efficient, reaching the exact Full Configuration Interaction energy solution at specific layers, while reducing significantly the VQE optimization steps. While NI-DUCC-VQE effectively addresses the gradient measurement bottleneck of ADAPT-VQE-like iterative algorithms, the classical computational cost of constructing the $\mathcal{O}(n)$ set of excitations increases exponentially with the number of qubits. We provide a first implementation for constructing the generators' set able to handle up to 20 qubits and discuss the efficiency perspectives.</p>

            <h2>DasAtom: A Divide-and-Shuttle Atom Approach to Quantum Circuit Transformation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yunqi Huang, Dingchao Gao, Shenggang Ying, Sanjiang Li</p>
            <p>Neutral atom (NA) quantum systems are emerging as a leading platform for quantum computation, offering superior or competitive qubit count and gate fidelity compared to superconducting circuits and ion traps. However, the unique features of NA devices, such as long-range interactions, long qubit coherence time, and the ability to physically move qubits, present distinct challenges for quantum circuit compilation. In this paper, we introduce DasAtom, a novel divide-and-shuttle atom approach designed to optimise quantum circuit transformation for NA devices by leveraging these capabilities. DasAtom partitions circuits into subcircuits, each associated with a qubit mapping that allows all gates within the subcircuit to be directly executed. The algorithm then shuttles atoms to transition seamlessly from one mapping to the next, enhancing both execution efficiency and overall fidelity. For a 30-qubit Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), DasAtom achieves a 414x improvement in fidelity over the move-based algorithm Enola and a 10.6x improvement over the SWAP-based algorithm Tetris. Notably, this improvement is expected to increase exponentially with the number of qubits, positioning DasAtom as a highly promising solution for scaling quantum computation on NA platforms.</p>

            <h2>Information geometry approach to quantum stochastic thermodynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Laetitia P. Bettmann, John Goold</p>
            <p>Recent advancements have revealed new links between information geometry and classical stochastic thermodynamics, particularly through the Fisher information (FI) with respect to time. Recognizing the non-uniqueness of the quantum Fisher metric in Hilbert space, we exploit the fact that any quantum Fisher information (QFI) can be decomposed into a metric-independent incoherent part and a metric-dependent coherent contribution. We demonstrate that the incoherent component of any QFI can be directly linked to entropic acceleration, and for GKSL dynamics with local detailed balance, to the rate of change of generalised thermodynamic forces and entropic flow, paralleling the classical results. Furthermore, we tighten a classical uncertainty relation between the geometric uncertainty of a path in state space and the time-averaged rate of information change and demonstrate that it also holds for quantum systems. We generalise a classical geometric bound on the entropy rate for far-from-equilibrium processes by incorporating a non-negative quantum contribution that arises from the geometric action due to coherent dynamics. Finally, we apply an information-geometric analysis to the recently proposed quantum-thermodynamic Mpemba effect, demonstrating this framework's ability to capture thermodynamic phenomena.</p>

            <h2>Quantum jumps in amplitude bistability: tracking a coherent and invertible state localization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Th. K. Mavrogordatos</p>
            <p>We investigate the nature of quantum jumps occurring between macroscopic metastable states of light in the open driven Jaynes-Cummings model. We find that, in the limit of zero spontaneous emission considered in [H. J. Carmichael, Phys. Rev. X 5, 031028 (2015)], the jumps from a high-photon state to the vacuum state entail two stages. The first part is coherent and modelled by the localization of a state superposition, in the example of a null-measurement record predicted by quantum trajectory theory. The underlying evolution is mediated by an unstable state (which often splits to a complex of states), identified by the conditioned density matrix and the corresponding quasiprobability distribution of the cavity field. The unstable state subsequently decays to the vacuum to complete the jump. Coherence in the localization allows for inverting the null-measurement photon average about its initial value, to account for the full switch which typically lasts a small fraction of the cavity lifetime. This mechanism is contrasted to the jumps leading from the vacuum to the high-photon state in the bistable signal. Spontaneous emission degrades coherence in the localization, and prolongs the jumps.</p>

            <p>Parametrized quantum circuits are essential components of variational quantum algorithms. Until now, optical implementations of these circuits have relied solely on adjustable linear optical units. In this study, we demonstrate that using programmable nonlinearities, rather than linear optics, offers a more efficient method for constructing quantum optical circuits -- especially quantum neural networks. This approach significantly reduces the number of adjustable parameters and the circuit depth needed to achieve high-fidelity operation. Specifically, we explored a quantum optical neural network (QONN) architecture composed of meshes of two-mode interferometers programmable by adjustable Kerr-like nonlinearities. We assessed the capabilities of our quantum optical neural network architecture and compared its performance to previously studied architectures that use multimode linear optics units. Additionally, we suggest future research directions for improving programmable quantum optical circuits.</p>

            <h2>Gate Efficient Composition of Hamiltonian Simulation and Block-Encoding with its Application on HUBO, Chemistry and Finite Difference Method</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robin Ollive, Stephane Louise</p>
            <p>This article proposes a formalism which unifies Hamiltonian simulation techniques from different fields. This formalism leads to a competitive method to construct the Hamiltonian simulation with a comprehensible, simple-to-implement circuit generation technique. It leads to a gate decomposition and a scaling different from the usual strategy based on a Linear Combination of Unitaries (LCU) reformulation of the problem. It can significantly reduce the quantum circuit number of rotational gates, multi-qubit gates, and the circuit depth. This method leads to one exact Hamiltonian simulation for each summed term and Trotter step. Each of these Hamiltonian simulation unitary matrices also allows the construction of the non-exponential terms with a maximum of six unitary matrices to be Block-encoding (BE). The formalism is easy to apply to the widely studied Highorder Unconstrained Binary Optimization (HUBO), fermionic transition Hamiltonian, and basic finite difference method instances. For the HUBO, our implementation exponentially reduces the number of gates for high-order cost functions with respect to the HUBO order. The individual electronic transitions are implemented without error for the second-quantization Fermionic Hamiltonian. Finite difference proposed matrix decompositions are straightforward, very versatile, and scale as the state-of-the-art proposals.</p>

            <h2>Engineering propagating cat states with driving-assisted cavity QED</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seigo Kikura, Hayato Goto, Takao Aoki</p>
            <p>We propose a method for generating optical cat states in propagating pulses based on cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED). This scheme uses multiple four-level systems (4LSs) inside an optical cavity as a light source. Time-modulating driving stimulates it to produce a superposition of coherent states entangled with the 4LSs. The postselection of an appropriate state of the 4LSs leads to a multicomponent cat state in a propagating pulse. Taking atomic decay and cavity loss into account, we optimize the cavity external loss rate to maximize the fidelity. We find that its optimum value is formulated similarly to those of other generation methods for propagating states, suggesting a universal property of cavity-QED systems interacting with fields outside the cavity.</p>

            <p>We investigate unitary and state $t$-designs from a computational complexity perspective. First, we address the problems of computing frame potentials that characterize (approximate) $t$-designs. We present a quantum algorithm for computing frame potentials and establish the following: (1) exact computation can be achieved by a single query to a $\# \textsf{P}$-oracle and is $\# \textsf{P}$-hard; (2) for state vectors, deciding whether the frame potential is larger than or smaller than certain values is $\textsf{BQP}$-complete, provided the promise gap between the two values is inverse-polynomial in the number of qubits; and (3) for both state vectors and unitaries, this promise problem is $\textsf{PP}$-complete if the promise gap is exponentially small. Second, we address the promise problems of determining whether a given set is a good or bad approximation to a $t$-design. We show that this problem is in $\textsf{PP}$ for any constant $t$ and is $\textsf{PP}$-hard for $t=1,2$ and $3$. Remarkably, this remains true even when the set is promised to be either exponentially close to or no closer than a constant to a $1$-design, particularly illustrating that, while unitary and state designs are powerful information resources, it is inherently hard to determine their properties. We further identify the implications of our results across diverse areas, including variational methods for constructing designs, diagnosing quantum chaos through out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), and exploring emergent designs in Hamiltonian systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yun-Chih Liao, Ben J. Powell, Thomas M. Stace</p>
            <p>Superconducting circuit quantisation conventionally starts from classical Euler-Lagrange circuit equations-of-motion. Invoking the correspondence principle yields a canonically quantised circuit description of circuit dynamics over a bosonic Hilbert space. This process has been very successful for describing experiments, but implicitly starts from the classical Ginsberg-Landau (GL) mean field theory for the circuit. Here we employ a different approach which starts from a microscopic fermionic Hamiltonian for interacting electrons, whose ground space is described by the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) many-body wavefuction that underpins conventional superconductivity. We introduce the BCS ground-space as a subspace of the full fermionic Hilbert space, and show that projecting the electronic Hamiltonian onto this subspace yields the standard Hamiltonian terms for Josephson junctions, capacitors and inductors, from which standard quantised circuit models follow. Importantly, this approach does not assume a spontaneously broken symmetry, which is important for quantised circuits that support superpositions of phases, and the phase-charge canonical commutation relations are derived from the underlying fermionic commutation properties, rather than imposed. By expanding the projective subspace, this approach can be extended to describe phenomena outside the BCS ground space, including quasiparticle excitations.</p>

            <p>We numerically benchmark 30 optimisers on 372 instances of the variational quantum eigensolver for solving the Fermi-Hubbard system with the Hamiltonian variational ansatz. We rank the optimisers with respect to metrics such as final energy achieved and function calls needed to get within a certain tolerance level, and find that the best performing optimisers are variants of gradient descent such as Momentum and ADAM (using finite difference), SPSA, CMAES, and BayesMGD. We also perform gradient analysis and observe that the step size for finite difference has a very significant impact. We also consider using simultaneous perturbation (inspired by SPSA) as a gradient subroutine: here finite difference can lead to a more precise estimate of the ground state but uses more calls, whereas simultaneous perturbation can converge quicker but may be less precise in the later stages. Finally, we also study the quantum natural gradient algorithm: we implement this method for 1-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard systems, and find that whilst it can reach a lower energy with fewer iterations, this improvement is typically lost when taking total function calls into account. Our method involves performing careful hyperparameter sweeping on 4 instances. We present a variety of analysis and figures, detailed optimiser notes, and discuss future directions.</p>

            <p>Within the framework of the rigorous quantum theory of the atomic photoeffect and the scenario of photoemission from a crystal as an inverse LEED process, pulsed photoemission from a flat thin-film photoemitter formed by a double quantum well on a dielectric substrate is investigated. The spatiotemporal dependences of the charge and current densities are calculated using the density matrix method. Asymptotic estimates are made in terms of the evolution of wave packets and the concepts of the extreme phase and fastest descent. The possibility of generating charge and current density waves as a result of the population and decay of quasi-stationary states of a doublet of a double quantum well under photoexcitation of electrons in conducting layers from inside this well is shown. For comparison, calculations were made for photoemission from a metal film on a substrate without a heterostructure: the double-well heterostructure increases, stabilizes, and extends the photocurrent pulse. A comparison of the contributions of the outgoing and incoming waves of the inverse LEED problem is made, and the relative smallness of the contribution of the incoming wave is quantitatively demonstrated</p>

            <p>The quantization of an optical field is a frontier in quantum optics with implications for both fundamental science and technological applications. Here, we demonstrate that a dinickel complex (Ni$_2$) traps and quantizes classical visible light, behaving as an individual quantum system or the Jaynes Cummings this http URL composite system forms through coherently coupling the two level NiNi charge transfer transition with the local scattering field, which produces nonclassical light featuring photon anti bunching and squeezed states, as verified by a sequence of discrete photonic modes in the incoherent resonance fluorescence. Notably, in this Ni$_2$ system, the collective coupling of N molecule ensembles scales as N, distinct from the Tavis-Cummings model, which allows easy achievement of ultrastrong coupling. This is exemplified by a vacuum Rabi splitting of 1.2 eV at the resonance (3.25 eV) and a normalized coupling rate of 0.18 for the N = 4 ensemble. The resulting quantum light of single photonic modes enables driving the molecule field interaction in cavity free solution, which profoundly modifies the electronic states. Our results establish Ni$_2$ as a robust platform for quantum optical phenomena under ambient conditions, offering new pathways for molecular physics, polaritonic chemistry and quantum information processing.</p>

            <p>Graph states are the key resources for measurement- and fusion-based quantum computing with photons, yet their creation is experimentally challenging. We optimize a hybrid graph-state generation scheme using a single quantum emitter and linear optics Bell-state measurements, called fusions. We first generate a restricted class of states from a single quantum emitter and then apply fusions to create a target graph state, where we use a dynamic programming approach to find the construction that requires the lowest possible number of fusions. Our analysis yields a lookup table for constructing $\sim 2.8\times 10^7$ non-isomorphic graph states with the minimum number of fusions. The lookup table covers all graph states with up to eight qubits and several other ones with up to 14 qubits. We present construction protocols of selected graph states and provide the lookup table. For large graph states that are not in the lookup table, we derive bounds for the required number of fusions using graph-theoretic properties. Finally, we use the lookup table to search for the best graph codes for loss-tolerant encodings, given a fixed number of fusions for their construction.</p>

            <p>Magnon blockade is a fundamental quantum phenomenon for generating single-magnon state, which gradually becomes one of the candidates for quantum information processing. In this paper, we propose a theoretical scheme to generate the magnon blockade in a hybrid system consisting of a YIG micromagnet and a skyrmion. Considering weak probing of the magnon and driving of the skyrmion qubit, the second-order correlation function is analytically derived, and the optimal condition for realizing the magnon blockade is identified. Under the optimal condition, we systematically analyze the behavior of the second-order correlation function $g^{(2)}(0)$ under different parameter regimes. Our analysis shows that with appropriate driving and probing field intensities, the magnon blockade effect can be significantly enhanced, effectively suppressing multi-magnon states and facilitating the generation of high-purity single-magnon states exhibiting pronounced antibunching. Furthermore, we explore the physical mechanisms underlying the magnon blockade, revealing the coexistence and interplay of conventional and unconventional magnon blockade. This scheme provides a versatile all-magnetic platform for generating high purity single-magnon sources.</p>

            <p>Non-equilibrium spin-chain systems have been attracting increasing interest in energy transport. This work studies a one-dimensional non-equilibrium Ising chain immersed in a tilted magnetic field, every spin contacts a Boson reservoir with the dissipative system-environment interaction. We analytically investigate the dynamics and the steady-state energy transport taking advantage of the Born-Markov-secular master equation. In the longitudinal field, one can find that the non dissipative $N^\prime$ spins decompose the spin chain into $N^\prime +1$ independent subchains and block the heat currents from the hot end to the cool end. Moreover, for the non-dissipative $\mu$th spin, its nearest two bulk spins become the nodal spins in the subchains and have the corresponding energy correction of $\pm J_{\mu-1,\mu}$ and $\pm J_{\mu,\mu+1}$ depending on the excited/ground state of the $\mu$th spin. Therefore, a magnetically controlled heat modulator can be designed by adjusting the direction of the magnetic field in which the non-dissipative spin is located. For the transverse field case, the whole Hilbert space of the chain can always be divided into two independent subspaces regardless of whether the bulk spin is dissipative. This work provides new insight into the dynamics and energy transport of the dissipative Ising model.</p>

            <p>The debate whether the von Neumann (VN) entropy is a suitable quantum version of the thermodynamic (TH) entropy has a long history. In this regard, we briefly review some of the main reservations about the VN entropy and explain that the objections about its time-invariance and subadditivity properties can be addressed convincingly. In a broader context, we here analyze in detail whether and when the VN entropy is the same or equivalent to the TH entropy. We find that the VN entropy of a large isolated system is equivalent to its TH entropy if the system is in a mixed state described by a microcanonical (MC) ensemble. This equivalence also holds for open system and subsystem if the full system (i.e. system-bath or subsystem-bath combination) is in a mixed state described by an MC ensemble or in a {\it typical} pure state (or if the {\it Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis}, {\it ETH}, holds for the full system). Unlike isolated and open system, demonstrating the equivalence for a subsystem is not straightforward. We take a one-dimensional spin-1/2 model to numerically show that, if the full system is in a pure state, then the VN entropy of a subsystem is equivalent to its TH entropy if the {\it ETH} holds for the full system. We also demonstrate that this equivalence always works (irrespective of whether the {\it ETH} holds) if the full system is in a mixed state describe by an MC ensemble.</p>

            <h2>Empirical Coordination of Separable Quantum Correlations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Husein Natur, Uzi Pereg</p>
            <p>We introduce the notion of empirical coordination for quantum correlations. Quantum mechanics enables the calculation of probabilities for experimental outcomes, emphasizing statistical averages rather than detailed descriptions of individual events. Empirical coordination is thus a natural framework for quantum systems. Focusing on the cascade network, the optimal coordination rates are established, indicating the minimal resources required to simulate on average a quantum state. As we consider a network with classical communication links, superposition cannot be maintained, hence the quantum correlations are separable (i.e., a convex combination of product states). This precludes entanglement. Providing the users with shared randomness, before communication begins, does not affect the optimal rates for empirical coordination. We begin with a rate characterization for a basic two-node network, and then generalize to a cascade network. The special case of a network with an isolated node is considered as well. The results can be further generalized to other networks as our analysis includes a generic achievability scheme. The optimal rate formula involves optimization over a collection of state extensions. This is a unique feature of the quantum setting, as the classical parallel does not include optimization. As demonstrated through examples, the performance depends heavily on the choice of decomposition. We further discuss the consequences of our results for quantum cooperative games.</p>

            <p>Qudits, generalizations of qubits to multi-level quantum systems, offer enhanced computational efficiency by encoding more information per lattice cell, avoiding costly swap operations and providing even exponential speedup in some cases. Utilizing the $d$-level manifold, however, requires high-speed gate operations because of the stronger decoherence at higher levels. While analytical control methods have proven effective for qubits in achieving fast gates with minimal control errors, their extension to qudits is nontrivial due to the increased complexity of the energy level structure arising from additional ancillary states. In this work, we present a universal pulse construction for generating rapid, high-fidelity unitary rotations between adjacent qudit levels, thereby providing a prescription for any gate in $SU(d)$. Control errors in these operations are effectively analyzed within a four-level subspace, including two leakage levels with approximately opposite detuning. By identifying the optimal degrees of freedom, we derive concise analytical pulse schemes that suppress multiple control errors and outperform existing methods. Remarkably, our approach achieves consistent coherent error scaling across all levels, approaching the quantum speed limit independently of parameter variations between levels. Validation on transmon circuits demonstrates significant improvements in gate fidelity for various qudit sizes aiming for $10^{-4}$ error. This method provides a scalable solution for improving qudit control and can be broadly applied to other quantum systems with ladder structures or operations involving multiple ancillary levels.</p>

We examine the point-spectrum and approximate-spectrum of the evolution operator $\mathsf{W}^{(\nu)}$ and obtain their representations in terms of the coin operator system of the model. We show that the point-spectrum and approximate-spectrum of $\mathsf{W}^{(\nu)}$ are completely independent of the magnetic potential $\nu$ although $\mathsf{W}^{(\nu)}$ itself is dependent of the magnetic potential $\nu$. Our work might suggest that a quantum walk perturbed by a magnetic field can have spectral stability with respect to the magnetic potential.</p>

We show that at any temperature, the Lindbladian spectral gap for even parity observables is lower bounded by a constant that is independent of the system size, when the interaction strength (e.g., the on-site interaction strength for the Fermi-Hubbard model) is below a constant threshold, which is also independent of the system size. This leads to a mixing time estimate that is at most linear in the system size, thus showing that the corresponding Gibbs states can be prepared efficiently on quantum computers.</p>

            <h2>Efficient Sampling for Pauli Measurement-Based Shadow Tomography in Direct Fidelity Estimation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hyunho Cha, Jungwoo Lee</p>
            <p>A constant number of random Clifford measurements allows the classical shadow protocol to perform Direct Fidelity Estimation (DFE) with high precision. However, estimating properties of an unknown quantum state is expected to be more feasible with random Pauli measurements than with random Clifford measurements in the near future. Inspired by the importance sampling technique applied to sampling Pauli measurements for DFE, we show that similar strategies can be derived from classical shadows. Specifically, we describe efficient methods using Pauli measurements to perform DFE with GHZ and W states, establishing tighter bounds ($\approx \times 14.22$ for GHZ, $\approx \times 16$ for W) on the number of measurements required for desired precision.</p>

            <h2>Quantum entanglement as an extremal Kirkwood-Dirac nonreality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Agung Budiyono</p>
            <p>Understanding the relationship between various different forms of nonclassicality and their resource character is of great importance in quantum foundation and quantum information. Here, we discuss a quantitative link between quantum entanglement and the anomalous or nonclassical nonreal values of Kirkwood-Dirac (KD) quasiprobability, in a bipartite setting. We first construct an entanglement monotone for a pure bipartite state based on the nonreality of the KD quasiprobability defined over a pair of orthonormal bases in which one of them is a product, and optimizations over these bases. It admits a closed expression as a Schur-concave function of the state of the subsystem having a form of nonadditive quantum entropy. We then construct a bipartite entanglement monotone for generic quantum states using the convex roof extension. Its normalized value is upper bounded by the concurrence of formation, and for two-qubit systems, they are equal. We also derive lower and upper bounds in terms of different forms of uncertainty in the subsystem quantified respectively by an extremal trace-norm asymmetry and a nonadditive quantum entropy. The entanglement monotone can be expressed as the minimum total state disturbance due to a nonselective local binary measurement. Finally, we discuss its estimation using weak value measurement and classical optimization, and its connection with strange weak value and quantum contextuality.</p>

            <h2>Entropy flow in a parametric amplifier</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sergei Khlebnikov</p>
            <p>Computations of entropy in thermodynamics rely on discreteness of the spectra of the subsystems. We argue that, for cases with continuous spectra (typically, radiation), there is a useful definition of entropy flow based on discretizing the signal into Gabor's "atoms," say, by means of a windowed Fourier transform. In particular, applying this method to a parametric amplifier (paramp) driven by a classical pump and coupled to a zero-temperature Markovian bath, we find that the output entropy flux vanishes at large times, even though the energy and photon number fluxes remain nonzero. This is consistent with the manner in which the paramp is expected to release information about its initial state. We relate the quenching of the entropy flow to development of the off-diagonal coherences in the output and discuss possible relevance of this mechanism to the black-hole information problem. We also propose to use measurements of the off-diagonal coherences as a means of extracting the rates at which high-entropy subsystems release information to Gaussian environments.</p>

            <p>We investigate the entanglement of a ladder of spins formed by two sublattices, a ''cluster'' chain and the ''environment'', consisting of independent spins, both coupled by an exchange interaction and evolving under a unitary discrete time dynamics. The automaton is defined by the composition of the two body spin swap gate (between sublattices) and the three body cluster interaction. We observe that, depending on the set of coupling constants, the cluster subsystem evolves towards states corresponding to different entanglement phases. In the weak coupling regime the subsystem remains near the topological cluster state. Increasing the coupling strength leads to random states which transform from almost pure to fully mixed, according to the effective number of the environment active degrees of freedom.</p>

This more efficient encoding, together with zero noise extrapolation techniques, is shown to improve the fidelity of the simulated energies with respect to exact solutions.</p>

            <p>We present a general non-perturbative method to determine the exact perturbed steady state of open quantum systems, in terms of the eigenmodes of the unperturbed system. The perturbation may be time-independent or periodic, and of arbitrarily large amplitude. Using a generalized inverse and two diagonalizations, we construct an operator that generates the entire dependence of the steady state on the perturbation parameter. The approach also enables exact analytic operations-such as differentiation, integration, and ensemble averaging-with respect to the parameter, even when the steady state is computed numerically. We apply the method to three non-trivial open quantum systems, showing that it achieves exact results, with a computational speedup for calculations requiring large sampling, such as ensemble averaging, compared to sampling-based approaches.</p>

            <p>Periodically driving a quantum many-body system can drastically change its properties, leading to exotic non-equilibrium states of matter without a static analog. In this scenario, parametric resonances and the complexity of an interacting many-body system are pivotal in establishing non-equilibrium states. We report on a Floquet-engineered transverse field Ising model for the controlled propagation in one dimension of spin waves. The underlying mechanisms behind our proposal rely on high-frequency drivings using characteristic parametric resonances of the spin lattice. Many-body resonances modulating spin-sping exchange or individual spin gaps inhibit interactions between spins thus proving a mechanism for controlling spin-wave propagation and a quantum switch. Our schemes may have applications in coupling-decoupling schemes for system-reservoir interaction, and routing in quantum networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Longwen Zhou, Rongtao Wang, Jiaxin Pan</p>
            <p>Higher-order topological phases (HOTPs) possess localized and symmetry-protected eigenmodes at corners and along hinges in two and three dimensional lattices. The numbers of these topological boundary modes will undergo quantized changes at the critical points between different HOTPs. In this work, we reveal unique higher-order topology induced by time-periodic driving at the critical points of topological phase transitions, which has no equilibrium counterparts and also goes beyond the description of gapped topological matter. Using an alternately coupled Creutz ladder and its Floquet-driven descendants as illustrative examples, we analytically characterize and numerically demonstrate the zero and $\pi$ corner modes that could emerge at the critical points between different Floquet HOTPs. Moreover, we propose a unified scheme of bulk-corner correspondence for both gapless and gapped Floquet HOTPs protected by chiral symmetry in two dimensions. Our work reveals the possibility of corner modes surviving topological transitions in Floquet systems and initializes the study of higher-order Floquet topology at quantum criticality.</p>

            <p>Distinguishing resource states from resource-free states is a fundamental task in quantum information. We have approached the state detection problem through a hypothesis testing framework, with the alternative hypothesis set comprising resource-free states in a general context. Consequently, we derived the optimal exponential decay rate of the failure probability for detecting a given $n$-tensor product state when the resource-free states are separable states, positive partial transpose (PPT) states, or the convex hull of the set of stabilizer states. This optimal exponential decay rate is determined by the minimum of the reverse relative entropy, indicating that this minimum value serves as the general detectability measure. The key technique of this paper is a quantum version of empirical distribution.</p>

            <p>Macroscopic entanglement, as critical quantum resources in quantum information science, has been extensively studied in optomechanical systems with purely dispersive coupling over the past decades. However, quantum entanglement, induced by purely dissipative coupling, remains unexplored. In this work, we study quantum entanglement in a Michelson-Sagnac interferometer, where the dispersive and the dissipative coupling can be arbitrarily switched on and off. With current experimental parameters, we demonstrate that the steady-state mechanical displacement exhibits a nonlinear (linear) dependence on the driving power with the purely dispersive (dissipative) coupling. Further, we find that quantum entanglement generated by purely dissipative coupling is significantly stronger and more noise-tolerant than that generated by purely dispersive coupling. When both couplings coexist, entanglement is weakened due to interference. Our findings provide a promising path to engineer strong and noise-tolerant quantum entanglement in purely dissipative quantum systems.</p>

            <p>Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) theoretically provides information-theoretic security based on physical laws. However, imperfections in practice lead to the possibility of quantum hacking on the QKD implementation, especially the passive attacks that are difficult to be detected. In this paper, we study experimentally and theoretically the upper limit of a backflash attack, as one of the vital passive attacks, on a fiber-based QKD system. We experimentally demonstrate the backflash attack on a full equipped fiber-based QKD receiver to show its feasibility and limited distinguish ratio of decoding. More importantly, we have developed a simulation model to analyze the maximum distinguish ratio of decoding can be achieved considering the wide-spectrum feature of backflash photons, which indicates that Eve can extract effective key information from 95.7% of the backflash photons. Consequently, the secure key rate of the decoy-state BB84 QKD system under backflash attack is calculated. This work provides a general methodology to comprehensively evaluate the effect of the backflash attack on a QKD system.</p>

            <p>Magneto-nonlinear Hall effect is known to be intrinsic and requires time-reversal symmetry. Here we show that a new type of magneto-nonlinear Hall effect can occur in the time-reversal breaking materials within the second-order response to in-plane electric and vertical magnetic fields. Such a Hall response is generated by the oscillation of the electromagnetic field and has a quantum origin arising from a geometric quantity associated with the Berry curvature and band velocity. We demonstrate that the massive Dirac model of LaAlO3/LaNiO3/LaAlO3 quantum well can be used to detect this Hall effect. Our work widens the theory of the Hall effect in the time-reversal breaking system by proposing a new kind of nonlinear electromagnetic response.</p>

Using this construction we study the problem of communication over authenticated classical-quantum channels and derive its capacity. As another application of our construction, we also study the problem of quantum asymmetric composite hypothesis testing.</p>

            <p>As scientists living through a climate emergency, we have a responsibility to lead by example, or to at least be consistent with our understanding of the problem. This common goal of reducing the carbon footprint of our work can be approached through a variety of strategies. For theoreticians, this includes not only optimizing algorithms and improving computational efficiency but also adopting a frugal approach to modeling. Here we present and critically illustrate this principle. First, we compare two models of very different level of sophistication which nevertheless yield the same qualitative agreement with an experiment involving electric manipulation of molecular spin qubits while presenting a difference in cost of $>4$ orders of magnitude. As a second stage, an already minimalistic model of the potential use of single-ion magnets to implement a network of probabilistic p-bits, programmed in two different programming languages, is shown to present a difference in cost of a factor of $\simeq 50$. In both examples, the computationally expensive version of the model was the one that was published. As a community, we still have a lot of room for improvement in this direction.</p>

            <p>We introduce two disorder-free variants of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, demonstrate their integrability, and study their static and dynamical properties. Unlike diagrammatic techniques, the integrability of these models allows us to obtain dynamical correlation functions even when the number of Majorana fermions is finite. From the solutions, we find that out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) in these models exhibit exponential growth at early times, resembling that of quantum chaotic systems, such as those with disorder or external kick terms, despite their large $N$ behavior differing from that of typical chaotic systems. Conversely, our analysis shows no evidence of random-matrix behavior in level statistics or the spectral form factor. Our findings illustrate that the clean versions of the SYK models represent simple but nontrivial examples of disorder-free quantum many-body systems displaying chaos-like behavior of OTOCs.</p>

As an intermediate step, we prove that a unital completely positive map between finite-dimensional C*-algebras is a homomorphism if and only if its adjusted Choi operator is a projection. Both equivalences generalize familiar facts about stochastic maps between finite sets.</p>

            <h2>Neural network based deep learning analysis of semiconductor quantum dot qubits for automated control</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jacob R. Taylor, Sankar Das Sarma</p>
            <p>Machine learning offers a largely unexplored avenue for improving noisy disordered devices in physics using automated algorithms. Through simulations that include disorder in physical devices, particularly quantum devices, there is potential to learn about disordered landscapes and subsequently tune devices based on those insights. In this work, we introduce a novel methodology that employs machine learning, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to discern the disorder landscape in the parameters of the disordered extended Hubbard model underlying the semiconductor quantum dot spin qubit architectures. This technique takes advantage of experimentally obtainable charge stability diagrams from neighboring quantum dot pairs, enabling the CNN to accurately identify disorder in each parameter of the extended Hubbard model. Remarkably, our CNN can process site-specific disorder in Hubbard parameters, including variations in hopping constants, on-site potentials (gate voltages), and both intra-site and inter-site Coulomb terms. This advancement facilitates the prediction of spatially dependent disorder across all parameters simultaneously with high accuracy ($R^2>0.994$) and fewer parameter constraints, marking a significant improvement over previous methods that were focused only on analyzing on-site potentials at low coupling. Furthermore, our approach allows for the tuning of five or more quantum dots at a time, effectively addressing the often-overlooked issue of crosstalk. Not only does our method streamline the tuning process, potentially enabling fully automated adjustments, but it also introduces a "no trust" verification method to rigorously validate the neural network's predictions. Ultimately, this work aims to lay the groundwork for generalizing our method to tackle a broad spectrum of physical problems.</p>

            <p>In this work, improvements are introduced into the current models of the ideal Fermi gas and the ideal Bose gas by incorporating the quantum nature of phase space, directly linked to the uncertainty principle. These improved models leverage the recently developed concepts of quantum phase space and phase space representation of quantum mechanics. The Hamiltonian operator for a gas particle and its eigenstates are first determined, and quantum statistical mechanics is used to derive the thermodynamic properties of the ideal gas.  Analytic expressions for thermodynamic quantities - including the grand canonical potential, particle number, internal energy, Von Neumann entropy, and pressure are derived, alongside the corresponding thermodynamic equations of state for both bosons and fermions. These corrections are particularly significant at low temperatures and in confined volumes, where quantum effects such as shape and size become prominent. The results also establish a direct link between thermodynamic functions and the quantum statistical variances of momenta.  Importantly, the improved models recover well-known classical relations of the ideal gas in the high-temperature and large-volume limits, ensuring consistency with classical physics. By addressing quantum corrections and their thermodynamic implications, this work provides a foundation for further applications in nanoscale systems, quantum gases, low-temperature physics, utra-cold physics and astrophysics.</p>

            <h2>Second-Order Moment Quantum Fluctuations and Quantum Equivalence Principle</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M.J.Luo</p>
            <p>The second-order moment quantum fluctuations or uncertainties are mass-dependent, and the incompatibility between the quantum uncertainty principle and the equivalence principle is at the second-order moment (variation) level, but not the first-order moment (mean) level. To reconcile the two fundamental principles, we find that the second-order moment quantum fluctuations are actually distinguished into two parts: a dynamic part and a geometric part. The dynamic part is indeed mass-dependent and governed by a non-zero Hamiltonian in a non-general-covariant inertial frame, and the geometric part is mass-independent and comes from coarse-graining and/or geometric effects. The dynamic part is coordinate dependent, it can be canceled away by a coordinate transformation, and hence it plays no role in general covariant theories whose Hamiltonian automatically vanishes. However, the geometric part is valid for general coordinate, and it can not be eliminated by a coordinate transformation. On the contrary, the geometric part of second-order moment fluctuation of quantum spacetime leads to coordinate transformation anomaly, which induces an effective Einstein's gravity theory. The geometric part is mass-independent and universal, so it is only this part measures the universal second-order moment quantum fluctuation of the spacetime, while the dynamic part plays no role in the general covariant description. The observation generalizes the classical equivalence principle to the quantum level. And according to the principle, a general covariant theory with only geometric part quantum fluctuation, i.e. a non-linear sigma model, is proposed as a theory of a material quantum reference frame system. The effects of the universal second-order moment quantum fluctuations in the material quantum reference system and its implications to an effective gravity theory are also discussed.</p>

            <p>In approximate ground states obtained from imaginary-time evolution, the spectrum of the state -- its decomposition into exact energy eigenstates -- falls off exponentially with the energy. Here we consider the energy spectra of approximate matrix product ground states, such as those obtained with the density matrix renormalization group. Despite the high accuracy of these states, contributions to the spectra are roughly constant out to surprisingly high energy, with an increase in the bond dimension reducing the amplitude but not the extent of these high-energy tails. The unusual spectra appear to be a general feature of compressed wavefunctions, independent of boundary or dimensionality, and are also observed in neural network wavefunctions. The unusual spectra can have a strong effect on sampling-based methods, yielding large fluctuations. The energy variance, which can be used to extrapolate observables to eliminate truncation error, is subject to these large fluctuations when sampled. Nevertheless, we devise a sampling-based variance approach which gives excellent and efficient extrapolations.</p>

            <p>The Rydberg atomic quantum receivers (RAQR) are emerging quantum precision sensing platforms designed for receiving radio frequency (RF) signals. It relies on creation of Rydberg atoms from normal atoms by exciting one or more electrons to a very high energy level, thereby making the atom sensitive to RF signals. RAQRs realize RF-to-optical conversions based on light-atom interactions relying on the so called electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) and Aulter-Townes splitting (ATS), so that the desired RF signal can be read out optically. The large dipole moments of Rydberg atoms associated with rich choices of Rydberg states and various modulation schemes facilitate an ultra-high sensitivity ($\sim$ nV/cm/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$) and an ultra-broadband tunability (direct-current to Terahertz). RAQRs also exhibit compelling scalability and lend themselves to the construction of innovative, compact receivers. Initial experimental studies have demonstrated their capabilities in classical wireless communications and sensing. To fully harness their potential in a wide variety of applications, we commence by outlining the underlying fundamentals of Rydberg atoms, followed by the principles and schemes of RAQRs. Then, we overview the state-of-the-art studies from both physics and communication societies. Furthermore, we conceive Rydberg atomic quantum single-input single-output (RAQ-SISO) and multiple-input multiple-output (RAQ-MIMO) schemes for facilitating the integration of RAQRs with classical wireless systems.

            <p>We propose an explicit algorithm based on the Linear Combination of Hamiltonian Simulations technique to simulate both the advection-diffusion equation and a nonunitary discretized version of the Koopman-von Neumann formulation of nonlinear dynamics. By including dissipation into the model, through an upwind discretization of the advection operator, we avoid spurious parasitic oscillations which usually accompany standard finite difference discretizations of the advection equation. In contrast to prior works on quantum simulation of nonlinear problems, we explain in detail how different components of the algorithm can be implemented by using the Quantum Signal Processing (QSP) and Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) methods. In addition, we discuss the general method for implementing the block-encoding (BE) required for QSP and QSVT circuits and provide explicit implementations of the BE oracles tailored to our specific test cases. We simulate the resulting circuit on a digital emulator of quantum fault-tolerant computers and investigate its complexity and success probability. The proposed algorithm is universal and can be used for modeling a broad class of linear and nonlinear differential equations including the KvN and Carleman embeddings of nonlinear systems, the semiclassical Koopman-van Hove (KvH) equation, as well as the advection and Liouville equations.</p>

            <p>Dualities play a central role in the study of quantum spin chains, providing insight into the structure of quantum phase diagrams and phase transitions. In this work we study categorical dualities, which are defined as bounded-spread isomorphisms between algebras of symmetry-respecting local operators on a spin chain. We consider generalized global symmetries that correspond to unitary fusion categories, which are represented by matrix-product operator algebras. A fundamental question about dualities is whether they can be extended to quantum cellular automata on the larger algebra generated by all local operators that respect the unit matrix-product operator. For conventional global symmetries, which are on-site representations of finite groups, this larger algebra is simply the tensor product of algebras associated to individual spins in the chain. We present a solution to the extension problem using the machinery of Doplicher-Haag-Roberts bimodules. Our solution provides a crisp categorical criterion for when an extension of a duality exists. We show that the set of possible extensions form a torsor over the invertible objects in the relevant symmetry category. As a corollary, we obtain a classification result concerning dualities in the group case.</p>

            <p>We provide a complete classification of the integrability and nonintegrability of the spin-1 bilinear-biquadratic model with a uniaxial anisotropic field, which includes the Heisenberg model and the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki model. It is rigorously shown that all systems, except for the known integrable systems, are nonintegrable, meaning that they do not have nontrivial local conserved quantities. In particular, this result guarantees the nonintegrability of the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki model, which is a fundamental assumption for quantum many-body scarring. Furthermore, we give simple necessary conditions for integrability in an extended model of the bilinear-biquadratic model with anisotropic interactions. Our result has accomplished a breakthrough in nonintegrability proofs by expanding their scope to spin-1 systems.</p>

            <h2>Probing nonlocal correlations in magnetic rare-earth clusters</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David W. Facemyer, Sergio E. Ulloa</p>
            <p>Understanding and quantifying entanglement entropy is crucial to characterize the quantum behaviors that drive phenomena in a variety of systems. Rare-earth spin complexes, with their unique magnetic properties, provide fertile ground for exploring these nonlocal correlations. In this work, we study Eu$^{2+}$ ions deposited on a Au(111) substrate, modeling finite clusters of large spin-moments using a Heisenberg Hamiltonian parameterized by first-principles calculations. Our analysis reveals a one-to-one correspondence between structures in the differential conductance profiles and changes in the von Neumann entanglement entropy of bipartite subsystems, influenced by probe-ion separation and applied magnetic fields. Distinct braiding patterns in the conductance profiles are shown to correspond to stepwise changes in the entanglement entropy, providing a new avenue for investigating quantum correlations. These results establish a foundation for experimentally probing and controlling entanglement in lanthanide-based systems, with potential applications in quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>We report the experimental super-resolution of pairs of point-like fluorescent sources using a modified image inversion interferometer microscope. The technique is inspired by recent developments in the application of quantum parameter estimation theory to semiclassical imaging problems. We find that the image inversion technique requires special polarization filtering to account for the dipolar nature of the emission. Using an azimuthal polarizer, we obtain improvements in the Fisher information of point-source separation by over an order of magnitude relative to direct imaging. Unlike established super-resolution fluorescence techniques, the method does not require sequential photoswitching/blinking of the fluorophores, and thus could facilitate significant speed-ups for certain biological imaging/tracking tasks.</p>

            <p>Exceptional points (EPs) has seen substantial advances in both experiment and theory. However, in quantum systems, higher-order exceptional points remain of great interest and possess numerous intriguing properties yet to be fully explored. Here, we describe a \emph{PT} symmetry-protected three-level non-Hermitian system with the dissipative spin-orbit-coupled (SOC) fermions in which a third-order exceptional point (EP3) emerges when both the eigenvalues and eigenstates of the system collapse into one. The band structure and its spin dynamics are explored for $^{173}$Yb fermions. We highlight the enhanced sensitivity to the external perturbation of EP3 with cubic-root energy dispersion. Additionally, we investigate the second-order exceptional point (EP2) with square-root energy dispersion in a three-level quantum system with the absence of parity symmetry, which proves that the enhanced sensitivity closely relates to the symmetries of the NH system. Furthermore, we analyze the encircling behavior of EP3 in terms of the adiabatic limit and the nonadiabatic dynamics and discover some different results from that of EP2.</p>

            <h2>A Simplification Method for Inequality Constraints in Integer Binary Encoding HOBO Formulations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuichiro Minato</p>
            <p>This study proposes a novel method for simplifying inequality constraints in Higher-Order Binary Optimization (HOBO) formulations. The proposed method addresses challenges associated with Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulations, specifically the increased computational complexity and reduced solution accuracy caused by the introduction of slack variables and the resulting growth in auxiliary qubits. By efficiently integrating constraints, the method enhances the computational efficiency and accuracy of both quantum and classical solvers. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through numerical experiments applied to combinatorial optimization problems. The results indicate that this method expands the applicability of quantum algorithms to high-dimensional problems and improves the practicality of classical optimization solvers for optimization problems involving inequality constraints.</p>

            <p>Stark Many-Body Localization (MBL) is a phenomenon observed in quantum systems in the absence of disorder, where the presence of a linear potential, known as the Stark field, causes the localization. Our study aims to provide novel insight into the properties of Stark MBL and to discover unique entanglement characteristics specific to this phenomenon. The phase diagram analysis reveals different behavior with varying interaction strengths. Furthermore, we highlight the influence of domain wall structures on the breakdown of the entanglement entropy of the system. Moreover, the investigation of Out-of-Time-Ordered Correlator (OTOC) behavior demonstrates distinct responses to interactions based on domain wall configurations. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of Stark MBL and offer valuable insights into the entanglement properties of systems subjected to Stark potentials.</p>

            <p>The negatively charged tin-vacancy (SnV-) center in diamond has emerged as a promising platform for quantum computing and quantum networks. To connect SnV- qubits in large networks, in-situ tuning and stabilization of their optical transitions are essential to overcome static and dynamic frequency offsets induced by the local environment. Here we report on the large-range optical frequency tuning of diamond SnV- centers using micro-electro-mechanically mediated strain control in photonic integrated waveguide devices. We realize a tuning range of >40 GHz, covering a major part of the inhomogeneous distribution. In addition, we employ real-time feedback on the strain environment to stabilize the resonant frequency and mitigate spectral wandering. These results provide a path for on-chip scaling of diamond SnV-based quantum networks.</p>

            <h2>Generation of entanglement and non-stationary states via competing coherent and incoherent bosonic hopping</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Parvinder Solanki, Albert Cabot, Matteo Brunelli, Federico Carollo, Christoph Bruder, Igor Lesanovsky</p>
            <p>Incoherent stochastic processes added to unitary dynamics are typically deemed detrimental since they are expected to diminish quantum features such as superposition and entanglement. Instead of exhibiting energy-conserving persistent coherent motion, the dynamics of such open systems feature, in most cases, a steady state, which is approached in the long-time limit from all initial conditions. This can, in fact, be advantageous as it offers a mechanism for the creation of robust quantum correlations on demand without the need for fine-tuning. Here, we show this for a system consisting of two coherently coupled bosonic modes, which is a paradigmatic scenario for the realization of quantum resources such as squeezed entangled states. Rather counterintuitively, the mere addition of incoherent hopping, which results in a statistical coupling between the bosonic modes, leads to steady states with robust quantum entanglement and enables the emergence of persistent coherent non-stationary behavior.</p>

            <h2>Efficient Simulation of Quantum Secure Multiparty Computation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kartick Sutradhar</p>
            <p>One of the key characteristics of secure quantum communication is quantum secure multiparty computation. In this paper, we propose a quantum secure multiparty summation (QSMS) protocol that can be applied to many complex quantum operations. It is based on the $(t, n)$ threshold approach. We combine the classical and quantum phenomena to make this protocol realistic and secure. Because the current protocols employ the $(n, n)$ threshold approach, which requires all honest players to execute the quantum multiparty summation protocol, they have certain security and efficiency problems. However, we employ a $(t, n)$ threshold approach, which requires the quantum summation protocol to be computed only by $t$ honest players. Our suggested protocol is more economical, practical, and secure than alternative protocols.</p>

            <p>For multiple hypothesis testing based on classical data samples, we demonstrate a quantum advantage in the optimal privacy-utility trade-off (PUT), where the privacy and utility measures are set to (quantum) local differential privacy and the pairwise-minimum Chernoff information, respectively. To show the quantum advantage, we consider some class of hypotheses that we coin smoothed point masses. For such hypotheses, we derive an upper bound of the optimal PUT achieved by classical mechanisms, which is tight for some cases, and propose a certain quantum mechanism which achieves a better PUT than the upper bound. The proposed quantum mechanism consists of a classical-quantum channel whose outputs are pure states corresponding to a symmetric informationally complete positive operator-valued measure (SIC-POVM), and a depolarizing channel.</p>

            <p>Secure and reliable certification of quantum resources is a fundamental challenge in the advancement of next-generation quantum technologies, particularly as devices become more complex and integrated into practical applications, where parts of the system may be untrusted or inaccessible by users. Addressing this challenge requires certification methods that rely on minimal assumptions and limited trust while still faithfully and reliably verifying the quantum resources in question. For infinite-dimensional bosonic systems, existing certification methods rely on fully trusted and well calibrated measurement systems, leaving significant security vulnerabilities open. In this work, we present the first experimental demonstration of measurement-device-independent (MDI) certification schemes for infinite-dimensional bosonic systems, where the certification process is conducted using entirely untrusted measurement devices and assuming only the trusted preparation of coherent states. Specifically, we implement schemes for the MDI certification of continuous-variable (CV) entanglement and the operation of an elementary optical CV quantum memory. We leverage techniques of Bayesian metrology and exploit the practicality and accessibility of Gaussian quantum optics to achieve secure and efficient certification. These results demonstrate the potential of the MDI framework to enhance trust in quantum technologies with applications in quantum communication and quantum computing.</p>

            <p>Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) using coherent states and heterodyne detection enables secure quantum communication based on technology that has large similarities to coherent optical telecommunication. Yet, practical implementations of coherent receivers used in both technologies encounter device imperfections, which for CVQKD are often not addressed in security proofs. Here, we present a theoretical framework that rigorously accounts for imperfect heterodyne measurements arising from phase imbalances in the coherent (heterodyne) receiver. Focusing on collective attacks, we establish a finite-size security proof that reveals how measurement imperfections limit the distance over which a positive key rate is achievable. To mitigate these effects, we propose a local transformation during classical post-processing. We validate our approach experimentally on a CVQKD system with an imperfect coherent receiver, underscoring its potential for scalable, cost-effective CVQKD with photonic integrated receivers in which phase-imbalances naturally appear through manufacturing tolerances.</p>

            <p>Quantum backflow, a counterintuitive interference phenomenon where particles with positive momentum can propagate backward, is important in applications involving light-matter interactions. To date, experimental demonstrations of backflow have been restricted to classical optical systems, where momentum is measured using the slit scanning technique or the Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor technique. However, these techniques have low spatial resolution due to limitations in slit width and Fourier transform lenslet array density. Here, by adopting the technique of weak measurement, we report an observation of azimuthal backflow both theoretically and experimentally. Our results show that a heralded single photon, prepared in specific superposition states with solely negative orbital angular momentum (OAM), exhibits positive OAM. The effects of mode ratio, propagation distance and OAM index on the azimuthal backflow are systematically investigated. Our method avoids using slits and lenslet arrays, allowing for the accurate extraction of photon momentum at each pixel. This work provides new insights and techniques for observing and manipulating backflow in quantum systems.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate electrically tunable, spin-dependent, directional coupling of single photons by embedding quantum dots (QDs) in a waveguide-coupled nanocavity. The directional behavior arises from direction-dependent interference between two cavity modes when coupled to the device waveguides. The small mode volume cavity enables simultaneous Purcell enhancement (${10.8\pm0.7}$) and peak directional contrast (${88\pm1\%}$), exceeding current state-of-the-art waveguide-only systems. We also present a scattering matrix model for the transmission through this structure, alongside a quantum trajectory-based model for predicting the system's directionality, which we use to explain the observed asymmetry in directional contrast seen in QD devices. Furthermore, the nanocavity enables wide-range electrical tuning of the emitter's directional contrast. We present results showing precise tuning of a QD emission line from a directional contrast of ${2\%}$ to ${96\%}$. In combination, these characteristics make this cavity-waveguide approach promising for use as a building block in directional nanophotonic circuits.</p>

            <p>In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of ambient noise intensity on the rate modifications of ground-state chemical reactions in an optical cavity under vibrational strong-coupling conditions. To achieve this, we utilize a numerically exact open quantum system approach--the hierarchical equations of motion in twin space, combined with a flexible tree tensor network state solver. Our findings reveal a stochastic resonance phenomenon in cavity-modified chemical reactivities: an optimal reaction rate enhancement occurs at an intermediate noise level. In other words, this enhancement diminishes if ambient noise, sensed by the cavity-molecule system through cavity leakage, is either too weak or excessively strong. In the collective coupling regime, when the cavity is weakly damped, rate enhancement strengthens as more molecules couple to the cavity. In contrast, under strong cavity damping, reaction rates decline as the number of molecules grows.</p>
