            <h2>Entanglement is protected by acceleration-induced transparency in thermal field</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yongjie Pan, Baocheng Zhang, Qingyu Cai</p>
            <p>The acceleration-induced transparency (AIT) effect has been suggested recently to amply the transition probability of the two-level detctor and offers a potential avenue for the experimental detection of the Unruh effect. In this paper, we explore the influence of the AIT effect on quantum entanglement between two detectors accelerated in a thermal field background, since the thermal backgound field cannot be avoided completely in any experiments. Interestingly, we find that although the backgound thermal field generally degrade the entanglement between the detectors, the AIT effect can effectively protect it.</p>

            <h2>RedCarD: A Quantum Assisted Algorithm for Fixed-Depth Unitary Synthesis via Cartan Decomposition</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Omar Alsheikh, Efekan Kökcü, Bojko N. Bakalov, A. F. Kemper</p>
            <p>A critical step in developing circuits for quantum simulation is to synthesize a desired unitary operator using the circuit building blocks. Studying unitaries and their generators from the Lie algebraic perspective has given rise to several algorithms for synthesis based on a Cartan decomposition of the dynamical Lie algebra. For unitaries of the form $e^{-itH}$, such as time-independent Hamiltonian simulation, the resulting circuits have depth that does not depend on simulation time $t$. However, finding such circuits has a large classical overhead in the cost function evaluation and the high dimensional optimization problem. In this work, by further partitioning the dynamical Lie algebra, we break down the optimization problem into smaller independent subproblems. Moreover, the resulting algebraic structure allows us to easily shift the evaluation of the cost function to the quantum computer, further cutting the classical overhead of the algorithm. As an application of the new hybrid algorithm, we synthesize the time evolution unitary for the 4-site transverse field Ising model on several IBM devices and Quantinuum's H1-1 quantum computer.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement transition in unitary system-bath dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bo Xing, Giuliano Chiriacò, Paola Cappellaro, Rosario Fazio, Dario Poletti</p>
            <p>The evolution of a system coupled to baths is commonly described by a master equation that, in the long-time limit, yields a steady-state density matrix. However, when the same evolution is unraveled into quantum trajectories, it is possible to observe a transition in the scaling of entanglement within the system as the system-bath coupling increases - a phenomenon that is invisible in the trajectory-averaged reduced density matrix of the system. Here, we go beyond the paradigm of trajectories from master equations and explore whether a qualitatively analogous entanglement-scaling transition emerges in the unitary evolution of the combined system-bath setup. We investigate the scaling of entanglement in a unitary quantum setup composed of a 2D lattice of free fermions, where each site is coupled to a fermionic bath. Varying the system-bath coupling reveals a transition from logarithmic-law to area-law scaling, visible in the logarithmic fermionic negativity, mutual information, and also in the correlations. This occurs while the system's steady-state properties are trivial, highlighting that the signatures of these different scalings are within the bath-bath correlations.</p>

            <h2>High-Performance Labyrinth Circular Bragg Grating Design for Charge and Stark-Tunable Quantum Light Sources Spanning Visible to Telecom Wavelengths</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rohit Prasad, Quirin Buchinger, Fei Chi Kristy Yuen, Yorick Reum, Sven Höfling, Tobias Huber-Loyola</p>
            <p>Semiconductor quantum dots embedded in circular Bragg gratings (CBGs) are among the most efficient integrated single-photon sources. However, the fully etched rings of conventional CBGs restrict the implementation of charge and Stark tuning via electrical contacts. To overcome this limitation, a labyrinth CBG geometry with four bridges has been proposed, yet the added bridges significantly degraded optical performance. In this work, we numerically demonstrate that a periodic labyrinth CBG design preserves both high coupling efficiency and strong Purcell enhancement while enabling electrical integration if optimized after introducing the bridges. We show three optimized designs at emission wavelengths of 780 nm, 930 nm, and 1550 nm, because these wavelengths are among the most relevant for quantum dots and show the general applicability of our approach. At all three wavelengths collection efficiencies exceeding 90% into a numerical aperture of 0.7 and Purcell factors greater than 25 are achieved. Furthermore, we propose a device layout incorporating a barrier layer that separates p- and n-doped semiconductor regions, which is incorporated to prevent tunneling of one of the charge carriers for selective charging. Also this design can be reoptimized to retain the performance of a device without tunnel barrier. These results establish labyrinth CBGs as a platform for electrically tunable quantum dot single-photon sources with high efficiency and scalability.</p>

            <h2>Collective three-body interactions enable a robust quantum speedup</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haoqing Zhang, Anjun Chu, Chengyi Luo, Chitose Maruko, Eliot A. Bohr, James K. Thompson, Ana Maria Rey</p>
            <p>We show that collective three-body interactions (3BIs), implementable with $N$ atoms loaded inside an optical cavity, offer a significant advantage for preparing complex multipartite entangled states. Firstly, they enable a speedup of order $\sim N$ in preparing generalized Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states, outperforming conventional methods based on all-to-all two-body Ising interactions. Secondly, they saturate the Heisenberg bound in phase estimation tasks using a time-reversal protocol realized through simple rotations and followed by experimentally accessible collective spin measurements. Lastly, compared with two-body interactions (2BIs), in the presence of cavity losses and single particle decoherence, 3BIs feature a high gain in sensitivity for moderate atom numbers and in large ensembles a fast entanglement generation despite constraints in parameter regimes where they are implementable.</p>

            <h2>Deterministic and Universal Frequency-Bin Gate for High-Dimensional Quantum Technologies</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xin Chen</p>
            <p>High-dimensional photonic systems access large Hilbert spaces for quantum information processing. They offer proven advantages in quantum computation, communication, and sensing. However, implementing scalable, low-loss unitary gates across many modes remains a central challenge. Here we propose a deterministic, universal, and fully programmable high-dimensional quantum gate based on a cavity-assisted sum-frequency-generation process, achieving near-unity fidelity. The device implements an M-by-N truncated unitary transformation (with 1 <= M < N), or a full unitary when M = N, on frequency-bin modes. With current technology, the attainable dimensionality reaches M-by-N on the order of ten to the power of four, with N up to about one thousand, and can be further increased using multiple pulse shapers. Combined with compatible SPDC sources, high-efficiency detection, and fast feed-forward, this approach provides a scalable, fiber-compatible platform for high-dimensional frequency-bin quantum processing.</p>

            <h2>Highly robust logical qubit encoding in an ensemble of V-symmetrical qutrits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luis Octavio Castaños-Cervantes, Manuel Calixto, Julio Guerrero</p>
            <p>We propose using even and odd Schödinger cat states formed from coherent states of U(3) of an ensemble of qutrits with a symmetrical V-configuration (a qubit-disguised qutrit) to encode a logical qubit. These carefully engineered logical qubit states are parameter independent stationary states of the effective master equation governing the evolution of the ensemble and, consequently, constitute dark states and are invulnerable to dissipation and correlated collective dephasing. In particular, the logical qubit states are immune to single qutrit decay (the analogous of single photon loss process for qutrits) and simultaneous decay and driving of two qutrits (the analogous two-photon loss and driving processes for qutrits). In addition, we show how to implement the single-qubit quantum NOT gate and the Hadamard gate followed by either the phase gate or the phase and $Z$ gates. We study analytically the case of two qutrits and conclude that the logical qubit states exhibit parity-sensitive inhomogeneous broadening and local correlated dephasing: the even logical state is completely immune to these processes, while odd one is vulnerable. Nevertheless, in the presence of these interactions one can also define another odd state with mixed permutation symmetry that is immune to both inhomogeneous broadening and local correlated dephasing. We suggest that these results can be extrapolated to an arbitrary number of qutrits. The effective master equation is deduced from a physical system composed of two parametrically coupled cavities with one of them interacting dispersively with an ensemble of three-level atoms (the qutrits). In principle this physical system can be implemented by means of two coplanar waveguide resonators, a SQUID parametrically coupling them, and a cloud of alkali atoms close to one of the resonators.</p>

            <h2>Spin-photon Qubits for Scalable Quantum Network</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Md Sakibul Islam, Kuldeep Singh, Yunhe Zhao, Nitesh Singh, Wayesh Qarony</p>
            <p>Solid-state quantum light sources offer a scalable pathway for interfacing stationary spin qubits with flying photonic qubits, forming the backbone of future quantum networks. Telecom-band spin-photonic qubits, operating in the 1260-1675 nm wavelength range, are particularly well-suited for long-distance quantum communication due to minimal loss in standard optical fibers. Achieving scalability, however, hinges on fulfilling several stringent criteria: coherent spin-state control, deterministic and indistinguishable single-photon emission, and integration with nanophotonic structures that enhance radiative properties, such as lifetime, coherence, and photon indistinguishability. This study explores the state-of-the-art spin-photonic qubits across solid-state platforms, including diamond color centers, silicon carbide defect centers, quantum dots, and two-dimensional materials. Special attention is given to silicon-based emitters, particularly G, T, C- and Ci-centers, which promise monolithic integration with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology and telecom-band operation. We classify these systems based on spin-photon interface availability, CMOS process compatibility, and emitter scalability. We also discuss recent advances in cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED), including Purcell enhancement and quality factor engineering in integrated photonic (circuits) environments. The work highlights emerging demonstrations of quantum networking over metropolitan scales and outlines the trajectory toward chip-scale quantum photonic integrated circuits (QPICs). It combines deterministic emitter creation, coherent spin manipulation, and quantum information processing. These developments pave the way for global quantum networks, enabling secure communication, distributed quantum computing, and quantum-enhanced sensing.</p>

            <h2>Bound state in the continuum and multiple atom state transfer applications in a waveguide QED setup</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiang Guo, Xiaojun Zhang, Mingzhu Weng, Qian Bin, Hao-di Liu, Hai-Jun Xing, Xin-You Lü, Zhihai Wang</p>
            <p>Bound states in the continuum (BICs) have been extensively exploited to enhance light--matter interactions in metamaterials, yet their emergence and utility in multi-atom waveguide platforms remain far less explored. Here we study atom--waveguide-dressed BICs in a one-dimensional coupled-resonator waveguide, where two spatially separated atomic arrays couple to distinct resonators with time-dependent strengths. We show that these BICs support a standing-wave photonic mode and enable the transfer of an arbitrary unknown quantum state between the two arrays with fidelities exceeding $99\%$. The protocol remains robust against both disorder and intrinsic dissipation. Our results establish BICs as long-lived resources for high-fidelity quantum information processing in waveguide-QED architectures.</p>

            <h2>Experimental demonstration of scalable quantum cryptographic conferencing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haotao Zhu, Zhenhua Li, Shuai Zhao, Xiaodan Lyu, Shihao Ru, Yizhi Huang, Zitong Xu, Rui Qu, Weibo Gao</p>
            <p>Quantum network enables a variety of quantum information processing tasks, where multi-user quantum communication is one of the important objectives. Quantum cryptographic conferencing serves as an essential solution to establish secure keys to realize secure multi-user communications. However, existing QCC implementations have been fundamentally limited by the low probability of multi-user coincidence detection to measure or construct the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) entangled state. In this work, we report the experimental realization of QCC eliminating the need for coincidence detection, where the GHZ state is constructed by correlating detection events occurring within the coherence time, thereby greatly enhancing the success probability of GHZ-state measurement. Meanwhile, to establish and maintain high-visibility GHZ measurement among three independent users, we developed a three-party phase compensation scheme combined with precise temporal and polarization alignment within a time-bin-phase encoding framework. Furthermore, we designed an efficient pairing strategy to simplify subsequent data processing and enhance processing efficiency. Based on these techniques, we successfully performed QCC experiments over total channel losses of 66.3 dB, corresponding to 331.5 km of commercial fiber (0.2 dB/km), achieving secure key rates of 5.4 bit/s, whereas previous QCC experiments have been limited to 100 km. The results surpass the multi-user repeaterless bound in quantum networks, establishing a new regime of scalable, multi-user quantum communication and paving the way for metropolitan quantum networks.</p>

            <h2>Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access-Based Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution: Secret Key Rate Analysis and Power Allocation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhichao Dong, Xiaolin Zhou, Huang Peng, Wei Ni, Ekram Hossain, Xin Wang</p>
            <p>We address the multi-user quantum key distribution (QKD) problem under malicious quantum attacks, which is critical for realizing a large-scale quantum Internet. This paper maximizes the sum secret key rate (SKR) of a novel uplink non-orthogonal multiple access based continuous-variable QKD (NOMA-CVQKD) system under collective attacks. The proposed system uses Gaussian-modulated coherent states and a quantum successive interference cancellation based heterodyne receiver. We derive closed-form asymptotic bounds for the legitimate users' achievable key rates via the entropy power inequality and maximum entropy principle, as well as for the eavesdropper's intercepted information based on Holevo information. A successive convex approximation based power allocation algorithm is developed to maximize the asymptotic sum SKR of the NOMA-CVQKD system under collective attacks, with guaranteed convergence to a locally optimal Karush-Kuhn-Tucker solution. Simulation results show that the proposed NOMA-CVQKD system with the power allocation algorithm achieves up to 23% higher sum SKR than quantum-orthogonal multiple access, supports 16 users at excess noise variance 0.1, and remains robust under varying turbulence intensities and transmission distances.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Correlation Assisted Cooling of Microwave Cavities Below the Ambient Temperature</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daryoosh Vashaee, Jahanfar Abouie</p>
            <p>We develop a theoretical framework for cooling a microwave cavity mode using a Poisson stream of internally correlated pairs of two-level systems and analyze its performance under realistic dissipation. Starting from a Lindblad model of a phonon-tethered cavity interacting with sequentially injected atom pairs, we derive closed-form expressions for the steady-state cavity occupation and effective temperature. Two coupling geometries are examined: a one-atom configuration, where only one member of each pair interacts with the cavity, and a two-atom configuration, where both atoms couple collectively. The single-atom model enables cooling below the phonon bath but not below the reservoir temperature, whereas the two-atom scheme exhibits enhanced refrigeration - pair correlations modify the cavity's upward and downward transition rates so that the steady-state temperature can fall well below that of the reservoir for weak phonon damping. We map the parameter space including detuning, coupling strength, damping, and intra-pair exchange, identifying cooling valleys near resonance and the crossover between reservoir- and phonon-dominated regimes. The two-atom configuration thus realizes a genuine quantum-enhanced cooling mechanism absent in the single-atom case. We further outline an experimental implementation using two superconducting qubits repeatedly prepared, coupled, and reset inside a 3D cavity. Realistic reset and flux-tuning protocols support MHz-rate interaction cycles, enabling engineered reservoirs to impose cavity temperatures of 50-120 mK even when the cryostat is at ~1 K, offering a pathway to autonomous, on-chip refrigeration of microwave modes in scalable quantum hardware.</p>

            <p>We investigate the short-term temporal dynamics of superradiance in closely spaced quantum emitters. Building on Dicke's 1954 framework, we analyze the sequential emergence of coherence, superradiance, and entanglement, revealing a distinct temporal hierarchy in their extremal values: relative coherence develops first, followed by the peak of correlated emission, then minimal entanglement, and finally correlated dephasing. These findings suggest that enhanced relative coherence initiates correlated emission and when correlated dephasing is negligible, entanglement and correlated emission become tightly linked in time.</p>

            <p>Coherent Ising Machines (CIMs) have emerged as a hybrid form of quantum computing devices designed to solve NP-complete problems, offering an exciting opportunity for discovering optimal solutions. Despite challenges such as susceptibility to noise-induced local minima, we achieved notable advantages in improving the computational accuracy and stability of CIMs. We conducted a successful experimental demonstration of CIM via femto-second laser pumping that integrates optimization strategies across optical and structural dimensions, resulting in significant performance enhancements. The results are particularly promising. An average success rate of 55% was achieved to identify optimal solutions within a Mobius Ladder graph comprising 100 vertices. Compared with other alternatives, the femto-second pulse results in significantly higher peak power, leading to more pronounced quantum effects and lower pump power in optical fiber based CIMs. In addition, we have maintained an impressive success rate for a continuous period of 8 hours, emphasizing the practical applicability of CIMs in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, our research extends to the application of these principles in practical applications such as molecular docking and credit scoring. The results presented substantiate the theoretical promise of CIMs, paving the way for their integration into large-scale practical applications.</p>

Conventional labeling-based sorting methods, such as fluorescence-activated cell sorting and magnetic-activated cell sorting, enable precise sorting when reliable markers are available. However, their applicability is limited in cells lacking defined markers or sensitive to labeling, as labeling can compromise cellular viability and function. We present a single-cell identification approach using quantum-enhanced NMR with diamond nitrogen-vacancy centers for label-free detection of intracellular proton ($^1$H) signals. Using this method, we distinguish two human tumor cell lines by their proton spin-lattice ($T_1$) relaxation times, which serve as a cell-intrinsic physicochemical signature. It lays the groundwork for label-free sorting applications in rare cell analysis, personalized medicine, and single-cell diagnostics.</p>

            <h2>Revisiting Quantum Supremacy: Simulating Sycamore-Class Circuits Using Hybrid CPU/GPU HPC Workloads</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bob Wold, Venkateswaran Kasirajan</p>
            <p>We present a framework for effectively simulating the execution of quantum circuits originally designed to demonstrate quantum supremacy using accessible high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure. Building on prior CPU-only approaches, our pipeline combines a single NVIDIA A100 GPU for quantum state construction, followed by N parallel CPU jobs that perform distributed measurement sampling. We validate the fidelity by simulating the 53-qubit, 14-cycle Sycamore circuit and achieving a linear cross-entropy benchmarking (XEB) score of 0.549, exceeding the published XEB score of 0.002 from Google's reference data. We then evaluate execution time performance with the more complex 53-qubit, 20-cycle circuit, completing the full 2.5 million-shot workload over 100 CPU jobs in 01:15:36, representing a 6.95 x 10^7 speedup compared to Google's original classical estimate. Further, we show that if 1,000 CPU jobs were employed, the estimated duration would be approximately 00:17:35, only 12 minutes slower than the time taken by the original QPU-based experiment. These results illustrate that 'quantum supremacy' is not fixed and continues to be a moving target. In addition, hybrid classical-quantum strategies may provide broader near-term quantum utility than once thought.</p>

            <h2>33 Gbit/s source-device-independent quantum random number generator based on heterodyne detection with real-time FPGA-integrated extraction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marius Cizauskas, Hamid Tebyanian, Mark Fox, Manfred Bayer, Marc Assmann, Alex Greilich</p>
            <p>We present a high-speed continuous-variable quantum random number generator (QRNG) based on heterodyne detection of vacuum fluctuations. The scheme follows a source-device-independent (SDI) security model in which the entropy originates from quantum measurement uncertainty and no model of the source is required; security depends only on the trusted measurement device and the calibrated discretization, and thus remains valid even under adversarial state preparation. The optical field is split by a 90$^\circ$ optical hybrid and measured by two balanced photodiodes to obtain both quadratures of the vacuum state simultaneously. The analog outputs are digitized using a dual-channel 12-bit analog-to-digital converter operating at a sampling rate of 3.2 GS/s per channel, and processed in real time by an FPGA implementing Toeplitz hashing for randomness extraction. The quantum-to-classical noise ratio was verified through calibrated power spectral density measurements and cross-checked in the time domain, confirming vacuum-noise dominance within the 1.6 GHz detection bandwidth. After extraction, the system achieves a sustained generation rate of $R_{\rm net}= 33.92~\mathrm{Gbit/s}$ of uniformly distributed random bits, which pass all NIST and Dieharder statistical tests. The demonstrated platform provides a compact, FPGA-based realization of a practical heterodyne continuous-variable source-independent QRNG suitable for high-rate quantum communication and secure key distribution systems.</p>

            <p>This study explores the energy storage dynamics of a quantum battery (QB) modeled using a dipolar spin system with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction. We examine the performance of this system in terms of ergotropy, instantaneous power, capacity, and quantum coherence using a two-qubit model. By solving the system's time evolution under cyclic unitary processes, we analyze how external parameters such as temperature, magnetic field, and DM interaction influence the charging behavior and quantum resources of the battery. The findings demonstrate that quantum coherence and DM interaction significantly enhance the energy storage efficiency and power output of the quantum battery, offering promising strategies for designing high-performance quantum energy storage devices. Furthermore, we investigate the performance of quantum battery under the influence of a common dephasing environment, which limits the long-term work-extraction capability of dipolar quantum batteries.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ge Sun, Hongzheng Wu, Jing Lu, Lan Zhou</p>
            <p>We propose a scheme to achieve efficient frequency conversion for a single photon propagating in a 1D conventional waveguide by exploiting the quantum interference induced by the scale of a V-type giant atom (GA) characterized by the distance between the two coupling points as well as single-photon transition pathways originated from the coupling between the GA and the resonator. The presence of photons in the resonator triggers the frequency conversion of photons. The scattering spectra and the conversion contrast are studied in both the Markovian and the non-Markovian regimes. The disappearance of frequency conversion is rooted in the complete suppression of the emission from the excited state to either of lower states in the $n+1$ subspace where $n$ is the photon number of the resonator, and the non-Markovicity-induced nonreciprocity is found under specific conditions. Altering the photon number $n$ induces the non-reciprocal transmission of single photons in the waveguide, hence, enhance the conversion probability.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rei Kawano, Shin Nishio, Hideaki Kawaguchi, Shota Nagayama, Takahiko Satoh</p>
            <p>Layered architectures for the Quantum Internet have been proposed, inspired by that of the classical Internet, which has demonstrated high maintainability even in large-scale systems. While lower layers in the Quantum Internet, such as entanglement generation and distribution, have been extensively studied, the application layer - responsible for translating user requests into executable quantum-network operations - remains largely unexplored. A significant challenge is translating application-level requests into the concrete instructions executable at lower layers. In this work, we introduce a RuleSet-based framework that explicitly incorporates the application layer into the layered architecture of the Quantum Internet. Our framework builds on a RuleSet-based protocol, clarifying communication procedures, organizing application request information, and introducing new Rules for application execution by embedding application specifications into RuleSets. To evaluate feasibility, we constructed state machines from the generated RuleSets. This approach enables a transparent integration from the application layer down to the physical layer, thereby lowering barriers to deploying new applications on the Quantum Internet.</p>

            <h2>Exponentially accelerated relaxation and quantum Mpemba effect in open quantum systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emerson Lima Caldas, Diego Paiva Pires</p>
            <p>We investigate the quantum Mpemba effect in the relaxation of open quantum systems whose effective dynamics is described by Davies maps. We present a class of unitary transformations based on permutation matrices that, acting on the initial state of the system, (i) suppress the contribution of slowest decaying modes of the nonunitary dynamics; (ii) ensure that it is as distinguishable as possible from the steady state. The first requirement guarantees an exponentially accelerating convergence to the steady state, while the second implies that a quantum system initially farther from equilibrium approaches it more rapidly than an initial state closer to it. This protocol provides a genuine Mpemba effect, and its numerical simulation requires low computational effort. We prove that, for any initial state, there always exists a permutation matrix that maximizes its distance from the equilibrium for a given information-theoretic distinguishability measure. We illustrate our findings for the nonunitary dynamics of the transverse field Ising chain and XXZ chain, each weakly coupled to a bosonic thermal bath, showing the quantum Mpemba effect captured by the Hilbert-Schmidt distance, quantum relative entropy, and trace distance. Our results provide a universal and versatile framework to engineer the genuine quantum Mpemba effect in open quantum systems.</p>

            <p>Single-photon sources are crucial for quantum information technologies. Here, we demonstrate a microwave single-photon source fabricated using a tantalum-based thin film, whose favorable material properties enable high-quality and stable photon emission. The antibunching behavior of the emitted radiation is revealed by second-order correlation measurements. Furthermore, traveling-wave parametric amplifiers are used as the pre-amplifier in the detection chains, we substantially improve the signal-to-noise ratio and thereby greatly reduce the acquisition time required for second-order correlation measurements. These results demonstrate the viability of tantalum-based superconducting devices as reliable platforms for microwave quantum photonics.</p>

            <h2>Sharp values for all dynamical variables via Anti-Wick quantization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Simon Friederich</p>
            <p>This paper proposes an approach to interpreting quantum expectation values that may help address the quantum measurement problem. Quantum expectation values are usually calculated via Hilbert space inner products and, thereby, differently from expectation values in classical mechanics, which are weighted phase-space integrals. It is shown that, by using Anti-Wick quantization to associate dynamical variables with self-adjoint linear operators, quantum expectation values can be interpreted as genuine weighted averages over phase space, paralleling their classical counterparts. This interpretation arises naturally in the Segal-Bargmann space, where creation and annihilation operators act as simple multiplication and differentiation operators. In this setting, the Husimi Q-function - the coherent-state representation of the quantum state - can be seen as a true probability density in phase space. Unlike Bohmian mechanics, the present approach retains the standard correspondence between dynamical variables and self-adjoint operators while paving the way for a classical-like probabilistic interpretation of quantum statistics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bartu Bisgin, Marwa Garsi, Andreas Welscher, Michael Hanke, Fleming Bruckmaier</p>
            <p>The increasing complexity of advanced semiconductor packages, driven by chiplet architectures and 2.5D/3D integration, challenges conventional failure localization methods such as lock-in thermography (LIT) and complicates current Failure Analysis (FA) workflows. Dense redistribution layers and buried interconnects limit the ability of established techniques to understand failure mechanisms non-destructively. In this work, we validate quantum diamond microscopy (QDM) based on nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond as a non-destructive localization method through magnetic current path imaging at the package level. Using commercial Integrated Fan-Out Package-on- Package (InFO-PoP) devices from iPhones, we showcase a complete FA workflow that includes QDM to localize a short-type failure at an Integrated Passive Device (IPD) at the package backside. We showcase that the QDM results provide invaluable information on top of conventional techniques and can significantly enhance root-cause identification in package-level FA workflows. This work demonstrates the potential of QDM for broader integration into semiconductor chip and package analysis workflows.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qi-Yin Lin, Guang-Zheng Ye, Can Li, Wan-Jun Su, Huai-Zhi Wu</p>
            <p>We propose a scheme to achieve a nonreciprocal quantum battery (QB) in the non-Hermitian (NH) system, which can overcome the intrinsic dissipation and reverse flow constraints. The design is based on a charger and a battery, which are coherently coupled and jointly interact with a bad cavity. By introducing the auxiliary bad cavity and exploiting the nonreciprocal condition, this model can harness the environmental dissipation to suppress the reverse energy transfer. Under resonant conditions, we have achieved a four ratio of the battery energy to the charger energy; in contrast, this ratio is significantly reduced under large detuning. Through damping optimization, high efficiency of the short-time charging power is attained. In comparison to the fully nonreciprocal scheme, the QB operating at the exceptional point (EP) exhibits greater resilience to parameter fluctuations. These findings highlight the potential of NH quantum engineering for advancing QB technology, particularly in regimes involving directional energy transfer, controlled dissipation, and entropy management in open quantum systems.</p>

            <p>We propose a versatile control protocol based on modulated zero-pulse-area fields that dynamically suppresses Rydberg excitation while retaining Rydberg-Rydberg interactions as an entangling phase resource. This mechanism enables single-step, perfectly entangling phase gates for arbitrary blockade strengths, eliminating finite-blockade errors even when the Rabi frequency approaches or exceeds the interaction energy. The approach defines a new operational regime for Rydberg-blockade quantum logic in which speed, fidelity, and robustness are achieved simultaneously within a simple dynamical framework. Owing to its simplicity and generality, the technique is compatible with a wide range of neutral-atom architectures and offers a promising route toward scalable, high-fidelity quantum computation and simulation.</p>

            <p>Fault-tolerant quantum computing will require error rates far below those achievable with physical qubits. Quantum error correction (QEC) bridges this gap, but depends on decoders being simultaneously fast, accurate, and scalable. This combination of requirements has not yet been met by a machine-learning decoder, nor by any decoder for promising resource-efficient codes such as the colour code. Here we introduce AlphaQubit 2, a neural-network decoder that achieves near-optimal logical error rates for both surface and colour codes at large scales under realistic noise. For the colour code, it is orders of magnitude faster than other high-accuracy decoders. For the surface code, we demonstrate real-time decoding faster than 1 microsecond per cycle up to distance 11 on current commercial accelerators with better accuracy than leading real-time decoders. These results support the practical application of a wider class of promising QEC codes, and establish a credible path towards high-accuracy, real-time neural decoding at the scales required for fault-tolerant quantum computation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alan Kahan, Pablo Viñas, Torsten V. Zache, Alejandro Bermudez</p>
            <p>We propose and analyze a trapped-ion quantum simulator of the Jackiw-Rebbi model, a paradigmatic quantum field theory in (1+1) dimensions where solitonic excitations of a scalar field can bind fermionic zero modes leading to fractionally charged excitations. In our approach, the scalar field is a coarse-grained description of the planar zigzag ion displacements in the vicinity of a structural phase transition. The internal electronic states of the ions encode spins with interactions mediated by the transverse phonons and in-plane spin-phonon couplings with a zigzag pattern, which together correspond to a Yukawa-coupled Dirac field. Instead of assuming a fixed soliton background, we study the effect of back-reaction and quantum fluctuations on the coupled dynamics of the full fermion-boson system. We start by applying a Born-Oppenheimer approximation to obtain an effective Peierls-Nabarro potential for the topological kink, unveiling how the fermionic back-reaction can lead to localization of the kink. Beyond this limit, a truncated Wigner approximation combined with fermionic Gaussian states captures the quantum spreading and localization of a kink and kink-antikink scattering. Our results reveal how back-reaction and quantum fluctuations modify the stability and real-time evolution of fractionalized fermions, predicting experimentally accessible signatures in current trapped-ion architectures.</p>

            <h2>Statistical properties of quantum jumps between macroscopic states of light: reading an operational coherence record</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Th. K. Mavrogordatos</p>
            <p>We propose an experimental apparatus to reveal the quantum coherence manifested in downward quantum jumps of amplitude bistability. The underlying coherent superposition of macroscopic quantum states is translated into the statistical properties of the integrated charge deposited in the detector circuit of a mode-matched heterodyne/homodyne detection scheme. At first, the dynamical evolution of a signal transmitted from an auxiliary cavity is employed to pinpoint a macroscopic switching event in a bistable main cavity subject to direct photodetection. Once the decision is made on the occurrence of a downward switch, the main cavity mode is let to freely decay to the vacuum, monitored to the production of an integrated charge. In the long-time limit, the charge distribution over an identical collection of pure states generated during the jumps converges to the Q function (heterodyne detection) or marginals of the Wigner function (homodyne detection) dictated by the phase of the local oscillator. When fluctuations over the ensemble step in, we connect the statistical properties of several switching events and the ensuing production of current records, to the cavity field correlations associated with the breakdown of photon blockade.</p>

            <p>Hybrid quantum systems harness the distinct advantages of different physical platforms, yet their integration is not always trivial due to potential incompatibilities in operational principles. Here, we theoretically propose and demonstrate a scheme for generating non-Gaussian mechanical states using a strongly driven hybrid system that combines cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) and cavity optomechanics. Our protocol prepares a non-Gaussian cavity state in the dispersive regime of cavity QED and subsequently transfers it to a mechanical oscillator using the optomechanical interaction enhanced by a coherent cavity drive. While non-Gaussian cavity state control in cavity QED is well established in the dispersive regime, its behavior under strong cavity drive, essential for cavity optomechanics, remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we develop an efficient simulation framework to model cavity QED dynamics in the high-photon-number regime. We show that a strong cavity drive can coherently displace the cavity state with minimal perturbations, effectively decoupling it from the qubit. The resulting large coherent cavity field enhances the optomechanical coupling strength, enabling high-fidelity transfer of non-Gaussian cavity states to the mechanical mode. These results reveal new dynamical features of driven cavity QED and open a pathway toward realizing non-Gaussian mechanical quantum memories and sensors.</p>

            <p>Qubit readout is a critical operation in quantum computing systems, which maps the analog response of qubits into discrete classical states. Deep neural networks (DNNs) have recently emerged as a promising solution to improve readout accuracy . Prior hardware implementations of DNN-based readout are resource-intensive and suffer from high inference latency, limiting their practical use in low-latency decoding and quantum error correction (QEC) loops. This paper proposes LUNA, a fast and efficient superconducting qubit readout accelerator that combines low-cost integrator-based preprocessing with Look-Up Table (LUT) based neural networks for classification. The architecture uses simple integrators for dimensionality reduction with minimal hardware overhead, and employs LogicNets (DNNs synthesized into LUT logic) to drastically reduce resource usage while enabling ultra-low-latency inference. We integrate this with a differential evolution based exploration and optimization framework to identify high-quality design points. Our results show up to a 10.95x reduction in area and 30% lower latency with little to no loss in fidelity compared to the state-of-the-art. LUNA enables scalable, low-footprint, and high-speed qubit readout, supporting the development of larger and more reliable quantum computing systems.</p>

            <p>We introduce two classes of lightweight, adaptive calibration protocols for quantum computers that leverage fast feedback. The first enables shot-by-shot updates to device parameters using measurement outcomes from simple, indefinite-outcome quantum circuits. This low-latency approach supports rapid tuning of one or more parameters in real time to mitigate drift. The second protocol updates parameters after collecting measurements from definite-outcome circuits (e.g.~syndrome extraction circuits for quantum error correction), balancing efficiency with classical control overheads. We use numerical simulations to demonstrate that both methods can calibrate 1- and 2-qubit gates rapidly and accurately even in the presence of decoherence, state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors, and parameter drift. We propose and demonstrate effective adaptive strategies for tuning the hyperparameters of both protocols. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of real-time in-situ calibration of qubits performing quantum error correction, using only syndrome data, via numerical simulations of syndrome extraction in the [[5,1,3]] code.</p>

            <h2>Comparing quantum channels using Hermitian-preserving trace-preserving linear maps: A physically meaningful approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arindam Mitra, Jatin Ghai</p>
            <p>In quantum technologies, quantum channels are essential elements for the transmission of quantum states. The action of a quantum channel usually introduces noise in the quantum state and thereby reduces the information contained in it. Concatenating a quantum channel with another quantum channel makes it more noisy and degrades its information and resource preservability. These are mathematically described by completely positive trace-preserving linear maps that represent the generic evolution of quantum systems. These are special cases of Hermitian-preserving trace-preserving linear maps. In this work, we demonstrate a physically meaningful way to compare a pair of quantum channels using Hermitian-preserving trace-preserving linear maps. More precisely, given a pair of quantum channels and an arbitrary unknown input state, we show that if the output state of one quantum channel from the pair can be obtained from the output statistics of the other channel from the pair using some quantum measurement, then the latter channel from the pair can be obtained from the former channel by concatenating it with a Hermitian-preserving trace-preserving linear map. This relation between these two channels is a preorder, and we try to study its characterization in this work. We also illustrate the implications of our results for the incompatibility of quantum devices through an example.</p>

Here, we compare the RPM model and Ramsey-like model under laboratory conditions and under in vivo conditions respectively. The results are both surprising and reasonable. Under laboratory conditions, if we have precise control over time and a reasonably accurate prior knowledge of the magnetic field direction, the Ramsey-like model will outperform the RPM model. However, when such information is unavailable, as under in vivo conditions, the RPM model stands out. The RPM model achieves greater practicality at the cost of reduced accuracy.</p>

            <p>Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have precipitated profound advances in microwave detection, manifesting themselves both in spatial resolution and sensitivity. However, typical methods based on Rabi oscillations are subject to detunings due to thermal and magnetic fluctuations and/or gradients, which introduce systematic errors and render the measurements susceptible to environmental perturbations. Here, we propose and demonstrate a novel approach for determining both the magnitude and direction of microwaves, by exploiting the spectral line broadening effect in the optically detected magnetic resonance of NV centers. This method eliminates the requirement of aligning the MW frequency to the spin transitions and is therefore immune to variations and inhomogeneities of the magnetic field and temperature, providing an optimal tool for fast imaging applications. With this method, we achieved wide-field imaging of near field microwaves generated with a microscale $\rm{\Omega}$-pattern antenna with a resolution of 800\,nm. Combining with the vector detection using multi-axis NVs, a full reconstruction of the vector microwave fields is obtained. Besides, our scheme also exhibits excellent linearity over a broad range of MW amplitudes, and the scale is theoretically calculated to be more than four orders. Our results augment the applicability of diamond-based microwave devices in applications under complex scenarios, especially where large dynamic range, fast test speed, and high spatial resolution are demanded.</p>

            <p>Temporal single-photon (TSP-) LiDAR presents a promising solution for imaging-free target recognition over long distances with reduced size, cost, and power consumption. However, existing TSP-LiDAR approaches are ineffective in handling open-set scenarios where unknown targets emerge, and they suffer significant performance degradation under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and short acquisition times (fewer photons). Here, inspired by semantic communication, we propose a semantic TSP-LiDAR based on a self-updating semantic knowledge base (SKB), in which the target recognition processing of TSP-LiDAR is formulated as a semantic communication. The results, both simulation and experiment, demonstrate that our approach surpasses conventional methods, particularly under challenging conditions of low SNR and limited acquisition time. More importantly, our self-updating SKB mechanism can dynamically update the semantic features of newly encountered targets in the SKB, enabling continuous adaptation without the need for extensive retraining of the neural network. In fact, a recognition accuracy of 89% is achieved on nine types of unknown targets in real-world experiments, compared to 66% without the updating mechanism. These findings highlight the potential of our framework for adaptive and robust target recognition in complex and dynamic environments.</p>

The benefits and challenges of quantum technologies are examined from a diplomatic and geopolitical perspective to help leaders make informed strategic decisions. Leading powers now recognise quantum as a domain where technological leadership directly translates to geopolitical influence, compelling an intense race for dominance alongside new forms of multilateral diplomacy aimed at managing both risks and opportunities. Quantum technologies do not all have the same operational maturity, but technological progress is accelerating. Post-quantum cryptography demands immediate action -- every encrypted communication created today may be harvested and decrypted within the decade by adversaries equipped with quantum capabilities.</p>

            <p>We report the results and unique instrument configuration of a novel experiment in which we successfully transitioned a DPPH sample from its natural paramagnetic state and essentially a non-magnetic material to a ferromagnetic state at room temperature. This was achieved using a specifically applied helical flux magnetic field. The DPPH sample (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) remained ferromagnetic for at least one hour after the experiment, indicating that a transformation in the material was induced by the external field rather than being merely a temporary magnetic phase transition observed only during the experiment. The external magnetic field used had a helical pitch angle of approximately $54.7°$, known mathematically as the Magic Angle, relative to the +z-axis, which is aligned with the normal S to N external field's magnetic moment vector. Based on the phenomenology of the experiment, we infer that this specific magic angle corresponding to the known quantization precession spin angle of free electrons under a homogeneous straight flux magnetic field potentially enhances the percentage of unpaired valence electrons within the DPPH material, allowing them to align in parallel with the applied external field. Typically, in paramagnetic materials, the distribution of unpaired electrons' quantum spins relative to an external field is nearly random, showing roughly a 50% chance of either parallel or antiparallel alignment. Only a slight majority preference exists in one alignment direction due to the Boltzmann thermal distribution, which contributes to the paramagnetic nature of these materials. In our measurements, we found that the induced ferromagnetism of the DPPH sample resulted in an abnormal thousand-fold decimal value increase in relative magnetic permeability at ${\mu}{\approx}1.4$, compared to its typical paramagnetic value of $1.0001$ for this material.</p>

            <p>We develop a finite-dimensional formulation of the recently introduced notion of ``timelike entanglement'', defined in terms of two-point functions between operators supported on different Cauchy slices. Using a local orthonormal operator basis, we recast this construction in terms of a generalized response tensor. Building on this, we introduce a generalized spacetime density kernel (GSDK) corresponding to higher-point correlation functions, including time-ordered as well as out-of-time-ordered correlators. We show that the Haar-averaged $(2N)$-point function yields the $(2N)$-th moment of the spectral form factor (SFF), evaluated at an $N$-enhanced effective temperature. The correlation functions of the GSDK operators also yield the SFF, with an effective $(1/N)$-reduction of the physical time-scales. The GSDK places both scrambling diagnostics and spectral statistics on a similar footing and clarifies how higher-point correlators and non-trivial time ordering capture fine-grained dynamical information of a quantum system.</p>

            <p>Accurately predicting protein-ligand binding free energies (BFEs) remains a central challenge in drug discovery, particularly because the most reliable methods, such as free energy perturbation (FEP), are computationally intensive and difficult to scale. Here, we introduce a hybrid quantum-classical framework that combines Mining Minima sampling with quantum mechanically refined ligand partial charges, QM/MM interaction evaluation, and variational quantum eigensolver (VQE)-based electronic energy correction. This design enables explicit treatment of polarization, charge redistribution, and electronic correlation effects that are often underestimated in purely classical scoring schemes, while retaining computational efficiency. Across 23 protein targets and 543 ligands, the method achieves a mean absolute error of about 1.10 kcal/mol with strong rank-order fidelity (Pearson R = 0.75, Spearman rho = 0.76, Kendall tau = 0.57), consistent with the performance of contemporary FEP protocols. Notably, the workflow requires only about 25 minutes per ligand on standard compute resources, resulting in an approximate 20-fold reduction in computational cost relative to alchemical free energy approaches. This level of accuracy and efficiency makes the method well-suited for high-throughput lead optimization and iterative design cycles in pharmaceutical discovery. The framework also provides a natural foundation for future integration with machine learning models to enable predictive, large-scale, and adaptive screening strategies.</p>

By quantum mechanical density functional theory, empowered by interatomic potential models, we efficiently sample the complex configurational landscape and identify both known and previously unreported defect geometries. Our results reveal a pronounced energetic driving force for aggregation: the formation energy per interstitial decreases systematically from isolated split interstitials to compact multi-interstitial clusters, with the tetra-interstitial platelet emerging as a particularly stable structural motif. Additionally, charge analysis indicates that the predominantly covalent bonding in diamond becomes more polar within the defect centers. Analysis of defect energy levels shows that only the investigated mono-, di-, penta-, and hexa-interstitial complexes introduce in-gap electronic states, whereas the tri- and tetra-interstitial clusters are electronically inert. Vibrational spectroscopies further reveal that self-interstitials generate characteristic signatures. Short carbon-carbon bonds inside the defect cores give rise to high-frequency vibrational modes between 1375 and 1925 cm$^{-1}$, which are strongly IR-active but exhibit weak Raman activity. Taken together, these findings provide a coherent picture of the structural, electronic, and vibrational characteristics of carbon self-interstitials and establish a robust framework for their experimental identification.</p>

            <h2>MaxwellLink: A unified framework for self-consistent light-matter simulations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinwei Ji, Andres Felipe Bocanegra Vargas, Gang Meng, Tao E. Li</p>
            <p>A major challenge in light-matter simulations is bridging the disparate time and length scales of electrodynamics and molecular dynamics. Current computational approaches often rely on heuristic approximations of either the electromagnetic (EM) or material component, hindering the exploration of complex light-matter systems. Herein, MaxwellLink -- a modular, open-source Python framework -- is developed for the massively parallel, self-consistent propagation of classical EM fields interacting with a large heterogeneous molecular ensemble. The package utilizes a robust TCP/UNIX socket interface to couple EM solvers with a wide range of external molecular drivers. This decoupled architecture allows users to seamlessly switch between levels of theory of either the EM solver or molecules without modifying the counterpart. Crucially, MaxwellLink supports EM solvers spanning from single-mode cavities to full-feature three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) engines, and molecules described by multilevel open quantum systems, force-field and first-principles molecular dynamics, and nonadiabatic real-time Ehrenfest dynamics. Benefiting from the socket-based design, the EM engine and molecular drivers scale independently across multiple high-performance computing (HPC) nodes, facilitating large-scale simulations previously inaccessible to existing numerical schemes. The versatility and accuracy of this code are demonstrated through applications including superradiance, radiative energy transfer, vibrational strong coupling in Bragg resonators, and plasmonic heating of molecular gases. By providing a unified, extensible engine, MaxwellLink potentially offers a powerful platform for exploring emerging phenomena across the research fronts of spectroscopy, quantum optics, plasmonics, and polaritonics.</p>

            <h2>Polarons from first principles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhenbang Dai, Jon Lafuente-Bartolome, Feliciano Giustino</p>
            <p>This article reviews recent theoretical developments in the ab initio study of polarons in materials. The polaron is an emergent quasiparticle that arises from the interaction between electrons and phonons in solids, and consists of an electron or a hole accompanied by a distortion of the crystal lattice. Recent advances in experiments, theory, and computation have made it possible to investigate these quasiparticles with unprecedented detail, reigniting the interest in this classic problem of condensed matter physics. Recent theoretical and computational advances include ab initio calculations of polaron spectral functions, wavefunctions, lattice distortions, and transport and optical properties. These developments provide new insight into polaron physics, but they have evolved somewhat independently from the earlier effective Hamiltonian approaches that laid the foundation of the field. This article aims to bridge these complementary perspectives by placing them within a single unified conceptual framework. To this end, we start by reviewing effective Hamiltonians of historical significance in polaron theory, ab initio techniques based on density functional theory, and many-body first-principles approaches to polarons. After this survey, we outline a general field-theoretic framework that bridges between these diverse approaches to polaron physics. For completeness, we also review recent progress in the study of exciton polarons and self-trapped excitons and their relations to polarons. Beyond the methodology, we discuss recent applications to several classes of materials that attracted attention in the context of polaron physics.</p>

            <p>Mm-wave and THz superconducting circuits find numerous applications in areas ranging from quantum information and sensing to high-energy physics. Planar THz transmission lines and resonators are fabrication-friendly, compact, and scalable, and they can be efficiently interfaced with external signals and controls. However, planar circuits radiate strongly at high frequencies, which precludes their use in loss-sensitive applications. Here, we present the design and characterization of planar dispersion-engineered transmission lines that effectively suppress radiation leakage in desired mm-wave bands. We extend this concept to design planar resonators with extremely low radiation leakage, resulting in radiation Q-factors above 106 at 553 GHz. Low-loss planar THz circuitry will impact many application domains, including broadband communications, quantum information, radio astronomy, and cosmology.</p>

            <p>Quantum sensors based on electronic spins have emerged as powerful probes of microwave-frequency fields. Among other solid-state platforms, spins in molecular crystals offer a range of advantages, from high spin density to functionalization via chemical tunability. Here, we demonstrate microwave vector magnetometry using the photoexcited spin triplet of pentacene molecules, operating at zero external magnetic field and room temperature. We achieve full three-dimensional microwave field reconstruction by detecting the Rabi frequencies of anisotropic spin-triplet transitions associated with two crystallographic orientations of pentacene in deuterated naphthalene crystals. We further introduce a phase alternated protocol that extends the rotating-frame coherence time by an order of magnitude and enables sensitivities of approximately $1~\mu\mathrm{T}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ with sub-micrometer spatial resolution. These results establish pentacene-based molecular spins as a practical and high-performance platform for microwave quantum sensing in addition to demonstrating control techniques broadly applicable to other molecular and solid-state spin systems.</p>

            <p>By defining a graded global R-operator $\mathbb{R}_{ab}^{(2D,2S)}$ that couples free-fermion structures and incorporates anisotropic Hubbard interactions while satisfying the Yang--Baxter equation, we construct a strictly solvable two-dimensional lattice model. We then build the layer-to-layer transfer matrix through a bidirectional-monodromy construction and prove the model's integrability via the associated global RTT relations. Using the nested algebraic Bethe ansatz, we obtain the exact eigenvalues of the transfer matrix and derive the corresponding first- and second-level Bethe equations. Finally, by taking the logarithmic derivative of the transfer matrix at the regular point, we recover explicitly a local Hamiltonian that features anisotropic hopping, an on-site Hubbard interaction, and orbital-coupling contributions.</p>

            <p>To date, most integrated quantum photonics experiments rely on single-photon detectors operating at cryogenic temperatures coupled to photonic integrated circuits (PICs) through single-mode optical fibers. This approach presents significant challenges due to the detection complexity, as cryogenic conditions hinder the development of scalable systems. In addition, going towards fully-integrated devices or, at least, removing the optical fibers would be also advantageous to develop compact and cost-efficient solutions featuring a high number of optical modes. This work reports on the direct coupling of a PIC, fabricated by femtosecond laser writing (FLW), and a silicon single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array, fabricated in a custom planar technology and compatible with the operation at room temperature. The effectiveness of this solution is shown by achieving perfect coupling and a system detection efficiency as high as 41.0% at a wavelength of 561 nm, which is the highest value reported to date among both heterogeneous/hybrid integrated and directly coupled systems. We also show the robustness of the coupling to misalignments, demonstrating that costly alignment procedures are not needed. Finally, we exploit the SPAD array to characterize a reconfigurable Mach-Zehnder interferometer, i.e., the basic building block of multimode reconfigurable PICs. This solution provides a new avenue to the design and implementation of quantum photonics experiments, especially effective when compact and cost-efficient systems are needed.</p>

            <h2>Geometry-Induced Vacuum Polarization and Mode Shifts in Maxwell-Klein-Gordon Theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Li Wang, Jun Wang, Yong-Long Wang</p>
            <p>Geometric confinement is known to modify single-particle dynamics through effective potentials, yet its imprint on the interacting quantum vacuum remains largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate the Maxwell--Klein--Gordon system constrained to curved surfaces and demonstrate that the geometric potential $\Sigma_{\mathrm{geom}}(\mathbf{r})$ acts as a local renormalization environment. We show that extrinsic curvature modifies the scalar loop spectrum, entering the vacuum polarization as a position-dependent mass correction $M^2(\mathbf{r}) \to m^2 + \Sigma_{\mathrm{geom}}(\mathbf{r})$. This induces a finite, gauge-invariant ``geometry-induced running'' of the electromagnetic response. In the long-wavelength regime ($|{\bf Q}|R \ll 1$), we derive a closed-form expression for the relative frequency shift $\Delta\omega/\omega$, governed by the overlap between the electric energy density and the geometric potential. Applying this formalism to Gaussian bumps, cylindrical shells, and tori, we identify distinct spectral signatures that distinguish these quantum loop corrections from classical geometric optics. Our results suggest that spatial curvature can serve as a tunable knob for ``vacuum engineering,'' offering measurable shifts in high-$Q$ cavities and plasmonic systems.</p>

            <p>Quantum machine learning offers a promising pathway for enhancing stock market prediction, particularly under complex, noisy, and highly dynamic financial environments. However, many classical forecasting models struggle with noisy input, regime shifts, and limited generalization capacity. To address these challenges, we propose a Quantum Temporal Convolutional Neural Network (QTCNN) that combines a classical temporal encoder with parameter-efficient quantum convolution circuits for cross-sectional equity return prediction. The temporal encoder extracts multi-scale patterns from sequential technical indicators, while the quantum processing leverages superposition and entanglement to enhance feature representation and suppress overfitting. We conduct a comprehensive benchmarking study on the JPX Tokyo Stock Exchange dataset and evaluate predictions through long-short portfolio construction using out-of-sample Sharpe ratio as the primary performance metric. QTCNN achieves a Sharpe ratio of 0.538, outperforming the best classical baseline by approximately 72\%. These results highlight the practical potential of quantum-enhanced forecasting model, QTCNN, for robust decision-making in quantitative finance.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei-Liang Gao, Jie-Yu Zhang, Zheng-Xin Liu, Peng Ye</p>
            <p>Strange correlator is a powerful tool widely used in detecting symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. However, the result of strange correlator crucially relies on the adoption of the reference state. In this work, we report that an ill-chosen reference state can induce spurious long-range strange correlators in trivial SPT phases, leading to false positives in SPT diagnosis. Using matrix product state (MPS) representation, we trace the origin of these spurious signals in trivial SPT phases to the magnitude-degeneracy of the transfer matrix. We systematically classify three distinct mechanisms responsible for such degeneracy, each substantiated by concrete examples: (1) the presence of high-dimensional irreducible representations in the entanglement space; (2) a phase mismatch in symmetry representations between the target and reference states; and (3) long-range order arising from symmetry breaking. Our findings clarify the importance of the choice of proper reference states, providing a guideline to avoid pitfalls and correctly identify SPT order using strange correlators.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haipeng Cao, Kaining Zhang, Dacheng Tao, Zhaofeng Su</p>
            <p>Quantum generative models leverage quantum superposition and entanglement to enhance learning efficiency for both classical and quantum data. The quantum denoising diffusion probabilistic model (QuDDPM), inspired by its classical counterpart, has been proposed as a promising framework for quantum generative learning. QuDDPM is capable of efficiently learning and generating quantum data, and it demonstrates excellent performance in learning correlated quantum noise models, quantum many-body phases, and the topological structure of quantum data. However, we show that barren plateaus emerge in QuDDPMs due to the use of 2-design states as the input for the denoising process, which severely undermines the performance of QuDDPM. Through theoretical analysis and experimental validation, we confirm the presence of barren plateaus in the original QuDDPM. To address this issue, we introduce an improved QuDDPM that utilizes a distribution maintaining a certain distance from the Haar distribution, ensuring better trainability. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the barren plateau problem and generates samples with higher quality, paving the way for scalable and efficient quantum generative learning.</p>

            <p>We investigate the quantum dynamics of the electron spin resonance of topological defects (edge state) in dimerized chains. These objects are discontinuities of the spin chain protected by the properties of the global system leading to a quantum many-body multiplet protected from the environment decoherence. Despite recent achievements in the realization of isolated and finite spin chains, the potential implementation in quantum devices needs the knowledge of the relaxation and decoherence sources. Our study reveals that electron spin lattice relaxation is governed at lowest temperatures by phonon-bottlenecked process and at high temperature by the chain dimerization gap. We show that the inter edge-state effective dipolar field is reduced by the intrachain exchange coupling leading to a longer coherence time than isolated ions at equivalent concentration. Ultimately, we demonstrate that the homogeneous broadening is governed by the intra-chain dipolar field, and we establish design principles for optimizing coherence in future materials.</p>

            <h2>Real-Time Dynamics in Two Dimensions with Tensor Network States via Time-Dependent Variational Monte Carlo</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yantao Wu</p>
            <p>Reliably simulating two-dimensional many-body quantum dynamics with projected entangled pair states (PEPS) has long been a difficult challenge. In this work, we overcome this barrier for low-energy quantum dynamics by developing a stable and efficient time-dependent variational Monte Carlo (tVMC) framework for PEPS. By analytically removing all gauge redundancies of the PEPS manifold and exploiting tensor locality, we obtain a numerically well-conditioned stochastic reconfiguration (SR) equation amenable to robust solution using the efficient Cholesky decomposition, enabling long-time evolution in previously inaccessible regimes. We demonstrate the power and generality of the method through four representative real-time problems in two dimensions: (I) chiral edge propagation in a free-fermion Chern insulator; (II) fractionalized charge transport in a fractional Chern insulator; (III) vison confinement dynamics in the Higgs phase of a Z2 lattice gauge theory; and (IV) superfluidity and critical velocity in interacting bosons. All simulations are performed on 12x12 or 13x13 lattices with evolution times T = 10 to 12 using modest computational resources (1 to 5 days on a single GPU card). Where exact benchmarks exist (case I), PEPS-tVMC matches free-fermion dynamics with high accuracy up to T = 12. These results establish PEPS-tVMC as a practical and versatile tool for real-time quantum dynamics in two dimensions. The method extends the reach of classical tensor-network simulations for studying elementary excitations in quantum many-body systems and provides a valuable computational counterpart to emerging quantum simulators.</p>

            <p>We investigate the emergence and control of multiple topological Anderson insulator (TAI) phases in a one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) waveguide lattice with generalized Bernoulli-type disorder introduced in the intradimer couplings. By systematically varying the disorder configuration -- including the values and probabilities of the multivariate distribution -- we demonstrate that both the number and width of TAI phases can be precisely engineered. Analytical determination of topological phase boundaries via the inverse localization length shows excellent agreement with numerical simulations. Our results reveal a rich landscape of disorder-induced topological phase transitions, including multiple reentrant TAI phases that arise as the disorder amplitude increases. Furthermore, we show that the mean chiral displacement serves as a sensitive probe for detecting these topological transitions, providing a practical route for experimental realization in photonic waveguide lattices. This work establishes a versatile framework for designing quantum and photonic materials with customizable topological properties driven by tailored disorder.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Harry Sticker</p>
            <p>The fine-structure constant alpha approximately 1/137 is traditionally regarded as a fundamental dimensionless parameter. I argue instead that alpha is a scaled quantity that arises only where the structural scales contributed by classical electromagnetism (e), quantum mechanics (h-bar), and special relativity (c) intersect. None of these theories, taken individually, supplies the independent scales required to define alpha. The constant first appears when relativistic corrections are added to the Schrodinger-Bohr description of hydrogen (Sommerfeld), and it becomes the structural coupling in quantum electrodynamics, where quantum and relativistic effects modify the classical electromagnetic interaction. Expressing the governing laws in canonical form reveals this dependence and eliminates representational artifacts that make alpha appear fundamental. The running of alpha in QED further demonstrates its status as a scale-dependent coupling rather than a universal constant. I conclude that alpha is a domain-specific structural ratio reflecting contingent relationships among independent physical scales.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Hsueh Chen, Tarun Grover</p>
            <p>Recent progress in open many-body quantum systems has highlighted the importance of the Markov length, the characteristic scale over which conditional correlations decay. It has been proposed that non-equilibrium phases of matter can be defined as equivalence classes of states connected by short-time evolution while maintaining a finite Markov length, a notion called local reversibility. A natural question is whether well-known classical models of non-equilibrium criticality fit within this framework. Here we investigate the Domany--Kinzel model -- which exhibits an active phase and an absorbing phase separated by a 1+1-D directed-percolation transition -- from this information-theoretic perspective. Using tensor network simulations, we provide evidence for local reversibility within the active phase. Notably, the Markov length diverges upon approaching the critical point, unlike classical equilibrium transitions where Markov length is zero due to their Gibbs character. Correspondingly, the conditional mutual information exhibits scaling consistent with directed percolation universality. Further, we analytically study the case of 1+1-D compact directed percolation, where the Markov length diverges throughout the phase diagram due to spontaneous breaking of domain-wall parity symmetry from strong to weak. Nevertheless, the conditional mutual information continues to faithfully detect the corresponding phase transition.</p>

            <p>Transition metal doping is commonly used for altering the properties of solid-state materials to suit applications in science and technology. Partially filled $d$-shells of transition metal atoms lead to electronic states with diverse spatial and spin symmetries. Chromium(III) cations have shown great potential for designing laser materials and, more recently, for developing spin qubits in quantum applications. They also represent an intriguing class of chemical systems with strongly correlated multi-reference excited states, due to the $d^3$ electron configuration. These states are difficult to describe accurately using single-reference quantum chemical methods such as density functional theory (DFT), the most commonly used method to study the electronic structures of solid-state systems. Recently, the periodic effective Hamiltonian of crystal field (pEHCF) method has been shown to overcome some limitations arising in the calculations of excited $d$-states. In this work, we assess the suitability of DFT and pEHCF to calculate the electronic structure and $d$-$d$ excitations of chromium(III) dopants in wide band gap host materials. The results will aid computational development of novel transition metal-doped materials and provide a deeper understanding of the complex nature of transition metal dopants in solids.</p>

The group velocity of a wave packet during the time evolution in such NH lattices is not only governed by the real part of the band structure but also by its imaginary part. The momentum also evolves due to the imaginary part of the band structure, which can lead to a self-induced Bloch oscillation in the absence of external fields. Furthermore, we discover the wave-packet dynamics can exhibit disorder-free NH jumps even when the energy spectra are entirely real. Finally, we show that the NH jumps can lead to both positive and negative temporal Goos--Hänchen shifts at the edge.</p>

            <p>The scalability of quantum photonic integrated circuits opens the path towards large-scale quantum computing and communication. To date, this scalability has been limited by the stochastic nature of the quantum light sources. Moreover, hybrid integration of different platforms will likely be necessary to combine state-of-the-art devices into a functioning architecture. Here, we demonstrate the active alignment and edge-coupling of arrays of ten site-controlled gallium arsenide quantum dots to an array of ten silicon nitride single-mode waveguides, at cryogenic temperatures. The coupling is facilitated by the fabrication of nanopillars, deterministically self-aligned around each quantum dot, leading to a high-yield and regular array of single-photon sources. An on-chip beamsplitter verifies the triggered emission of single photons into the silicon nitride chip. The low inhomogeneous broadening of the ensemble enables us to observe the spectral overlap of adjacent site-controlled emitters. Across the array of waveguides, the signal collected from each coupled quantum dot is consistently and reproducibly 0.17 relative to the free-space collection from the very same single-photon source. Comparing measurement with waveguide simulations, we infer that absolute coupling efficiencies of $\approx 5 \%$ are currently obtained between our quantum dots and the waveguides.</p>

Here we introduce a tensor-network formulation of the lattice Boltzmann method based on matrix product states (MPS), commonly known as a quantum-inspired approach, enabling compressed representations of structured flow fields with inherent error control. We demonstrate the generality of the method on flows through structured media and complex vascular geometries, establishing for the first time that tensor-network techniques can efficiently resolve fluid dynamics in complex, irregular domains. We show that in the presence of translational or approximate symmetries of the geometry, fluid states exhibit low effective complexity in MPS form, yielding compression ratios exceeding two orders of magnitude while preserving physical structure and dynamical fidelity. This reduction enables systematic numerical exploration of regimes that were previously intractable. Our results position tensor networks as a scalable paradigm for continuum mechanics.</p>

In particular, for weak off-diagonal disorder, the critical temperature decreases linearly with disorder amplitude for conventional SC, whereas it is only quadratic in the case of SC in FBs.

            <p>We consider the complex SYK model in the double-scaling limit. We obtain the transfer matrix for the grand canonical ensemble and symmetrize it. In the (n,Q)- basis of chord states, the grand canonical transfer matrix is block diagonal, where each block is the canonical transfer matrix for the respective charge sector. We therefore conclude that the Krylov complexity for the grand canonical ensemble is given by the sum of the complexities in the charge sectors weighted by a probability function that depends on the chemical potential. Finally, we compute the Krylov complexity analytically in the limit of early and late time in the charge sector and numerically for both canonical and grand canonical ensemble.</p>

            <p>We investigate a variational Monte Carlo framework for trapped one-dimensional mixture of spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ fermions using Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) to construct universal neural-network wavefunction ansätze. The method can, in principle, achieve arbitrary accuracy, limited only by the Monte Carlo sampling and was checked against exact results at sub-percent precision. For attractive interactions, it captures pairing effects, and in the impurity case it agrees with known results. We present a method of systematic transfer learning in the number of network parameters, allowing for efficient training for a target precision. We vastly increase the efficiency of the method by incorporating the short-distance behavior of the wavefunction into the ansätz without biasing the method.</p>

            <p>Graph states are an important class of multipartite entangled quantum states. We propose a new approach for distributing graph states across a quantum network. We consider a quantum network consisting of nodes-quantum computers within which local operations are free-and EPR pairs shared between nodes that can continually be generated. We prove upper bounds for our approach on the number of EPR pairs consumed, number of timesteps taken, and amount of classical communication required, all of which are equal to or better than that of prior work. We also reduce the problem of minimizing the number of timesteps taken to distribute a graph state using our approach to a network flow problem having polynomial time complexity.</p>

            <p>The Entropy Accumulation Theorem (EAT) was introduced to significantly improve the finite-size rates for device-independent quantum information processing tasks such as device-independent quantum key distribution (QKD). A natural question would be whether it also improves the rates for device-dependent QKD. In this work, we provide an affirmative answer to this question. We present new tools for applying the EAT in the device-dependent setting. We present sufficient conditions for the Markov chain conditions to hold as well as general algorithms for constructing the needed min-tradeoff function. Utilizing Dupuis' recent privacy amplification without smoothing result, we improve the key rate by optimizing the sandwiched Rényi entropy directly rather than considering the traditional smooth min-entropy. We exemplify these new tools by considering several examples including the BB84 protocol with the qubit-based version and with a realistic parametric downconversion source, the six-state four-state protocol and a high-dimensional analog of the BB84 protocol.</p>

            <p>Quantum measurement is a physical process. What physical resources and constraints does quantum mechanics require for measurement to produce the classical world we observe? Treating measurement as a fully unitary quantum process, our goal is to show that objective, redundant, and correctly aligned outcomes are possible iff the environment begins in a specially structured, correlated subspace. We start with a minimal set of assumptions: unitarity, orthogonality of conditional environment branches, and finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Using these, we demonstrate that generic environmental states cannot support redundant and mutually consistent records of the signal, the measured quantum system. The admissible initial states form a subspace on which the measurement maps obey the Knill-Laflamme error-correction conditions, revealing that the emergence of classical objectivity relies on the environment behaving like a quantum error-correcting code. The post-measurement subspace naturally factorizes into a ``pointer'' to hold measurement outcomes and ``memory'' to retain pre-measurement quantum information about the environment's state, thereby respecting the no-deletion theorem. This further allows the identification of correlation as a finite resource consumed during measurement. Through an explicit qudit model with local interactions, we demonstrate how correlated environments yield redundant observer networks. Simulations show that record fidelity and redundancy depend on the initial correlations in the environment. This perspective links quantum Darwinism to error correction and raises the possibility that natural processes may prepare and evolutionarily favour environments capable of supporting reliable measurement.</p>

            <h2>One-Shot Distributed Source Simulation: As Quantum as it Can Get</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ian George, Min-Hsiu Hsieh, Eric Chitambar</p>
            <p>Distributed source simulation is the task where two (or more) parties share some correlated randomness and use local operations and no communication to convert this into some target correlation. Wyner's seminal result showed that asymptotically the rate of uniform shared randomness needed for this task is given by a mutual information induced measure, now referred to as Wyner's common information. This asymptotic result was extended by Hayashi in the quantum setting to separable states, the largest class of states for which this task can be performed to vanishing error. In this work we characterize this task in a near-tight manner in the one-shot setting using the smooth entropy framework. We do this by introducing one-shot operational quantities and correlation measures that characterize them. We establish asymptotic equipartition properties for our correlation measures thereby recovering the previous vanishing-error asymptotic results. In doing so, we consider technical points in one-shot network information theory and provide methods for cardinality bounds in the smooth entropy calculus. We also introduce entangled state versions of the distributed source simulation task and determine bounds in this setting via quantum embezzling. This provides a strong characterization of this network task in the one-shot, quantum regime.</p>

            <h2>A Robust Large-Period Discrete Time Crystal and its Signature in a Digital Quantum Computer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tianqi Chen, Ruizhe Shen, Ching Hua Lee, Bo Yang, Raditya Weda Bomantara</p>
            <p>Discrete time crystals (DTCs) are novel out-of-equilibrium quantum states of matter which break time translational symmetry. DTCs have been extensively realized in experiments, particularly their subclass that is characterized by period-doubling dynamics due to its natural occurrence in a system of periodically driven two-level, e.g., spin-1/2, particles. The realization of DTCs beyond period-doubling, including their generalizations termed discrete quasicrystals has also been made in recent years, though such experiments typically involve higher spin particles. Constructing and observing DTCs beyond period-doubling in systems of two-level particles are generally still considered an open challenge due to the latter's $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry that natively only leads to period-doubling. In this work, we developed an intuitive interacting system of two-level particles (qubits) that supports the more non-trivial period-quadrupling DTCs ($4T$-DTCs). Remarkably, by utilizing a variational algorithm, we are able to observe clear signatures of such $4T$-DTCs in a quantum processor despite the presence of considerable noise and the small number of available qubits. Our findings extend the landscape of time crystalline behavior by demonstrating a distinct realization of time crystallinity beyond standard period-doubling dynamics with qubits (two-level particles) on a NISQ-era digital quantum computer, as well as the potential of existing noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices for simulating exotic non-equilibrium quantum states of matter.</p>

            <h2>Asymptotic implementation of multipartite quantum channels and other quantum instruments using local operations and classical communication</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Scott M. Cohen</p>
            <p>We prove a necessary condition that a quantum channel on a multipartite system may be approximated arbitrarily closely using local operations and classical communication (LOCC). We then extend those arguments to obtain a condition that applies to all quantum instruments, which range from the most refined case, a generalized measurement, to the most coarse-grained, which is a quantum channel. We illustrate these results by a detailed analysis of a quantum instrument that is known not to be implementable by LOCC, but which can be arbitrarily closely approximated within that framework. As one outgrowth of this analysis, we find a quantum measurement that falls into the same category: it cannot be implemented exactly by LOCC, but can be approximated by LOCC arbitrarily closely. This measurement has an infinite number of outcomes, leaving open the question as to whether or not there exists a measurement within this same category but having only a finite number of outcomes.</p>

We illustrate their resilience to imperfect interactions, noise, and losses, making the buffers suitable for a realistic quantum network scenario.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kou Hamada, Yasunari Suzuki, Yuuki Tokunaga</p>
            <p>Encoding logical qubits with surface codes and performing multi-qubit logical operations with lattice surgery is one of the most promising approaches to demonstrate fault-tolerant quantum computing. Thus, a method to efficiently schedule a sequence of lattice-surgery operations is vital for high-performance fault-tolerant quantum computing. A possible strategy to improve the throughput of lattice-surgery operations is splitting a large instruction into several small instructions such as Bell state preparation and measurements and executing a part of them in advance. However, scheduling methods to fully utilize this idea have yet to be explored. In this paper, we propose a fast and high-performance scheduling algorithm for lattice-surgery instructions leveraging this strategy. We achieved this by converting the scheduling problem of lattice-surgery instructions to a graph problem of embedding 3D paths into a 3D lattice, which enables us to explore efficient scheduling by solving path search problems in the 3D lattice. Based on this reduction, we propose a method to solve the path-finding problems, look-ahead Dijkstra projection. We numerically show that this method reduced the execution time of benchmark programs generated from quantum phase estimation algorithms by 3.8 times compared with a naive method based on greedy algorithms. Our study establishes the relation between the lattice-surgery scheduling and graph search problems, which leads to further theoretical analysis on compiler optimization of fault-tolerant quantum computing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Uta Isabella Meyer, Ivan Šupić, Frédéric Grosshans, Damian Markham</p>
            <p>Self-testing identifies quantum states and correlations that exhibit nonlocality, distinguishing them, up to local transformations, from other quantum states. Due to their strong nonlocality, it is known that all graph states can be self-tested in the standard setting - where parties are not allowed to communicate. Recently it has been shown that graph states display nonlocal correlations even when bounded classical communication on the underlying graph is permitted, a feature that has found applications in proving a circuit-depth separation between classical and quantum computing. In this work, we develop self testing in the framework of bounded classical communication, and we show that certain graph states can be robustly self-tested even allowing for communication. In particular, we provide an explicit self-test for the circular graph state and the honeycomb cluster state - the latter known to be a universal resource for measurement based quantum computation. Since communication generally obstructs self-testing of graph states, we further provide a procedure to robustly self-test any graph state from larger ones that exhibit nonlocal correlations in the communication scenario.</p>

            <h2>Preparing matrix product states via fusion: constraints and extensions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David T. Stephen, Oliver Hart</p>
            <p>In the era of noisy, intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, the efficient preparation of many-body resource states is a task of paramount importance. In this paper we focus on the deterministic preparation of matrix-product states (MPS) in constant depth by utilizing measurements and classical communication to fuse smaller states into larger ones. We place strong constraints on the MPS that can be prepared using this method, which we refer to as MPS fusion. Namely, we establish that it is necessary for the MPS to have a flat entanglement spectrum. Using the recently introduced split-index MPS (SIMPS) representation, we then introduce a family of states that belong to interesting phases of matter protected by non-onsite symmetries, including anomalous and non-invertible symmetries, and also serve as resources for long-range quantum teleportation, but which lie beyond the scope of ordinary MPS fusion. It is shown constructively that these states can be prepared in constant depth using a broader class of measurement-assisted protocols, which we dub SIMPS fusion. Even in cases when MPS fusion is possible, using SIMPS fusion can give rise to significantly reduced resource overhead. We also discuss constraints on SIMPS fusion and propose a general framework for fusion that encompasses the MPS and SIMPS protocols. Our results therefore simultaneously establish the boundaries of conventional MPS fusion and push the envelope of which states can be prepared using measurement-assisted protocols.</p>

            <p>Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) represent a promising pathway toward achieving practical quantum advantage on near-term hardware. Despite this promise, for generic, expressive ansätze, their scalability is critically hindered by barren plateaus--regimes of exponentially vanishing gradients. We demonstrate that initializing a hardware-efficient, Floquet-structured ansatz within the many-body localized (MBL) phase mitigates barren plateaus and enhances algorithmic trainability. Through analysis of the inverse participation ratio, entanglement entropy, and a novel low-weight stabilizer Rényi entropy, we characterize a distinct MBL-thermalization transition. Below a critical kick strength, the circuit avoids forming a unitary 2-design, exhibits robust area-law entanglement, and maintains non-vanishing gradients. Leveraging this MBL regime facilitates the efficient variational preparation of ground states for several model Hamiltonians with significantly reduced computational resources. Crucially, experiments on a 127-qubit superconducting processor provide evidence for the preservation of trainable gradients in the MBL phase for a kicked Heisenberg chain, validating our approach on contemporary noisy hardware. Our findings position MBL-based initialization as a viable strategy for developing scalable VQAs and motivate broader integration of localization into quantum algorithm design.</p>

            <p>The existence and degeneracies of quantum exceptional, diabolical, and hybrid (i.e., diabolically degenerated exceptional) singularities of simple bosonic systems composed of up to five modes with damping and/or amplification are analyzed. Their dynamics governed by quadratic non-Hermitian Hamiltonians is followed using the Heisenberg-Langevin equations. Their dynamical matrices generally exhibit specific structures that allow for an effective reduction of their dimension by half. This facilitates analytical treatment and enables efficient spectral analysis based on characteristic second-order diabolical degeneracies. Conditions for the observation of inherited quantum hybrid points, observed directly in the dynamics of field operators, having up to third-order exceptional and second-order diabolical degeneracies are revealed. Surprisingly, exceptional degeneracies of only second and third orders are revealed, even though the systems with up to five modes are considered. Exceptional and diabolical genuine points and their degeneracies observed in the dynamics of second-order field-operator moments are also analyzed. Each analyzed bosonic system exhibits its own unique and complex dynamical behavior.</p>

            <p>We construct a family of infinitely many new candidate non-Abelian self-correcting topological quantum memories in $D\geq 5+1$ spacetime dimensions without particle excitations using local commuting non-Pauli stabilizer lattice models and field theories of $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$ higher-form gauge fields with nontrivial topological action. We call such non-Pauli stabilizer models magic stabilizer codes. The family of topological orders have Abelian electric excitations and non-Abelian magnetic excitations that obey Ising-like fusion rules and non-Abelian braiding, including Borromean ring type braiding which is a signature of non-Abelian topological order, generalizing the dihedral group $\mathbb{D}_8$ gauge theory in (2+1)D. The simplest example includes a new non-Abelian self-correcting memory in (5+1)D with Abelian loop excitations and non-Abelian membrane excitations. We prove the self-correction property and the thermal stability, and devise a probabilistic local cellular-automaton decoder. We also construct fault-tolerant non-Clifford CCZ logical gate using constant depth circuit from higher cup products in the 5D non-Abelian code. The use of higher-cup products and non-Pauli stabilizers allows us to get an $O(n^{2/5})$ distance overcoming the $O(n^{1/3})$ distance barrier in conventional topological stabilizer codes, including the 3D color code and the 6D self-correcting color code.</p>

            <p>This study examines the potential for fault-tolerant quantum computers to provide utility in fluid dynamics simulations, with a focus on drag force calculations for ship hull design. We assess whether quantum algorithms can surpass classical computational limits by generating detailed quantum resource estimates (QREs) in terms of logical qubits and $T$-gate counts. Our analysis is based on a quantum algorithm leveraging Carleman linearization of the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM), which has been suggested to offer exponential speedup. We develop efficient block encodings for LBM matrices and a method for amplitude-encoding drag force. We apply the method to the simple case of fluid flow past a sphere across a range of Reynolds numbers ($\mathrm{Re}$). We estimate the required (logical qubits)$\times$($T$-gates), finding them to be prohibitively large, ranging from $10^{21}$ to $10^{39}$. While classical simulations scale as $O(\mathrm{Re}^3)$, our QREs exhibit a modest polynomial scaling of $O(\mathrm{Re}^{2.68})$, indicating no exponential quantum advantage. We attribute this limitation to an intrinsic power-law relationship between spatial grid resolution and time-stepping requirements that is a fundamental characteristic of explicit methods for evolving nonlinear differential equations. Thus, quantum computers are unlikely to provide utility in applications that require time-evolving fluids and other systems of nonlinear differential equations.</p>

We design a control strategy and prove that it outperforms any control-free strategies, recovering the optimal Heisenberg limit up to a small error term that is intrinsic to this model. We further demonstrate the advantage of our control strategy via experiments on a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) platform.

            <p>In the realm of quantum information processing, the efficient characterization of entangled states poses an overwhelming challenge, rendering the traditional methods including quantum tomography unfeasible and impractical. To tackle this problem, we propose a new verification scheme using collective strategies, showcasing arbitrarily high efficiency that beats the optimal verification with global measurements. Our collective scheme can be implemented in various experimental platforms and scalable for large systems with a linear scaling on hardware requirement, and distributed operations are allowed. Notably, larger ensembles can always improve the efficiency further, but without increasing the quantum memory. More importantly, the approach consumes only a few copies of the entangled states, while ensuring the preservation of unmeasured ones, and even boosting their fidelity for any subsequent tasks. Furthermore, our protocol provides additional insight into the specific types of noise affecting the system, thereby facilitating potential targeted improvements. These advancements hold promise for a wide range of applications, offering a pathway towards more robust and efficient quantum information processing.</p>

Here we demonstrate the power of more general tree tensor networks for this purpose. We provide direct constructions of a number of elementary functions as generic tree tensor networks and interpolative constructions for more complicated functions via a generalization of the tensor cross interpolation algorithm. For a range of multi-dimensional functions we show how more structured tree tensor networks offer a significantly more efficient ansatz than the commonly used tensor train. We demonstrate an application of our methods to solving multi-dimensional, non-linear Fredholm equations, providing a rigorous bound on the rank of the solution which, in turn, guarantees exponentially scaling accuracy with the size of the tree tensor network for certain problems.</p>

We prove this result analytically using a quantum error correction formulation, demonstrate its applicability numerically, and discuss consequences for the disentanglability of states generated through Hamiltonian dynamics. We show that this result implies a novel representation of approximate state designs that can also facilitate their efficient generation, and we propose a novel quantum circuit compression scheme for Clifford circuits doped with non-Clifford phase gates.</p>

            <p>Quantum dynamics governs the transformation of static quantum resources, such as coherence and entanglement, in both quantum states and measurements. Prior studies have established that a quantum channel's state-cohering power can be converted into the state-entangling power without additional coherence. Here, we complete this coherence-to-entanglement paradigm by demonstrating that a channel's measurement-cohering power can likewise be converted into the measurement-entangling power. This result reinforces, on the dynamical level, the intuition that entanglement emerges as a manifestation of coherence. To formalize this picture, we develop resource theories for measurement-cohering and measurement-entangling powers and characterize the structure of incoherent measurements to analyze measurement-coherence generation. Furthermore, we show that the state-cohering power of a quantum channel is equivalent to the measurement-cohering power of its adjoint map, and a corresponding equivalence also exists between the state-entangling power and the measurement-entangling power.</p>

To allow for a comprehensive analysis of holographic code constructions, we introduce LEGO_HQEC, a software package utilizing the quantum LEGO formalism. This package constructs holographic codes on regular hyperbolic tilings and generates their stabilizer generators and logical operators for a specified number of seed codes and layers.

            <p>We investigate the extendibility problem for Brauer states, focusing on the symmetric two-sided extendibility and the de Finetti extendibility. By employing the representation theory of the unitary and orthogonal groups, we provide a general recipe for determining the set of $(n,m)$-extendible and $n$-de Finetti-extendible Brauer states. From the concrete form of the commutant of the diagonal action of the orthogonal group, we explicitly determine the set of parameters for which the Brauer states are $(1,2)$-, $(1,3)$- and $(2,2)$-extendible in any dimension $d$ and find that Brauer states extend with a non-trivial trade-off in $n$ and $m$. Using the same recipe we also provide an estimate of the set of $(1,m)$-extendible Brauer states for any $m$ and dimension $d$. Finally, using the branching rules from $\mathrm{U}(d)$ to $\mathrm{O}(d)$, we obtain the set of $n$-de Finetti-extendible Brauer states in any dimension, and also analytically describe the $n\to\infty$ limiting shape which turns out not to be a polygon for odd dimensions.</p>

            <h2>Information geometry of bosonic Gaussian thermal states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zixin Huang, Mark M. Wilde</p>
            <p>Bosonic Gaussian thermal states form a fundamental class of states in quantum information science. This paper explores the information geometry of these states, focusing on characterizing the distance between two nearby states and the geometry induced by a parameterization in terms of their mean vectors and Hamiltonian matrices. In particular, for the family of bosonic Gaussian thermal states, we derive expressions for their Fisher-Bures, Kubo-Mori, and $\alpha$-$z$ information matrices with respect to their mean vectors and Hamiltonian matrices. An important application of our formulas consists of fundamental limits on how well one can estimate these parameters. We additionally establish formulas for the derivatives and the symmetric logarithmic derivatives of bosonic Gaussian thermal states. The former could have applications in gradient descent algorithms for quantum machine learning when using bosonic Gaussian thermal states as an ansatz, and the latter in formulating optimal strategies for single parameter estimation of bosonic Gaussian thermal states. Finally, the expressions for the aforementioned information matrices could have additional applications in natural gradient descent algorithms when using bosonic Gaussian thermal states as an ansatz.</p>

            <h2>Ion-Trap Chip Architecture Optimized for Implementation of Quantum Error-Correcting Code</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jeonghoon Lee, Hyeongjun Jeon, Taehyun Kim</p>
            <p>We propose a scalable trapped-ion quantum-computing architecture that efficiently incorporates quantum error correction. The chip design exploits orthogonal qubit connectivity by assigning horizontal trap regions to transversal logical gates and vertical regions to non-transversal gates and syndrome extraction, thereby enabling universal gate operations with minimal ion shuttling and reduced hardware complexity. Using a dedicated software tool, we evaluate the architecture on several benchmark algorithms and scheduling policies for two-dimensional color code of varying code distance. Our results demonstrate that increasing the code distance by two reduces the effective logical two-qubit gate error probability by approximately two orders of magnitude, reaching values as low as $10^{-8}$ with the $[[31, 1, 7]]$ color code. This improvement substantially expands the range of algorithms that can be executed reliably, up to scales of a few thousand logical qubits, depending on the algorithmic structure. Overall, these findings validate the practicality and scalability of the proposed architecture and its control strategies, highlighting a viable route toward fault-tolerant, trapped-ion quantum computing.</p>

            <h2>Nonclassical nullifiers for quantum hypergraph states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhijith Ravikumar, Darren W. Moore, Radim Filip</p>
            <p>Quantum hypergraph states form a generalisation of the graph state formalism that goes beyond the pairwise (dyadic) interactions imposed by remaining inside the Gaussian approximation. Networks of such states are able to achieve universality for continuous variable measurement based quantum computation with only Gaussian measurements. For normalised states, the simplest hypergraph states are formed from $k$-adic interactions among a collection of $k$ harmonic oscillator ground states. However such powerful resources have not yet been observed in experiments and their robustness and scalability have not been tested. Here we develop and analyse necessary criteria for hypergraph nonclassicality based on simultaneous nonlinear squeezing in the nullifiers of hypergraph states. We put forward an essential analysis of their robustness to realistic scenarios involving thermalisation or loss and suggest several basic proof-of-principle options for experiments to observe nonclassicality in hypergraph states.</p>

            <p>The unification of quantum theory and the general theory of relativity - describing gravity, is one of the most important challenges in science. Einstein's general theory of relativity is based on the principle of equivalence, and has been confirmed to great accuracy for large bodies. However, in the quantum domain the equivalence principle has been predicted to take a unique form involving a gauge phase, equal to the quantum phase of a free-falling object. To measure this phase, we realize a novel cold-atom interferometer in which one wave-packet stays static in the laboratory frame while the other is in free fall. The observed relative-phase of the wave-packets confirms the predicted phase of a free-falling object, and shows that in our low energy regime, the equivalence principle may be applied to the quantum domain. Our observation constitutes a fundamental test of the interface between quantum theory and gravity. The new interferometer also opens the door for further probing of the latter interface, as well as to searches for new physics.</p>

            <p>In this work we introduce a superconducting quantum processor architecture that uses a transmission-line resonator to implement effective all-to-all connectivity between six transmon qubits. This architecture can be used as a test-bed for algorithms that benefit from high connectivity. We show that the central resonator can be used as a computational element, which offers the flexibility to encode a qubit for quantum computation or to utilize its bosonic modes which further enables quantum simulation of bosonic systems. To operate the quantum processing unit (QPU), we develop and benchmark the qubit-resonator conditional Z gate and the qubit-resonator MOVE operation. The latter allows for transferring a quantum state between one of the peripheral qubits and the computational resonator. We benchmark the QPU performance and achieve a genuinely multi-qubit entangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state over all six qubits with a readout-error mitigated fidelity of $0.86$.</p>

            <h2>Bridging wire and gate cutting with ZX-calculus</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marco Schumann, Tobias Stollenwerk, Alessandro Ciani</p>
            <p>Quantum circuit cutting refers to a series of techniques that allow one to partition a quantum computation on a large quantum computer into several quantum computations on smaller devices. This usually comes at the price of a sampling overhead, that is quantified by the $1$-norm of the associated decomposition. The applicability of these techniques relies on the possibility of finding decompositions of the ideal, global unitaries into quantum operations that can be simulated onto each sub-register, which should ideally minimize the $1$-norm. In this work, we show how these decompositions can be obtained diagrammatically using ZX-calculus expanding on the work of Ufrecht et al. [arXiv:2302.00387]. The central idea of our work is that since in ZX-calculus only connectivity matters, it should be possible to cut wires in ZX-diagrams by inserting known decompositions of the identity in standard quantum circuits. We show how, using this basic idea, many of the gate decompositions known in the literature can be re-interpreted as an instance of wire cuts in ZX-diagrams. Furthermore, we obtain improved decompositions for multi-qubit controlled-Z (MCZ) gates with $1$-norm equal to $3$ for any number of qubits and any partition, which we argue to be optimal. Our work gives new ways of thinking about circuit cutting that can be particularly valuable for finding decompositions of large unitary gates. Besides, it sheds light on the question of why exploiting classical communication decreases the 1-norm of a wire cut but does not do so for certain gate decompositions. In particular, using wire cuts with classical communication, we obtain gate decompositions that do not require classical communication.</p>

            <p>Sharing logical entangled pairs between distant quantum nodes is a key process to achieve fault tolerant quantum computation and communication. However, there is a gap between current experimental specifications and theoretical requirements for sharing logical entangled states while improving experimental techniques. Here, we propose an efficient logical entanglement distribution protocol based on surface codes for two distant 2D qubit array with nearest-neighbor interaction. A notable feature of our protocol is that it allows post-selection according to error estimations, which provides the tunability between the infidelity of logical entanglements and the success probability of the protocol. With this feature, the fidelity of encoded logical entangled states can be improved by sacrificing success rates. We numerically evaluated the performance of our protocol and the trade-off relationship, and found that our protocol enables us to prepare logical entangled states while improving fidelity in feasible experimental parameters. We also discuss a possible physical implementation using neutral atom arrays to show the feasibility of our protocol.</p>

            <p>A protocol involving the repetitive (twofold, to be precise) application of PBT protocol to the same resource is studied. The quantities characterizing the resulting protocol, so-called \textit{two-step PBT}, namely \textit{enatnglement fidelity} and \textit{success probability} are provided for two scenarios, relying on application of pretty-good measurement, i.e. deterministic and probabilistic PBT with non-EPR resource. This results show that two-step PBT is an accurate protocol, provided the resource is sufficiently large. In particular, the deterministic two-step PBT obtains fidelity that is remarkably close to the optimal MPBT fidelity for teleportation of two quantum states. Additionally, the \textit{recycling fidelity}, i.e. the quantity characterizing the degradation of the resource state is calculated for repetitive application of probabilistic protocol, for both EPR and optimized resource, showing that entanglement recycling with two-step PBT is possible in the former case as well.</p>

            <h2>Q-Cluster: Quantum Error Mitigation Through Noise-Aware Unsupervised Learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hrushikesh Pramod Patil, Dror Baron, Huiyang Zhou</p>
            <p>Quantum error mitigation (QEM) is critical in reducing the impact of noise in the pre-fault-tolerant era, and is expected to complement error correction in fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC). In this paper, we propose a novel QEM approach, Q-Cluster, that uses unsupervised learning (clustering) to reshape the measured bit-string distribution. Our approach starts with a simplified bit-flip noise model. It first performs clustering on noisy measurement results, i.e., bit-strings, based on the Hamming distance. The centroid of each cluster is calculated using a qubit-wise majority vote. Next, the noisy distribution is adjusted with the clustering outcomes and the bit-flip error rates using Bayesian inference. Our simulation results show that Q-Cluster can mitigate high noise rates (up to 40% per qubit) with the simple bit-flip noise model. However, real quantum computers do not fit such a simple noise model. To address the problem, we (a) apply Pauli twirling to tailor the complex noise channels to Pauli errors, and (b) employ a machine learning model, ExtraTrees regressor, to estimate an effective bit-flip error rate using a feature vector consisting of machine calibration data (gate & measurement error rates), circuit features (number of qubits, numbers of different types of gates, etc.) and the shape of the noisy distribution (entropy). Our experimental results show that our proposed Q-Cluster scheme improves the fidelity by a factor of 1.46x, on average, compared to the unmitigated output distribution, for a set of low-entropy benchmarks on five different IBM quantum machines. Our approach outperforms the state-of-art QEM approaches M3 [24], Hammer [35], and QBEEP [33] by 1.29x, 1.47x, and 2.65x, respectively.</p>

This combined system achieves full controllability and exhibits enhanced performance for nanoscale magnetic sensing, including an improved dynamic range. Moreover, we investigate the rich many-body spin dynamics within the hybrid system, which enables us to estimate the concentration of V_B^- spins.

This mechanism further facilitates remote generation of W-class entangled states. Our results thereby open exciting possibilities for quantum networks and quantum information processing.</p>

            <h2>Heterogeneously error-corrected QRAMs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ansh Singal, Kaitlin N. Smith</p>
            <p>Quantum Random Access Memory (QRAM) holds the promise of enabling several large scale applications of quantum computers. However, designing fault tolerant QRAMs for large scale applications is still an open problem due to the poor error and resource scaling of current architectures. Existing protocols often overlook the need for error correcting QRAMs, which will be required for data-intensive, fault-tolerant applications. However, naively error correcting all qubits used to implement the QRAM is prohibitively resource intensive, quickly becoming infeasible for large applications. To fill this gap, we propose a novel QRAM architecture that leverages variable strength error correction. We strongly error-correct qubits that heavily influence query fidelity, and lightly correct less critical regions of the QRAM. This scheme produces queries with fidelity bounded by a constant for arbitrarily sized QRAMs without requiring improvements in physical hardware. Furthermore, the heterogeneous scheme requires 5x fewer resources (for depth 30 QRAM) and quadratically slower error scaling as compared to a uniformly error corrected Bucket Brigade QRAM. In this work, we present a rigorous analysis of the query fidelity scaling and perform resource analyses of two variations of the heterogeneous architecture using the surface code. We verify our results using numerical simulations and compare our results against several other existing QRAM techniques. Through our results, we quantitatively prove the optimal scaling of the heterogeneous architecture, paving a way for data-intensive and fault tolerant quantum applications.</p>

            <p>We investigate a one-dimensional quantum system with a self-similar arrangement of delta-function potential barriers, exhibiting discrete scale invariance. The singular potential induces kinematically enforced symmetry breaking at $x=0$, decoupling the positive and negative spatial regions and leading to non-symmetric zero-energy states. We demonstrate that the system supports a unique zero-energy wavefunction, which, though not square-integrable, decays to zero at infinity and acts as a bound-like state with self-similar properties under discrete scaling transformations, akin to Efimov physics but limited to a single state. In momentum space, this wavefunction exhibits a threshold singularity at low momenta, with behavior depending on the scaling exponent $\alpha$:power-law divergence and log-periodic modulations for $0 < \alpha < 1$, logarithmic divergence for $\alpha = 1$, and a finite limit for $\alpha > 1$, which may be observable through time-of-flight or spectroscopic measurements in cold atom experiments. The system's continuous spectrum, starting at zero energy, lacks discrete bound states. These findings highlight the role of singular potentials in generating scale-invariant quantum phenomena and provide a minimal framework for studying discrete scale symmetry and its potential experimental signatures.</p>

            <p>Quantum sensing and metrology present one of the most promising near-term applications in the field of quantum technologies, with quantum sensors enabling unprecedented precision in measurements of electric, magnetic or gravitational fields and displacements. Experimental loss at the detection stage remains one of the key obstacles to achieving a truly quantum advantage in many practical scenarios. Here, we combine the capabilities of Rydberg atoms to both sense external fields and be used for quantum information processing, thereby largely overcoming the issue of detection losses. While utilising the large dipole moments of Rydberg atoms in an ensemble to achieve a $\SI{39}{\nV\per\cm \hertz\tothe{-1/2}}$ sensitivity, we employ inter-atomic dipolar interactions to take advantage of an error-prevention protocol that protects information against conventional losses at the detection stage. Counterintuitively, the protocol's idea is based on introducing an additional non-linear, lossy quantum channel, which results in a 3.3-fold enhancement of Fisher information. The presented results pave the way for broader adoption of quantum-information-inspired enhancements enabled by intrinsic interactions present in a sensor system, and more broadly in practical quantum metrology and communication, without the need for a general-purpose quantum computer.</p>

            <p>Qubit control protocols have traditionally leveraged a characterisation of the qubit-bath coupling via its power spectral density. Previous work proposed the inference of noise operators that characterise the influence of a classical bath using a grey-box approach that combines deep neural networks with physics-encoded layers. This overall structure is complex and poses challenges in scaling and real-time operations. Here, we show that no expensive neural networks are needed and that this noise operator description admits an efficient parameterisation. We refer to the resulting parameter space as the \textit{quantum feature space} of the qubit dynamics resulting from the coupled bath. We show that the Euclidean distance defined over the quantum feature space provides an effective method for classifying noise processes in the presence of a given set of controls. Using the quantum feature space as the input space for a simple machine learning algorithm (random forest, in this case), we demonstrate that it can effectively classify the stationarity and the broad class of noise processes perturbing a qubit. Finally, we explore how control pulse parameters map to the quantum feature space.</p>

            <h2>Insightful Approach to Quantum Noise Suppression Below the Standard Quantum Limit Using a Single Mirror and Beam Splitter</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sun-Hyun Youn</p>
            <p>When a coherent electromagnetic wave passes through a beam splitter (BS), it is divided equally into two parts. However, the quantum noise associated with the resulting coherent states, despite being reduced in amplitude by half, remains fundamentally constrained by the quantum noise limit, independent of the intensity. By placing a mirror at the unused input port of the BS, a standing wave is formed in the vicinity of the mirror, which influences the vacuum fluctuations of the coherent state at the BS output. Using semi-classical and quantum mechanical approaches, we calculate the vacuum fluctuations induced by the mirror and demonstrate that the vacuum noise originating from the mirror side periodically reaches zero at the BS output. Leveraging this effect, we show that the vacuum fluctuations of the light split by the BS can be readily reduced below the quantum noise limit. Furthermore, through feedback mechanisms, the vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field at the other output port can also be suppressed below the quantum noise limit. These findings provide a pivotal insight into the manipulation of electromagnetic noise, with broad implications for all experiments involving quantum noise control.</p>

We show that a square root law (SRL) for covert entanglement generation similar to that for classical communication: $L_{\rm EG}\sqrt{n}$ entangled bits (ebits) can be generated covertly and reliably over $n$ uses of a bosonic channel. We report a single-letter expression for optimal $L_{\rm EG}$ as well as an achievable method. We additionally analyze the performance of covert entanglement generation using single- and dual-rail photonic qubits, which may be more practical for physical implementation.</p>

            <p>The learning of the physical world relies on sensing and data post-processing. When the signals are weak, multidimensional and correlated, the performance of learning is often bottlenecked by the quality of sensors, calling for integrating quantum sensing into the learning of such physical-layer data. An example of such a learning scenario is the stochastic quadrature displacements of electromagnetic fields, modeling optomechanical force sensing, radiofrequency photonic sensing, microwave cavity weak signal sensing, and other applications. We propose a unified protocol that combines machine learning with interferometric photon counting to reduce noise and reveal correlations. By applying variational quantum learning with multimode programmable quantum measurements, we enhance signal extraction. Our results show that multimode interferometric photon counting outperforms conventional homodyne detection proposed in prior works for tasks like principal component analysis (PCA) and cross-correlation analysis (CCA), even below vacuum noise levels. To further enhance the performance, we also integrate entanglement-enhanced modules, in the form of squeezed state distribution and anti-squeezing at detection, into the protocol. Combining multimode interferometric photon counting and multipartite entanglement, the proposed protocol provides a powerful toolbox for learning weak signals.</p>

            <p>In the typical implementation of a quantum error-correcting code, each stabilizer is measured by entangling one or more ancilla qubits with the data qubits and measuring the ancilla qubits to deduce the value of the stabilizer. Recently, the dynamic circuit approach has been introduced, in which stabilizers are measured without ancilla qubits. Here, we demonstrate that dynamic circuits are particularly useful for the Floquet code. Our dynamic circuit increases the timelike distance of the code, automatically removes leakage, and both significantly increases the threshold and lowers the logical error rate compared to the standard ancilla-based circuit. At a physical error rate of $10^{-3}$, we estimate a nearly $3\times$ reduction in the number of qubits required to reach a $10^{-12}$ logical error rate.</p>

            <h2>Continuous-time parametrization of neural quantum states for quantum dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dingzu Wang, Wenxuan Zhang, Xiansong Xu, Dario Poletti</p>
            <p>Neural quantum states are a promising framework for simulating many-body quantum dynamics, as they can represent states with volume-law entanglement. As time evolves, the neural network parameters are typically optimized at discrete time steps to approximate the wave function at each point in time. Given the differentiability of the wave function stemming from the Schrödinger equation, here we impose a time-continuous and differentiable parameterization of the neural network by expressing its parameters as linear combinations of temporal basis functions with trainable, time-independent coefficients. We test this ansatz, referred to as the smooth neural quantum state (\textit{s}-NQS) with a loss function defined over an extended time interval, under a sudden quench of a non-integrable many-body quantum spin chain. We demonstrate accurate time evolution using a restricted Boltzmann machine as the instantaneous neural network architecture. We show that the parameterization enables accurate simulations with fewer variational parameters, independent of time-step resolution. Furthermore, the smooth neural quantum state also allows us to initialize and evaluate the wave function at times not included in the training set, both within and beyond the training interval.</p>

            <h2>Approximate combinatorial optimization with Rydberg atoms: the barrier of interpretability</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christian de Correc, Thomas Ayral, Corentin Bertrand</p>
            <p>Analog quantum computing with Rydberg atoms is seen as an avenue to solve hard graph optimization problems, because they naturally encode the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem on Unit-Disk (UD) graphs, a problem that admits rather efficient approximation schemes on classical computers. Going beyond UD-MIS to address generic graphs requires embedding schemes, typically with chains of ancilla atoms, and an interpretation algorithm to map results back to the original problem. However, interpreting approximate solutions obtained with realistic quantum computers proves to be a difficult problem. As a case study, we evaluate the ability of two interpretation strategies to correct errors in the recently introduced Crossing Lattice embedding. We find that one strategy, based on finding the closest embedding solution, leads to very high qualities, albeit at an exponential cost. The second strategy, based on ignoring defective regions of the embedding graph, is polynomial in the graph size, but it leads to a degradation of the solution quality which is prohibitive under realistic assumptions on the defect generation. Moreover, more favorable defect scalings lead to a contradiction with well-known approximability conjectures. Therefore, it is unlikely that a scalable and generic improvement in solution quality can be achieved with Rydberg platforms -- thus moving the focus to heuristic algorithms.</p>

            <h2>Extended parameter shift rules with minimal derivative variance for parameterized quantum circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhijian Lai, Jiang Hu, Dong An, Zaiwen Wen</p>
            <p>Parameter shift rules (PSRs) are useful methods for computing arbitrary-order derivatives of the cost function in parameterized quantum circuits. The basic idea of PSRs is to evaluate the cost function at different parameter shifts, then use specific coefficients to combine them linearly to obtain the exact derivatives. In this work, we propose an extended parameter shift rule (EPSR) which generalizes a broad range of existing PSRs and has the following two advantages. First, EPSR offers an infinite number of possible parameter shifts, allowing the selection of the optimal parameter shifts to minimize the final derivative variance and thereby obtaining the more accurate derivative estimates with limited quantum resources. Second, EPSR extends the scope of the PSRs in the sense that EPSR can handle arbitrary Hermitian operator $H$ in gate $U(x) = \exp (iHx)$ in the parameterized quantum circuits, while existing PSRs are valid only for simple Hermitian generators $H$ such as simple Pauli words. Additionally, we show that the widely used ``general PSR'', introduced by Wierichs et al. (2022), is a special case of our EPSR, and we prove that it yields globally optimal shifts for minimizing the derivative variance under the weighted-shot scheme. Finally, through numerical simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of EPSR and show that the usage of the optimal parameter shifts indeed leads to more accurate derivative estimates.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Seniority-based Subspace Expansion: Linear Combinations of Short-Circuit Unitary Transformations for the Electronic Structure Problem</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Smik Patel, Praveen Jayakumar, Rick Huang, Tao Zeng, Artur F. Izmaylov</p>
            <p>Quantum SENiority-based Subspace Expansion (Q-SENSE) is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm that interpolates between the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and Configuration Interaction (CI) methods. It constructs Hamiltonian matrix elements on a quantum device and solves the resulting eigenvalue problem classically. Unlike other expansion-based methods -- such as Quantum Subspace Expansion (QSE), Quantum Krylov Algorithms, and the Non-Orthogonal Quantum Eigensolver -- Q-SENSE introduces seniority operators as artificial symmetries to construct orthogonal basis states. This seniority-symmetry-based approach reduces one of the primary limitations of VQE on near-term quantum hardware -- circuit depth -- at the cost of measuring additional matrix elements. The artificial symmetries also reduce the number of Hamiltonian terms that must be measured, as only a small fraction of the terms couple basis states in different seniority subspaces. With all these merits, Q-SENSE offers a scalable and resource-efficient route to quantum advantage on near-term quantum devices and in the early fault-tolerant regime.</p>

            <h2>A method for the numerical analysis of hybrid lumped-distributed superconducting quantum circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Simona Zaccaria, Antonio Gnudi</p>
            <p>We present a method for the numerical analysis of superconducting quantum circuits combining lumped elements, either linear or non-linear (i.e.~Josephson junctions), and distributed coplanar waveguide (CPW) structures. CPW transmission lines and multiline couplers are directly modeled without discretizing them into lumped-element equivalents, and the circuit Hamiltonian parameters are extracted by using the energy participation ratio (EPR) method. This approach enables fast and accurate extraction of mode frequencies, anharmonicities, cross-Kerr interactions, and Purcell decay rates without relying on full electromagnetic simulations, while naturally accounting for higher-order modes of distributed components. We have implemented the proposed method in a Python framework, QuLTRA (Quantum hybrid Lumped and TRansmission lines circuits Analyzer), which we have used to validate the approach against full electromagnetic simulations (Ansys HFSS, pyEPR), existing circuit-analysis tools (QuCAT), and designs reported in the literature. The comparisons show excellent agreement with orders-of-magnitude reductions in computational time relative to full-wave solvers. We demonstrate applications including Purcell-protected readout, multimode ultra-strong coupling, and multiplexed qubit readout, illustrating how the method can support fast and reliable early-stage circuit design.</p>

            <h2>Geometric Discord of any arbitrary dimensional bipartite system and its application in quantum key distribution</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rashi Jain, Satyabrata Adhikari</p>
            <p>Entangled quantum states are regarded as a key resource in quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols. However, quantum correlations, other than entanglement can also play a significant role in the QKD protocols. In this work, we will focus on one such measure of quantum correlation, known as geometric quantum discord (GQD). Firstly, we derive an analytical expression of GQD for two-qutrit quantum systems and further generalize it for $d_1\otimes d_2$ dimensional systems. Next, we apply the concept of GQD in studying QKD. In particular, if the shared resource state is an entangled state constructed with the linear combination of the tensor product of the Bell pair and the state $\sigma_i$'s, $i=0,1,2,3$, then we have shown that under some assumption on $\sigma_i$'s, the lower bound for a distillable secret key rate $K_D$ can be expressed in terms of GQD of $\frac{\sigma_0+\sigma_1}{2}$ and $\frac{\sigma_2+\sigma_3}{2}$. Thus, the distillable key rate depends upon the GQD of $\frac{\sigma_0+\sigma_1}{2}$ and $\frac{\sigma_2+\sigma_3}{2}$, when the communicating parties uses private states for generating a secret key in presence of an eavesdropper. Further, for a certain range of GQD of $\frac{\sigma_0+\sigma_1}{2}$ and $\frac{\sigma_2+\sigma_3}{2}$, we find that there exists some NPT entangled resource state for which the successful generation of the secret key may not be guaranteed. We, moreover study the behavior of distillable key rate when the geometric discord of $\frac{\sigma_0+\sigma_1}{2}$ and $\frac{\sigma_2+\sigma_3}{2}$ increases, decreases or remains constant, with the help of a few examples.</p>

            <h2>A Modular, Adaptive, and Scalable Quantum Factoring Algorithm</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alok Shukla, Prakash Vedula</p>
            <p>Shor's algorithm for integer factorization offers an exponential speedup over classical methods but remains impractical on Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware due to the need for many coherent qubits and very deep circuits. Building on our recent work on adaptive and windowed phase-estimation methods, we have developed a modular, windowed formulation of Shor's algorithm that mitigates these limitations by restructuring phase estimation into shallow, independent circuit blocks that can be executed sequentially or in parallel, followed by lightweight classical postprocessing. This approach allows for a reduction in the size of the phase (or counting) register from a large number of qubits down to a small, fixed block size of only a few qubits (for example, three or four phase qubits were sufficient for the computational examples considered in this work), while leaving the work register requirement unchanged. The independence of the blocks allows for parallel execution and makes the approach more compatible with near-term hardware than the standard Shor's formulation. An additional feature of the framework is the overlap mechanism, which introduces redundancy between blocks and enables robust reconstruction of phase information, though zero-overlap configurations can also succeed in certain regimes. Numerical simulations verify the correctness of the modular formulation while also showing substantial reductions in counting qubits per block.</p>

            <p>We present a microscopic derivation of a master equation for two-component bosons (bosonic qubits) which tunnel between spatially separated modes under local dephasing noise. Starting from the full system-bath Hamiltonian with Lorentzian coupling distributions, we analytically obtain a time-local master equation whose structure reveals intrinsic non-Markovian features and recovers the standard phenomenological dephasing model in the short-time limit. Comparison with exact pseudomode simulations confirms its validity beyond weak-coupling and Markovian regimes. We identify a resonance condition between tunneling and bath frequencies for which dephasing drives the system towards correlated steady states, stabilizing coherence and entanglement instead of suppressing them. These results establish a rigorous microscopic foundation for dephasing models in bosonic tunneling systems and reveal a noise-induced mechanism for steady-state entanglement.</p>

            <p>Having multiple Bell pairs shared by distant quantum registers provides a key resource for both quantum networks and distributed quantum computing. In this paper, we present a protocol for parallelized Bell-pair generation that uses the phase of a coherent light pulse to encode a qudit, enabling the simultaneous generation of multiple Bell pairs. By encoding a qudit in a basis of light-matter Schrödinger's cat states, the loss of a photon in transit can be detected through an $XX$ parity syndrome, allowing the backaction due to the lost photon to be deterministically corrected through single-qubit rotations. The protocol presented here is compatible with existing technologies in both optical and microwave (circuit QED) architectures, supporting near-term implementation across diverse quantum platforms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kevin Player</p>
            <p>The Unruh effect, central to quantum field theory in curved spacetime, states that uniformly accelerated observers perceive the Minkowski vacuum as a thermal ensemble of Rindler excitations. Building on this foundation and drawing analogies from squeezing in quantum optics, we investigate how entangled, non-thermal excitations generated by bilocal driving sources contribute to the accelerated response. These paired excitations act as inertial microstates within the thermal Unruh ensemble, suggesting that portions of the effect can be interpreted as source-driven. To capture this, we employ modular automorphisms from algebraic QFT to track localization of modes and observers across nested Rindler wedges. We then construct compact wave-packet approximations using parabolic cylinder functions, providing a smooth interpolation between wedge-supported thermal modes and fully localized non-thermal excitations. This approach situates the Unruh response within a broader framework where standard thermality emerges alongside, and sometimes from, localized source-induced structure.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Praveen Jayakumar, Tao Zeng, Artur F. Izmaylov</p>
            <p>Exact unitary transformations play a central role in the analysis and simulation of many-body quantum systems, yet the conditions under which they can be carried out exactly and efficiently remain incompletely understood. We show that exact transformations arise whenever the adjoint action of a unitary's generator defines a linear map within a finite-dimensional operator space. In this regime, there exists a finite-degree polynomial that annihilates the adjoint map, rendering the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion finite. We identify the role of Lie algebras and their modules in producing finite BCH expansions in all known cases. This perspective brings together previously disparate examples of exact transformations under a single unifying principle and clarifies how algebraic relations between generators and transformed operators determine the polynomial degree of the transformation. We illustrate this framework for previously known cases of efficient unitary transformations including unitary coupled-cluster and Pauli product generators. Using this framework, we propose a new class of fermionic generators that can be used for efficient transformations. The result establishes sufficient algebraic conditions for when exact unitary transformations are possible and provides new strategies for reducing their computational cost in quantum simulation and constructing feasible unitary transformations.</p>

This combined approach reveals real-time energy exchange dynamics and reproduces key phenomena such as anti-crossing behavior and the suppression of ferromagnetic resonance under strong electromagnetic fields. By addressing the multiscale and multiphysics challenges in magnon-photon modeling, our framework enables scalable simulation and rapid prototyping of next-generation quantum and spintronic devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Markus Heinrich, Jonas Haferkamp, Ingo Roth, Jonas Helsen</p>
            <p>Until very recently, it was generally believed that the (approximate) 2-design property is strictly stronger than anti-concentration of random quantum circuits, mainly because it was shown that the latter anti-concentrate in logarithmic depth, while the former generally need linear depth circuits. This belief was disproven by recent results which show that so-called relative-error approximate unitary designs can in fact be generated in logarithmic depth, implying anti-concentration. Their result does however not apply to ordinary local random circuits, a gap which we close in this paper, at least for 2-designs. More precisely, we show that anti-concentration of local random quantum circuits already implies that they form relative-error approximate state 2-designs, making them equivalent properties for these ensembles. Our result holds more generally for any random circuit which is invariant under local (single-qubit) unitaries, independent of the architecture.</p>

            <p>Mixed-state phase transitions have recently attracted growing attention as a new frontier in nonequilibrium quantum matter and quantum information. In this work, we introduce the measurement-dressed imaginary-time evolution (MDITE) as a novel framework to explore mixed-state quantum phases and decoherence-driven criticality. In this setup, alternating imaginary-time evolution and projective measurements generate a competition between coherence-restoring dynamics and decoherence-inducing events. While reminiscent of monitored unitary circuits, MDITE fundamentally differs in that the physics is encoded in decoherent mixed states rather than in quantum trajectories. We demonstrate that this interplay gives rise to a novel class of mixed-state phase transitions, using numerical simulations of the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model and the two-dimensional columnar dimerized Heisenberg model. Notably, the observed transitions do not fall into any previously established universality classes. Furthermore, we provide a diagrammatic representation of the evolving state, which naturally enables efficient studies of MDITE with quantum Monte Carlo and other many-body numerical methods, thereby extending investigations of mixed-state phase transitions to large-scale and higher-dimensional systems. In addition, the representation provides a natural interpretation of the phase transitions in terms of cluster formation within the simulations. Our results highlight MDITE as a powerful paradigm for investigating non-unitary dynamics and the fundamental role of decoherence in many-body quantum systems.</p>

            <p>Quantum circuits are considered more powerful than classical circuits and require exponential resources to simulate classically. Clifford circuits are a special class of quantum circuits that can be simulated in polynomial time but still show important quantum effects such as entanglement. In this work, we present an algorithm that simulates Clifford circuits by performing Gaussian elimination on a modified adjacency matrix derived from the circuit structure. Our work builds on an ZX-calculus tensor network representation of Clifford circuits that reduces to quantum graph states. We give a concise formula of amplitudes of graph states based on the LDL decomposition of matrices over GF(2), and use it to get efficient algorithms for strong and weak simulation of Clifford circuits using tree-decomposition-based fast LDL algorithm. The complexity of our algorithm matches the state of art for weak graph state simulation and improves the state of art for strong graph state simulation by taking advantage of Strassen-like fast matrix multiplication. Our algorithm is also efficient when computing many amplitudes or samples of a Clifford circuit. Further, our amplitudes formula provides a new characterization of locally Clifford equivalent graph states as well as an efficient protocol to learn graph states with low-rank adjacency matrices.</p>

            <p>Amplitude damping fundamentally limits qubit lifetimes by irreversibly leaking energy and information into the environment. Standard Wiseman--Milburn feedback offers only modest improvement because it acts on a single measured quadrature and its corrective drive is degraded by loop delay. We introduce a compact hybrid upgrade with two components: (i) a coherently coupled \emph{ancilla} qubit that receives the homodyne current and feeds back \emph{quantum-coherently} on the system, recovering information from \emph{both} field quadratures and intentionally engineered to decay much faster than the system; and (ii) a lightweight supervised predictor that forecasts the near-future homodyne current, phase-aligning the correction to overcome hardware latency. A Lindblad treatment yields closed-form effective decay rates: the ancilla suppresses the emission channel by a cooperativity factor, while the predictor further suppresses the residual decay in proportion to forecast quality. Using IBM-scale parameters (baseline \(T_1 = 50~\mu\mathrm{s}\)), numerical simulations surpass the W--M limit, achieving \(\sim 3\!-\!4\times\) longer \(T_1\) together with improved population retention and integrated energy. The method is modular and hardware-compatible: ancilla coupling and supervised prediction can be added to existing W--M loops to convert leaked information into a precise, time-advanced corrective drive. We also include a detailed, student-friendly derivation of the effective rates for both ancilla-assisted and prediction-enhanced feedback, making the impact of each design element analytically transparent.</p>

            <p>Electron-on-neon (eNe) qubits have recently emerged as a compelling platform for quantum computing, which combines the vacuum isolation advantages of trapped-ion qubits with the scalability of superconducting circuits. In this system, electrons are trapped in vacuum above a solid neon film deposited on superconducting microwave resonators, where they exhibit strong coupling to the resonators, coherence times of ~0.1 ms, and single-qubit gate fidelities exceeding 99.97%. A central challenge, however, is the spontaneous binding of electrons to neon surface bumps. These bumps, originating from substrate roughness, vary in size: electrons on bumps of suitable sizes within the resonator can couple to microwave photons and function as qubits, whereas those on unfavorable bumps remain inactive yet contribute to background charge noise. Moreover, both the bump landscape and the sites where electrons bind differ from run to run, leading to variable qubit characteristics that hinder scalability. To address this challenging issue, we present an on-chip magnetic-levitation architecture in which arrays of solid-neon microparticles are suspended above the processor chip to act as electron carriers. This design eliminates substrate effects while retaining strong qubit-resonator coupling and supporting inter-qubit connectivity. Our analysis further shows that the qubit transition frequency can be tuned across the gigahertz range and its anharmonicity can reach ~0.8 GHz by tuning the resonator bias voltage. Together, these features suggest a promising pathway toward robust, reproducible, and scalable eNe-based quantum computing.</p>

            <p>High-performance single-photon detectors (SPDs) are indispensable components for a wide range of quantum optical applications. However, the reliance of state-of-the-art devices on superconducting materials imposes severe technological demands and necessitates challenging operational conditions, such as cryogenics, thereby hindering scalable implementation. To address this, we propose the Enhanced Single-Photon Detector (ESPD) framework, a novel paradigm for achieving high-performance SPDs through the iterative enhancement of conventional room-temperature SPDs. Relying entirely on non-superconducting components and eliminating cryogenic cooling requirements, the ESPD scheme can upgrade a legacy SPD, with detection efficiency (DE) about $59\%$ and dark count rate (DCR) of $10^{-2}$, to a device with superior performance metrics, achieving DE exceeding $93\%$ and DCR below $10^{-9}$. This performance rivals or even surpasses that of state-of-the-art superconducting SPDs, allowing the minimal tolerable channel transmission rate for quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols to be reduced by several orders of magnitude. Although the architecture requires substantial integration effort, the scheme can provide superconducting-level performance without cryogenic cooling, offering a clear path toward the widespread deployment of high-performance SPDs as well as related quantum technologies in infrastructure-constrained environments.</p>

            <p>The task of conclusive exclusion for a set of quantum states is to find a measurement such that for each state in the set, there is an outcome that allows one to conclude with certainty that the state in question was not prepared. Defining classicality of statistics as realizability by a generalized-noncontextual ontological model, we show that there is a quantum-over-classical advantage for how well one can achieve conclusive exclusion. This is achieved in an experimental scenario motivated by the construction appearing in the Pusey-Barrett-Rudolph theorem. We derive noise-robust noncontextuality inequalities bounding the conclusiveness of exclusion, and describe a quantum violation of these. Finally, we show that this bound also constitutes a classical causal compatibility inequality within the bilocality scenario, and that its violation in quantum theory yields a novel possibilistic proof of a quantum-classical gap in that scenario.</p>

            <p>We study two entanglement measures in a large family of isotropic many-body states including incompressible quantum Hall liquids and quantum critical systems: the logarithmic negativity (LN), and mutual information (MI). For pure states, obtained for example from a bipartition at zero temperature, these provide distinct characterizations of the entanglement present between two spatial subregions, while for mixed states (such as at finite temperature) only the LN remains a good entanglement measure. Our focus is on regions that have corners, either adjacent or tip-touching. We first obtain general non-perturbative properties regarding the geometrical dependence of the LN and MI. A close similarity is observed with mutual charge fluctuations, where super-universal angle dependence holds allowing for explicit checks. For the MI, we make stronger statements due to strong subadditivity. We also give ramifications of our general analysis to conformal field theories (CFTs) in two spatial dimensions. We then explicitly verify these properties with integer quantum Hall states. To do so we develop two independent approaches to obtain the fermionic LN, which takes into account Fermi statistics: an overlap-matrix method, and a real-space lattice discretization. At finite temperature, we find a rapid decrease of the LN well inside the cyclotron gap at integer fillings. We further show that the LN decays faster compared to the MI at high temperatures.</p>

            <h2>Generalized Gibbs Ensemble from Eigenstate Entanglement Hamiltonian</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hao Chen, Biao Lian</p>
            <p>Relaxed quantum systems with conservation laws are believed to be approximated by the Generalized Gibbs Ensemble (GGE), which incorporates the constraints of certain conserved quantities serving as integrals of motion. By drawing an analogy between eigenstate reduced density matrix and GGE, we conjecture that a natural set of conserved quantities for GGE can emerge from the reduced density matrices of properly chosen eigenstates by the entanglement Hamiltonian superdensity matrix (EHSM) framework, and we demonstrate this explicitly for models mappable to free fermions. The framework proposes that such conserved quantities are linear superpositions of eigenstate entanglement Hamiltonians of a larger auxiliary system, where the eigenstates are Fock states occupying what we call the common eigenmodes, which remain eigenmodes when truncated within the physical subsystem. For 1D homogeneous free fermions with (anti-)periodic boundary conditions, which maps to 1D hardcore bosons with nearest neighbor hoppings, these conserved quantities lead to a non-Abelian GGE, which predicts the relaxation of both fermion and boson bilinears more accurately than the conventional Abelian GGE. Generalization of this framework may provide novel numerical insights for quantum integrability.</p>

            <p>Experiments have pointed to the formation of the electron quadrupling condensate in Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$ at $x \sim 0.8$. The state spontaneously breaks time-reversal symmetry and is sandwiched between two critical points, separating it from the broken time-reversal symmetry (BTRS) superconducting state at $T_{\rm c}^{U(1)}$ and normal-metal state at $T_{\rm c}^{\rm Z2}$. We report a theory of the acoustic effects spectroscopy of systems with an electron quadrupling phase based on ultrasound-velocity measurements. We show that the experimental results are consistent with BTRS superconductivity at $x \sim 0.8$, fulfilling the necessary condition for the formation of electron quadrupling in Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$. We provide the theoretical basis and the experimental strategy to study the order parameter symmetry of emerging quadrupling condensates in superconductors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zheng Zhou, Chen-Hui Song, Xu-Yang Hou, Hao Guo</p>
            <p>We investigate the Ising model on a spherical surface, utilizing a Fibonacci lattice to approximate uniform coverage. This setup poses challenges in achieving consistent lattice distribution across the sphere for comparison with planar models. We employ Monte Carlo simulations, principal component analysis (PCA), graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to study spin configurations across a range of temperatures and to determine phase transition temperatures. The Fibonacci lattice, despite its uniformity, contains irregular sites that influence spin behavior. In the ferromagnetic case, sites with fewer neighbors exhibit a higher tendency for spin flips at low temperatures, though this effect weakens as temperature increases, leading to a higher phase transition temperature than in the planar Ising model. In the antiferromagnetic case, lattice irregularities induce geometric frustration, resulting in highly degenerate ground states and the phase transition temperature lower than the planar square lattice. Phase transition temperatures are derived through specific heat, magnetic susceptibility analysis and GCNs predictions, yielding $T_c$ values for both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic scenarios. This work emphasizes the impact of the Fibonacci lattice's geometric properties-namely curvature and connectivity-on spin interactions in non-planar systems, with relevance to microgravity environments.</p>

            <h2>Spectral decomposition and high-accuracy Greens functions: Overcoming the Nyquist-Shannon limit via complex-time Krylov expansion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sebastian Paeckel</p>
            <p>The accurate computation of low-energy spectra of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems, typically accessed via Green's functions, is a long-standing problem posing enormous challenges to numerical methods. When the spectral decomposition is obtained from Fourier transforming a time series, the Nyquist-Shannon theorem limits the frequency resolution $\Delta \omega$ according to the numerically accessible time domain size $T$ via $\Delta \omega = 2\pi/T$. In tensor network methods, increasing the domain size is exponentially hard due to the ubiquitous spread of correlations, limiting the frequency resolution and thereby restricting this ansatz class mostly to one-dimensional systems with small quasi-particle velocities. Here, we show how this limitation can be overcome by augmenting the time series with complex-time Krylov states. At the example of the critical $S-1/2$ Heisenberg model and light bipolarons in the two-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, we demonstrate the enormous improvements in accuracy, which can be achieved using this method.</p>

            <p>Determining the solvability of a given quantum mechanical system is generally challenging. We discuss that the numerical bootstrap method can help us to solve this question in one-dimensional quantum mechanics. We show that the bootstrap method can derive exact energy eigenvalues in systems with shape invariance, which is a sufficient condition for solvability and which many solvable systems satisfy. The information of the annihilation operators is also obtained naturally, and thus the bootstrap method tells us why the system is solvable. We numerically demonstrate this explicitly for shape invariant potentials: harmonic oscillators, Morse potentials, Rosen-Morse potentials and hyperbolic Scarf potentials. Therefore, the numerical bootstrap method can determine the solvability of a given unknown system if it satisfies shape invariance.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shi Jin, Nana Liu, Chuwen Ma, Yizhe Peng, Yue Yu</p>
            <p>The Schrödingerization method converts linear partial and ordinary differential equations with non-unitary dynamics into systems of Schrödinger-type equations with unitary evolution. It does so via the so-called warped phase transformation that maps the original equation into a Schrödinger-type equation in one higher dimension \cite{Schrshort,JLY22SchrLong}. The original proposal used a particular initial function in the auxiliary space that did not achieve optimal scaling in precision. Here we show that, by choosing smoother initial functions in auxiliary space, Schrödingerization \textit{can} in fact achieve near optimal and even optimal scaling in matrix queries. We construct three necessary criteria that the initial auxiliary state must satisfy to achieve optimality. This paper presents detailed implementation of four smooth initializations for the Schrödingerization method: (a) the error function and related functions, (b) the cut-off function, (c) the higher-order polynomial interpolation, and (d) Fourier transform methods. Method (a) achieves optimality and methods (b), (c) and (d) can achieve near-optimality. A detailed analysis of key parameters affecting time complexity is conducted.</p>

            <p>Solid-state platforms based on bosonic quasiparticles offer a compelling route toward on-chip quantum information technologies scalable to nanometer dimensions. Coherence time, a key figure of merit for any quantum system, is fundamentally limited by the lifetime of quasiparticles that store quantum information. For magnons - bosonic excitations of collective magnetization dynamics - it has long been reported that their lifetime does not exceed a few hundred nanoseconds, placing a stringent constraint on their use in quantum architectures. Here, we demonstrate magnon lifetimes exceeding 18 {\mu}s. Experiments performed on single-crystal yttrium iron garnet spheres cooled to 30 mK reveal relaxation times of short-wavelength magnons nearly two orders of magnitude longer than previously observed. These findings overturn the established view of magnon dissipation limits, positioning magnons as viable, long-lived information carriers for solid-state quantum computing.</p>

Tunable long-range tunneling and repulsive hole-hole interactions enable a rich phase diagram featuring a double superfluid phase, a DSS phase, and an antiferromagnetic insulator. Intriguingly, within the DSS regime we observe an unconventional thermal enhancement of crystalline order.

PAOA operates by iteratively modifying the couplings of a network of binary stochastic units, guided by cost evaluations from independent samples. We establish a direct correspondence between derivative-free updates and the gradient of the full Markov flow over the exponentially large state space, showing that PAOA admits a principled variational formulation. Simulated annealing emerges as a limiting case under constrained parameterizations, and we implement this regime on an FPGA-based probabilistic computer with on-chip annealing to solve large 3D spin-glass problems. Benchmarking PAOA against QAOA on the canonical 26-spin Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model with matched parameters reveals superior performance for PAOA. We show that PAOA naturally extends simulated annealing by optimizing multiple temperature profiles, leading to improved performance over SA on heavy-tailed problems such as SK-Lévy.</p>

            <p>Exploring novel topological matters with exotic quantum states has always been a core issue in the field of condensed matter physics, which can update the understanding of topological phases and broaden the classification of topological materials. Here, we report a class of unconventional hybrid-order topological insulators (HyOTIs), which simultaneously host various different higher-order topological states in a single band gap. Such topological states exhibit a unique bulk-boundary correspondence that is different from the well-known first-order topological states, higher-order topological states, and the coexistence of both. Particularly, we develop a generic surface theory to precisely capture them and discover a three-dimensional unconventional HyOTI protected by inversion symmetry, which renders both helical and corner topological states and exhibits an unprecedented bulk-edge-corner correspondence. By adjusting the parameters of the system, we also observe the nontrivial phase transitions between the inversion-symmetric HyOTI and other conventional phases. We further propose a circuit-based experimental scheme to detect these interesting results. Remarkably, we demonstrate that a modified tight-binding model of bismuth can support the unconventional HyOTI, suggesting a possible route for its material realization. This work shall significantly advance the research of hybrid topological states in both theory and experiment.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adit Vishnu, Abhay Shastry, Dhruva Kashyap, Chiranjib Bhattacharyya</p>
            <p>Machine learning with density operators, the mathematical foundation of quantum mechanics, is gaining prominence with rapid advances in quantum computing. Generative models based on density operators cannot yet handle tasks that are routinely handled by probabilistic models. The progress of latent variable models, a broad and influential class of probabilistic unsupervised models, was driven by the Expectation-Maximization framework. Deriving such a framework for density operators is challenging due to the non-commutativity of operators. To tackle this challenge, an inequality arising from the monotonicity of relative entropy is demonstrated to serve as an evidence lower bound for density operators. A minorant-maximization perspective on this bound leads to Density Operator Expectation Maximization (DO-EM), a general framework for training latent variable models defined through density operators. Through an information-geometric argument, the Expectation step in DO-EM is shown to be the Petz recovery map. The DO-EM algorithm is applied to Quantum Restricted Boltzmann Machines, adapting Contrastive Divergence to approximate the Maximization step gradient. Quantum interleaved Deep Boltzmann Machines and Quantum Gaussian-Bernoulli Restricted Boltzmann Machines, new models introduced in this work, outperform their probabilistic counterparts on generative tasks when trained with similar computational resources and identical hyperparameters.</p>

            <p>Spin-liquid and spin-glass states represent two distinct phases of disordered quantum spin systems. These states are, in principle, distinguished by quantum-entangled fluctuations and spin freezing, but identifying each state and characterizing the transition between them remains challenging. Here, we systematically explore the relationship between the spin-liquid and spin-glass states using a model with all-to-all random interactions among p spins, which interpolates between the Ising-like one-component, XY-like two-component, and isotropic three-component cases. By analyzing the system-size N dependence of the Edwards-Anderson order parameter and the density of states, we identify the transition from the spin liquid to the spin glass for various values of p. We show that the phase diagrams for different p can be unified through a scaling with N/p2, revealing that increasing anisotropy in the interactions systematically suppresses the spin-liquid phase and extends the spin-glass regime. Furthermore, we examine the competition between multiple-spin interactions and anisotropy under an external magnetic field in the isotropic case, and find that the spin-liquid phase transitions into the spin-glass phase before entering a quantum paramagnetic phase. Our findings provide insights into quantum disordered phases and the transitions between them.</p>

The Bethe-Salpeter equation provides the theoretical framework, and numerical methods have been developed for its equal-time time-slice. In practice, it requires solving a sixteen-component eigenvalue equation with a two-particle Dirac Hamiltonian, including the appropriate interaction. The double-pair corrections can either be included in the interaction part of the eigenvalue equation or treated as a perturbation to the no-pair Hamiltonian.

            <p>Accurate evaluation of nonlinear photonic integrated circuits requires separating input and output coupling efficiencies (i.e., $\eta_1$ and $\eta_2$), yet the conventional linear-transmission calibration method recovers only their product (i.e., $\eta_1\,\eta_2$) and therefore introduces systematic bias when inferring on-chip performance from off-chip data. We present bidirectional nonlinear optical tomography (BNOT), a direction-aware metrology that uses forward and backward pumping of complementary nonlinear probes, with process-appropriate detection, to break the ``degeneracy'' of $\eta_1\,\eta_2$ and estimate individual interface efficiencies with tight confidence intervals. The method links off-chip measurements to on-chip quantities through a compact observation model that explicitly incorporates pump fluctuations and detector noise, and it frames efficiency extraction as a joint constrained optimization. Monte Carlo studies show unbiased convergence of the estimated efficiencies to ground truth with low error across realistic operating regimes. Using these efficiency estimates to reconstruct on-chip nonlinear figures of merit yields distributions centered on the true values with reduced variance, whereas conventional ``degenerate'' calibration is biased and can substantially misestimate on-chip performance. BNOT is hardware-compatible and platform-agnostic, and provides unbiased characterization of off- and on-chip coupling efficiencies across nonlinear processes, enabling reproducible, coupling-resolved benchmarking for scalable systems in quantum optics, frequency conversion, and precision metrology.</p>

            <p>A quantum message is encoded into $N$ storage nodes (quantum systems $Q_1\dots Q_N$) with assistance from $N_B$ maximally entangled bi-partite quantum systems $A_1B_1, \dots, A_{N_B}B_{N_B}$, that are prepared in advance such that $B_1\dots B_{N_B}$ are stored separately as entanglement assistance (EA) nodes, while $A_1\dots A_{N_B}$ are made available to the encoder. Both the storage nodes and EA nodes are erasure-prone. The quantum message must be recoverable given any $K$ of the $N$ storage nodes along with any $K_B$ of the $N_B$ EA nodes. The capacity for this setting is the maximum size of the quantum message, given that the size of each EA node is $\lambda_B$. All node sizes are relative to the size of a storage node, which is normalized to unity. The exact capacity is characterized as a function of $N,K,N_B,K_B, \lambda_B$ in all cases, with one exception. The capacity remains open for an intermediate range of $\lambda_B$ values when a strict majority of the $N$ storage nodes, and a strict non-zero minority of the $N_B$ EA nodes, are erased. As a key stepping stone, an analogous classical storage (with shared-randomness assistance) problem is introduced. A set of constraints is identified for the classical problem, such that classical linear code constructions translate to quantum storage codes, and the converse bounds for the two settings utilize similar insights. In particular, the capacity characterizations for the classical and quantum settings are shown to be identical in all cases where the capacity is settled.</p>

Despite its importance for the fundamental understanding in quantum thermodynamics and its technological implications, coherence effects in heat transport have not been observed previously. Here, we measure quantum features in the heat transfer between a qubit and a thermal bath. The system is formed of a driven flux qubit galvanically coupled to a $\lambda/4$ coplanar-waveguide resonator that is coupled to a heat reservoir. This thermal bath is a normal-metal mesoscopic resistor, whose temperature can be measured and controlled. We detect interference patterns in the heat current due to driving-induced coherence. In particular, resonance peaks in the heat transferred to the bath are found at driving frequencies which are integer fractions of the resonator frequency. A selection rule on the even/odd parity of the peaks holds at the qubit symmetry point. We present a theoretical model based on Floquet theory that captures the experimental results. The studied system provides a platform for studying the role of coherence in quantum thermodynamics.

            <p>We develop a microscopic theory of magnon-exciton drag effect in a bilayer van der Waals antiferromagnetic semiconductor CrSBr. Effective exciton-magnon coupling arises from an orbital mechanism: Magnons tilt the layer magnetizations, enabling charge carrier tunneling that mixes intra- and interlayer excitons and thereby modulate the exciton energy. We derive the effective Hamiltonian of exciton-magnon coupling, based on our calculation of the magnon spectrum taking into account short-range exchange interaction between Cr-ion spins, single-ion anisotropy, and long-range dipole-dipole interactions. The latter produces a negative group velocity of magnons at small wavevectors. We show that despite rather small renormalization of exciton's energy and effective mass by the exciton-magnon interaction, the three key two-magnon processes: exciton-magnon scattering, two-magnon absorption by exciton, and two-magnon emission are highly efficient. By solving the Boltzmann kinetic equation, we evaluate short exciton-magnon scattering time which is in the sub-ps range and strongly decreases with the increase of magnon population. Hence, exciton-magnon scattering is likely to be dominant over other scattering processes related to the exciton-phonon and exciton-disorder interactions. We demonstrate that magnons can efficiently drag excitons, resulting in a large and nearly isotropic exciton propagation that can significantly exceed the intrinsic anisotropic diffusion. Our results provide a theoretical basis for recent observations of anomalous exciton transport in CrSBr [F. Dirnberger, et al., Nat. Nano. (2025)] and establish magnon-exciton drag as a powerful mechanism for controlling exciton propagation in magnetic systems.</p>

            <h2>Multimode equilibrium approximations in light-matter systems from weak to strong coupling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Davis M. Welakuh, Vasil Rokaj, Michael Ruggenthaler, Angel Rubio</p>
            <p>In this work, we detail different approaches to treat multi-mode photonic environments within non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics in the long-wavelength approximation efficiently. Specifically we show that for equilibrium properties of coupled light-matter systems, we can approximately capture the effects of multi-mode photonic environments on matter systems by either only keeping the polarization part of the electric field in the length-gauge formulation or by a few effective modes. We present a comprehensive set of approximation methods designed to accurately capture equilibrium phenomena in quantum light-matter systems across a range of complex photonic environments, from weak to strong coupling. These methods are applied to atomic and molecular models as well as to a two-dimensional quantum ring, demonstrating the versatility of our approach and laying the groundwork for first-principles simulations of real materials in cavity quantum electrodynamics.</p>

            <h2>Mechanically mediated optical-microwave quantum state transfer by feedback</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Max P. Foreman, Jesse J. Slim, Warwick P. Bowen</p>
            <p>State transfer between light and microwaves is a key challenge in quantum networks. Promising transducers use a mechanical intermediary that couples to both fields via radiation pressure. Such electro-optomechanical devices have achieved high efficiencies, yet require resolved-sideband cavities, and generally compromise in scalability and noise performance. Here, we relax this constraint by extending the protocol of Navarathna et al. that transfers optical quantum information onto a mechanical resonator using a broadband, sideband-unresolved cavity and feedback. Combining this with parametric mechanical-to-microwave conversion, we show that continuous optical-to-microwave quantum state transfer is possible using measurement-based feedback, while all-optical coherent feedback enables bidirectional transfer. To assess the transfer, we introduce the quantum transfer witness $\mathcal{W}_T$, which -- though similar to the input-referred added noise -- also identifies whether a channel is capable of both preserving Gaussian entanglement and outperforming classical transduction schemes. Finally, we show that quantum-compatible noise performance is within reach of current experimental capabilities. Our results unlock a new design space for electro-optomechanical transducers and strengthens their candidacy as scalable quantum links between distant nodes.</p>

            <h2>Squeezing Classical Antiferromagnets into Quantum Spin Liquids via Global Cavity Fluctuations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Charlie-Ray Mann, Mark A. Oehlgrien, Błażej Jaworowski, Giuseppe Calajó, Jamir Marino, Kyung S. Choi, Darrick E. Chang</p>
            <p>Cavity quantum electrodynamics with atomic ensembles is typically associated with collective spin phenomena, such as superradiance and spin squeezing, in which the atoms evolve collectively as a macroscopic spin ($S\sim N/2$) on the Bloch sphere. Surprisingly, we show that the tendency toward a collective spin description need not imply collective spin phenomena; rather, it can be exploited to generate new forms of strongly correlated quantum matter. The key idea is to use uniform cavity-mediated interactions to energetically project the system into the total-spin singlet sector ($S=0$) - a highly entangled subspace where the physics is governed entirely by cavity fluctuations. Focusing on Rydberg atom arrays coupled to a single-mode cavity, we show that global cavity fluctuations can effectively squeeze classical antiferromagnets into quantum spin liquids, characterized by non-local entanglement, fractionalized excitations, and emergent gauge fields. This work suggests that cavity QED can be a surprising resource for inducing strongly correlated phenomena, which could be explored in the new generation of hybrid tweezer-cavity platforms.</p>

            <h2>Quantum open system description of a hybrid plasmonic cavity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marco Vallone</p>
            <p>We present a unified quantum open system framework for lossy plasmonic cavities in which coherent dynamics, relaxation, dephasing, and irreversible absorption are treated on equal footing. The Dyson equation for the cavity photon propagator in the random-phase approximation yields a complex self-energy S that accounts for both the renormalization and the damping of hybrid plasmon-photon modes (polaritons, in a quasi-particle description). Tracing out the electronic and photonic environments leads to a Liouvillian for the upper (UP) and lower (LP) polaritonic branches, incorporating leakage through the imaginary part of the self-energy, internal UP-LP scattering rates, and dephasing. Time evolution equations for polariton populations, interbranch coherence, and driven amplitudes in closed form also provide analytic expressions for their steady-state values, the quench rate of UP-LP oscillations and polaritonic lineshapes, valid in the limit of low polaritonic density, but covering light-matter ultrastrong coupling. The theory establishes a self-consistent description of dissipative polariton dynamics in plasmonic and nanophotonic cavities, directly applicable to response spectra, time-domain measurements, and dissipation engineering.</p>

            <h2>Quantum correlated steady states under competing collective and individual decay</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nikita Leppenen, Ephraim Shahmoon</p>
            <p>Collective dissipation can generate useful quantum correlations, while ubiquitous individual decay destroys them. We study the interplay between these two competing processes considering a driven system of many spins (``atoms") undergoing both collective and individual dissipation (``radiation"). In steady state and depending on drive, we find that the system exhibits a first-order phase transition and quantum bistability: its quantum state is a mixture of two many-body states associated with the two competing decay processes. Accordingly, one of these states closely resembles a correlated ``coherently radiating spin state" (CRSS) -- the solution of purely collective dissipation -- exhibiting spin-squeezing entanglement. We predict dynamical switching between the two stable states, manifest as many-body quantum jumps in the various observables of spin and radiation. Macroscopically, the switching rate tends to vanish and the system can reside in a correlated CRSS for long times. This reveals how correlated dissipative physics emerges at the presence of decorrelating individual decay, opening a path for unlocking collective dissipation phenomena in realistic quantum platforms and applications. We discuss consequences for experiments in collective radiation.</p>

            <h2>High-fidelity implementation of a Majorana-encoded CNOT gate on a photonic platform</h2>

            <p>We present the experimental realisation of a robust CNOT quantum gate in a Majorana-encoded logical space simulated on a photonic platform. Instead of implementing physical Majorana quasiparticles, our experiment emulates the algebra of Majorana zero modes using photonic degrees of freedom obtained through a Jordan-Wigner mapping. This mapping enables us to simulate two logical qubits, encoded in three Kitaev chains supporting endpoint Majorana operators. Moreover, we realise the unitary representations of both intra-chain and inter-chain Majorana braiding operations that implement the encoded CNOT gate. Due to hardware constraints, the full braiding sequence is executed through a cyclic input-output procedure, requiring an indirect reconstruction of accumulated noise across successive steps. We numerically show that the Majorana encoding offers resilience to the dominant noise in our photonic setup, provided the physical error rate stays below a well-defined threshold. As our experimental error rate (p=0.012) lies beneath this threshold, the experimentally measured encoded CNOT fidelity is significantly enhanced, exceeding 0.992. This reveals a novel pathway to fault-tolerant quantum computing based on Majorana-inspired encodings, even in the absence of full topological protection.</p>

            <p>Contextuality, a key resource for quantum advantage, describes systems in which the outcome of a measurement is not independent of other compatible measurements, in contrast to classical hidden-variable descriptions. We investigate the harvesting of contextuality from the vacuum of a quantum field using Unruh-DeWitt detectors. We show that localized interactions with the field can endow initially non-contextual detectors with contextuality with respect to Heisenberg-Weyl measurements, as quantified by contextual fraction. The harvested contextuality correlates with the emergence of Wigner function negativity, in agreement with known equivalences between these notions. Our results show that contextuality is a resource that can be extracted directly from the quantum vacuum and establish contextuality harvesting as a fundamental phenomenon in relativistic quantum information.</p>

            <p>Exactly solvable dissipative models provide an analytical tool for studying the relaxation dynamics in open quantum systems. In this work, we study an exactly solvable model based on an anisotropic variant of the Yao-Lee spin-orbital model, with dissipation acting in the spin sector. We map Liouvillian dynamics to fermions hopping in a doubled Hilbert space under a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and demonstrate the model's exact solvability. We analyze the model's strong and weak symmetries, which protect an exponentially large manifold of non-equilibrium steady states, establishing the system as a physically feasible dissipative spin liquid. Furthermore, we analyze the transient dynamics in a translationally invariant sector and discover that the single-particle Liouvillian spectrum hosts an exceptional ring in momentum space. We map out a characteristic $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry breaking transition driven by the dissipation strength, which governs the crossover from oscillatory to decaying relaxation of physical observables. Our work provides a physically motivated, solvable setting for exploring the coexistence of dissipative spin liquid physics and Liouvillian spectral singularities.</p>

            <h2>Exploiting Movable Logical Qubits for Lattice Surgery Compilation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Laura S. Herzog, Lucas Berent, Aleksander Kubica, Robert Wille</p>
            <p>Lattice surgery with two-dimensional quantum error correcting codes is among the leading schemes for fault-tolerant quantum computation, motivated by superconducting hardware architectures. In conventional lattice surgery compilation schemes, logical circuits are compiled following a place-and-route paradigm, where logical qubits remain statically fixed in space throughout the computation. In this work, we introduce a paradigm shift by exploiting movable logical qubits via teleportation during the logical lattice surgery CNOT gate. Focusing on lattice surgery with the color code, we propose a proof-of-concept compilation scheme that leverages this capability. Numerical simulations show that the proposed approach can substantially reduce the routed circuit depth compared to standard place-and-route compilation techniques. Our results demonstrate that optimizations based on movable logical qubits are not limited to architectures with physically movable qubits, such as neutral atoms or trapped ions - they are also readily applicable to superconducting quantum hardware. An open-source implementation of our method is available on GitHub this https URL.</p>

            <h2>A Quantum Gate Architecture via Teleportation and Entanglement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samuel J. Sheldon, Pieter Kok, Callum W. Duncan</p>
            <p>We present a universal quantum computing architecture which combines the measurement-driven aspect of MBQC with the circuit model's algorithm dependent generation of qubit entanglement. Our architecture, which we call QGATE, is tailored for discrete-variable photonic quantum computers with deterministic photon sources capable of generating 1D entangled photonic states. QGATE achieves universal quantum computing on a logical data qubit register via the implementation of Clifford operations, QGATE ancilla, and arbitrary angle single-qubit measurements. We realise unitary evolutions defined by multi-qubit Pauli strings via the generation of entanglement between a sub-set of logical qubits and a mutual QGATE ancilla qubit. Measurement of the QGATE ancilla in the appropriate basis then implements a given term of the desired unitary operation. This enables QGATE to both directly perform Hamiltonian evolutions in terms of a series of multi-qubit Pauli operators, in terms of projectors for an arbitrary sparse Hamiltonian, or realise multi-controlled gates enabling direct translation of circuit models to QGATE. We consider examples inspired by quantum chemistry and computational fluid dynamics. We propose an example photonic implementation of QGATE and calculate thresholds of $10.36\pm0.02\%$ or $25.98\pm0.28\%$ on the photonic loss for logical qubits constructed from foliated rotated surface codes, dependent on the deployment of intra-layer or inter-layer fusion respectively.</p>

Precise control and manipulation of these modes remain critical challenges, particularly in systems where nonlinear multimode dynamics interact with dispersion effects.

We present a perturbation-theory-based approach to analyze GVD effects in a synchronously pumped dispersive cavity. By comparing perturbative solutions to rigorous steady-state results, we establish the validity region of the perturbative approach and assess its limitations in multimode systems. Our study identifies key parameters governing the breakdown of perturbation theory, such as mode order, dispersion strength, and cavity decay rates.</p>

            <p>We experimentally demonstrate enhanced sensitivity of an atom-based Rydberg radio frequency (RF) receiver integrated with a gradient refractive index (GRIN) Luneburg-type metamaterial lens. By analyzing the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) effect in Cesium vapor, we compare receiver performance with and without the GRIN lens under a 2.2~GHz and a 3.6~GHz far-field excitation. Our measurements reveal a significant amplification of the EIT transparency window when the lens is introduced, consistent with the theoretical prediction that the local E-field enhancement at the vapor cell reduces the minimum detectable electric field and increases the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the Rydberg RF receiver. This experimental validation highlights the potential of metamaterial-assisted quantum sensing to overcome the inherent bandwidth and sensitivity limitations of bare Rydberg receivers for a variety of applications, such as electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) testing, quantum radar, and wireless communications.</p>

            <h2>Universal quantum control over non-Hermitian continuous-variable systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhu-yao Jin, Jun Jing</p>
            <p>Although the control of non-Hermitian quantum systems has a growing interest for their nonunitary feature in the time evolution, the existing discussions are not more than two or three dimensions and heavily influenced by the singularity of the energy spectrum. We here develop a general theory to control an arbitrary number of bosonic modes governed by the time-dependent non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. It takes advantage of the gauge potential in the instantaneous frame rather than the energy spectrum of Hamiltonian. In particular, the dynamics of a general non-Hermitian continuous-variable system is analyzed in the instantaneous frame associated with time-dependent ancillary operators that are superpositions of the laboratory-frame operators and irrelevant to the original Hamiltonian. The gauge potential is determined by the unitary transformation between the time-dependent and stationary ancillary frames. The upper triangularization condition for the Hamiltonian's coefficient matrix in the stationary ancillary frame enables two of the time-dependent ancillary operators to be nonadiabatic Heisenberg passages of the non-Hermitian system. The probability conservation of the system wavefunction can be restored at the end of these passages without artificial normalization. Our theory is exemplified with the perfect and nonreciprocal state transfers in a cavity magnonic system. The former holds for arbitrary initial states and is irrelevant to the parity-time symmetry of the Hamiltonian and the exceptional point of the spectra; and the latter is consistent with the unidirectional perfect absorbtion. Our work essentially extends the universal quantum control (UQC) theory to the non-Hermitian continuous-variable systems, providing a promising approach for their coherent control.</p>

            <p>Accurate computation of non-covalent, intermolecular interaction energies is important to understand various chemical phenomena, and quantum computers are anticipated to accelerate it. Although the state-of-the-art quantum computers are still noisy and intermediate-scale ones, development of theoretical frameworks those are expected to work on a fault-tolerant quantum computer is an urgent issue. In this work, we explore resource-efficient implementation of the quantum phase estimation-based complete active space configuration interaction (QPE-CASCI) calculations, with the aid of the second-order Møller--Plesset perturbation theory (MP2)-based active space selection with Boys localized orbitals. We performed numerical simulations of QPE for the supramolecular approach-based intermolecular interaction energy calculations of the hydrogen-bonded water dimer, using 6 system and 6 ancilla qubits. With the aid of algorithmic error mitigation, the QPE-CASCI simulations achieved interaction energy predictions with an error of 0.02 kcal mol$^{-1}$ relative to the CASCI result, demonstrating the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed methodology. Preliminary results on quantum circuit compression for QPE are also presented to reduce the number of two-qubit gates and depth.</p>

            <p>In quantum field theory (QFT), the "vacuum" is not just empty space but the lowest-energy state of a quantum field. If the energy landscape has multiple local minima, the local ground states are the false vacuum (FV) which can tunnel towards the global ground state (true vacuum, TV). This process exhibits signature akin to classical supercooled gas transitions and many-body tunneling in discrete quantum systems. Here, we study the FV decay and bubble nucleation in a Rydberg atom ring. The long-range van-der-Waals interactions and individual-site addressability allow us to explore physics beyond the standard Ising model. We observe that the FV decay rate decreases exponentially with the inverse of the symmetry-breaking field, directly mirroring QFT predictions. Moreover, we demonstrate that even minor deviations from the ideal metastable state can cause a stark departure from this universal scaling law. Extending beyond short-time decay dynamics, we also examine resonant bubble nucleation, a feature distinctive to systems with discrete energy spectra. Our findings and methods open avenues for future studies of many-body tunneling in higher dimensions or more complex geometries.</p>

            <p>Recently proposed metastability-induced quantum batteries have shown particular promise for coherent microwave generation. However, achieving high-power coherent microwave generation in quantum batteries remains fundamentally challenging due to quantum correlations, aging, and self-discharging processes. For the cavity-quantum-electrodynamics (CQED)-based quantum batteries, a further trade-off arises between strong spin-photon coupling for energy storage and sufficient output coupling for power delivery. To overcome these constraints, we introduce dissipation engineering as a dynamic control strategy that temporally separates energy storage and release. By suppressing emission during charging and rapidly enhancing the output coupling during discharging, we realize nanosecond microwave bursts with watt-level peak power. By optimizing three dissipation schemes, we improve work extraction efficiency of the quantum battery by over two orders of magnitude and achieve high power compression factors outperforming the state-of-the-art techniques, establishing dissipation engineering as a pathway toward room-temperature, high-power coherent microwave sources.</p>

We implement a noise-aware pulse selection strategy to identify candidate protocols with reduced susceptibility to certain noise sources, then analyze their performance under realistic noise sources -- including atomic motion, Rydberg decay, and experimentally motivated laser phase and intensity noise. For a $^{88}$Sr-based architecture, we demonstrate fast iSWAP gate protocols which exceed fidelities of $99.9\%$ under realistic experimental conditions.

            <p>Quantum transduction, which enables the coherent conversion of quantum information between disparate physical platforms, is a cornerstone for realizing scalable and interoperable quantum networks. Among various approaches, parametric frequency mixing processes such as four-wave mixing (FWM) offer a promising pathway toward efficient and low-noise transduction. In this work, we demonstrate the feasibility of coherent quantum state transfer by indirectly verifying high-fidelity wavefunction's phase mapping (>99%) from the input field to the generated output field wave. Using a gas-filled hollow-core capillary fiber, we systematically investigate spectral phase evolution across a broad range, including infrared (IR) to ultraviolet (UV) transitions, as well as conversions from telecom-band (1550 nm) to visible (516 nm) and deep-UV (308 nm) wavelengths. Our results reveal that strong phase coherence can be maintained throughout these diverse conversion regimes. Because quantum properties such as coherence and entanglement are intrinsically encoded in both the amplitude and phase of a photonic wavefunction, preserving spectral phase is essential for faithful quantum information transfer. We further show that efficient and phase-preserving transduction can be achieved by tuning system parameters, offering valuable insights into nonlinear coupling dynamics. These findings establish a promising foundation for advancing FWM-based quantum transduction schemes and open new avenues for integrating heterogeneous quantum systems across wide spectral domains within future quantum communication networks.</p>

            <p>Ultrahigh nonreciprocal transmission has been achieved in a cavity-magnon system, which consists of two whispering gallery modes (WGMs) and a single magnon mode within a magnetic insulator yttrium iron garnet sphere. The nonreciprocal frequency shift induced by the Sagnac effect enables unidirectional transmission of an input field, while suppressing propagation in the opposite direction, thereby facilitating nonreciprocal optical transmission. Within experimentally accessible parameter regimes, the optical isolation ratio can exceed 40 dB, representing the highest isolation ratio reported to date. Furthermore, applying squeezing to the magnon mode further enhances this isolation performance. Additionally, the directionality of light isolation can be reversed simply by modifying the rotation of the WGM cavity. These findings offer promising prospects for developing high-performance, tunable, and compact optical nonreciprocal devices.</p>

            <h2>New Identity for Cayley's First Hyperdeterminant with Applications to Symmetric Tensors and Entanglement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Isaac Dobes</p>
            <p>In this article, a new formula for computing Cayley's first hyperdeterminant in terms of the Levi-Civita symbol is given. It is then shown that this formula can be used to compute the hyperdeterminant of symmetric hypermatrices in polynomial time with respect to their order (assuming fixed side length). Applications to the quantum entanglement of bosons are then discussed. Additionally, in order to obtain the fast calculation of the hyperdeterminant on symmetric hypermatrices, hypermatrix generalizations of elimination and duplication matrices are defined, and explicit formulas for them are derived in the appendix of this article.</p>

            <h2>Performance Analysis of Quantum Support Vector Classifiers and Quantum Neural Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomás Villalba-Ferreiro, Eduardo Mosqueira-Rey, Diego Alvarez-Estevez</p>
            <p>This study explores the performance of Quantum Support Vector Classifiers (QSVCs) and Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) in comparison to classical models for machine learning tasks. By evaluating these models on the Iris and MNIST-PCA datasets, we find that quantum models tend to outperform classical approaches as the problem complexity increases. While QSVCs generally provide more consistent results, QNNs exhibit superior performance in higher-complexity tasks due to their increased quantum load. Additionally, we analyze the impact of hyperparameter tuning, showing that feature maps and ansatz configurations significantly influence model accuracy. We also compare the PennyLane and Qiskit frameworks, concluding that Qiskit provides better optimization and efficiency for our implementation. These findings highlight the potential of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) for complex classification problems and provide insights into model selection and optimization strategies</p>

            <h2>Generating redundantly encoded resource states for photonic quantum computing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samuel J. Sheldon, Pieter Kok</p>
            <p>Measurement-based quantum computing relies on the generation of large entangled cluster states that act as a universal resource on which logical circuits can be imprinted and executed through local measurements. A number of strategies for constructing sufficiently large photonic cluster states propose fusing many smaller resource states generated by a series of quantum emitters. However, the fusion process is inherently probabilistic with a 50% success probability in standard guise. A recent proposal has shown that, in the limit of low loss, the probability of achieving successful fusion may be boosted to near unity by redundantly encoding the vertices of linear graph states using Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states [Quantum 7, 992 (2023)]. Here we present a protocol for deterministically generating redundantly encoded photonic resource states using single quantum emitters, and study the impact of protocol errors and photonic losses on the generated resource states and type-II photonic fusion. Our work provides a route for efficiently constructing complex entangled photonic qubit states for photonic quantum computing and quantum repeaters.</p>

            <h2>Many-body symmetry-protected zero boundary modes of synthetic photo-magnonic crystals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alan Gardin, Emilio Cobanera, Giuseppe C. Tettamanzi</p>
            <p>The topological classification of insulators and superconductors, the "ten-fold way", is grounded on fermionic many-body symmetries and has had a dramatic impact on many fields of physics. Therefore, it seems equally important to investigate a similar approach for bosons as tightly analogous to the fermionic prototype as possible. There are, however, several obstacles coming from the fundamental physical differences between fermions and bosons. Here, we propose a potentially optimal way forward: a theory of free boson topology (topological classification and bulk-boundary correspondence) protected by bosonic many-body symmetry operations, namely, squeezing transformations, particle number, and bosonic time reversal. We identify two symmetry classes that are topologically non-trivial in one dimension. They include key models like the bosonic Kitaev chain, protected by a squeezing symmetry within our framework, and the celebrated bosonic SSH model, protected by a squeezing symmetry and particle number. To provide a robust experimental platform for testing our theory, we introduce a new quantum meta-material: photo-magnonic crystals. They consist of arrays of interconnected photo-magnonic cavities. They are remarkable for their experimental flexibility and natural affinity for displaying band topological physics at microwave frequencies. We engineer a many-body symmetry-protected topological photo-magnonic chain with boundary modes mandated by a Pfaffian invariant. Using an electromagnetic finite-element modelling, we simulate its reflection and transmission and identify experimental signatures of its boundary modes. The experimental tuning of the crystal to its symmetry-protected topological phase is also addressed. Our modelling of the photo-magnonic chain provides a thorough blueprint for its experimental realisation and the unambiguous observation of its exotic physics.</p>

            <h2>The Pound-Drever-Hall Method for Superconducting-Qubit Readout</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ibukunoluwa Adisa, Won Chan Lee, Kevin C. Cox, Alicia J. Kollár</p>
            <p>Scaling quantum computers to large sizes requires the implementation of many parallel qubit readouts. Here we present an ultrastable superconducting-qubit readout method using the multi-tone self-phase-referenced Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) technique, originally developed for use with optical cavities. In this work, we benchmark PDH readout of a single transmon qubit, using room-temperature heterodyne detection of all tones to reconstruct the PDH signal. We demonstrate that PDH qubit readout is insensitive to microwave phase drift, displaying $0.73^\circ$ phase stability over 2 hours, and capable of single-shot readout in the presence of phase errors exceeding the phase shift induced by the qubit state. We show that the PDH sideband tones do not cause unwanted measurement-induced state transitions for a transmon qubit, leading to a potential signal enhancement of at least $14$~dB over traditional heterodyne readout.</p>

            <h2>Excess work in counterdiabatic driving</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lucas P. Kamizaki, Marcus V. S. Bonança</p>
            <p>Many years have passed since the conception of the quintessential method of shortcut to adiabaticity known as counterdiabatic driving (or transitionless quantum driving). Yet, this method appears to be energetically cost-free and thus continually challenges the task of quantifying the amount of energy it demands to be accomplished. This paper proposes that the energy cost of controlling a closed quantum system using the counterdiabatic method can also be assessed using the instantaneous excess work during the process and related quantities, as the time-averaged excess work. Starting from the Mandelstam-Tamm bound for driven dynamics, we have shown that the speed-up of counterdiabatic driving is linked with the spreading of energy between the eigenstates of the total Hamiltonian, which is necessarily accompanied by transitions between these eigenstates. Nonetheless, although excess work can be used to quantify energetically these transitions, it is well known that the excess work is zero throughout the entire process under counterdiabatic driving. To recover the excess work as an energetic cost quantifier for counterdiabatic driving, we will propose a different interpretation of the parameters of the counterdiabatic Hamiltonian, leading to an excess work different from zero. We have illustrated our findings with the Landau-Zener model.</p>

            <h2>Sketch Tomography: Hybridizing Classical Shadow and Matrix Product State</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xun Tang, Haoxuan Chen, Yuehaw Khoo, Lexing Ying</p>
            <p>We introduce Sketch Tomography, an efficient procedure for quantum state tomography based on the classical shadow protocol used for quantum observable estimations. The procedure applies to the case where the ground truth quantum state is a matrix product state (MPS). The density matrix of the ground truth state admits a tensor train ansatz as a result of the MPS assumption, and we estimate the tensor components of the ansatz through a series of observable estimations, thus outputting an approximation of the density matrix. The procedure is provably convergent with a sample complexity that scales quadratically in the system size. We conduct extensive numerical experiments to show that the procedure outputs an accurate approximation to the quantum state. For observable estimation tasks involving moderately large subsystems, we show that our procedure gives rise to a more accurate estimation than the classical shadow protocol. We also show that sketch tomography is more accurate in observable estimation than quantum states trained from the maximum likelihood estimation formulation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ching-Tai Huang, Yu-Cheng Lin, Ferenc Igloi</p>
            <p>We investigate quench dynamics in the quantum $S=1/2$ XXZ antiferromagnetic chain with staggered and anisotropic interactions in the flat-band limit. Our quench protocol interchanges the odd- and even-bond strengths of a fully dimerized chain, enabling us to derive exact time-dependent states for arbitrary even system sizes by working in the Bell basis. We obtain closed-form, size-independent expressions for the von Neumann and second-order Rényi entanglement entropies. We further calculate exact Loschmidt echoes and the corresponding return rate functions across various anisotropies and system sizes, and identify Loschmidt zeros in finite chains. Our analysis reveals the precise conditions on the anisotropy parameter that govern the periodicity of the dynamical observables. In addition to the analytic study, we perform two types of numerical experiments on IBM-Q quantum devices. First, we use the Hadamard test to estimate the Bell-basis expansion coefficients and reconstruct the dynamical states, achieving accurate entanglement entropies and the Loschmidt echo for small systems. Second, we implement Trotter-error-free time-evolution circuits combined with randomized Pauli measurements. Post-processing via statistical correlations and classical shadows yields reliable estimates of the second-order Rényi entanglement entropy and the Loschmidt echo, showing satisfactory agreement with exact results.</p>

            <h2>Hybridized-Mode Parametric Amplifier in Kinetic-Inductance Circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Danial Davoudi, Abdul Mohamed, Shabir Barzanjeh</p>
            <p>Parametric amplification is essential for quantum measurement, enabling the amplification of weak microwave signals with minimal added noise. While Josephson-junction-based amplifiers have become standard in superconducting quantum circuits, their magnetic sensitivity, limited saturation power, and sub-kelvin operating requirements motivate the development of alternative nonlinear platforms. Here we demonstrate a two-mode kinetic-inductance parametric amplifier based on a pair of capacitively coupled Kerr-nonlinear resonators fabricated from NbTiN and NbN thin films. The distributed Kerr nonlinearity of these materials enables nondegenerate four-wave-mixing amplification with gains approaching 40 dB, gain-bandwidth products up to 6.9 MHz, and 1-dB compression powers two to three orders of magnitude higher than those of state-of-the-art Josephson amplifiers. A coupled-mode theoretical model accurately captures the pump-induced modification of the hybridized modes and quantitatively reproduces the observed signal and idler responses. The NbN device exhibits a significantly larger Kerr coefficient and superior gain-bandwidth performance, highlighting the advantages of high-kinetic-inductance materials. Our results establish coupled kinetic-inductance resonators as a robust platform for broadband, high-power, and magnetically resilient quantum-limited amplification, offering a scalable route for advanced readout in superconducting qubits, spin ensembles, quantum dots, and other microwave-quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Engineering photonic dispersion relation and atomic dynamics in waveguide QED setup via long-range hoppings</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weijun Cheng, Da-Wei Wang, Yang Xue, Zhihai Wang, Liantuan Xiao</p>
            <p>Non-trivial dispersion relations engineered in photonic waveguide for the precise control of atomic dynamics has recently attracted considerable attention. Here, we study a system in which atoms are coupled to one-dimensional coupled-resonator waveguides with long-range hoppings. By carefully engineering the jth-order nearest neighbor (JNN) hoppings between resonators, we construct linear dispersion relations with the chiral characteristic. To quantify the degree of linearity, we analyze the propagation fidelities of Gaussian wave packets in these waveguides. Furthermore, we demonstrate that such coupled-resonator waveguides can serve as versatile platforms for enabling directional atomic radiation and absorption. Beyond linear dispersion relations, more general forms, including quadratic and cubic relations, can also be achieved through tailored JNN-hoppings. Our study thus provides a unified framework for simulating atom-environment couplings with arbitrary dispersion relations.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Encrypted Control of Networked Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zihao Ren, Daniel Quevedo, Salah Sukkarieh, Guodong Shi</p>
            <p>Encrypted control has been extensively studied to ensure the confidentiality of system states and control inputs for networked control systems. This paper presents a computationally efficient encrypted control framework for networked systems enabled by quantum communication. A quantum channel between sensors and actuators is used to generate identical secret keys, whose security is further enhanced through quantum key distribution. These keys enable lightweight encryption and decryption while preserving confidentiality and control accuracy. We develop a novel encryption-decryption architecture for state-feedback control of linear systems based on quantum keys, and characterize the impact of quantum state errors on closed-loop stability. In particular, we establish the existence of a critical threshold on intrinsic quantum noise below which stability is guaranteed. In contrast to classical encrypted control schemes, which may collapse under a single key-bit error, the proposed quantum encrypted control exhibits strong robustness to key imperfections. We further adopt quantization techniques to address the scenarios with limited communication bits in practical situations, and implement privacy protection for quantum keys based on a stochastic quantizer. These results demonstrate that integrating quantum technologies into control systems in a nontrivial and principled manner, even at their current level of maturity, can yield substantial performance gains in reducing computational complexity and improving resilience to key errors while ensuring security against multiple eavesdropping sources.</p>

            <h2>Edge bits in average symmetry protected topological mixed state</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yoshihito Kuno</p>
            <p>Edge bit in an average symmetry protected topological (ASPT) mixed state is studied. The state is protected by one strong $Z_2$ and one weak (average) $Z_2$ symmetries. As analogous objects of pure symmetry protected topological (SPT) states, the ASPT possesses edge bits. In particular, the analogous operator response exists, that is, symmetry fractionalization. The fractionalization preserves the presence of the ASPT in the bulk, and the fractionalized edge operators acting on the edge bits of the ASPT. %analogous to the ones in the pure SPTs. In this work, based on the cluster model and by employing Choi mapping, we discuss generic features of the edge bits and numerically clarify the behavior of the edge bits and their robustness for varying decoherence and perturbative interactions. By using an operator-space mutual information (OSMI), we track the flow of quantum correlations between the two edges. Remarkably, even in the ASPT regime, a finite portion of the initial edge-to-edge correlation survives.</p>

            <h2>Sympathetic Cooling of Levitated Optomechanics through Nonreciprocal Coupling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jialin Li, Guangyu Zhang, Zhang-qi Yin</p>
            <p>Optomechanical cooling of levitated nanoparticles has become an essential topic in modern quantum physics, providing a platform for exploring macroscopic quantum phenomena and high-precision sensing. However, conventional cavity-assisted cooling is fundamentally constrained by cavity dissipation and environmental noise, limiting the attainable minimum temperature. In this work, we propose a non-Hermitian optomechanical cooling scheme through nonreciprocal coupling between two levitated nanoparticles, where one particle is directly cooled by an optical cavity and the other is cooled indirectly through a non-Hermitian interaction. Both analytical solutions and numerical simulations reveal that increasing nonreciprocity enhances directional energy transfer, enabling the target particle to reach a lower phonon occupation than is achievable in conventional cavity cooling. This study demonstrates a new cooling mechanism driven by non-Hermitian interactions, offering theoretical guidance for realizing controllable energy flow and deep cooling in levitated optomechanical systems, and paving the way for future developments in quantum control and sensing technologies.</p>

            <h2>Geometrical structure of the Wigner flow information quantifiers and hyperbolic stability in the phase-space framework</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alex E. Bernardini</p>
            <p>Quantifiers of stationarity, classicality, purity and vorticity are derived from phase-space differential geometrical structures within the Weyl-Wigner framework, after which they are related to the hyperbolic stability of classical and quantum-modified Hamiltonian (non-linear) equations of motion. By examining the equilibrium regime produced by such an autonomous system of ordinary differential equations, a correspondence between Wigner flow properties and hyperbolic stability boundaries in the phase-space is identified. Explicit analytical expressions for equilibrium-stability parameters are obtained for quantum Gaussian ensembles, wherein information quantifiers driven by Wigner currents are identified. Illustrated by an application to a Harper-like system, the results provide a self-contained analysis for identifying the influence of quantum fluctuations associated to the emergence of phase-space vorticity in order to quantify equilibrium and stability properties of Hamiltonian non-linear dynamics.</p>

Optimal sensitivity requires only moderate initial squeezing, and the non-Gaussian advantage remains robust against loss and detection noise. We identify optimal measurement strategies and show that several experimentally relevant preparation schemes surpass Gaussian limits, in some cases reaching the sensitivity of cubic phase states.

We present a quantum algorithm for the Largest Empty Square problem and the Largest Empty Rectangle of a fixed width $d$ for $n\times n$-rectangular map. Query complexity of the algorithm is $\tilde{O}(n^{1.5})$ for the square case, and $\tilde{O}(n\sqrt{d})$ for the rectangle with a fixed width $d$ case, respectively. At the same time, the lower bounds for the classical case are $\Omega(n^2)$, and $\Omega(nd)$, respectively. The Quantum algorithm for the one-dimensional version of the problem has $O(\sqrt{n}\log n\log\log n)$ query complexity. The quantum lower bound for the problem is $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ which is almost equal to the upper bound up to a log factor. The classical lower bound is $\Omega(n)$.

            <h2>Solution of the Electric Field Integral Equation Using a Hybrid Quantum-Classical Scheme: Investigation of Accuracy and Efficiency</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rui Chen, Teng-Yang Ma, Meng-Han Dou, Chao-Fu Wang</p>
            <p>Conventional classical solvers are commonly used for solving matrix equation systems resulting from the discretization of SIEs in computational electromagnetics (CEM). However, the memory requirement would become a bottleneck for classical computing as the electromagentic problems become much larger. As an alternative, quantum computing has a natural "parallelization" advantage with much lower storage complexity due to the superposition and entanglement in quantum mechanics. Even though several quantum algorithms have been applied for the SIEs-based methods in the literature, the size of the matrix equation systems solvable using them is still limited. In this work, we use a hybrid quantum-classical scheme to solve the EFIE for analyzing electromagentic scattering from three-dimensional (3D) perfect electrically conducting objects with arbitrary shapes in CEM for the first time. Instead of directly solving the original EFIE matrix equation system using the quantum algorithms, the hybrid scheme first designs the preconditioned linear system and then uses a double-layer iterative strategy for its solution, where the external iteration layer builds subspace matrix equation systems with smaller dimension and the internal iteration layer solves the smaller systems using the quantum algorithms. Two representative quantum algorithms, HHL and VQLS, are considered in this work, which are executed on the quantum simulator and quantum computer platforms. We present the theoretical time complexity analysis of the hybrid quantum-classical scheme and perform numerical experiments to investigate the accuracy and efficiency of the hybrid scheme. The results show that the computational complexity of the hybrid VQLS-classical scheme is lower than the conventional fast solvers in classical computing, which indicates the hybrid scheme is more promising for analyzing large-scale electromagnetic problems.</p>

            <p>Quantum high-harmonic generation (HHG) is a growing field of research with capabilities of providing high photon-number entangled states of light. However, there is an open debate regarding the theory level required for correctly describing the quantum aspects of HHG emission, such as squeezing or entanglement. Previous approaches have employed non-interacting classical ensembles of trajectories, or perturbation theory utilizing the classical trajectories as a starting point, missing out key entanglement features. In this Letter, we develop a full quantum theory for entanglement measures in HHG solving exactly the light-matter interaction Hamiltonian and employ it for evaluating the entanglement between emitted photons of different harmonics. For the first time, we reach qualitative agreement of theory with recent experiments showing that the R entanglement parameter decreases with increasing laser power for below-threshold harmonics. Our results indicate that fine-tuning the laser power could enhance HHG entanglement features, which are observed to oscillate with the driving power and exhibit local non-classical maxima structures. Similarly, our theory predicts that the oscillatory behavior of entanglement observed for below-threshold harmonics also appears for entanglement involving above-threshold harmonics. We also show that the long-range behavior of driven electronic trajectories can qualitatively change the resulting entanglement. Lastly, we show that focal averaging over classical degrees of freedom, which has thus far been ignored in quantum HHG theories, plays a key role in entanglement measures and can change the qualitative behavior of observables. Our work establishes the state-of-the art in exploring entanglement features in HHG, and paves way for analysis and engineering of 'truly-quantum' multi-photon states in the XUV and ultrafast regime for more complex matter systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Davut Emre Tasar, Ceren Ocal Tasar</p>
            <p>Quantum key distribution (QKD) security fundamentally relies on the ability to distinguish genuine quantum correlations from classical eavesdropper simulations, yet existing certification methods lack rigorous statistical guarantees under finite-sample conditions and adversarial scenarios. We introduce TARA (Test by Adaptive Ranks), a novel framework combining conformal prediction with sequential martingale testing for quantum anomaly detection that provides distribution-free validity guarantees. TARA offers two complementary approaches. TARA k, based on Kolmogorov Smirnov calibration against local hidden variable (LHV) null distributions, achieving ROC AUC = 0.96 for quantum-classical discrimination. And TARA-m, employing betting martingales for streaming detection with anytime valid type I error control that enables real time monitoring of quantum channels. We establish theoretical guarantees proving that under (context conditional) exchangeability, conformal p-values remain uniformly distributed even for strongly contextual quantum data, confirming that quantum contextuality does not break conformal prediction validity a result with implications beyond quantum certification to any application of distribution-free methods to nonclassical data. Extensive validation on both IBM Torino (superconducting, CHSH = 2.725) and IonQ Forte Enterprise (trapped ion, CHSH = 2.716) quantum processors demonstrates cross-platform robustness, achieving 36% security margins above the classical CHSH bound of 2. Critically, our framework reveals a methodological concern affecting quantum certification more broadly: same-distribution calibration can inflate detection performance by up to 44 percentage points compared to proper cross-distribution calibration, suggesting that prior quantum certification studies using standard train test splits may have systematically overestimated adversarial robustness.</p>

Bell's result was originally proven in a simple bipartite causal structure, but analogous results have also been shown in further causal structures. Here we study the only causal structure with six or fewer nodes in which the question of whether or not there exist quantum correlations that cannot be achieved classically was open. In this causal structure we show that such quantum correlations exist using a method that involves imposing additional restrictions on the correlations. This hence completes the picture of which causal structures of up to six nodes support non-classical quantum correlations. We also provide further illustrations of our method using other causal structures.</p>

This paper introduces A2G (Adaptive Aggregation with Two Gains), a dual gain framework that jointly regulates geometric blending through a geometry gain and modulates client importance using a QoS gain derived from teleportation fidelity, latency, and instability. We develop the A2G update rule, establish convergence guarantees under smoothness and bounded variance assumptions, and show that A2G recovers FedAvg, QoS aware averaging, and manifold based aggregation as special cases. Experiments on a quantum classical hybrid testbed demonstrate improved stability and higher accuracy under heterogeneous and noisy conditions.</p>

            <h2>Short-Range Modulated Electron Lattice and d-Wave Superconductivity in Cuprates: A Phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau Framework</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jaehwahn Kim, Davis A. Rens, Waqas Khalid, Hyunchul Kim</p>
            <p>We develop a phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau (GL) framework for high-$T_c$ cuprates in which a short-range modulation of the electronic charge density couples to a $d$-wave superconducting condensate. The resulting modulated electron lattice (MEL) state is distinct from long-range static charge density wave order: it is short range, partially phase coherent, and linked to superconducting coherence. A preferred wave vector $q^{\ast} \approx 0.3$ reciprocal lattice units along the Cu-O bond direction emerges from the interplay between a momentum-dependent susceptibility and bond-stretching phonons, consistent with neutron and x-ray data on YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ and related cuprates. The GL free energy contains coupled $d$-wave superconducting and charge sectors with parameters constrained by optimally doped YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$. We identify an MEL enhancement window in doping, temperature, MEL correlation length, and disorder where a coherence linked modulation enhances the superfluid stiffness. Classical Monte Carlo simulations yield an in-plane stiffness enhancement of order ten percent, which we treat as a qualitative prediction to be tested by self-consistent Bogoliubov de Gennes calculations. The MEL framework yields falsifiable experimental signatures. For scanning tunneling spectroscopy in Bi-based cuprates we highlight two predictions: the Fourier-transformed local density of states should exhibit a $q^{\ast} \approx 0.3$ peak whose spectral weight sharpens as superconducting phase coherence develops below $T_c$, in contrast to static charge scenarios, and the local gap magnitude $\Delta(r)$ should correlate positively with the local MEL amplitude. The framework implies correlations between MEL correlation length, superfluid stiffness, disorder, and vortex pinning, and organizes cuprate observations into testable STM/STS predictions.</p>

            <h2>Stretched Exponential Scaling of Parity-Restricted Energy Gaps in a Random Transverse-Field Ising Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> G.-X. Tang, J.-Z. Zhuang, L.-M. Duan, Y.-K. Wu</p>
            <p>The success of a quantum annealing algorithm requires a polynomial scaling of the energy gap. Recently it was shown that a two-dimensional transverse-field Ising model on a square lattice with nearest-neighbor $\pm J$ random coupling has a polynomial energy gap in the symmetric subspace of the parity operator [Nature 631, 749-754 (2024)], indicating the efficient preparation of its ground states by quantum annealing. However, it is not clear if this result can be generalized to other spin glass models with continuous or biased randomness. Here we prove that under general independent and identical distributions (i.i.d.) of the exchange energies, the energy gap of a one-dimensional random transverse-field Ising model follows a stretched exponential scaling even in the parity-restricted subspace. We discuss the implication of this result to quantum annealing problems.</p>

            <p>Recent advances in coherent conveyor-mode spin qubit shuttling are paving the way for large-scale quantum computing platforms with qubit connectivity achieved by spin qubit shuttles. We developed a simulation tool to investigate numerically the impact of device imperfections on the spin-coherence of conveyor-mode shuttling in Si/SiGe. We simulate the quantum evolution of a mobile electron spin-qubit under the influence of sparse and singly charged point defects placed in the Si/SiGe heterostructure in close proximity to the shuttle lane. We consider different locations of a single charge defect with respect to the center of the shuttle lane, multiple orbital states of the electron in the shuttle with $g$-factor differences between the orbital levels, and orbital relaxation induced by electron-phonon interaction. With this simulation framework, we identify the critical defect density of charged point defects in the heterostructure for conveyor-mode spin qubit shuttle devices and quantify the impact of a single defect on the coherence of a qubit.</p>

            <p>Ultracold neutral atoms in optical lattices are a promising platform for simulating the behavior of complex materials and implementing quantum gates. We optimize collision gates for fermionic Lithium atoms confined in a double-well potential, controlling the laser amplitude and keeping its relative phase constant. We obtain high-fidelity gates based on a one-dimensional confinement simulation. Our approach extends beyond earlier Fermi-Hubbard simulations by capturing a momentum dependence in the interaction energy. This leads to a higher interaction strength when atoms begin in separate subwells compared to the same subwell. This momentum dependence might limit the gate fidelity under realistic experimental conditions, but also enables tailored applications in quantum chemistry and quantum simulation by optimizing gates for each of these cases separately.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Edoardo Zavatti, Gabriele Bellomia, Samuele Giuli, Matteo Ferraretto, Massimo Capone</p>
            <p>Cold-atom experiments based on alkali-like atoms provide us with a tool to experimentally realize Hubbard models with a large number $N$ of components. The value of $N$ can be seen as a new handle to tune the properties of the system, leading to new physics both in the case of fully SU($N$) symmetric systems, or in the presence of controlled symmetry breaking. We focus on the Mott transition at global half filling and we characterize local correlations between particles complementing conventional estimates with the inter-flavor mutual information. We prove that these correlations have classical nature and, using Dynamical Mean-Field Theory, we show that the SU(4) system has significantly smaller correlations than the SU(2) counterpart. In the atomic limit we prove that increasing $N$ further decreases the strength of the correlations. This suggests that a controlled reduction of the symmetry, reducing the number of effective components, can be used to enhance the degree of correlation. We confirm this scenario solving the model for $N=4$ and gradually breaking the symmetry via a Raman field, revealing an evolution from the SU(4) to the SU(2) Mott transition as the symmetry-breaking term increases, with a sudden recovery of the large correlations of the SU(2) model at weak Raman coupling in the Mott state. By further exploring the interplay between energy repulsion and the Raman field, we obtain a rich phase diagram with three different phases -- a metal, a band insulator, and a Mott insulator -- all coexisting at a single tricritical point.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rachid El Aitouni, Miloud Mekkaoui, Pablo Díaz, David Laroze, Ahmed Jellal</p>
            <p>We study how electrons move across a graphene sheet when it encounters two magnetic barriers with a region in between that is continuously driven by laser light. Rather than acting as a static obstacle, this illuminated middle section becomes a Floquet cavity that opens new transport channels through controlled photon absorption and emission. By combining Floquet theory with the transfer matrix method, we track electron transmission through both the main energy band and the emerging photon-assisted sidebands. We find that the laser does more than modify the potential--it reshapes how electrons interact between the magnetic barriers, enabling a switch from ordinary transmission to transport dominated by photon exchange. Because the magnetic field and the optical drive are applied to separate sections of the device, the system supports interference between cyclotron-filtered motion and discrete photon-pumping channels, producing Fano resonances and angle-dependent transmission zeros that cannot appear in double magnetic or double laser barrier systems alone. Under well-defined conditions, the distance between the magnetic barriers controls the coupling between Floquet channels, allowing highly tunable resonances and even perfect transmission, despite strong magnetic confinement. We also observe that low-energy carriers are efficiently blocked by the magnetic regions, while conductance steadily rises with energy until it reaches a clear saturation plateau. This hybrid design provides a versatile way to steer graphene electrons by balancing optical pumping and magnetic momentum filtering.</p>

In this Letter, we investigate non-radiative Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between $V_B^-$ centers and either monolayer graphene or 2D semiconductors. Strikingly, we find that the FRET rate is negligible for hBN sensing layers thicker than 3 nm, highlighting the potential of $V_B^-$ centers for integration into ultra-thin quantum sensors within van der Waals heterostructures. Furthermore, we experimentally extract the intrinsic radiative decay rate of $V_B^-$ defects.</p>

            <p>Amid the International Year of Quantum Science and Technology 2025 (IYQ 2025), a significant portion of global funding has been dedicated to various quantum initiatives, with over 30 countries announcing their respective quantum strategies. Within the Southeast Asia context, Singapore, Thailand, and the Philippines have launched their respective quantum strategies and roadmaps. Meanwhile, six out of eleven Southeast Asia countries have expressed interest in formulating a regional quantum ecosystem to pursue a set of common goals. Quantum technologies, though still in their infancy within the second quantum revolution, have advanced rapidly in recent years. Due to their dual-use nature, quantum technologies are considered emerging and disruptive, often raising concerns from the cybersecurity perspective. While several discussions regarding Malaysia's quantum initiative and strategy are ongoing, it is vital to broaden the conversation and position Malaysia within the regional ecosystem. This paper provides an overview of Malaysia's quantum landscape and a summary of the regional initiatives since the establishment of Southeast Asia Quantum Network. We then analyse Malaysia's strengths in quantum research and provide four recommendations to strengthen the regional ecosystem.</p>

            <h2>Contrary Inferences for Classical Histories within the Consistent Histories Formulation of Quantum Theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adamantia Zampeli, Georgios E. Pavlou, Petros Wallden</p>
            <p>In the histories formulation of quantum theory, sets of coarse-grained histories that are consistent obey the classical probability rules. It has been argued that these sets can describe the quasi-classical behaviour of closed quantum systems, e.g. Omnes (Rev. Mod. Phys. 64(2), 339, 1992) and Hartle (Les Houches1992). Most physical scenarios admit multiple different consistent sets and one can view each of these as a separate context. Using propositions from different consistent sets to make inferences leads to paradoxes such as contrary inferences, first noted by Kent (Phys. Rev. Lett. 78(15), 2874, 1997). In this contribution, we use the consistent histories to describe a quasi-classical and macroscopic system to show that paradoxes involving contextuality persist even in the quasi-classical limit. This is distinctively different from the contextuality of standard quantum theory, where the contextuality paradoxes do not persist in the quasi-classical limit. Specifically, we consider different consistent sets for the arrival time problem of a (quasi-classical) ball in an infinite square well. For this setting, we construct two different consistent sets. We find the probabilities that each consistent set assigns to the simple question of whether the ball ever crossed the middle of the interval. We show that one consistent set concludes with certainty that the ball crossed it while the other consistent set concludes with certainty that it did not. Our results point to the need for constraints on the histories sets, additional to the consistency condition, to recover the correct quasi-classical limit in this formalism and lead to the motto "all consistent sets are equal", but "some consistent sets are more equal than others".</p>

            <p>Evolutions under non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with unbroken $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry can be considered unitary under appropriate choices of inner products, facilitated by the so-called metric operator. While it is understood that the choice of the metric operator has no bearing on the description of the system, in this work, we show that this choice does dictate the entanglement structure of the system. We show that the partial trace of the Hermitized density matrix gives the correct representation of the reduced subsystem, and based on such operations, we elucidate the metric dependency of the reduced dynamics and consequently the observable dependence of the subsystem decomposition. We use a non-Hermitian $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric quantum walk as a toy model to study this metric dependency, where we use the internal (coin state) as the subsystem of interest and study the coin-position entanglement and non-Markovianity of the coin dynamics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kohtaro Tadaki</p>
            <p>The notion of probability plays a crucial role in quantum mechanics. It appears in quantum mechanics as the Born rule. In modern mathematics which describes quantum mechanics, however, probability theory means nothing other than measure theory, and therefore any operational characterization of the notion of probability is still missing in quantum mechanics. In our former works [K. Tadaki, arXiv:1804.10174], based on the toolkit of algorithmic randomness, we presented a refinement of the Born rule, called the principle of typicality, for specifying the property of results of measurements in an operational way. In this paper, we make an application of our framework to the argument of local realism versus quantum mechanics for refining it, in order to demonstrate how properly our framework works in practical problems in quantum mechanics.</p>

            <p>We present a finite-size security proof of the decoy-state BB84 QKD protocol against coherent attacks, using entropic uncertainty relations, for imperfect detectors. We apply this result to the case of detectors with imperfectly characterized basis-efficiency mismatch. Our proof works by obtaining a suitable bound on the phase error rate, without requiring any new modifications to the protocol steps or hardware. It is applicable to imperfectly characterized detectors, and only requires the maximum relative difference in detection efficiencies and dark count rates of the detectors to be characterized. Moreover, our proof allows Eve to choose detector efficiencies and dark count rates in their allowed ranges in each round, thereby addressing an important problem of detector side channels. We prove security in the variable-length framework, where users are allowed to adaptively determine the length of key to be produced, and number of bits to be used for error-correction, based on observations made during the protocol. We quantitatively demonstrate the effect of basis-efficiency mismatch by applying our results to the decoy-state BB84 protocol.</p>

            <p>Recent years have seen a surge of interest in exceptional points in open quantum systems. The natural approach in this area has been the use of Markovian master equations. While the resulting Liouvillian EPs have been seen in a variety of systems and have been associated to numerous exotic effects, it is an open question whether such degeneracies and their peculiarities can persist beyond the validity of master equations. In this work, taking the example of a dissipative double-quantum-dot system, we show that exact Heisenberg equations governing system and bath dynamics exhibit the same EPs as the corresponding master equations. To highlight the importance of this finding, we prove that the paradigmatic property associated to EPs - critical damping, persists well beyond the validity of master equations. Our results demonstrate that Liouvillian EPs can arise from underlying fundamental exact principles, rather than merely as a consequence of approximations involved in deriving master equations.</p>

            <p>While the spontaneous emission from independent emitters provides spatially uncorrelated photons - a typical manifestation of quantum randomness, the interference of the coherent scattering leads to a well-defined intensity pattern - a feature described by linear optics. We here demonstrate experimentally how the interplay between the two mechanisms in large systems of quantum emitters leads to spatial variations of photon correlations. The implementation with trapped ion crystals in free space allows us to observe the anti-correlation between photon rates and variance of the photon number distributions in chains of up to 18 ions. For smaller crystals of four ions, the transition from a sub-Poissonian to a super-Poissonian variance of the photon number in the scattered light is reported. For higher numbers of scatterers, the photon statistics still display a strong deviation from the fully incoherent scattering case. Our results illustrate how the interference of coherent scattering, combined with spontaneous emission, provides a control mechanism for the light statistics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Avantika Agarwal, Shalev Ben-David</p>
            <p>We study the quantum-classical polynomial hierarchy, QCPH, which is the class of languages solvable by a constant number of alternating classical quantifiers followed by a quantum verifier. Our main result is that QCPH is infinite relative to a random oracle (previously, this was not even known relative to any oracle). We further prove that higher levels of PH are not contained in lower levels of QCPH relative to a random oracle; this is a strengthening of the somewhat recent result that PH is infinite relative to a random oracle (Rossman, Servedio, and Tan 2016). The oracle separation requires lower bounding a certain type of low-depth alternating circuit with some quantum gates. To establish this, we give a new switching lemma for quantum algorithms which may be of independent interest. Our lemma says that for any $d$, if we apply a random restriction to a function $f$ with quantum query complexity $\mathrm{Q}(f)\le n^{1/3}$, the restricted function becomes exponentially close (in terms of $d$) to a depth-$d$ decision tree. Our switching lemma works even in a "worst-case" sense, in that only the indices to be restricted are random; the values they are restricted to are chosen adversarially. Moreover, the switching lemma also works for polynomial degree in place of quantum query complexity.</p>

            <p>The comb-like spectrum added to laser light by an electro-optic modulator (EOM) finds use in a wide range of applications, including coherent optical communication, atomic spectroscopy, and laser frequency and phase stabilization. In some cases a sideband-free optical frequency shift is preferred, such as in laser offset locking using an optical cavity, single-photon frequency shifting, and laser range finding. Approaches to obtaining an optical frequency offset (OFO) involve trade-offs between shift range, conversion gain, and suppression of spurious sidebands. Here we demonstrate an OFO of continuous-wave 871 nm laser light by serrodyne modulation using a fiber EOM and radio-frequency (RF) tones from a commercial RF system on a chip (RFSoC) to achieve shifts of 40 to 800 MHz with > 15 dB suppression of spurious sidebands and < 1.5 dB conversion loss. We also observe a smoothly varying conversion gain. The utility of this tool is demonstrated by continuously shifting the offset of a cavity-locked laser from 50 to 1600 MHz, a capability useful in spectroscopy of unknown optical transitions.</p>

            <p>I investigate the problem of optimally discriminating between two open quantum dynamical processes in a single-shot scenario, with the goal of minimizing the error probability of identification. This task involves optimising both the input state -- potentially entangled with an ancillary system that remains isolated from the dynamics -- and the time at which the resulting time-dependent quantum channels, induced by the two distinct dynamical maps, becomes most distinguishable. To illustrate the complexity and richness of this problem, I focus on Pauli dynamical maps and their associated families of time-dependent Pauli channels. I identify a regime in which separable strategies require waiting indefinitely for the dynamics to reach the stationary state, whereas entangled input states enable optimal discrimination at a finite time, with a strict reduction in error probability. These results highlight the crucial interplay between entanglement and timing in enhancing the distinguishability of quantum dynamical processes.</p>

            <p>Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are algorithms for sampling probability distributions, commonly applied to the Boltzmann distribution in physical and chemical models such as protein folding and the Ising model. These methods enable exploration of such systems by sampling their most probable states.

In this context, quantum computing, with its potential to accelerate classical methods, emerges as a promising solution to the sampling problem. In this work, we present the design of a new circuit based on the Discrete Quantum Walk (DQW) algorithm to perform MCMC sampling over a desired distributions. Simulation results show convergence behavior in the superposition of the quantum register that encodes the target distribution. This design is further refined to increase convergence speed and, consequently, the scalability of the algorithm.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Caroline E. P. Robin</p>
            <p>We investigate how the stabilizer formalism, in particular highly-entangled stabilizer states, can be used to describe the emergence of many-body shape collectivity from individual constituents, in a symmetry-preserving and classically efficient way. The method that we adopt is based on determining an optimal separation of the Hamiltonian into a stabilizer component and a residual part inducing non-stabilizerness. The corresponding stabilizer ground state is efficiently prepared using techniques of graph states and stabilizer tableaux. We demonstrate this technique in context of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, a fully-connected spin system presenting a second order phase transition from spherical to deformed state. The resulting stabilizer ground state is found to capture to a large extent both bi-partite and collective multi-partite entanglement features of the exact solution in the region of large deformation. We also explore several methods for injecting non-stabilizerness into the system, including ADAPT-VQE, and imaginary-time evolution (ITE) techniques. Stabilizer ground states are found to accelerate ITE convergence due to a larger overlap with the exact ground state. While further investigations are required, the present work suggests that collective features may be associated with high but simple large-scale entanglement which can be captured by stabilizer states, while the interplay with single-particle motion may be responsible for inducing non-stabilizerness. This study motivates applications of the proposed approach to more realistic quantum many-body systems, whose stabilizer ground states can be used in combinations with powerful classical many-body techniques and/or quantum methods.</p>

            <p>Quantum spin models are ubiquitous in solid-state physics, but classical simulation of them remains extremely challenging. Experimental testbed systems with a variety of spin-spin interactions and measurement channels are therefore needed. One promising potential route to such testbeds is provided by microwave-photon-mediated interactions between superconducting qubits, where native strong light-matter coupling enables significant interactions even for virtual-photon-mediated processes. In this approach, the spin-model connectivity is set by the photonic mode structure, rather than the spatial structure of the qubit. Lattices of coplanar-waveguide (CPW) resonators have been demonstrated to allow extremely flexible connectivities and can therefore host a huge variety of photon-mediated spin models. However, large-scale CPW lattices with non-trivial band structures have never before been successfully combined with superconducting qubits. Here we present the first such device featuring a quasi-1D CPW lattice with multiple transmon qubits. We demonstrate that superconducting-qubit readout and diagnostic techniques can be generalized to this highly multimode environment and observe the effective qubit-qubit interaction mediated by the bands of the resonator lattice. This device completes the toolkit needed to realize CPW lattices with qubits in one or two Euclidean dimensions, or negatively-curved hyperbolic space, and paves the way to driven-dissipative spin models with a large variety of connectivities.</p>

            <p>Superposed coherent states are central to quantum technologies, yet their reliable identification remains a challenge, especially in noisy or resource-constrained settings. We introduce a novel, directly measurable criterion for detecting cat-like features in quantum states, rooted in the concept of nonlinear squeezing. This approach bypasses the need for full state tomography and reveals structure where fidelity fails. The numerical results confirm its robustness under loss and its potential for experimental implementation. The method naturally generalizes to more exotic superpositions, including multiheaded cat states.</p>

            <p>Unitary quantum gates constitute the building blocks of Quantum Computing in the circuit paradigm. In this work, we engineer a locally driven two-qubit Hamiltonian whose instantaneous ground-state dynamics generates the controlled-NOT (CNOT) quantum gate. In practice, quantum gates have to be implemented in finite-time, hence non-adiabatic and external noise effects debilitate gate fidelities. Here, we show that counterdiabatic control can restore gate performance with near perfect fidelities even in open quantum systems subject to decoherence.</p>

            <h2>Acquisition of Delocalized Information via Classical and Quantum Carriers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julian Maisriml, Sebastian Horvat, Borivoje Dakić</p>
            <p>We investigate the information-theoretic power of spatial superposition by analyzing tasks in which information is locally encoded at multiple distant sites and must be acquired by a single information carrier, such as a particle. Within an operational framework, we systematically compare the statistical correlations that can be generated in such tasks using classical particles, quantum particles in spatial superposition, and more general "second-order interference" resources. We bound classical strategies via convex polytopes and present a study of their symmetry, demonstrating that the vertices are inherently connected to K-juntas as defined in the classical theory of Boolean functions, while their facet inequalities are in one-to-one correspondence with oracle games. We then analyze the violation of the "fingerprinting inequality" achievable by the use of one quantum particle, and we study the dependence of this violation on the dimension d of the particle's internal degree of freedom. In particular, we show that the case of d = 2 can achieve a higher violation of the inequality than the previously investigated case of d = 1. We also provide analytic and numerical evidence that this violation cannot be further increased for larger d > 2. Finally, we find that both quantum and any other (generalized) second-order interference models exhibit the same asymptotic scaling in violating the fingerprinting inequality. Our results thereby further articulate quantum interference and spatial superposition as a resource for information processing.</p>

            <h2>Purely quantum memory in closed systems observed via imperfect measurements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jorge Tabanera-Bravo, Aljaž Godec</p>
            <p>The detection and quantification of non-Markovianity, a.k.a. memory, in quantum systems is a central problem in the theory of open quantum systems. There memory is as a result of the interaction between the system and its environment. Little is known, however, about memory effects induced by imperfect measurements on closed systems, where an entanglement with the environment is not possible. We investigate the emergence and characteristics of memory in closed systems observed via imperfect stroboscopic quantum measurements yielding coarse-grained outcomes. We consider ideal and two kinds of imperfect measurements: von Neumann measurements--the analogue of classical lumping--which destroy any coherence in the system, and genuinely quantum-lumping Lüders measurements preserving certain quantum correlations. Whereas the conditions for Markov dynamics under von Neumann lumping are the same as for classical dynamics, quantum-lumping requires stronger conditions, i.e. the absence of any detectable coherence. We introduce the concept of purely quantum memory having no classical counterpart. We illustrate our results with a quantum walk on a lattice and discuss their implications for dissipative dynamics and decoherence effects induced by more realistic measurements.</p>

            <p>Optical nuclear electric resonance (ONER) was recently proposed as a fast and robust single-qubit gate mechanism in $^{87}$Sr. Here, we demonstrate through numerical simulations that ONER can be extended to single-qudit control, addressing multiple one-level hyperfine transitions within the ten-dimensional nuclear-spin manifold. We identify suitable operating regimes and show that ONER enables high-fidelity spin manipulations, with simulated $\pi$-gate fidelities exceeding 99.9\%, while maintaining coherence under realistic parameter fluctuations. These results establish a proof-of-principle for optical qudit control in $^{87}$Sr and delineate practical parameter ranges for future experiments, highlighting ONER as a promising pathway toward high-dimensional quantum information processing.</p>

            <p>In quantum communication, quantum state transfer from one location to another in a quantum network plays a prominent role, where the impact of noise could be crucial. The idea of state transfer can be fruitfully associated with quantum walk on graphs. We investigate the consequences of non-Markovian quantum noises on periodicity and state transfer induced by a discrete-time quantum walk on graphs, governed by the Grover coin operator. Different bipartite graphs, such as the path graph, cycle graph, star graph, and complete bipartite graph, present periodicity and state transfer in a discrete-time quantum walk depending on the topology of the graph. We investigate the effect of quantum non-Markovian dephasing noises, particularly quantum non-Markovian Random Telegraph Noise (RTN) and modified non-Markovian Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Noise (OUN) on state transfer and periodicity. We demonstrate how the RTN and OUN noises allow state transfer and periodicity for a finite number of steps in a quantum walk. Our investigation brings out the feasibility of state transfer in a noisy environment.</p>

            <h2>What's my phase again? Computing the vacuum-to-vacuum amplitude of quadratic bosonic evolution</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicolás Quesada</p>
            <p>Quadratic bosonic Hamiltonians and their associated unitary transformations form a fundamental class of operations in quantum optics, modelling key processes such as squeezing, displacement, and beam-splitting. Their Heisenberg-picture dynamics simplifies to linear (or possibly affine) transformations on quadrature operators, enabling efficient analysis and decomposition into optical gate sets using matrix operations. However, this formalism discards a phase, which, while often neglected, is essential for a complete unitary characterization. We present efficient methods to recover this phase directly from the vacuum-to-vacuum amplitude of the unitary, using calculations that scale polynomially with the number of modes and avoid Fock space manipulations. We reduce the general problem for time-dependent Hamiltonians to integration, and provide analytical results for key cases including time-independent Hamiltonians which are positive definite, passive, active, or single-mode. Finally, we show that our results can be easily used to obtain the phase associated with any Gaussian state, be it mixed or pure.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jahan Claes</p>
            <p>In the typical implementation of a quantum error-correcting code, each stabilizer is measured by entangling one or more ancilla qubits with the data qubits and measuring the ancilla qubits to deduce the value of the stabilizer. Recently, the dynamic circuit approach has been introduced, in which stabilizers are measured without ancilla qubits. Here, we demonstrate that dynamic circuits are particularly useful for the Floquet code. Our dynamic circuit increases the timelike distance of the code, automatically removes leakage, and both significantly increases the threshold and lowers the logical error rate compared to the standard ancilla-based circuit. At a physical error rate of $10^{-3}$, we estimate a nearly $3\times$ reduction in the number of qubits required to reach a $10^{-12}$ logical error rate.</p>

            <p>We present a general theory to treat periodic solids with quantum-chemistry methods. It relies on two main developments: 1) the modeling of a solid as a Clifford torus which is a torus that is both periodic and flat and 2) the introduction of a periodic gaussian basis set that is compatible with the topology of the Clifford torus. We illustrate our approach by calculating the ground-state energy of a periodic chain of hydrogen atoms within both Hartree-Fock and coupled cluster theory. We demonstrate that our approach yields the correct ground-state energy in the thermodynamic limit by comparing it to the ground-state energy of a ring of hydrogen atoms in the same limit. Since equivalent ring-like calculations for three-dimensional solids are impossible, our approach is an excellent alternative to perform quantum-chemistry calculations of solids. Our Clifford formalism can be seamlessly combined with current implementations of quantum-chemistry methods designed for atoms and molecules to make them applicable to solids.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Noura Chabar, M. Amghar, Shakir Ullah, Mohamed Amazioug</p>
            <p>Nonreciprocity is a powerful tool in quantum technologies. It allows signals to be sent in one direction but not the other. In this article, we propose a method for achieving non-reciprocal entanglement and Gaussian interferometric power (GIP) via the Barnett effect. The YIG is coupled to a microwave cavity that interacts with an optical parametric amplifier (OPA). Due to the Barnett effect, giant nonreciprocal entanglement can emerge. By fine-tuning the cavity detuning, the GIP can exhibits nonreciprocal behavior. All entanglements with ideal nonreciprocity can be achieved by tuning the photon frequency detuning, appropriately choosing the cavity-magnon coupling regime, the nonlinear gain, and the phase shift of the OPA. Interestingly, the amount of entanglement nonreciprocity and its resilience to thermal occupation are remarkably enhanced by increasing the gain of the OPA. This nonreciprocity can be significantly enhanced even at relatively high temperatures. Our research offers a pathway for the realization of nonreciprocal single-phonon devices, with potential applications in quantum information processing and quantum communication. This proposed scheme could pave the way for the development of novel nonreciprocal devices that remain robust under thermal fluctuations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ahmad Salmanogli, Hesam Zandi</p>
            <p>This study introduces a superconducting quantum chip architecture designed to simultaneously preserve entanglement and readout fidelity, addressing one of the key trade-offs in the development of scalable quantum hardware. In conventional quantum circuits, strong qubit qubit coupling enhances entanglement but often leads to undesired crosstalk, dephasing, and reduced measurement fidelity. To mitigate these effects, we propose a hybrid multiqubit configuration consisting of nine transmon qubits organized into interior and exterior groups, interconnected via a flux tunable qubit and a network of distributed resonators. The interior qubits along with tunable qubit form an entanglement core, while the exterior qubits operate in the dispersive regime under large detuning to enable readout. The degree of entanglement can be dynamically tuned by adjusting the coupling between the central tunable qubit and the interior qubits. The total Hamiltonian includes all significant coupling contributions, encompassing effective exchange interactions among interior and exterior qubits, as well as their mediated couplings through interface resonators. By numerically solving the complete Hamiltonian alongside the Lindblad master equation, the system dynamics are characterized, allowing evaluation of both spectroscopic features and separation fidelity. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed design maintains strong entanglement by creating the avoided-crossing region while sustaining measurement fidelity around 0.995 under realistic noise conditions. These findings confirm that entanglement strength and readout fidelity can be co-optimized within a single, reconfigurable architecture, establishing a viable route toward high-performance and scalable superconducting quantum processors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yunyan Lee, Ian R. Petersen, Daoyi Dong</p>
            <p>Model predictive control has shown potential to enhance the robustness of quantum control systems. In this work, we propose a tractable Stochastic Model Predictive Control (SMPC) framework for finite-dimensional quantum systems under continuous-time measurement and quantum filtering. Using the almost-sure eigenstate reduction of quantum trajectories, we prove that the infinite-horizon stochastic objective collapses to a fidelity term that is computable in closed form from the one-step averaged state. Consequently, the online SMPC step requires only deterministic propagation of the filter and a terminal fidelity evaluation. An advantage of this method is that it eliminates per-horizon Monte Carlo scenario sampling and significantly reduces computational load while retaining the essential stochastic dynamics. We establish equivalence and mean-square stability guarantees, and validate the approach on multi-level and Ising-type systems, demonstrating favorable scalability compared to sampling-based SMPC.</p>

            <h2>Superconducting Parametric Amplifiers: Resonator Design and Role in Qubit Readout</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Babak Mohammadian</p>
            <p>Superconducting parametric amplifiers (SPAs) are critical components for ultralow-noise qubit readout in quantum computing, addressing the critical challenge of amplifying weak quantum signals without introducing noise that degrades coherence and computational fidelity. Unlike classical amplifiers, SPAs can achieve or closely approach quantum-limited performance, specifically the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL) of half a photon of added noise for phase-preserving amplification. The core principle of SPAs relies on parametric amplification, where energy is transferred from a strong pump tone to a weak input signal through non-dissipative nonlinear mixing processes. This is enabled by intrinsic nonlinearities in superconducting materials, primarily kinetic inductance in thin films (e.g., NbTiN, Al) and, more significantly, the Josephson effect in Josephson junctions. These nonlinear elements facilitate frequency mixing (three-wave or four-wave mixing) and can operate in phase-preserving or phase-sensitive amplification modes, with the latter allowing for noise squeezing below the SQL. This chapter emphasizes the significant role of resonator design in determining critical SPA performance metrics such as gain, bandwidth, and noise characteristics. It details both lumped-element (LC) and distributed-element (coplanar waveguide, CPW) resonators, discussing their unique properties, suitability for different frequency ranges, and the importance of achieving high-quality factors (Q) for efficient energy storage and minimal loss. A practical design and simulation of a meandered quarterwavelength CPW resonator coupled to a feed line is presented, illustrating how precise control over geometric parameters optimizes resonant frequency, coupling strength, and quality factor for high-fidelity qubit state discrimination.</p>

            <h2>Foundations of Quantum Granular Computing with Effect-Based Granules, Algebraic Properties and Reference Architectures</h2>

            <p>This paper develops the foundations of Quantum Granular Computing (QGC), extending classical granular computing including fuzzy, rough, and shadowed granules to the quantum regime. Quantum granules are modeled as effects on a finite dimensional Hilbert space, so granular memberships are given by Born probabilities. This operator theoretic viewpoint provides a common language for sharp (projective) and soft (nonprojective) granules and embeds granulation directly into the standard formalism of quantum information theory. We establish foundational results for effect based quantum granules, including normalization and monotonicity properties, the emergence of Boolean islands from commuting families, granular refinement under Luders updates, and the evolution of granules under quantum channels via the adjoint channel in the Heisenberg picture. We connect QGC with quantum detection and estimation theory by interpreting the effect operators realizing Helstrom minimum error measurement for binary state discrimination as Helstrom type decision granules, i.e., soft quantum counterparts of Bayes optimal decision regions. Building on these results, we introduce Quantum Granular Decision Systems (QGDS) with three reference architectures that specify how quantum granules can be defined, learned, and integrated with classical components while remaining compatible with near term quantum hardware. Case studies on qubit granulation, two qubit parity effects, and Helstrom style soft decisions illustrate how QGC reproduces fuzzy like graded memberships and smooth decision boundaries while exploiting noncommutativity, contextuality, and entanglement. The framework thus provides a unified and mathematically grounded basis for operator valued granules in quantum information processing, granular reasoning, and intelligent systems.</p>

            <p>Hyperentanglement, which refers to entanglement encoded in two or more independent degrees of freedom (DOFs), is a valuable resource for the future high-capacity quantum network. Certifying hyperentanglement sources work as intended is critical for the hyperentanglement-based quantum information tasks. Self testing is the strongest certification method for quantum state and measurement under minimal assumptions, even without any knowledge of the devices' inner workings. However, the existing self testing protocols all focus on one-DOF entanglement, which cannot self test the multi-DOF entanglement. In the paper, we propose a hyperentanglement self testing framework. We take the self testing for the polarization-spatial-mode hyperentangled Bell states as an example. The self testing is based on the violation of two-dimension CHSH test in each DOF independently. The two-step swap isometry circuits are proposed for self testing the entanglement in spatial-mode and polarization DOFs, respectively. All the sixteen polarization-spatial-mode hyperentangled Bell states can be self tested. Our hyperentanglement self testing framework has three advantages. First, it is a general hyperentanglement self testing framework, and can be extended to self test multi-DOF hyperentanglement and multipartite hyperentanglement. Second, it can provide the robust hyperentanglement self testing and establish the relation between the lower bound of fidelity and the imperfect violation of Bell-like inequality in each DOF. Third, it is feasible with current experimental technology. Our hyperentanglement self testing framework provides a promising way to certify complex hyperentanglement sources, and has potential application in future high-capacity quantum network.</p>

            <p>We investigate the non-Hermitian (NH) attractive Hubbard model with spin depairing, which is a spin-resolved asymmetric hopping that nonreciprocally operates spins in the opposite direction. We find that spin depairing stabilizes a superfluid state unique to the NH system. This phase is characterized not only by a finite order parameter, but also by the emergence of exceptional points (EPs) in the momentum space - a feature that starkly contrasts with previously discussed NH fermionic superfluidity, where EPs are absent within the superfluid state and emerge only at the onset of the superfluid breakdown. We uncover the rich mechanism underlying this ``exceptional fermionic superfluidity'' by analyzing the interplay between EPs and the effective density of states of the complex energy dispersion. Furthermore, we reveal that the exceptional superfluid state breaks down induced by strong spin depairing on the cubic lattice, while it remains robust on the square lattice.</p>

We focus on targeted tests of the Born rule for spin or polarisation probabilities, which offer a particularly clean experimental signal, and which can be described by a simple hidden-variables model of two-state systems proposed by Bell. These probabilities test a remarkable feature of the quantum formalism, whereby expectation values for incompatible experiments are linearly related. Born-rule violations can be parameterised by nonlinear expectation values for quantum measurements of spin or polarisation, along with anomalies in ensemble averages, which may then be constrained by experiment. Notable experiments considered here include the recent detection of single photons from top-quark decay, and the indirect measurement of tau-lepton polarisation. Repurposing these experiments as tests of the Born rule, however, presents several challenges, which are discussed in this paper.</p>

Moreover, the direction of rectification-whether positive or negative-can be precisely controlled by varying the polarization of the light, highlighting the potential for external optical control of electronic behavior.

            <p>Inspired by the novel idea proposed by T.~Padmanabhan in \textit{Phys.\ Rev.\ D 100, 045024 (2019)}, we develop a method to uncover the hidden thermal properties of the inertial Feynman propagator in Minkowski spacetime in a causally consistent manner. This, in turn, enables a coherent interpretation based on future-directed propagation. In our approach, the Fourier transform is implemented following the convention used in the analysis of vacuum fluctuations. As a result, future-directed propagation across causal horizons can be consistently interpreted, from the perspective of an observer confined to a causally disconnected region, as the emission of scalar quanta at the past horizon and their absorption at the future horizon. Moreover, we find that the ratio between emission and absorption processes reproduces the characteristic Boltzmann factor of a thermal ensemble. We first apply this analysis to a causal diamond of length $2\alpha$, performing a detailed study of the near-horizon geometry and thereby obtaining the temperature associated with the thermal behavior of the Minkowski vacuum as perceived by an observer with finite lifetime $2\alpha$. For completeness, we also apply the method to the right Rindler wedge, recovering the well-known Unruh temperature, $T = a/(2\pi)$. Our results demonstrate that thermality can emerge directly from causal structure, independently of acceleration or gravity, with causal diamonds encoding intrinsic thermodynamic behavior in quantum field theory.</p>

The construction can be seen as providing a natural way to isometrically embed any given finite metric space into the space of pure quantum states 'spanned' upon it. In order to show that the maps $d_p$ are indeed distance functions -- in particular, that they satisfy the triangle inequality -- we employ methods of analysis, multilinear algebra and convex geometry, obtaining a nontrivial auxiliary convexity result in the process. The paper significantly extends earlier work, resolving an important question about the geometry of quantum state space imposed by the quantum Wasserstein distances and solidifying the foundation for applications of distances $d_p$ in quantum information science.</p>

            <p>Tensor networks prepare states that share many features of states in quantum gravity. However, standard constructions are not diffeomorphism invariant and do not support an algebra of non-commuting area operators. Recently, analogues of both problems were addressed in a tensor network discretization of topological field theories (TFT) with finite or compact gauge groups. Here, we extend this work towards gravity by generalizing to gauge groups that are discrete or continuous, compact or non-compact. Applied to $\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{R}) \times \text{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ Chern-Simons theory, our construction can be interpreted as building states of three dimensional gravity with a negative cosmological constant. Our tensor networks prepare states that satisfy the constraints of Chern-Simons theory. In metric variables, this implies that the states we construct satisfy the Wheeler-DeWitt equation and momentum constraints, and so are diffeomorphism invariant.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vincent Flynn, Benedetta Flebus</p>
            <p>The identification of platforms with independently tunable nonlinearity and non-Hermiticity promises a quantitative route to far-from-equilibrium universality across many-body systems. Here we show that a conventional ferromagnetic multilayer realizes this paradigm: balancing a dc drive against Gilbert damping stabilizes a chiral spin-superfluid limit cycle that spontaneously breaks spacetime-translation symmetry. The resulting superflow is intrinsically nonreciprocal: long-wavelength magnons of opposite chirality acquire asymmetric dispersions and propagate direction-selectively, realizing a spin-superfluid diode. This asymmetry is flow-borne - it reflects broken Galilean invariance and requires neither structural asymmetry nor finely tuned gain-loss balance. Linearized dynamics in the comoving superfluid frame are intrinsically pseudo-Hermitian and, in the long-wavelength sector, can be mapped to a (1+1)D wave equation on curved spacetime. Spatial modulation of the drive enables the generation of sonic horizons that parametrically squeeze magnons and produce Hawking-like particle-hole emission. Our results establish a tabletop route from nonlinear dissipative-driven magnetization dynamics to nonreciprocal transport, nonequilibrium phase transitions, and analogue-gravity kinematics.</p>

            <h2>The Gravitational Aspect of Information: The Physical Reality of Asymmetric "Distance"</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomoi Koide, Armin van de Venn</p>
            <p>We show that when a Brownian bridge is physically constrained to satisfy a canonical condition, its time evolution exactly coincides with an m-geodesic on the statistical manifold of Gaussian distributions. This identification provides a direct physical realization of a geometric concept in information geometry. It implies that purely random processes evolve along informationally straight trajectories, analogous to geodesics in general relativity. Our findings suggest that the asymmetry of informational ``distance" (divergence) plays a fundamental physical role, offering a concrete step toward an equivalence principle for information.</p>

            <h2>High-Sensitivity NV Ensemble Imaging via AOD-Based Raster Scanning and Photodetection</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luca Troise, Nikolaj W. Hansen, Marvin Holten, Dhiren M. Kara, Jean-Francois Perrier, Ulrik L. Andersen, Alexander Huck</p>
            <p>We present a technique based on an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond capable of imaging magnetic fields with high spatio-temporal resolution. A focused laser beam is raster-scanned using an acousto-optic deflector (AOD) and NV center fluorescence is read out with a single photodetector, enabling low-noise detection with high dynamic range. The method operates in a previously unexplored regime, quasi-continuous wave optically detected magnetic resonance (qCW-ODMR). In this regime, NV centers experience short optical pump pulses for spin readout and repolarization, analogous to pulsed ODMR technique, while the microwave field remains continuously on resonance with the spin transitions. We systematically characterize this regime and show that the spin response is governed by a tunable interplay between coherent evolution and relaxation, determined by the temporal spacing between pump laser pulses. Notably, the technique does not require precise microwave pulse control, thus simplifying experimental implementation. To demonstrate its capabilities, we image time-varying magnetic fields from a microelectrode in a conductive medium with sub-millisecond temporal resolution. This approach enables flexible spatial sampling and with our diamond achieves nT$\cdot$Hz$^{-1/2}$ per pixel sensitivity, making it well suited for detecting weak, dynamic magnetic fields in biological and other complex systems.</p>

            <h2>Dispersion Outperforms Absorption: EIT-Enhanced Atomic Localization and Gradient Sensing with Super-Gaussian Beams</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mahboob Ul Haq</p>
            <p>This work presents a comprehensive theoretical comparison between absorption-based and electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT)-based atomic gradient sensing in a four-level tripod system. Both methods were evaluated under identical and optimized physical conditions to ensure a fair and unbiased comparison. The analysis demonstrates that EIT, driven by its steep dispersion response, consistently outperforms conventional absorption detection across a wide range of super-Gaussian beam profiles. Under optimal detuning, EIT achieved up to an order-of-magnitude enhancement in gradient sensitivity and maintained a twofold advantage even under identical detuning. Both approaches reached sub-diffraction spatial resolution in the range of 0.29lambda-0.40lambda, with EIT exhibiting sharper edge contrast and higher localization accuracy. These results confirm EIT as a fundamentally superior approach for precision atomic gradient sensing and sub-wavelength localization, offering clear guidance for the design of next-generation optical and quantum metrology systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raphael Kaubruegger, Adam M. Kaufman</p>
            <p>Quantum entanglement offers powerful opportunities for enhancing measurement sensitivity beyond classical limits, with optical atomic clocks serving as a leading platform for such advances. This chapter introduces the principles of entanglement-enhanced quantum metrology and explores their applications to timekeeping. We review the theoretical framework of quantum phase estimation, comparing frequentist and Bayesian approaches, and discuss paradigmatic entangled states such as spin-squeezed and GHZ states. Particular emphasis is placed on the challenges posed by decoherence, which constrain the practical advantages that can be realized in large-scale devices. The discussion then turns to frequency estimation in atomic clocks, highlighting how experimental constraints shape the translation of abstract quantum limits into real performance gains. Finally, we outline emerging directions of contemporary quantum metrology. Together, these developments underscore the increasingly close interplay between quantum information processing and precision metrology.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dat Thanh Le, Arkady Fedorov, Thomas M. Stace</p>
            <p>Circulators are nonreciprocal devices that enable directional signal routing. Nonreciprocity, which requires time-reversal symmetry breaking, can be produced in waveguides in which the propagation medium moves relative to the waveguide at a moderate fraction of the wave speed. Motivated by this effect, here we propose a design for nonreciprocal microwave transmission based on an extended, annular Josephson junction, in which the propagation medium consists of a train of moving fluxons. We show how to harness this to build a high-quality resonant microwave circulator, and we theoretically evaluate the anticipated performance of such a device.</p>

            <h2>Detection of photon-level signals embedded in sunlight with an atomic photodetector</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Laura Zarraoa, Romain Veyron, Tomas Lamich, Sondos Elsehimy, Morgan W. Mitchell</p>
            <p>The detection of few-photon signals in a broadband background is an extreme challenge for photon counting, requiring filtering that accepts a narrow range of optical frequencies while strongly rejecting all others. Recent work [Zarraoa et. al, Phys. Rev. Res. 6, 033338 (2024)] demonstrated that trapped single atoms can act as low dark-count narrow-band photodetectors. Here we show that this ``quantum jump photodetector'' (QJPD) approach can also detect photon-level signals embedded in strong sunlight. Using a single rubidium atom as a QJPD, we count arrivals of individual narrow-band laser photons embedded in sunlight powers of order $10^{10}$ photons/s. We derive a rate-equation model for the atom's internal-state dynamics in sunlight, and find quantitative agreement with experiment. Using this model, we calculate the channel capacity over a noisy communication channel when sending weak coherent states and detecting them in the presence of sunlight, achieving a representative rate of 0.5 bits per symbol when sending 150 probe photons per 10 ms time-bin, embedded in 1 nW of sunlight (of order $10^{10}$ photons/s in the visible and near-infrared bands). The demonstration may benefit background-limited applications such as daytime light detection and ranging (LIDAR), remote magnetometry, and free-space classical and quantum optical communications.</p>

            <p>Quantum technologies, encompassing communication, computation, and metrology, rely on the generation and control of non-Gaussian states of light. These states enable secure quantum communication, fault-tolerant quantum computation, and precision sensing beyond classical limits, yet their practical realisation remains a major challenge due to reliance on high-photon-number Fock states or strong non-linearities. Here we introduce a unified optical framework that removes this constraint, using only Gaussian inputs, optical parametric amplification, and heralded photon detection. Within a single architecture, we demonstrate the generation of photon-added squeezed states with near unit fidelity, cubic-phase-like states with strong non-linearities and fidelities above 98.5%, and squeezed-cat states exceeding 99% fidelity that can be iteratively bred into GKP grid states surpassing the 9.75 dB fault-tolerance threshold. Operating entirely below 3 dB of input squeezing, the approach provides a scalable, experimentally accessible platform that unites the state resources required for quantum communication, metrology, and computation within one coherent optical framework.</p>

            <p>Non-Hermitian quantum mechanics with parity-time (PT) symmetry offers a powerful framework for exploring the complex interplay of dissipation and coherent interactions in open quantum systems. While PT-symmetry breaking has been studied in various physical systems, its observation on a quantum many-body level remains elusive. Here, we experimentally realize a non-Hermitian XY model in a strongly-interacting Rydberg-atom array. By measuring the Loschmidt Echo of a fully polarized state, we observe distinct dynamical signatures of a PT-symmetry-breaking phase transition. Dipole interactions are found to play a crucial role, not only determining the transition point but also triggering a non-Hermitian many-body blockade effect that protects the Loschmidt Echo from decay with a non-monotonic dependence on the system size. Our results reveal intricate interaction-induced effects on PT-symmetry breaking and open the door for exploring non-Hermitian many-body dynamics beyond single-particle and mean-field paradigms.</p>

            <h2>Fault-tolerant quantum computation with constant overhead for general noise</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthias Christandl, Omar Fawzi, Ashutosh Goswami</p>
            <p>Fault-tolerant quantum computation traditionally incurs substantial resource overhead, with both qubit and time overheads scaling polylogarithmically with the size of the computation. While prior work by Gottesman showed that constant qubit overhead is achievable under stochastic noise using quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes, it has remained an open question whether similar guarantees hold under more general, non-stochastic noise models. In this work, we address this question by considering a general circuit-level noise model defined via the diamond norm, which captures both stochastic and non-stochastic noise, including coherent and amplitude damping noise. We prove that constant qubit overhead fault-tolerant quantum computation is achievable in this general setting, using QLDPC codes with constant rate and linear minimum distance. To establish our result, we develop a fault-tolerant error correction scheme and a method for implementing logic gates under general circuit noise. These results extend the theoretical foundations of fault-tolerant quantum computation and offer new directions for fault-tolerant architectures under realistic noise models.</p>

            <p>Majorana bound states (MBSs), with their non-Abelian statistics and topological protection, are key candidates for fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, their unambiguous identification in solid-state systems remains a fundamental challenge. Here, we present a theoretical study demonstrating that drag transport in a capacitively coupled double quantum dot system offers a robust and nonlocal probe of weakly coupled MBSs. Using the master equation approach, we investigate both steady-state and transient dynamics and uncover a distinctive signature of MBSs, i.e., the emergence of pronounced split peaks in the drag transconductance, directly linked to inter-MBS coupling. We further show that the dynamics of quantum coherence exhibit an inverse correlation with the emergence and enhancement of MBS-induced split peaks in the drag transconductance as the inter-MBS coupling increases. A comparative analysis with Andreev bound states (ABSs) reveals key differences, that is, MBS-induced transconductance peaks are symmetric and robust, while ABS features are asymmetric and sensitive to perturbations. These findings establish clear experimental criteria for distinguishing MBSs and provide a practical framework for probing Majorana physics through nonlocal transport.</p>

            <p>The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model has attracted widespread attention due to its relevance to diverse areas of physics, such as high temperature superconductivity, black holes, and quantum chaos. The model is, however, extremely challenging to realize experimentally. In this work, we show how a particular form of Floquet engineering, termed ``kinetic driving'', effectively eliminates single-particle processes and creates quasi-random all-to-all interactions when applied to models of Hubbard type. For the specific case of the Bose-Hubbard model, we explicitly verify that the driven system indeed reproduces SYK physics by direct comparison of the spectral form factor and out-of-time ordered correlation functions (OTOCs). Our findings indicate that a cold-atom realization of kinetic driving -- achieved through modulation of hopping amplitudes in an optical lattice -- offers a practical and accurate platform for quantum simulation of the SYK model.</p>

Importantly, the language captures not just qubit operations, but qudit operations for any dimension $d$. Throughout the paper we explore what it means to program with projective Cliffords through a number of examples and a case study focusing on stabilizer error correcting codes.</p>

            <h2>Spontaneous emission in Casimir-Rabi oscillations through a weak optomechanical coupling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ke-Xiong Yan, Yuan Qiu, Yang Xiao, Jie Song, Ye-Hong Chen, Yan Xia</p>
            <p>The dynamical Casimir effect (DCE) describes the energy conversion from a mechanical motion to the electromagnetic fields. When the mechanical oscillator is in a mechanically excited state, the free evolution due to the DCE produces radiation in the vacuum, in analogy with the spontaneous emission from an excited atom. In this manuscript, we investigate such a spontaneous radiation process by employing the quantum trajectory approach. When the dissipation rate of the system is very low, there can be a reversible energy exchange between the mirror in the excited state and the vacuum field, and this reversible exchange is called vacuum Casimir-Rabi oscillations. Multiple quantum trajectory simulations of this process show that the number of trajectories responsible for the generation of radiation can reach a significant value when the mechanical dissipation rate is less than the photon dissipation rate. We also find that two-photon (two/three-phonon) bundle emission occurs in photon (phonon) emission. In comparison to pure two-photon and three-phonon free dissipation, the probability of two-photon bundle emission and two-phonon bundle emission are observed to be marginally elevated as a consequence of the presence of the DCE. This pattern may assist in developing a deeper comprehension of the physical characteristics of photon and phonon emission in the DCE.</p>

            <h2>Error-mitigated quantum metrology via enhanced virtual purification</h2>

            <p>Quantum metrology stands as a leading application of quantum science and technology, yet noise often constrains its precision and sensitivity. In near-term quantum metrology, existing protocols largely depend on virtual state purification, but significant noise accumulation and additional noise from the implementations of these protocols can impede their effectiveness. We propose enhanced virtual channel purification to address these problems, yielding enhanced virtual state purification as a by-product. Within sequential quantum metrology schemes, our error analysis reveals substantial bias reduction and quantum advantages in sampling cost when the number of encoding channels is ${\mathcal{O}}(p^{-1})$, where $p$ represents the error rate of encoding channels. In this range, our methods demonstrate significant improvements in parameter estimation precision and robustness against practical noise, as evidenced by numerical simulations for both single- and multi-parameter tasks. Particularly, these methods can naturally extend beyond quantum metrology, indicating their broad applicability in quantum information and quantum computation.</p>

            <p>Topological phases in frustrated quantum magnetic systems have captivated researchers for decades, with the chiral spin liquid (CSL) standing out as one of the most compelling examples. Featured by long-range entanglement, topological order, and exotic fractional excitations, the CSL has inspired extensive exploration for practical realizations. In this work, we demonstrate that CSLs can emerge in a kagome lattice driven by vacuum quantum fluctuations over the non-interacting vacuum within a single-mode gyrotropic cavity. The gyrotropic cavity imprints quantum fluctuations with time-reversal symmetry breaking and stabilizes a robust CSL phase without external laser excitation. Moreover, we identify experimentally accessible observables -- such as average photon number and transport properties -- that reveal connections between photon dynamics and the emergent chiral order. Our findings establish a novel pathway for creating, controlling, and probing topological and symmetry-breaking quantum phases in strongly correlated systems.</p>

            <p>Bell nonlocality provides a robust scalable route to the efficient certification of quantum states. Here, we introduce a general framework for constructing Bell inequalities tailored to the $\mathbb{Z}_d$ toric code for odd prime local dimensions. Selecting a suitable subset of stabilizer operators and mapping them to generalized measurement observables, we compute multipartite Bell expressions whose quantum maxima admit a sum-of-squares decomposition. We show that these inequalities are maximally violated by all states in the ground-state manifold of the $\mathbb{Z}_d$ toric code, and determine their classical (local) bounds through a combination of combinatorial tiling arguments and explicit optimization. As a concrete application, we analyze the case of $d=3$ and demonstrate that the maximal violation self-tests the full qutrit toric-code subspace, up to local isometries and complex conjugation. This constitutes, to our knowledge, the first-ever example of self-testing a qutrit subspace. Extending these constructions, we further present schemes to enhance the ratio of classical--quantum bounds and thus improve robustness to experimental imperfections. Our results establish a pathway toward device-independent certification of highly entangled topological quantum matter and provide new tools for validating qudit states in error-correcting codes and quantum simulation platforms.</p>

            <p>Quantum networking seeks to enable global entanglement distribution through terrestrial and free space channels; however, the exponential loss in these channels necessitates quantum repeaters with efficient, long lived quantum memories (QMs). Space based architectures, particularly satellite assisted links, offer a path to truly global connectivity, yet they demand QMs that are compatible with orbital factors such as infrared radiation and the unique challenges of operating aboard a satellite. In this work, we propose a multimode quantum memory (MMQM) for low Earth orbit (LEO) repeaters based on the atomic frequency comb (AFC) protocol. Our design integrates a hybrid alkali noble gas ensemble in an optical cavity, using alkali atoms for strong photon matter coupling and noble gas nuclear spins for minutes to hours coherence, all without the need for cryogenics. The architecture natively supports temporal and spectral multiplexing, enabling the storage of 100 modes to parallelize probabilistic operations and overcome light limited round trip times. Representative link budgets at $h = 500$ km with realistic apertures, $\eta_{\text{mem}}\gtrsim 70%$, and $t_{\text{buffer}}$ of several minutes predict improvements of up to two orders of magnitude in per pass success probability and instantaneous SKR relative to a memoryless dual downlink, with clear scaling in $N$. Our contributions are (i) a non cryogenic, space ready multimode memory, (ii) a systems analysis coupling mode count, storage time, and orbital geometry to achievable rate, and (iii) a near term implementation roadmap. Together, these results indicate feasibility with current to near term technology and provide a practical path toward a high rate, space enabled quantum internet.</p>

            <p>We theoretically present new unit circuits of Kerr parametric oscillators (KPOs) with four-body interactions, which enable the scalable embedding of all-to-all connected logical Ising spins using the Lechner-Hauke-Zoller (LHZ) scheme. These unit circuits enable four-body interactions using linear couplers, making the circuit fabrication and characterization much simpler than those of conventional unit circuits with nonlinear couplers. Numerical calculations indicate that the magnitudes of the coupling constants can be comparable to those in conventional circuits. On the basis of this theory, we designed a four-KPO circuit and experimentally confirmed the four-body correlation by measuring the pump-phase dependence of the parity of the four-KPO states. We show that the choice of the pump frequencies are important not only to enable the four-body interaction, but to cancel the effects of other unwanted interactions. Using the circuit, we demonstrated the quantum annealing based on the LHZ scheme, where the strength of the interaction between the logical Ising spins is mapped to the local field and controlled by a coherent drive applied to each KPO.</p>

In this architecture, input and ancillary non-Gaussian quantum states necessary for fault-tolerance and universality of quantum computing are generated with pulsed light, whereas quantum processors including continuous-variable cluster states and homodyne measurement systems are operated with CW light. This architecture is expected to enable both generation of quantum states with shorter optical wavepackets and low-loss manipulation and measurement of these states, thus is compatible with ultrafast and low-loss quantum information processing. In this study, as a proof-of-principle, an ultrafast homodyne measurement using CW local oscillator was performed on single-photon states generated with pulsed light. The measured single-photon state's temporal width was around 70 ps and the value of the Wigner function at the origin was W(0,0) = -0.153 +/- 0.003, which is highly non-classical. This will be a core technology for realizing high-speed optical quantum information processing.</p>

            <h2>Optimized Many-Hypercube Codes toward Lower Logical Error Rates and Earlier Realization</h2>

            <p>Many-hypercube codes [H. Goto, Sci. Adv. 10, eadp6388 (2024)], concatenated ${[[n,n-2,2]]}$ quantum error-detecting codes ($n$ is even), have recently been proposed as high-rate quantum codes suitable for fault-tolerant quantum computing. However, the original many-hypercube codes with ${n=6}$ have large code block sizes at high concatenation levels (216 and 1296 physical qubits per block at levels 3 and 4, respectively), making not only experimental realization difficult but also logical error rates high. Toward earlier experimental realization and lower logical error rates, here we investigate smaller many-hypercube codes obtained by concatenating $[[6,4,2]]$ and/or $[[4,2,2]]$ codes, where, e.g., $D_{6,4,4}$ denotes the many-hypercube code using $[[6,4,2]]$ at level 1 and $[[4,2,2]]$ at levels 2 and 3. As a result, we found a surprising fact: $D_{6,4,4}$ ($D_{6,6,4,4}$) can achieve lower block error rates than $D_{4,4,4}$ ($D_{4,4,4,4}$), despite its higher encoding rate. Focusing on level 3, we also developed efficient fault-tolerant encoders realizing about 60% overhead reduction while maintaining or even improving the performance, compared to the original design. Using them, we numerically confirmed that $D_{6,4,4}$ also achieves the best performance for logical controlled-NOT gates in a circuit-level noise model. These results will be useful for early experimental realization of fault-tolerant quantum computing with high-rate quantum codes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David F. Locher, Josias Old, Katharina Brechtelsbauer, Jakob Holschbach, Hans Peter Büchler, Sebastian Weber, Markus Müller</p>
            <p>Multiqubit gates that involve three or more qubits are usually thought to be of little significance for fault-tolerant quantum error correction because single gate faults can lead to high-weight correlated errors. However, recent works have shown that multiqubit gates can be beneficial for measurement-free fault-tolerant quantum error correction and for fault-tolerant stabilizer readout in unrotated surface codes. In this work, we investigate multiqubit Rydberg gates that are useful for fault-tolerant quantum error correction in single-species neutral-atom platforms and can be implemented with a single, non-addressed laser pulse. We develop an open-source Python package to generate analytical, few-parameter pulses that implement the desired gates while minimizing gate errors due to Rydberg-state decay. The tool also allows us to identify parameter-optimal pulses, characterized by a minimal parameter count for the pulse ansatz. Measurement-free quantum error correction protocols require CCZ gates, which we analyze for atoms arranged in symmetric and asymmetric configurations. We investigate the performance of these schemes for various single-, two-, and three-qubit gate error rates, showing that break-even performance of measurement-free QEC is within reach of current hardware. Moreover, we study Floquet quantum error correction protocols that comprise two-body stabilizer measurements. Those can be realized using global three-qubit gates, and we show that this can lead to a significant reduction in shuttling operations. Simulations with realistic circuit-level noise indicate that applying three-qubit gates for stabilizer measurements in Floquet codes can yield competitive logical qubit performance in experimentally relevant error regimes.</p>

            <h2>Thermalization Rate of Light in Weakly Coupled Molecular Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vladislav Yu. Shishkov</p>
            <p>Emission and absorption spectra of molecular films are impacted by low-frequency molecular vibrations. These vibrations define the linewidths of the absorption and emission spectral peaks, as well as the Stokes shift. In cavities that use a molecular film as an active medium, low-frequency molecular vibrations facilitate the thermalization of light, enabling the formation of Bose-Einstein condensation. In this work, I employ perturbation theory for Lindblad superoperators and derive the contribution of the low-frequency molecular vibrations to the thermalization rate of light in a weak coupling regime between light and matter. The derived thermalization rate applies for any cavity design but depends on the local microscopic properties of low-frequency molecular vibrations. I provide an estimation for the thermalization rate, which requires only knowledge of the macroscopic parameters of the system: light-matter interaction strength, resonant frequencies of the cavity and excitons, number of molecules in the illuminated area, and the linewidth temperature dependence of the 0-0 peak in the emission spectra of standalone molecular film.</p>

            <p>The projected rapid growth of battery cell production over the next decade demands advanced diagnostic tools for quality control, ageing prediction, and recycling. Most existing techniques lack the spatial and temporal resolution required to capture internal electrochemical processes non-invasively. Here, we present magnetic imaging of current densities in battery cells, a sensitive quantum-magnetometry method that uses optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) to perform real-time imaging of internal dynamics in open-circuit configuration. We demonstrate this approach for monitoring relaxation processes in 6000 mA h lithium-ion cells following pulsed discharges across a range of pulse durations and currents as well as states of charge. The measurement results are benchmarked against superconducting-quantum-interference-device (SQUID) magnetometry and validated with three-dimensional finite element simulations. Equivalent circuit models are employed to interpret the relaxation profiles, revealing spatially resolved features and transient magnetic-field signatures that are inaccessible with complementary non-invasive techniques such as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). This work establishes OPM-based magnetic imaging of battery current density as a powerful diagnostic tool with potential impact on cell development, manufacturing quality assurance, and second-life assessment.</p>

            <h2>Passive Polarization Stabilization for Practical and Robust Entanglement Distribution</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jin-Woo Kim, Minchul Kim, Jiho Park, Chunju Youn</p>
            <p>Quantum entanglement is a key resource in quantum information science, playing an essential role in quantum key distribution (QKD), quantum networks, and distributed quantum computing. However, practical applications require techniques capable of reliably distributing entanglement under lossy and noisy conditions. In this work, we demonstrate that a simple configuration using two polarization-maintaining fibers (PMFs) arranged in a cross-axis alignment enables stable distribution of entangled photon pairs without the need for real-time polarization compensation. To support this, we performed quantum information modeling and fidelity simulations for the cross-aligned PMF pair, and experimentally compared the entanglement preservation and interference fringe stability in setups based on standard single-mode fibers (SMFs) and PMFs. The experimental results show that the PMF-based configuration achieves an average visibility of 0.867 and an error propagation of 0.023 under unstable conditions, whereas the SMF setup exhibits a significantly lower stability with an average visibility of 0.444 and an error propagation of 0.167 under the same conditions. These results indicate that the cross-aligned PMF pair allows robust entanglement transmission without complex active compensation devices, suggesting its suitability for reliable quantum state distribution in long-distance quantum communication, drone-based QKD, and multi-user quantum networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Geng Zhao, Yun Chen, Jiayuang Zhang, Jing Tang, Yuangang Deng</p>
            <p>We propose an experimentally accessible scheme for realizing tunable nonclassical light in cavity-coupled reconfigurable atomic arrays. By coherently controlling the collective interference phase, the system switches from single-photon blockade to high-purity multiphoton bundle emission, unveiling a hierarchical structure of photon correlations dictated by atom-number parity and cavity detuning. The scaling of photon population identifies the transition between superradiant and subradiant regimes, while parity- and phase-dependent spin correlations elucidate the microscopic interference processes enabling coherent multiphoton generation. This work establishes a unified framework connecting cooperative atomic interactions to controllable nonclassical photon statistics and introduces a distinct interference-enabled mechanism that provides a practical route toward high-fidelity multiphoton sources in scalable cavity QEDs.</p>

            <p>Bound states in the continuum (BICs) have attracted intense interest, yet their many-particle counterparts remain largely unexplored in waveguide quantum electrodynamics. We identify and characterize a bound state embedded in the doublon continuum (BIDC) that emerges when four atoms couple to a coupled-resonator waveguide with strong on-site interaction. Exploiting this interaction-enabled BIDC, we show that (i) a distant, four-atom entangled state can be prepared with high fidelity, and (ii) quantum entangled states can be coherently transferred between spatially separated nodes. Our results establish a scalable mechanism for multi-particle state generation and routing in waveguide platforms, opening a route to interaction-protected quantum communication with many-particle BICs.</p>

            <p>The Wigner function is a well-known phase space distribution function with many applications in quantum mechanics. In this article, we consider an open quantum system consisting of a non-relativistic single particle interacting with a general, possibly relativistic environment. For this system, we derive an expression for directly computing the time-dependent Wigner function from its initial values. This result renders time-dependent Wigner functions more applicable without having to make additional approximations that would otherwise be required in order to solve the corresponding equation of motion. As an illustration of our findings, we discuss the example of a non-relativistic single scalar particle interacting via a Yukawa interaction with an environment comprising another type of scalar field that is treated relativistically.</p>

            <p>The response of a ferrimagnetic sphere resonator to an externally applied parametric excitation is experimentally studied. Measurement results are compared with predictions derived from a theoretical model, which is based on the hypothesis that disentanglement spontaneously occurs in quantum systems. According to this hypothesis, time evolution is governed by a modified master equation having an added nonlinear term that deterministically generates disentanglement. It is found that the disentanglement--based model is compatible with the experimental results. In particular, the model can qualitatively account for an experimentally observed instability in the system under study, which cannot be derived from any theoretical model that is based on a linear master equation.</p>

            <p>We introduce folded optimal transport, as a way of extending a cost or distance defined on the extreme boundary of a convex to the whole set, broadening the framework of standard optimal transport, found to be the particular case where the convex is a simplex. Relying on Choquet's theory and standard optimal transport, we introduce the so-called folded Kantorovitch cost and folded Wasserstein distance, and study the metric properties it provides to the convex. We then apply the construction to the quantum setting, and obtain an actual separable quantum Wasserstein distance on the set of density matrices from a distance on the set of pure states, closely related to the semi-distance of Beatty and Stilck-França [3], and of which we obtain a variety of properties. Folded optimal transport provides a unified setting for both classical and separable quantum optimal transport, and we also find that the semiclassical Golse-Paul [12] cost writes as a folded Kantorovitch cost.</p>

            <p>Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) has emerged as a promising approach for secure quantum communication, offering advantages such as high key generation rates, compatibility with standard telecommunication infrastructure, and potential for integration on photonic chips. This review provides an accessible introduction to the theory of CV-QKD, aimed at researchers entering this rapidly developing field. We focus on fundamental concepts, key protocols, and security analysis essential for understanding CV-QKD systems, with a special emphasis on prepare-and-measure protocols using coherent states under asymptotic security conditions. We explain their equivalence to entanglement-based protocols and detail the security proof framework against collective attacks, encompassing both Gaussian and discrete modulation schemes. We also briefly address more advanced topics, including measurement-device-independent CV-QKD and finite-size security analysis. This work is motivated by Brazil's growing investment in quantum communication technologies. By presenting a clear learning path from basic concepts to advanced topics, this work aims to equip newcomers with the essential tools to engage with current research in CV-QKD, thereby supporting the training of a new generation of researchers in this strategic field.</p>

            <p>Quantum state preparation (QSP) for a general $n$-qubit state requires $O(2^n)$ CNOT gates and circuit depth, making exact amplitude encoding (EAE) impractical for near-term quantum hardware. We introduce an ancilla-free hybrid classical-quantum strategy that reduces this cost to $O(poly(n))$ for a broad class of compressible data. The method first applies a classical compression step to obtain a $d$-sparse representation of the input, loads this sparse vector using a sparse-state preparation routine, and then reconstructs the target state through a polynomial-depth quantum inverse transform. We evaluate the framework on synthetic benchmark signals and real biomedical time series using Fourier and Haar transforms, demonstrating substantial reductions in CNOT counts and circuit depth compared to EAE, together with competitive performance relative to the Fourier Series Loader (FSL). The quantum simulation results show that combining classical data compression with quantum decompression provides a scalable framework for efficient QSP, reducing quantum overhead without requiring variational training or ancillary registers.</p>

            <p>Scalable quantum computing requires architectural solutions beyond monolithic processors. Distributed quantum computing (DQC) addresses this challenge by interconnecting smaller quantum nodes through quantum communication protocols, enabling collaborative computation. While several experimental and theoretical proposals for DQC exist, emulator platforms are essential tools for exploring their feasibility under realistic conditions. In this work, we introduce a benchmarking framework to evaluate DQC emulators using a distributed implementation of the inverse Quantum Fourier Transform ($\mathrm{QFT}^{\dagger}$) as a representative test case, which enables efficient phase recovery from pre-encoded Fourier states. The QFT is partitioned across nodes using teleportation-based protocols, and performance is analyzed in terms of execution time, memory usage, and fidelity with respect to a monolithic baseline. As part of this work, we review a broad range of emulators, identifying their capabilities and limitations for programming distributed quantum algorithms. Many platforms either lacked support for teleportation protocols or required complex workarounds. Consequently, we select and benchmark four representative emulators: Qiskit Aer, SquidASM, Interlin-q, and SQUANCH. They differ significantly in their support for discrete-event simulation, quantum networking, noise modeling, and parallel execution. Our results highlight the trade-offs between architectural fidelity and simulation scalability, providing a foundation for future emulator development and the validation of distributed quantum protocols. This framework can be extended to support additional algorithms and emulators.</p>

            <p>The quantum and reversible paradigm merges the principles of quantum mechanics and reversible computation to enable information-preserving processing. It supports next-generation computing architectures that provide improved scalability and enhanced computational efficiency. Within these architectures, the decimal adder is a key arithmetic component, particularly for Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) operations widely used in financial and commercial systems. However, most reversible BCD adders focus primarily on quantum and reversible metrics, overlooking the critical influence of delay, which makes balanced optimization a significant challenge. This paper presents two reversible BCD adder designs optimized for both delay and quantum cost. One design integrates the decimal carry-skip technique to improve the overall delay. Using reversible logic gates, the proposed architectures efficiently perform BCD addition and implement the required correction logic while maintaining full reversibility. Evaluation results indicate that the proposed designs surpass existing reversible BCD adders, achieving best-case average improvements of 85.12% in delay and 30.75% in quantum cost. These advancements demonstrate the potential of the proposed adders for integration into future quantum-based arithmetic units and scalable reversible computing systems. Moreover, analysis of real banking transaction data underscores the practical importance of BCD addition and its widespread use in accurate and efficient monetary computations.</p>

            <h2>Automated Compilation Including Dropouts: Tolerating Defective Components in Stabiliser Codes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stasiu Wolanski</p>
            <p>Utility-scale solid-state quantum devices will need to fabricate quantum devices at scale using imperfect processes. By introducing tolerance to fabrication defects into the design of the quantum devices, we can improve the yield of usable quantum chips and lower the cost of useful systems. Automated Compilation Including Dropouts (ACID) is a framework that works in the ancilla-free (or `middle-out') paradigm, to generate syndrome extraction circuits for general stabiliser codes in the presence of defective couplers or qubits. In the ancilla-free paradigm, we do not designate particular qubits as measurement ancillas, instead measuring stabilisers using any of the data qubits in their support. This approach leads to a great deal of flexibility in how syndrome extraction circuits can be implemented. ACID works by constructing and solving an optimisation problem within the ancilla-free paradigm to find a short syndrome extraction circuit. Applied to the surface code, ACID produces syndrome-extraction circuits of depth between $1\times$ (no overhead) and $1.5\times$ relative to the depth of defect-free circuits. The LUCI algorithm, the best prior art, yielded a $2 \times$ overhead, so ACID offers a significant time saving. The yield of surface code chips with a logical error rate at most $10\times$ the dropout-free baseline is up to $3\times$ higher using ACID than using LUCI. I demonstrate the broad applicability of ACID by compiling syndrome extraction circuits for bivariate bicycle codes and the colour code. For these circuits, we incur a circuit-depth overhead of between $1\times$ (no overhead) and $2.5\times$ relative to defect-free circuits. I believe this work is the first to simulate both of these families of codes in the presence of fabrication defects.</p>

Although embedding nonlinear materials within resonant structures allows for the enhancement and tailoring of photon properties, accurately modeling these quantum interactions remains a challenge.

Unlike previous applications of this formalism, we explicitly account for reflections in the system. We derive the interaction Hamiltonian and calculate photon-pair generation rates using perturbation theory. The versatility of this model is illustrated through three examples: (i) spontaneous parametric down-conversion in an idealized cavity with flat-response mirrors; (ii) the generation of counter-propagating photon pairs in a periodically-poled material; and (iii) spontaneous four-wave mixing in a cavity built with Bragg reflectors.</p>

            <p>Quantum Separation Logic (QSL) has been proposed as an effective tool to improve the scalability of deductive reasoning for quantum programs. In QSL, separation is interpreted as disentanglement, and the frame rule brings a notion of entanglement-local specification (one that only talks about the qubits entangled with those acted upon by the program). In this paper, we identify two notions of locality unique to the quantum domain, and we construct a novel quantum separation logic, RapunSL, which is able to soundly reduce reasoning about superposition states to reasoning about pure states (basis-locality), and reasoning about mixed states arising from measurement to reasoning about pure states (outcome-locality). To do so, we introduce two connectives, linear combination and mixing, which together with separation provide a dramatic improvement in the scalability of reasoning, as we demonstrate on a series of challenging case studies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anthony O. Lara, Justin J. Talbot, Zhe Wang, Martin Head-Gordon</p>
            <p>Large atomic-orbital (AO) basis sets of at least triple and preferably quadruple-zeta (QZ) size are required to adequately converge Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) calculations towards the complete basis set limit. However, incrementing the cardinal number by one nearly doubles the AO basis dimension, and the computational cost scales as the cube of the AO dimension, so this is very computationally demanding. In this work, we develop and test a natural atomic orbital (NAO) scheme in which the NAOs are obtained as eigenfunctions of atomic blocks of the density matrix in a one-center orthogonalized representation. The NAO representation enables one-center compression of the AO basis in a manner that is optimal for a given threshold, by discarding NAOs with occupation numbers below that threshold. Extensive tests using the Hartree-Fock functional suggest that a threshold of $10^{-5}$ can yield a compression factor (ratio of AO to compressed NAO dimension) between 2.5 and 4.5 for the QZ pc-3 basis. The errors in relative energies are typically less than 0.1 kcal/mol when the compressed basis is used instead of the uncompressed basis. Between 10 and 100 times smaller errors (i.e., usually less than 0.01 kcal/mol) can be obtained with a threshold $10^{-7}$, while the compression factor is typically between 2 and 2.5.</p>

            <p>Starting from the foundational axiomatization of the perceptual color space initiated by Schrödinger in 1920 and eventually refined by Resnikoff in 1974, Berthier, Provenzi and their collaborators have recently proposed a reformulation of perceptual color attributes within the framework of quantum information. Their work is based on the Jordan algebra formalism of quantum theories and, more specifically, on a quantum system described by a spin factor over the field of real numbers. This theoretical framework is not that of ordinary quantum mechanics, mainly because it requires dealing with rebits, whereas the latter uses qubits. The aim of this paper is to show that this difference in no way hinders the implementation of experimental protocols for testing the validity of the predictions of the color perception model. In particular, we show how to compute the quantum information based perceptual attributes of perceived colors in terms of qubit density matrices.</p>

            <p>We are at the dawn of the second quantum revolution, where our ability to create and control individual quantum systems is poised to drive transformative advancements in basic science, computation, and everyday life. However, quantum theory has long been conceived as notoriously hard to learn, creating a significant barrier to workforce development, informed decision-making by stakeholders and policymakers, and broader public understanding. This paper is concerned with Quantum Picturalism, a novel visual mathematical language for quantum physics. Originally developed over two decades ago to explore the foundational structure of quantum theory, this rigorous diagrammatic framework has since been adopted in both academia and industry as a powerful tool for quantum computing research and software development. Here, we demonstrate its potential as a transformative educational methodology. We report the findings from a pilot study involving 54 UK high school students, randomly selected from a pool of 734 volunteers across the UK. Despite the absence of advanced mathematical prerequisites, these students demonstrated a strong conceptual grasp of key quantum principles and operations. On an assessment comprising university graduate-level exam questions, participants achieved an 82% pass rate, with 48% obtaining a distinction-level grade. These results pave the way for making quantum more inclusive, lowering traditional cognitive and demographic barriers to quantum learning. This approach has the potential to broaden participation in the field and provide a promising new entry point for stakeholders, future experts, and the general public.</p>

            <h2>When the center matters: color screening and gluelumps in dihedral lattice gauge theories</h2>

            <p>Confinement is one of the hallmarks of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Yet, its first-principle characterization, even in simpler models, remains elusive. Through a combination of group-theoretical arguments and numerical analysis, we show that the physical consequences of confinement in a class of discrete non-Abelian lattice gauge theories (LGTs), the dihedral groups $D_N$, are intimately connected with the presence of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ central subgroup. When the center is trivial (for odd $N$), static charges are screened by a gluon cloud, forming composite objects known in SU$(N)$ gauge theories as gluelumps. This finding implies that string breaking can occur through fluctuations of the electric field only, without the need to nucleate particle--antiparticle pairs from the vacuum. Furthermore, numerical analysis hints at finite-range interactions between the gluelumps in the continuum limit. Our results showcase how the rich and intricate physics typically associated with QCD can emerge in much simpler discrete non-Abelian LGTs, making them ideal settings to test this phenomenology both in numerical calculations and in near-term quantum devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Louis Hamaide, Hannah Banks, Peter Barker, Andrew A. Geraci</p>
            <p>Many well theoretically motivated models of ultralight dark matter are expected to give rise to feeble oscillatory forces on macroscopic objects. Optically trapped sensors have high force sensitivities but have remained relatively unexplored in this context. In this work we propose a new, tunable, optically trapped sensor specifically designed to detect such forces. Our design features a high-mass (mg) plate whose weight is supported by a vertical beam. We present the first systematic analysis and optimisation of quantum noises in optically trapped systems and show that our setup has the potential to operate at the standard quantum limit with current off-the-shelf technologies. We demonstrate that our sensor could offer unique access to large regions of uncharted parameter space of vector B-L dark matter, with projected sensitivities that could advance existing limits by several orders of magnitude over a broad range of frequencies.</p>

Both the anisotropic term and the bulk inversion asymmetry term of the Kane model are taken into account. Although the anisotropic term has converted the crossing between the $E_{1}$ and $H_{1}$ subbands into an anticrossing at $k_{z}R\!=\!0$, the gap-closing-and-reopening transition in the subband structure can still occur at the wave vectors $k_{z}R\!\approx\!\pm0.24$ for critical nanowire radius $R\!\approx\!3.45$ nm. The bulk inversion asymmetry does not contribute to the low-energy effective Hamiltonian, i.e., there is no spin splitting in the $E_{1}$, $H_{1}$, and $H_{2}$ subbands for a [001] oriented cylindrical nanowire.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ben Lee-Yeung Ngai, Justin Tim-Lok Chau, Junchen Rong, Yuan Da Liao, Zi Yang Meng</p>
            <p>Computing the subleading logarithmic term in the entanglement entropy (EE) of (2+1)d quantum many-body systems remains a significant challenge, despite its critical role in revealing universal information about quantum states and quantum critical points (QCPs). Capitalizing on recent algorithmic advances that enable the stable calculation of EE as an exponential observable, we develop a {\it bubble basis} projector quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm to precisely and efficiently compute the universal corner EE along a parameter trajectory connecting the Ising and Gaussian QCPs; where in the latter case there exists an analytic value to benchmark with. Our approach eliminates the dominant area-law term directly within the QMC sampling, thereby promoting the coveted subleading logarithmic term to the leading contribution. We apply this technique to calculate the EE in a (2+1)d square-lattice transverse-field Ising model augmented with a four-body interaction, tracing a path from the Ising to the Gaussian QCPs and then to the first-order transition. The consistent values obtained for the universal corner EE along the path validate the reliability and precision of our approach for extracting challenging entanglement properties. These results establish the long-sought connection between the universal values of an exactly solvable limit and those of a strongly correlated regime at (2+1)d.</p>

            <p>Bond breaking in the presence of highly energetic carriers is central to many important phenomena in physics and chemistry, including radiation damage, hot-carrier degradation, activation of dopant-hydrogen complexes in semiconductors, and photocatalysis. Describing these processes from first principles has remained an elusive goal. Here we introduce a comprehensive theoretical framework for the dissociation process, emphasizing the need for a non-adiabatic approach. We benchmark the results for the case of silicon-hydrogen bond dissocation, a primary process for hot-carrier degradation. Passivation of Si dangling bonds by hydrogen is vital in all Si devices because it eliminates electrically active mid-gap states; understanding the mechanism for dissociation of these bonds is therefore crucial for device technology. While the need for a non-adiabatic approach has been previously recognized, explicitly obtaining diabatic states for solid-state systems has been an outstanding challenge. We demonstrate how to obtain these states by applying a partitioning scheme to the Hamiltonian obtained from first-principles density functional theory. Our results demonstrate that bond dissociation can occur when electrons temporarily occupy the antibonding states, generating a highly repulsive excited-state potential that causes the hydrogen nuclear wavepacket to shift and propagate rapidly. Based on the Menzel-Gomer-Redhead (MGR) model, we show that after moving on this excited-state potential on femtosecond timescales, a portion of the nuclear wavepacket can continue to propagate even after the system relaxes back to the ground state, allowing us to determine the dissociation probability. Our results provide essential insights into the fundamental processes that drive carrier-induced bond breaking in general, and specifically elucidate hydrogen-related degradation in Si devices.</p>

Sharp stepwise drops in resonance frequency are detected as a function of increasing external magnetic field, attributed to the entry of individual Abrikosov vortices in the narrow region. This interpretation is confirmed by NV center magnetometry revealing discrete vortex entry events on increasing field. Our results establish a method to investigate and manipulate the states of Abrikosov vortices with microwaves.</p>

            <p>We introduce color Heisenberg-Lie (super)algebras graded by the abelian groups $Z_3^2$, $Z_2^p\times Z_3^2$ for $p=1,2,3$, and investigate the properties of their associated multi-particle quantum paraoscillators. In the Rittenberg-Wyler's color Lie (super)algebras framework the above abelian groups are the simplest ones which induce mixed brackets interpolating commutators and anticommutators. These mixed brackets allow to accommodate two types of parastatistics: one based on the permutation group (beyond bosons and fermions in any space dimension) and an anyonic parastatistics based on the braid group. In both such cases the two broad classes of paraparticles are given by parabosons and parafermions. Mixed-bracket parafermions are created by nilpotent operators; they satisfy a generalized Pauli exclusion principle leading to roots-of-unity truncations in their multi-particle energy spectrum (braided Majorana qubits and their Gentile-type parastatistics are recovered in this color Lie superalgebra setting). Mixed-bracket parabosons do not admit truncations of the spectrum; the minimal detectable signature of their parastatistics is encoded in the measurable probability density of two indistinguishable parabosonic oscillators in a given energy eigenstate.</p>

            <h2>Spectral form factor and power spectrum for trapped rotating interacting bosons: An exact diagonalization study</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohd Talib, M. A. H. Ahsan</p>
            <p>We present an exact diagonalization study of the spectral form factor and the power spectrum for externally impressed rotating bosons in a quasi-two-dimensional harmonic trap interacting via repulsive Gaussian potential. Our focus is on the spectral correlations arising from the condensate depletion as a result of the formation of quantized vortices and the strong interaction, which leads to chaos in the system. We consider two distinct interaction regimes: moderate, where the interaction energy is small compared to the trap energy, and strong, where it is comparable. For the non-rotating case, the spectral form factor (SFF) in the moderate interaction regime exhibits a dip-plateau structure characteristic of integrable systems, while in the strong interaction regime it develops a weak ramp, signalling a transition to pseudo-integrable behavior. For the rotating single-vortex state, the SFF in the moderate interaction regime shows the onset of a weak ramp consistent with pseudo-integrability, whereas in the strong interaction regime the ramp becomes significantly more pronounced, indicating strongly chaotic behavior. For the multi-vortex states in the strong interacting regime, the SFF exhibits a clear dip-ramp-plateau structure, indicative of chaotic behavior. The corresponding power spectrum results further corroborate these findings: integrable system exhibits the characteristic $1/f^{\alpha}$ (with $\alpha \approx2$) noise, chaotic system shows the ubiquitous $1/f^{\alpha}$ (with $\alpha \approx 1$) noise, and pseudo-integrable system yields intermediate exponents with $1 < \alpha < 2$.</p>

Here, we work on the so-called diffusion gauge and propose an algorithm to find efficiently new implementations of the noise terms. Compared with our initial results [F. Rousse \textit{et al.} 2024, J. Phys. A: Math.

This problem is relevant for the exchange of hydroxide ions across a multi-layer membrane in an alkaline electrolyzer. We use $16$ to $64$ grid points across the membrane, resulting from $n=4$ to $6$ data qubits for the ideal quantum simulations that are based on the Qiskit software. For these qubit numbers, the depth of the parametric quantum circuit has been chosen to ensure sufficient expressibility. The state preparation requires particular attention since the diffusivity $D$ is piecewise constant in the different layers with discontinuities at the interface. Furthermore, we compare different classical optimization schemes with respect to their convergence in the VQA method. We demonstrate the applicability of the quantum algorithm to a problem with non-trivial boundary conditions and jump conditions of the diffusion constant and outline possible extensions of the proof-of-concept application case of quantum computing.</p>

Using the technique of combinatorial designs, we also determine the quantum chromatic number of the distance-2 Hamming graph, whose edges consist of binary vectors of Hamming distance 2, for infinitely many length.</p>

We investigate the ``inductive" van der Waals-London interaction using both semiclassical and quantum electrodynamic (QED) approaches. The semiclassical model predicts a repulsive interaction due to anticorrelated current fluctuations. In contrast, the QED framework, which incorporates virtual photon exchange, reveals a predominantly attractive force. A key contribution comes from a state-independent two-photon exchange, which is absent in the semiclassical description and undetectable by spectroscopy. Our study introduces a new experimental platform for measuring the van der Waals force between individual artificial atoms via controlled mesoscopic circuits.</p>

            <p>The ability to switch and program molecular transitions via deterministically located plasmonic nanoantennae presents opportunities for wide spectrum of applications from biosensors to quantum computing. Due to its topology, toroidal nanoantenna (TNA) focuses immense amount of three-dimensional (3D) local electric field by toroidal moment while allowing pre and post positioning around quantum emitters (QEs). Here, we report complete switching of molecular transition energies of quantum objects (QOs) with modulation depth of 99.9% over 2840-fold radiative enhancement. At optimized TNA geometries, Fano interference between the broadband plasmonic continuum and narrow quantum transitions of QOs suppresses both radiative and non-radiative decay channels near 850 nm, yielding an observable full switching that traps energy within the hybrid mode instead of re-emitting it. To show the promises of the concept, we further demonstrate systems with multiple QOs where spectral degeneracy enhances the transparency bandwidth, while detuning generates distinct minima, enabling individually addressable spectral responses. These results establish plasmonic TNA as a promising architecture for spectral detection of single or multi-molecule configurations with high sensitivity and empowers the user for the implementation of quantum mode switches to be used in photonic processing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> SVS Sai Ruthvik, Tanay Nag</p>
            <p>We investigate the emergence of nonreciprocal dissipationless supercurrents in one-dimension manifested through the superconducting diode effect (SDE) and the Josephson diode effect (JDE) in the absence of any external magnetic field, where inversion symmetry (IS) and time-reversal symmetry (TRS) can be intrinsically broken by spin-orbit coupling (SOC), and altermagnetism (AM), respectively. We investigate Ising and Rashba SOC separately in two models where two-component AM, assembled with crystallographic angle, can lead to qualitatively similar indirect band-gap closing and non-reciprocal supercurrent in a Fulde-Ferrell (FF) superconductor. Interestingly, in the absence of the above SOCs, SDE persists and the sign of efficiency can be altered by tuning the angle only. Parallel spin components with complementary momentum functions, ensuring the breaking of IS and TRS, can induce SDE in the presence of FF pairing. Continuing the analysis in the context of JDE, we explore the interplay between SOCs and AM with the p-wave and Fulde-Ferrell superconductivity in three different setups. The bulk bands contributes to the non-reciprocity in the case of p-wave superconductivity while JDE is dominated by Andreev bound states for FF superconductivity. Importantly, JDE continues to exist due to finite momentum Cooper pair even without AM and SOC unlike the p-wave superconductivity. The sign of JD efficiency can be tuned with angle for p-wave superconductivity while absence of such sign reversal is a hallmark signature of FF superconductivity. Similar to SDE, parallel spin components in conjunction with p-wave superconductivity can lead to JDE that can also be mediated by only FF pairing in the absence of SOC and AM.</p>

            <p>Despite rapid advances in molecular and materials machine learning, most models still lack physical transferability: they fit correlations across whole molecules or crystals rather than learning the quantum interactions between atomic pairs. Yet bonding, charge redistribution, orbital hybridization, and electronic coupling all emerge from these two-body interactions that define local quantum fields in many-body systems. We introduce QuantumCanvas, a large-scale multimodal benchmark that treats two-body quantum systems as foundational units of matter. The dataset spans 2,850 element-element pairs, each annotated with 18 electronic, thermodynamic, and geometric properties and paired with ten-channel image representations derived from l- and m-resolved orbital densities, angular field transforms, co-occupancy maps, and charge-density projections. These physically grounded images encode spatial, angular, and electrostatic symmetries without explicit coordinates, providing an interpretable visual modality for quantum learning. Benchmarking eight architectures across 18 targets, we report mean absolute errors of 0.201 eV on energy gap using GATv2, 0.265 eV on HOMO and 0.274 eV on LUMO using EGNN. For energy-related quantities, DimeNet attains 2.27 eV total-energy MAE and 0.132 eV repulsive-energy MAE, while a multimodal fusion model achieves a 2.15 eV Mermin free-energy MAE. Pretraining on QuantumCanvas further improves convergence stability and generalization when fine-tuned on larger datasets such as QM9, MD17, and CrysMTM. By unifying orbital physics with vision-based representation learning, QuantumCanvas provides a principled and interpretable basis for learning transferable quantum interactions through coupled visual and numerical modalities.

Using electrostatic gate control, we load a single hole into any of the eight quantum dots. To demonstrate the potential of multilayer quantum dot systems, we show coherent spin control and hopping-induced spin rotations by shuttling between the quantum wells.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anna Vershynina</p>
            <p>For the sandwiched Rényi entropy the conditional entropy can be defined two ways: $\widetilde{H}^\downarrow_\alpha(A|B)_\rho, \widetilde{H}^\uparrow_\alpha(A|B)_\rho$. In the limiting case, $\alpha=1$, both definitions consolidate into conditional entropy $H(A|B)=S(AB)-S(B)$. The continuity inequality for conditional entropy $H(A|B)$, called the Alicki-Fannes-Winter (AWF) inequality, shows that if the states are close in trace-distance, then the conditional entropies are also close. Having the AWF inequality for conditional entropy, we show that the channel entropy defined through the relative entropy is continuous with respect to the diamond-distance between channels. Inspired by this, similar continuity inequalities for the Rényi conditional entropy $\widetilde{H}^\uparrow_\alpha$ were obtained in the work [A. Marwah and F. Dupuis, J. Math. Phys. 63, 052201 (2022)]. We provide continuity bounds for the sandwiched Rényi and Tsallis conditional entropies $\widetilde{H}^\downarrow_\alpha(A|B)_\rho, \widetilde{T}^\downarrow_\alpha(A|B)_\rho$ for states with the same marginal on the conditioning system. Similar to the previous bounds, our bound depends only on the dimension of the conditioning system. We apply this result to prove continuity of the channel entropy for Rényi and Tsallis channel entropies defined through the sandwiched Rényi and Tsallis relative entropies.</p>

            <p>The problem of a mobile hole doped into an antiferromagnet Mott insulator is believed to underly the rich physics of several paradigmatic strongly correlated electron systems, ranging from heavy fermions to high-Tc superconductivity. Arguably the simplest incarnation of this problem corresponds to a doped Ising antiferromagnet, a problem widely considered essentially solved since almost 60 years by a popular yet approximate mapping to a single-particle problem on the Bethe lattice. Here we show that, despite its deceptive simplicity, the local spectrum of a single hole in a classical Ising-Néel state contains a series of anomalous, long-lived states that go beyond the well-known ladder-like spectrum with excited energies spaced as $J^{2/3} t^{1/3}$. The anomalous states we find through exact diagonalization and within the self-avoiding path approximation have excitation energies scaling approximately linear with $J$ and lead to a series of avoided crossings with the more pronounced ladder spectrum. By also computing different local, rotational spectra we explain the origin of the anomalous states as rooted in an approximate emergent local $C_3$ symmetry of the problem. From their direct spectral signatures we further conclude that these states lead to anomalously slow thermalization behavior -- hence representing a new type of quantum many-body scar state, potentially related to many-body scars predicted in lattice gauge theories.</p>

            <h2>On-chip high-order parametric downconversion in the excitonic Mott insulator Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ for programmable multiphoton entangled states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dmitry Skachkov, Dirk R. Englund, Michael N. Leuenberger</p>
            <p>Spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) and four-wave mixing in $\chi^{(2)}$ and $\chi^{(3)}$ media underpin most entangled-photon sources, but direct generation of higher-order entangled multiphoton states by $n$-th order parametric downconversion remains extremely challenging because conventional materials exhibit tiny high-order nonlinearities. Here we show that single-layer Nb$_3$Cl$_8$, an excitonic Mott insulator on a breathing Kagome lattice, supports exceptionally large nonlinear susceptibilities up to seventh order. Many-body GW--Bethe--Salpeter and time-dependent BSE / Kadanoff--Baym simulations yield resonant $\chi^{(2)}$--$\chi^{(7)}$ for monolayer Nb$_3$Cl$_8$, with $|\chi^{(4)}|$ and $|\chi^{(5)}|$ surpassing values in prototypical transition metal dichalcogenides by 5--9 orders of magnitude. We trace this enhancement to flat bands and strongly bound Frenkel excitons with ferroelectrically aligned out-of-plane dipoles. Building on experimentally demonstrated 1$\times N$ integrated beam splitters with arbitrary power ratios, we propose an on-chip architecture where each output arm hosts an Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ patch, optionally gated by graphene to tune the complex $n$-photon amplitudes. Using the ab-initio $\chi^{(3)}$ and $\chi^{(4)}$ values, we predict that three-photon GHZ$_3$ and four-photon cluster-state sources in this platform can achieve $n$-photon generation rates up to $\sim 10^8$ and $\sim 10^6$ times larger, respectively, than silica-fiber- and MoS$_2$-based implementations with comparable geometry. We derive the quantum Hamiltonian and explicit $n$-photon generation rates for this platform, and show how suitable interferometric networks enable electrically and spectrally tunable GHZ, $W$, and cluster states based on genuine high-order nonlinear processes in a 2D excitonic Mott insulator.</p>

            <p>We present a technique based on an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond capable of imaging magnetic fields with high spatio-temporal resolution. A focused laser beam is raster-scanned using an acousto-optic deflector (AOD) and NV center fluorescence is read out with a single photodetector, enabling low-noise detection with high dynamic range. The method operates in a previously unexplored regime, quasi-continuous wave optically detected magnetic resonance (qCW-ODMR). In this regime, NV centers experience short optical pump pulses for spin readout and repolarization, analogous to pulsed ODMR technique, while the microwave field remains continuously on resonance with the spin transitions. We systematically characterize this regime and show that the spin response is governed by a tunable interplay between coherent evolution and relaxation, determined by the temporal spacing between pump laser pulses. Notably, the technique does not require precise microwave pulse control, thus simplifying experimental implementation. To demonstrate its capabilities, we image time-varying magnetic fields from a microelectrode in a conductive medium with sub-millisecond temporal resolution. This approach enables flexible spatial sampling and with our diamond achieves nT$\cdot$Hz$^{-1/2}$ per pixel sensitivity, making it well suited for detecting weak, dynamic magnetic fields in biological and other complex systems.</p>

            <h2>Stochastic approximate state conversion for entanglement and general quantum resource theories</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tulja Varun Kondra, Chandan Datta, Alexander Streltsov</p>
            <p>Quantum resource theories provide a mathematically rigorous way of understanding the nature of various quantum resources. An important problem in any quantum resource theory is to determine how quantum states can be converted into each other within the physical constraints of the theory. The standard approach to this problem is to study approximate or probabilistic transformations. Here, we investigate the intermediate regime, providing limits on both, the fidelity and the probability of state transformations. We derive limitations on the transformations, which are valid in all quantum resource theories, by providing bounds on the maximal transformation fidelity for a given transformation probability. As an application, we show that these bounds imply an upper bound on the asymptotic rates for various classes of states under probabilistic transformations. We also show that the deterministic version of the single copy bounds can be applied for drawing limitations on the manipulation of quantum channels, which goes beyond the previously known bounds of channel manipulations. Furthermore, we completely solve the question of stochastic-approximate state conversion via local operations and classical communication in the following two cases: (i) Both initial and target states are pure bipartite entangled states of arbitrary dimensions. (ii) The target state is a two-qubit entangled state and the initial state is a pure bipartite state.</p>

            <h2>A Mathematical Framework for Transformations of Physical Processes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matt Wilson, Giulio Chiribella</p>
            <p>We observe that the existence of sequential and parallel composition supermaps in higher order theories of transformations can be formalised using enriched category theory. Encouraged by relevant examples such as unitary supermaps and layers within higher order causal categories (HOCCs), we treat the modelling of higher order physical theories with enriched monoidal categories in analogy with the modelling of physical theories with monoidal categories. We use the enriched monoidal setting to construct a suitable definition of structure preserving map between higher order physical theories via the Grothendieck construction. We then show that the convenient feature of currying in higher order physical theories can be seen as a consequence of combining the primitive assumption of the existence of parallel and sequential composition supermaps with an additional feature of linking. We then use our definition of structure preserving map to show that categories containing infinite towers of enriched monoidal categories with full and faithful structure preserving maps between them inevitably lead to closed monoidal structures. The aim of the proposed definitions is to step towards providing a broad framework for the study and comparison of novel causal structures in quantum theory, and, more broadly, a paradigm of physical theory where static and dynamical features are treated in a unified way.</p>

            <h2>Trade-offs between Entanglement and Communication</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Srinivasan Arunachalam, Uma Girish</p>
            <p>We study the advantages of quantum communication models over classical communication models that are equipped with a limited number of qubits of entanglement. In this direction, we give explicit partial functions on $n$ bits for which reducing the entanglement increases the classical communication complexity exponentially. Our separations are as follows. For every $k\ge 1$: $Q\|^*$ versus $R2^*$: We show that quantum simultaneous protocols with $\tilde{\Theta}(k^5 \log^3 n)$ qubits of entanglement can exponentially outperform two-way randomized protocols with $O(k)$ qubits of entanglement. This resolves an open problem from [Gav08] and improves the state-of-the-art separations between quantum simultaneous protocols with entanglement and two-way randomized protocols without entanglement [Gav19, GRT22]. $R\|^*$ versus $Q\|^*$: We show that classical simultaneous protocols with $\tilde{\Theta}(k \log n)$ qubits of entanglement can exponentially outperform quantum simultaneous protocols with $O(k)$ qubits of entanglement, resolving an open question from [GKRW06, Gav19]. The best result prior to our work was a relational separation against protocols without entanglement [GKRW06]. $R\|^*$ versus $R1^*$: We show that classical simultaneous protocols with $\tilde{\Theta}(k\log n)$ qubits of entanglement can exponentially outperform randomized one-way protocols with $O(k)$ qubits of entanglement. Prior to our work, only a relational separation was known [Gav08]. Our techniques can also be used to show advantages of quantum communication models over hybrid classical-quantum models, i.e., models that have a large amount of both classical communication and quantum simultaneous communication.</p>

            <h2>Expanding bipartite Bell inequalities for maximum multi-partite randomness</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lewis Wooltorton, Peter Brown, Roger Colbeck</p>
            <p>Nonlocal tests on multi-partite quantum correlations form the basis of protocols that certify randomness in a device-independent (DI) way. Such correlations admit a rich structure, making the task of choosing an appropriate test difficult. For example, extremal Bell inequalities are tight witnesses of nonlocality, but achieving their maximum violation places constraints on the underlying quantum system, which can reduce the rate of randomness generation. As a result there is often a trade-off between maximum randomness and the amount of violation of a given Bell inequality. Here, we explore this trade-off for more than two parties. More precisely, we study the maximum amount of randomness that can be certified by correlations with a particular violation of the Mermin-Ardehali-Belinskii-Klyshko (MABK) inequality. For any even number of parties, we find that maximum randomness cannot occur beyond a threshold quantum violation, which increases with the number of parties, and we give a conjectured form of the maximum randomness in terms of the MABK value. We also show that maximum randomness can be obtained for any MABK violation for odd numbers of parties. To obtain our results, we derive new families of Bell inequalities certifying maximum randomness from a technique for randomness certification, which we call "expanding Bell inequalities". Our technique allows a bipartite Bell expression to be used as a seed, and transformed into a multi-partite Bell inequality tailored for randomness certification, showing how intuition learned in the bipartite case can find use in more complex scenarios.</p>

            <h2>Time-Efficient Quantum Entropy Estimator via Samplizer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qisheng Wang, Zhicheng Zhang</p>
            <p>Entropy is a measure of the randomness of a system. Estimating the entropy of a quantum state is a basic problem in quantum information. In this paper, we introduce a time-efficient quantum approach to estimating the von Neumann entropy $S(\rho)$ and Rényi entropy $S_\alpha(\rho)$ of an $N$-dimensional quantum state $\rho$, given access to independent samples of $\rho$. Specifically, we provide the following: 1. A quantum estimator for $S(\rho)$ with time complexity $\tilde O(N^2)$, improving the prior best time complexity $\tilde O(N^6)$ by Acharya, Issa, Shende, and Wagner (2020) and Bavarian, Mehraba, and Wright (2016). 2. A quantum estimator for $S_\alpha(\rho)$ with time complexity $\tilde O(N^{4/\alpha-2})$ for $0<\alpha<1$ and $\tilde O(N^{4-2/\alpha})$ for $\alpha>1$, improving the prior best time complexity $\tilde O(N^{6/\alpha})$ for $0<\alpha<1$ and $\tilde O(N^6)$ for $\alpha>1$ by Acharya, Issa, Shende, and Wagner (2020), though at a cost of a slightly larger sample complexity. Moreover, these estimators are naturally extensible to the low-rank case. We also provide a sample lower bound for estimating $S_\alpha(\rho)$. Technically, our method is quite different from the previous ones that are based on weak Schur sampling and Young diagrams. At the heart of our construction, is a novel tool called samplizer, which can "samplize" a quantum query algorithm to a quantum algorithm with similar behavior using only samples of quantum states; this suggests a unified framework for estimating quantum entropies. Specifically, when a quantum oracle $U$ block-encodes a mixed quantum state $\rho$, any quantum query algorithm using $Q$ queries to $U$ can be samplized to a $\delta$-close (in the diamond norm) quantum algorithm using $\tilde\Theta(Q^2/\delta)$ samples of $\rho$. Moreover, this samplization is proven to be optimal, up to a polylogarithmic factor.</p>

            <h2>Complexity of geometrically local stoquastic Hamiltonians</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Asad Raza, Jens Eisert, Alex B. Grilo</p>
            <p>The QMA-completeness of the local Hamiltonian problem is a landmark result of the field of Hamiltonian complexity that studies the computational complexity of problems in quantum many-body physics. Since its proposal, substantial effort has been invested in better understanding the problem for physically motivated important families of Hamiltonians. In particular, the QMA-completeness of approximating the ground state energy of local Hamiltonians has been extended to the case where the Hamiltonians are geometrically local in one and two spatial dimensions. Among those physically motivated Hamiltonians, stoquastic Hamiltonians play a particularly crucial role, as they constitute the manifestly sign-free Hamiltonians in Monte Carlo approaches. Interestingly, for such Hamiltonians, the problem at hand becomes more ''classical'', being hard for the class MA (the randomized version of NP) and its complexity has tight connections with derandomization. In this work, we prove that both the two- and one-dimensional geometrically local analogues remain MA-hard with high enough qudit dimension. Moreover, we show that related problems are StoqMA-complete.</p>

            <p>We propose a precise test of two fundamental gravitational constants using a detector concept that exploits the dynamics of quantum phononic excitations in a trapped Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), operable at the scale of tabletop experiments. In this setup, the sensitivity is enhanced by approximately 2 orders of magnitude through the use of a tritter operation, which mixes phononic excitations with the BEC's ground state. The BEC exhibits unique sensitivity to the two key components of the gravitational potential in $\Lambda$-gravity: the Newtonian $GM/r$ term and the cosmological constant $\Lambda r^2$, both entering the most general function following from a Gurzadyan's theorem. Using state-of-the-art experimental design, we predict that the gravitational constant $G$ could be measured with an accuracy up to $10^{-17}$ N m$^2$/kg$^2$, representing an improvement by 2 orders of magnitude over current measurements. Moreover, this experiment aims to establish the best Earth-based upper limit on $\Lambda$ at $<10^{-31}$ m$^{-2}$, marking the first laboratory-based probe of the cosmological constant. Additionally, the setup allows for the measurement of the distance-dependent behavior of each term in the gravitational potential, providing a means to test modified gravity theories.</p>

            <h2>Stabilizing Non-Abelian Topological Order against Heralded Noise via Local Lindbladian Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sanket Chirame, Abhinav Prem, Sarang Gopalakrishnan, Fiona J. Burnell</p>
            <p>An important open question for the current generation of highly controllable quantum devices is understanding which phases can be realized as stable steady-states under local quantum dynamics. In this work, we show how robust steady-state phases with both Abelian and non-Abelian mixed-state topological order can be stabilized, in two spatial dimensions (2d), against generic ``heralded" noise using active dynamics that incorporate measurement and feedback, modeled as a \emph{fully local} Lindblad master equation. These topologically ordered steady states are two-way connected to pure topologically ordered ground states using local quantum channels, and preserve quantum information for a time that is exponentially large in the system size. Specifically, we present explicit constructions of families of local Lindbladians for both Abelian ($\mathbb{Z}_2$) and non-Abelian ($D_4$) topological order whose steady-states host mixed-state topological order when the noise is below a threshold strength. As the noise strength is increased, these models exhibit first-order transitions to intermediate mixed state phases where they encode robust classical memories, followed by (first-order) transitions to a trivial steady state at high noise rates. When the noise is imperfectly heralded, steady-state order disappears but our active dynamics significantly enhances the lifetime of the encoded logical information. To carry out the numerical simulations for the non-Abelian $D_4$ case, we introduce a generalized stabilizer tableau formalism that permits efficient simulation of the non-Abelian Lindbladian dynamics.</p>

We demonstrate that, under some commonly satisfied technical conditions, an appropriate generalization can achieve super-quadratic speedups not only over unstructured search but also over a classical optimization algorithm that searches for the optimum by drawing samples from the stationary distribution of a Markov chain. We employ this framework to obtain algorithms for problems including variants of Max Bisection, Max Independent Set, and finding the ground states of the Antiferromagnetic Ising Model and the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Model, whose runtimes are asymptotically faster than those obtainable with previous short path techniques. In certain cases, our algorithms achieve super-quadratic speedups compared to the best known classical algorithms with rigorously established runtimes.</p>

            <p>The simultaneous estimation of multiple unknown parameters is the most general scenario in quantum sensing. Quantum multi-parameter estimation theory provides fundamental bounds on the achievable precision of simultaneous estimation. However, these bounds can become singular (no finite bound exists) in multi-parameter sensing due to parameter interdependencies, limited probe accessibility, and insufficient measurement outcomes. Here, we address the singularity issue in quantum sensing through a simple mechanism based on a sequential measurement strategy. This sensing scheme overcomes the singularity constraint and enables the simultaneous estimation of multiple parameters with a local and fixed measurement throughout the sensing protocol. This is because sequential measurements, involving consecutive steps of local measurements followed by probe evolution, inherently produce correlated measurement data that grows exponentially with the number of sequential measurements. Finally, through two different examples, namely a strongly correlated probe and a light-matter system, we demonstrate how such singularities are reflected when inferring the unknown parameters through Bayesian estimation.</p>

            <p>Quantum oracles are widely adopted in problems, like query oracle in Grover's algorithm, cipher in quantum cryptanalytic and data encoder in quantum machine learning. Notably, the bit-flip oracle, capable of flipping the state based on a given classical function, emerges as a fundamental component in the design and construction of quantum algorithms. Devising methods to optimally implement the bit-flip oracle essentially translates to the efficient synthesis of reversible functions. Prior research has primarily focused on the qubit model, leaving the higher dimensional systems, i.e. qudit model, largely unexplored. By allowing more than two computational bases, qudit model can fully utilize the multi-level nature of the underlying physical mechanism. We propose a method to synthesize even permutations in $A_{d^{n}}$ using $\Theta(d)$ $(n - 1)$-qudit sub-circuits, which achieve asymptotic optimality in the count of sub-circuits. Moreover, we introduce a technique for synthesizing reversible functions employing $O\left( n d^{n} \right)$ gates and only a single ancilla. This is asymptotically tight in terms of $d$ and asymptotically almost tight in terms of $n$.</p>

First, we show that encircling the EP of one enantiomer drives robust topological population transfer in the chiral molecule while its mirror twin remains unaffected, offering a new route for selective chiral control. Second, we reveal how resonant excitation of EPs in chiral molecules can amplify weak chiral effects, offering an alternative approach to the enhancement of chiral interactions. Third, we demonstrate that a twisted chiral fiber immersed in a liquid solution of chiral molecules exhibits topologically different behavior depending on the solution's enantiomeric excess, offering a new approach to the detection of molecular chirality. Our results combine high enantiosensitivity with topological robustness in chiral discrimination and control, paving the way for new approaches in the exploration of non-Hermitian and chiral phenomena.</p>

            <p>A unitary evolution in time may be treated as a curve in the manifold of the special unitary group. The length of such a curve can be related to the energetic cost of the associated computation, meaning a geodesic curve identifies an energetically optimal path. In this work, we employ sub-Riemannian geometry on the manifold of the unitary group to obtain optimally designed Hamiltonians for generating single-qubit gates in an environment with the presence of dephasing noise as well as a two-qubit gate under a time-constant crosstalk interaction. The resulting geodesic equation involves knowing the initial conditions of the parameters that cannot be obtained analytically. We then introduce a random sampling method combined with a minimization function and a cost function to find initial conditions that lead to optimal control fields. We also compare the optimized control fields obtained from the solutions of the geodesic equation with those extracted from the well-known Krotov method. Both approaches provide high fidelity values for the desired quantum gate implementation, but the geodesic method has the advantage of minimizing the required energy to execute the same task. These findings bring new insights for the design of more efficient fields in the arsenal of optimal control theory.</p>

            <p>Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) is a cardinal algorithm in quantum computing that plays a crucial role in various applications, including cryptography, molecular simulation, and solving systems of linear equations. However, the standard implementation of QPE faces challenges related to time complexity and circuit depth, which limit its practicality for large-scale computations. We introduce LuGo, a novel framework designed to enhance the performance of QPE by reducing circuit duplication, as well as using parallelization techniques to achieve faster generation of the QPE circuit and gate reduction. We validate the effectiveness of our framework by generating quantum linear solver circuits, which require both QPE and inverse QPE, to solve linear systems of equations. LuGo achieves significant improvements in both computational efficiency and hardware requirements without compromising on accuracy. Compared to a standard QPE implementation, LuGo reduces time consumption to generate a circuit that solves a $2^6\times 2^6$ system matrix by a factor of $50.68$ and over $31\times$ reduction of quantum gates and circuit depth, with no fidelity loss on an ideal quantum simulator. We demonstrated the versatility and scalability of LuGo enabled HHL algorithm by simulating a canonical Hele-Shaw fluid problem using a quantum simulator. With these advantages, LuGo paves the way for more efficient implementations of QPE, enabling broader applications across several quantum computing domains.</p>

The connection between these two frameworks is still unexplored, but if clarified it will lead to a more profound understanding of symmetries in quantum mechanics and quantum gravity. Here, we establish a correspondence between quantum reference frame transformations and transformations generated by a quantum deformation of the Galilei group with commutative time, taken at first order in the quantum deformation parameter. This is found once the quantum group noncommutative transformation parameters are represented on the phase space of a quantum particle, and upon setting the quantum deformation parameter to be proportional to the inverse of the mass of the particle serving as the quantum reference frame. These results allow us to show that quantum reference frame transformations are physically relevant when the state of the quantum reference frame is in a quantum superposition of semiclassical states. We conjecture that the all-order quantum Galilei group describes quantum reference frame transformations between more general quantum states of the quantum reference frame.</p>

            <h2>Critical Scaling of the Quantum Wasserstein Distance</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gonzalo Camacho, Benedikt Fauseweh</p>
            <p>Distinguishing quantum states with minimal sampling overhead is of fundamental importance to teach quantum data to an algorithm. Recently, the quantum Wasserstein distance emerged from the theory of quantum optimal transport as a promising tool in this context. Here we show on general grounds that the quantum Wasserstein distance between two ground states of a quantum critical system exhibits critical scaling. We demonstrate this explicitly using known closed analytical expressions for the magnetic correlations in the transverse field Ising model, to numerically extract the critical exponents for the distance close to the quantum critical point, confirming our analytical derivation. Our results have implications for learning of ground states of quantum critical phases of matter.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Doru Sticlet, Balázs Dóra, Dominik Szombathy, Gergely Zaránd, Cătălin Paşcu Moca</p>
            <p>Magic, or nonstabilizerness, is a crucial quantum resource, yet its dynamics in open quantum systems remain largely unexplored. We investigate magic in the open XXZ spin chain under either boundary gain and loss, or bulk dephasing using the stabilizer Rényi entropy $M_2$. To enable scalable simulations of large systems, we develop a novel, highly efficient algorithm for computing $M_2$ within the matrix product states formalism while maintaining constant bond dimension--an advancement over existing methods. For boundary driving, we uncover universal scaling laws, $M_2(t) \sim t^{1/z}$, linked to the dynamical exponent $z$ for several distinct universality classes. We also disentangle classical and quantum contributions to magic by introducing a mean-field approximation for magic, thus emphasizing the prominent role of quantum critical fluctuations in nonstabilizerness. For bulk dephasing, dissipation can transiently enhance magic before suppressing it, and drive it to a nontrivial steady-state value. These findings position magic as a powerful diagnostic tool for probing universality and dynamics in open quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>Macroscopicity and observational deficit in states, operations, and correlations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Teruaki Nagasawa, Eyuri Wakakuwa, Kohtaro Kato, Francesco Buscemi</p>
            <p>To understand the emergence of macroscopic irreversibility from microscopic reversible dynamics, the idea of coarse-graining plays a fundamental role. In this work, we develop a unified inferential framework for macroscopic states, that is, coarse descriptions of microscopic quantum systems that can be inferred from macroscopic measurements. Building on quantum statistical sufficiency and Bayesian retrodiction, we characterize macroscopic states through equivalent abstract (algebraic) and explicit (constructive) formulations. Central to our approach is the notion of observational deficit, which quantifies the degree of irretrodictability of a state relative to a prior and a measurement. This leads to a general definition of macroscopic entropy as an inferentially grounded measure of asymmetry under Bayesian inversion. We formalize this structure in terms of inferential reference frames, defined by the pair consisting of a prior and a measurement, which encapsulate the observer's informational perspective. We then formulate a resource theory of microscopicity, treating macroscopic states as free states and introducing a hierarchy of microscopicity-non-generating operations. This theory unifies and extends existing resource theories of coherence, athermality, and asymmetry. Finally, we apply the framework to study quantum correlations under observational constraints, introducing the notion of observational discord and deriving necessary and sufficient conditions for their vanishing in terms of information recoverability. This work is dedicated to Professor Ryszard Horodecki on the occasion of his 80th birthday, in deep admiration and gratitude for his pioneering contributions to quantum information theory.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuta Uenaga, Kensuke Gallock-Yoshimura, Takano Taira</p>
            <p>Memory effects in a quantum system coupled to an environment are one of the central features in the theory of open quantum systems. The dynamics of such quantum systems are typically governed by an equation of motion with a time-convolution integral of the memory kernel. However, solving such integro-differential equations is challenging, especially when the memory kernel is nonstationary (not time-translation invariant). In this paper, we analytically and nonperturbatively solve such integro-differential equations with a nonstationary memory kernel by employing a train of Dirac-delta switchings. We then apply this method to the damped Jaynes-Cummings model and the damped harmonic oscillator model to demonstrate that (i) our solution asymptotes to the well-known exact solution in the continuum limit, and that (ii) our method also enables us to visualize the memory effect in the environment.</p>

            <h2>Quantum sequel of neural network training</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hao Zhang, Alex Kamenev</p>
            <p>Training of neural networks (NNs) has emerged as a major consumer of both computational and energy resources. Quantum computers were coined as a root to facilitate training, but no experimental evidence has been presented so far. Here we demonstrate that quantum annealing platforms, such as D-Wave, can enable fast and efficient training of classical NNs, which are then deployable on conventional hardware. From a physics perspective, NN training can be viewed as a dynamical phase transition: the system evolves from an initial spin glass state to a highly ordered, trained state. This process involves eliminating numerous undesired minima in its energy landscape. The advantage of annealing devices is their ability to rapidly find multiple deep states. We found that this quantum training achieves superior performance scaling compared to classical backpropagation methods, with a clearly higher scaling exponent (1.01 vs. 0.78). It may be further increased up to a factor of 2 with a fully coherent quantum platform using a variant of the Grover algorithm. Furthermore, we argue that even a modestly sized annealer can be beneficial to train a deep NN by being applied sequentially to a few layers at a time.</p>

            <h2>Local Rydberg blockade regimes for disk graph embedding and quantum optimization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elie Bermot, Lucia Valor, Wesley Coelho, Louis-Paul Henry, Natalie Pearson</p>
            <p>Rydberg atom arrays are a powerful platform for solving combinatorial optimization problems, owing to the Rydberg blockade mechanism, which imposes effective constraints on simultaneous atomic excitations. These constraints have enabled the encoding of the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem on unit disk graphs, where atoms interact within a fixed, globally defined blockade radius. However, this restriction limits the class of addressable problems. A natural extension is to consider disk graphs, which generalize unit disk graphs by allowing arbitrary disk radii and correspond to the intersection graphs of disks in the plane. Embedding such graphs in Rydberg systems requires moving beyond the standard, globally uniform blockade model. In this work, we introduce a local Rydberg blockade regime, which emerges when local drives are applied to different pairs of atoms involved in a potential interaction. We develop a general theoretical framework for this regime and propose two novel metrics, the correlation matrix and the maximum independence violation, to quantify the quality of the embedding. Using these metrics, we demonstrate that disk graphs can be meaningfully embedded into Rydberg atom arrays under local drive schemes, thereby expanding the landscape of quantum-addressable optimization problems. Finally, when evaluating approximate solutions of the MIS problem, characterized by near-optimal independent sets, local drive approaches exhibit significantly improved performance over global ones. These results highlight the practical advantage of local blockade engineering for approximate combinatorial optimization and open a path toward leveraging the analog capabilities of Rydberg platforms beyond conventional geometric constraints.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eyuri Wakakuwa</p>
            <p>Understanding physical phenomena at the intersection of quantum mechanics and general relativity remains a major challenge in modern physics. While various experimental approaches have been proposed to probe quantum systems in curved spacetime, most focus on the Newtonian regime, leaving post-Newtonian effects such as frame dragging largely unexplored. In this study, we propose and theoretically analyze an experimental scheme to investigate how post-Newtonian gravity affects quantum systems. We consider two setups: (i) a quantum clock interferometry setup designed to detect the gravitational field of a rotating mass, and (ii) a scheme exploring whether such effects could be used to generate gravity-induced entanglement. Due to the symmetry of the configuration, the proposed setup is insensitive to Newtonian gravitational contributions but remains sensitive to the frame-dragging effect. Furthermore, our scheme allows for testing whether the observed gravity-induced entanglement is consistent with the quantum equivalence principle. While the predicted effects appear too small to detect with current technology, our scheme offers a starting point for future experiments probing post-Newtonian quantum gravitational effects.</p>

            <p>Here we investigate analogy between quantum signal processing (QSP) and the adiabatic-impulse model (AIM) in order to implement the QSP algorithm with fast quantum logic gates. QSP is an algorithm that uses single-qubit dynamics to perform a polynomial function transformation. AIM effectively describes the evolution of a two-level quantum system under strong external driving field. We can map parameters from QSP to AIM to implement QSP-like evolution with nonadiabatic, high-amplitude external drives. By choosing AIM parameters that control non-adiabatic transition parameters (such as driving amplitude $A$, frequency $\omega$, and signal timing), one can achieve polynomial approximations and increase robustness in quantum circuits. The analogy presented here between QSP and AIM can be useful as a way to directly implement the QSP algorithm on quantum systems and obtain all the benefits from the fast Landau-Zener-Stuckelberg-Majotana (LZSM) quantum logic gates.</p>

            <p>We show how one can asymptotically reach the Heisenberg limit in quantum Hamiltonian learning without entanglement, globally coherent measurements, or dynamical control, using only local quantum operations. Our protocol uses ensemble-averaging over the outcomes of experiments initialized in Haar-random local product states, accompanied by random Pauli measurements, leading to the effective cancellation of interference terms so that a Heisenberg-limited regime emerges for short-time experiments. Furthermore, we show that the act of ensemble averaging makes unbiased estimation data, meaning all Hamiltonian parameters can be simultaneously estimated from the same data-set, removing the need for parameter isolation. We supplement the theoretical results by showing empirically that, even away from the asymptotic limit, one can surpass the SQL using randomly spread product-state ensembles. We do so numerically by learning a selection of different disordered multi-qubit Hamiltonians in a black-box learning scenario.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> H. Solki, Ali Motazedifard, M. H. Naderi, A. Youssefi, R. Roknizadeh</p>
            <p>We propose an experimentally feasible optomechanical system (OMS) that is dispersively driven and operates in the reversed dissipation regime (RDR), where the mechanical damping rate far exceeds the cavity decay rate. We demonstrate that coherent, fast-time modulation of the driving laser frequency on time scales longer than the mechanical decoherence time allows for adiabatic elimination of the mechanical mode, resulting in strong parametric amplification of quantum vacuum fluctuations of the intracavity field. This mechanism, known as the parametric dynamical Casimir effect (parametric-DCE), leads to the generation of Casimir photons. In the dispersive RDR, we find that the total system Hamiltonian-including the DCE term-is intrinsically modified by a generalized optomechanical Kerr-type nonlinearity. This nonlinearity not only saturates the mean number of radiated Casimir photons on short time scales, even without dissipation, but also induces oscillatory behavior in their dynamics and quantum characteristics. Remarkably, the presence of the Kerr nonlinearity causes the generated DCE photons to exhibit nonclassical features, including simultaneous sub-Poissonian statistics and negative Wigner function, as well as quadrature squeezing, which can be controlled by adjusting the system parameters. Surprisingly, the controllable simultaneous nonclassical dynamics in the same physical parameter regime, which is induced by the optomechanical Kerr nonlinearity to the parametric DCE cannot occur in the standard DCE or Kerr-type systems. The proposed nonclassical microwave radiation source possesses the potential to be applied in quantum information processing, quantum computing as well as microwave quantum sensing.</p>

Our approach reveals how this group-theoretic structure naturally emerges from physical constraints, particularly the preservation of purity and reversibility in quantum processes. Beyond its theoretical relevance, the construction offers a pedagogically accessible framework for introducing core ideas in quantum mechanics and symmetry groups, making the abstract correspondence between $SU(2)$ and $SO(3)$ tangible through experimentally meaningful procedures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alejandro Frank</p>
            <p>Microscopic quantum laws are time-symmetric: nothing in the Schrödinger equation or its relativistic extensions distinguishes future from past. Yet measurements produce irreversible records, an apparently one-way causal flow, and the familiar notion that causes precede effects. Within the Quantum Time-Symmetric Interpretation (QTSI), this asymmetry is not fundamental but emergent. Isolated quantum systems are described by a two-component temporal state containing forward- and backward-propagating amplitudes. Their mixing, governed by a parameter $\Delta(\phi)$, defines a retrocausal coherence time $\tau_{RC}(\phi)$ beyond which advanced components are suppressed. As the system couples to amplifying environments characterized by a macroscopic parameter $\phi$, $\Delta(\phi)$ decreases and the backward component is dynamically eliminated, giving rise to classical causality and effective collapse. QTSI aligns naturally with time-symmetric approaches from Wheeler--Feynman, Aharonov, and Price, agrees with all weak-measurement and quantum eraser results in their operational regimes, and predicts specific signatures in temporal echoes and chaotic cavities. Detailed formal and experimental developments appear in the Supplementary Addenda.</p>

            <p>Gaussian building blocks are essential for photonic quantum information processing, and universality can be practically achieved by equipping Gaussian circuits with adaptive measurement and feedforward. The number of adaptive steps then provides a natural parameter for computational power. Rather than assessing power only through sampling problems -- the usual benchmark -- we follow the ongoing shift toward tasks of practical relevance and study the quantum mean-value problem, i.e., estimating observable expectation values that underpin simulation and variational algorithms. More specifically, we analyze bosonic circuits with adaptivity and prove that when the number of adaptive measurements is small, the mean-value problem admits efficient classical algorithms even if a large amount of non-Gaussian resources are present in the input state, whereas less constrained regimes are computationally hard. This yields a task-level contrast with sampling, where non-Gaussian ingredients alone often induce hardness, and provides a clean complexity boundary parameterized by the number of adaptive measurement-and-feedforward steps between classical simulability and quantum advantage. Beyond the main result, we introduce classical techniques -- including a generalization of Gurvits' second algorithm to arbitrary product inputs and Gaussian circuits -- for computing the marginal quantities needed by our estimators, which may be of independent interest.</p>

            <p>Entangled quantum states are regarded as a key resource in quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols. However, quantum correlations, other than entanglement can also play a significant role the QKD protocols. In this work, we will focus on one such measure of quantum correlation, known as geometric quantum discord (GQD). Firstly, we derive an analytical expression of GQD for two-qutrit quantum systems and further generalize it for $d_1\otimes d_2$ dimensional systems. Next, we apply the concept of GQD in studying QKD. In particular, we derive the lower bound for a distillable secret key rate $K_D$ in terms of GQD when two communicating parties uses private states for generating a secret key in the presence of an eavesdropper. The lower bound of $K_D$ depends upon the GQD of $\frac{\sigma_0+\sigma_1}{2}$ and $\frac{\sigma_2+\sigma_3}{2}$, where $\sigma_i$'s, $i=0,1,2,3$ are the density matrices. We find that for a certain range of GQD, the successful generation of the secret key is not guaranteed. We further study the behavior of distillable key rate when the geometric discord of $\frac{\sigma_0+\sigma_1}{2}$ and $\frac{\sigma_2+\sigma_3}{2}$ increases, decreases or remains constant, with the help of a few examples. Moreover, we find that even when $\sigma_i$'s are separable or positive partial transpose entangled states, the distillable key can still be generated.</p>

            <p>This paper provides a framework for characterizing sequential scenarios, allowing for the identification of contextuality given empirical data, and then provides precise operational interpretations in terms of the possible hidden variable model explanations. Sequential scenarios are different in essence from non-local scenarios as each instrument is allowed to change the state as it enters subsequent instruments. Thus, it is necessary to formulate the possible state update in any hidden variable model description. Here we develop such hidden variable models for sequential scenarios, and we develop on the notion of no-disturbance: an instrument $A$ does not disturb another instrument $B$ if the statistics of $B$ are independent of whether $A$ was measured or not. We define non-contextuality inequalities for the sequential scenario, and show that violation implies that the data cannot be explained by a hidden variable model that is both deterministic and not disturbing in this sense. We further provide a translation from standard contextuality frameworks to ours, providing sequential versions which carry over the same inequalities and measures of contextuality, but now with the sequential interpretations stated.</p>

            <p>Classification of medical images plays a vital role in medical image analysis; however, it remains challenging due to the limited availability of labeled data, class imbalances, and the complexity of medical patterns. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel Hybrid Quantum-Classical Neural Network (HQCNN) for both binary and multi-class classification. The architecture of HQCNN integrates a five-layer classical convolutional backbone with a 4-qubit variational quantum circuit that incorporates quantum state encoding, superpositional entanglement, and a Fourier-inspired quantum attention mechanism. We evaluate the model on six MedMNIST v2 benchmark datasets. The HQCNN consistently outperforms classical and quantum baselines, achieving up to 99.91% accuracy and 100.00% AUC on PathMNIST (binary) and 99.95% accuracy on OrganAMNIST (multi-class) with strong robustness on noisy datasets like BreastMNIST (87.18% accuracy). The model demonstrates superior generalization capability and computational efficiency, accomplished with significantly fewer trainable parameters, making it suitable for data-scarce scenarios. Our findings provide strong empirical evidence that hybrid quantum-classical models can advance medical imaging tasks.</p>

            <p>Magic resources and entanglement are fundamental components for achieving the universal quantum computation, so is the interplay between them. Herein, we uncover an intrinsic scaling law of the magic resource and bond dimension of matrix product states in Haar-random quantum circuits, that is, the magic resource is converged on a bond dimension in logarithmic scale with the system size. From a practical perspective, this finding substantially enhances the classical simulability of nonstabilizerness. It also allows us to utilize the bond dimension as a bridge to link the entanglement and the nonlocal magic resource, which extends the capacity perspective that the entanglement plays the role of container for the nonlocal magic resource. Furthermore, the intrinsic scaling enables an information separation between the nonlocal magic resource and the extra entanglement. This, in turn, leads to the conclusion that, any dynamical relation between magic and entanglement resources is ruled out. In other words, it is inappropriate to regard the entanglement as the driving force of the growth and spreading of nonlocal magic resource.</p>

Extending this result, we prove that any $n$-qubit quantum state can be prepared in two regimes: (1) with a constant number of Pauli rotations to constant precision, or (2) with a polynomial number of rotations to inverse-polynomial precision. Our results improve over previous approaches to quantum state preparation in terms of gate complexity, thereby yielding quantum space advantage. As an application, we identify a practical condition under which quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems can be solved with exponential quantum speedups.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maximilian Rüsch, Benjamin Rodatz, Aleks Kissinger</p>
            <p>Two circuits are considered to be equivalent under noise if the effect of faults on one circuit is no worse than the effect of faults on the other circuit. We call this relationship fault equivalence. Fault equivalence offers a way to transform circuits while provably preserving their fault-tolerant properties, enabling a framework for fault-tolerant circuit synthesis and optimisation that is correct by construction. The ZX calculus, a set of graphical rewrite rules for quantum computations, provides a useful tool for manipulating circuits while preserving fault equivalence. For this, the usual set of ZX rewrites has to be restricted to not only preserve the underlying linear map represented by the diagram but also fault equivalence. In this work, we provide a set of ZX rewrites that are sound and complete for fault equivalence of Clifford ZX diagrams. This means that any equivalence that can be derived using the proposed rules is certain to be correct, and any correct equivalence can be derived using only these rules. For this, we utilise diagrammatic constructions called fault gadgets to reason about arbitrary, possibly correlated Pauli faults in ZX diagrams. Fault gadgets allow us to separate the diagram into a fault-free part, which captures the noise-free behaviour of a diagram, and a noisy part that enumerates the effects of all possible faults. Using this, we provide a unique normal form for ZX diagrams under noise and show that any diagram can be brought into this normal form using our proposed rule set.</p>

A key challenge is the large bandwidth mismatch between QD photons and the narrow optical transitions of the memories. We combine a comprehensive model of the spin-photon interface, including full spin-photon coupling dynamics, and explore mitigation strategies such as frequency filtering and optimized magnetic-field orientation. Our results show that with optimized designs, photon-to-memory transfer can be achieved with high efficiency and fidelity, supporting the feasibility of such hybrid systems. Finally, we analyze a full repeater chain using experimentally achievable parameters and find that a network with thousands of memories across several repeater nodes could achieve a secret-key rate of 500 bit/s over 1,000 km, demonstrating the strong potential of this approach for next-generation quantum networks.</p>

            <h2>Information phases of partial projected ensembles generated from random quantum states and scrambling dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alan Sherry, Saptarshi Mandal, Sthitadhi Roy</p>
            <p>The projected ensemble -- an ensemble of pure states on a subsystem conditioned on projective measurement outcomes on its complement -- provides a finer probe of ergodicity and information structure than the reduced density matrix of the subsystem in bipartite quantum states. This framework can be generalised to partial projected ensembles in tripartite settings, where outcomes from part of the measured subsystem are discarded, leading to ensembles of mixed states. We show that information measures defined for such ensembles, in particular the Holevo information, yield a more detailed characterisation of how quantum information is distributed between subsystems compared to conventional entanglement measures. Using exact analytical results supported by numerical results, we uncover a qualitative change in the scaling of the Holevo information with system size in partial projected ensembles generated by Haar-random states, as the relative sizes of the subsystem are varied. In one phase, the Holevo information decays exponentially with system size, while in the other it grows linearly, thereby defining distinct information phases separated by sharp transitions signalled by non-analyticities in the Holevo information. The exponentially decaying phase rigorously establishes the existence of a measurement-invisible quantum-correlated phase -- a manifestation of many-body information scrambling with no bipartite analogue. We contrast this information-phase diagram with the entanglement-phase structure of tripartite Haar-random states obtained from logarithmic negativity, and show that the Holevo information reveals additional fine structure beyond conventional entanglement measures. Finally, we show that these information phases, as characterised by the Holevo information, emerge in the dynamics of chaotic quantum circuits and discuss the associated timescales.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> You-Cai Lv, Yu-Jia Zhu, Zong-Quan Zhou, Chuan-Feng Li, Guang-Can Guo</p>
            <p>Long-lived storage of single photons is a fundamental requirement for enabling quantum communication and foundational tests of quantum physics over extended distances. While the implementation of a global-scale quantum network requires quantum storage times on the order of seconds to minutes, existing photonic quantum memories have so far been limited to subsecond lifetimes. Although $^{151}$Eu$^{3+}$:Y$_2$SiO$_5$ crystals exhibit substantially extended spin coherence times at the `magic' magnetic field, the concomitant weak optical absorption has until now prevented single-photon storage. Here, we overcome this challenge by integrating a noiseless photon echo protocol--which makes full use of the crystal's natural absorption for photonic storage--with a universally robust dynamical decoupling sequence incorporating adiabatic pulses to efficiently protect delocalized spin-wave excitation, enabling long-lived quantum storage at the `magic' magnetic field. At a storage time of 5.6 s, we achieve a time-bin qubit storage fidelity of 88.0 $\pm$ 2.1%, surpassing the maximum fidelity attainable via classical strategies. Our device reaches a $1/e$ storage lifetime of 27.6 $\pm$ 0.5 s, enabling single-photon-level storage for 42 s with a signal-to-noise ratio greater than unity. This work establishes photonic quantum memory in the minute-scale regime, laying a solid foundation for global-scale quantum network and deep-space quantum experiments.</p>

            <h2>Enhancing Non-classical Properties of Entangled Coherent States via Post-Selected von Neumann Measurements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Janarbek Yuanbek, Bruno Tenorio</p>
            <p>The present study systematically investigates the modulation mechanism of post-selected weak measurement (WM) on the non-classical properties of entangled coherent states (ECSs). The primary goal is achieving controllable enhancement of quantum resources such as entanglement and squeezing, while minimising disturbance to the quantum state. We theoretically analyze the post-selected weak measurement process, and its effectiveness in amplifying the non-classical features of ECSs. The von Neumann measurement model is employed to analytically describe the weak-value amplification of the pointer state. It is demonstrated that a significant enhancement of squeezing can be achieved by tuning the measurement coupling strength. The joint Wigner function analysis in phase space further reveals that, as the coupling strength increases, the coherent structure of the state evolves from symmetric double peaks to multi-branch quantum interference fringes. The entanglement, quantified by the Hillery-Zubairy criterion, exhibits a pronounced increase with stronger coupling, while the quantum Fisher information indicates a systematic improvement in phase estimation precision. The results obtained establish a tunable weak measurement framework for precise manipulation of continuous-variable entangled states. This provides a feasible theoretical pathway for enhancing quantum metrology and measurement-based state engineering.</p>

            <h2>Kernelized Decoded Quantum Interferometry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fumin Wang</p>
            <p>Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI) promises superpolynomial speedups for structured optimization; however, its practical realization is often hindered by significant sensitivity to hardware noise and spectral dispersion. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{Kernelized Decoded Quantum Interferometry (k-DQI)}, a unified framework that integrates spectral engineering directly into the quantum circuit architecture. By inserting a unitary kernel prior to the interference step, k-DQI actively reshapes the problem's energy landscape, concentrating the solution mass into a ``decoder-friendly'' low-frequency head. We formalize this advantage through a novel robustness metric, the noise-weighted head mass $\Sigma_K$, and prove a \textbf{Monotonic Improvement Theorem}, which establishes that maximizing $\Sigma_K$ guarantees higher decoding success rates under local depolarizing noise. We substantiate these theoretical gains in Optimal Polynomial Interpolation (OPI) and LDPC-like problems, demonstrating that kernel tuning functions as a ``spectral lens'' to recover signal otherwise lost to isotropic noise. Crucially, we provide explicit, efficient circuit realizations using Chirp and Linear Canonical Transform (LCT) kernels that achieve significant boosts in effective signal-to-noise ratio with negligible depth overhead ($\tilde{O}(n)$ to $\tilde{O}(n^2)$). Collectively, these results reframe DQI from a static algorithm into a tunable, noise-aware protocol suited for near-term error-corrected environments.</p>

            <h2>An Optimal Framework for Constructing Lie-Algebra Generator Pools: Application to Variational Quantum Eigensolvers for Chemistry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yaromir Viswanathan, Olivier Adjoua, César Feniou, Siwar Badreddine, Jean-Philip Piquemal</p>
            <p>Lie Algebras are powerful mathematical structures used in physics to describe sets of operators and associated combinations. A central task is to identify a minimal set of generators from which the algebra can be constructed. The classical search for such generators has so far relied on greedy construction steps applied to an exponentially growing number of candidate operators, making it rapidly computationally intractable. We propose a general, polynomial-scaling and optimal strategy, based on Lie-Algebraic basic properties, to overcome this bottleneck. It allows for the efficient construction of these generators, also known as Minimal Complete Pools (MCPs), for a target Lie Algebra. As an immediate application, efficiently constructing user-defined MCPs that respect fermionic algebra is crucial in the context of adaptive Variational Quantum Eigensolver for quantum chemistry. Thus, we introduce MB-ADAPT-VQE, which incorporates optimally constructed MCPs into batched ADAPT-VQE to reduce quantum resources and improve convergence under strong correlation. These MCPs also unlock fixed-ansatz methods based on a Lie-algebraic structure such as the gradient-free NI-DUCC-VQE, enabling simulations surpassing prior MCP limits. The presented mathematical framework is general and applicable well beyond chemistry in fields including quantum error correction, quantum control, quantum machine learning, and more universally wherever compact Pauli basis are required.</p>

            <h2>Spectral analysis of the Koopman operator recovers Hamiltonian parameters in open quantum systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jorge E. Pérez-García, Carlos Colchero, Julio C. Gutiérrez-Vega</p>
            <p>Accurate identification of Hamiltonian parameters is essential for modeling and controlling open quantum systems. In this work, we demonstrate that the multichannel Hankel alternative view of Koopman (mHAVOK) algorithm is a robust and reliable spectral data-driven method for retrieving Hamiltonian parameters from the evolution of first-moment observables in open quantum systems. The method relies on the discrete spectrum of the Koopman operator to obtain these parameters, which are computed using the mHAVOK algorithm; a theoretical connection to this affirmation is presented. The method is tested on noiseless quadratures of an open two-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator and shown to retrieve oscillation frequencies, damping rates, nonlinear Kerr shifts, the qubit-photon coupling strength of a Jaynes-Cummings interaction, and the modulated frequency of a time-dependent Hamiltonian. The majority of the recovered parameters remained within 5\% of their actual values. Compared with Fourier and matrix-pencil estimators, our approach yields lower errors for dynamics with strong dissipation. Overall, these findings suggest that Koopman operator theory provides a practical framework for studying quantum dynamical systems.</p>

This family is universal in the sense that the map sending the generating projections to any other set of projections which satisfy the same relations is completely positive. These operator systems are constructed as inductive limits of explicitly defined operator systems. By choosing the linear relations to be the nonsignalling relations from quantum correlation theory, we obtain a hierarchy of ordered vector spaces dual to the hierarchy of quantum correlation sets. By considering another set of relations, we also find a new necessary condition for the existence of a SIC-POVM.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yun-Feng Lo, Yen-Chi Lee, Min-Hsiu Hsieh</p>
            <p>This paper studies the role of symmetry in determining the low-noise behavior of high-dimensional quantum channels, with a focus on the modified Landau--Streater (MLS) family derived from spin-$j$ representations of $SU(2)$. We show that these channels exhibit a quadratic scaling of the approximate degradability parameter, $\eta = O(p^2)$, for every dimension $d=2j+1$, using an explicit degrading map whose structure is dictated by the $SU(2)$ Casimir operator. We further identify two algebraic features underlying this behavior: the tracelessness of the noise operators, which enforces a geometric orthogonality between signal and noise components, and an eigen-invariance property that preserves this structure under the channel action. These observations lead to a general sufficient condition under which a channel displays quadratic suppression of non-degradability, placing the MLS and generalized Pauli channels within a common analytical framework. Overall, the results clarify why certain symmetric noise models admit tighter low-noise capacity estimates and suggest a structural perspective for analyzing approximate degradability in higher dimensions.</p>

We first prove that any rotationally symmetric 2D membrane embedded in flat 3D space cannot be transient. Then we formulate a criterion for the transience of a general asymmetric 2D membrane. We use it to explicitly construct a class of transient 2D manifolds with a non-trivial metric and height function but ``zero average curvature,'' which we dub tablecloth manifolds. The absence of the logarithmic infrared divergence of the Laplace-Beltrami operator in turn implies the absence of weak localization, non-existence of bound states in shallow potentials, and breakdown of the Mermin-Wagner theorem and Kosterlitz-Thouless transition on the tablecloth manifolds, which may be realizable in both quantum simulators and corrugated two-dimensional materials.</p>

            <p>This work analyses the extent to which the "blurred orbits" of the current model for the atom, drafted by Heisenberg in 1926, fits the image of a bunch of wandering electrons around a nucleus. We will deal with early appearances of the concept of indistinguishable particles within the frame of quantum mechanics. There are few studies on the use of this concept in Heisenberg's 1926 papers on helium, in contrast with the large number of them on its use in Bose--Einstein's 1924 papers. We will discuss to what extent Heisenberg's approach leads to a purely statistical interpretation of this concept. We will also study the viewpoint of Dirac, who dealt with the same topic few months later. Although the indistinguishability of the electrons and indeterminacy are common explanations for the blurring of electron orbits, we argue that such an image is an oversimplification which masks interesting aspects of: a) the dynamics of bound electrons and b) the deeper implications of indistinguishability in quantum mechanics.</p>

            <h2>Tricritical Kibble-Zurek scaling in Rydberg atom ladders</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hanteng Wang, Xingyu Li, Chengshu Li</p>
            <p>The Kibble-Zurek (KZ) mechanism has been extensively studied in various second-order phase transitions, yet the case of tricriticality-the point where second-order phase transition lines terminate-remains experimentally elusive. Here, we theoretically propose probing KZ scaling at tricritical points using Rydberg atom arrays arranged as two- and three-leg ladders, which realize the tricritical Ising and tricritical Potts universality classes. By slowly ramping the Rabi frequency and detuning, we extract two relevant tricritical exponents, $\nu$ and $\nu'$, both via conventional paths from the disordered to the ordered phase and via "tangential" paths confined entirely within the disordered phase. At faster speeds, ramping dynamics go beyond the standard KZ paradigm: data collapse analysis using the parent critical exponents (rather than the tricritical ones) reveals renormalization group flows toward the adjacent second-order critical line, and we identify it as a dynamical analog of Zamolodchikov's $c$-theorem. Our protocol is readily implementable on existing Rydberg quantum simulators. This provides a direct route to measuring distinct tricritical exponents which can reveal an emergent spacetime supersymmetry constraint $1/\nu - 1/\nu' = 1$. Moreover, this work deepens our theoretical understanding and opens new avenues for exploring beyond-KZ quantum dynamics with rich renormalization group structure.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Molly Gibbins, Adam Gammon-Smith, Bruno Bertini</p>
            <p>The study of symmetry restoration has recently emerged as a fruitful means to extract high-level information on the relaxation of quantum many-body systems. However, while the restoration of internal symmetries has been investigated intensively, that of spatial symmetries has hitherto only been considered in the context of random unitary circuits. Here we present a complementary study of translation symmetry restoration in integrable systems. In particular, we consider a one-dimensional chain of spinless, non-interacting fermions quenched from a $\nu>1$ shift invariant state, and follow the local restoration of one-site shift invariance using the Frobenius distance $\Delta F_A$ between the state on a subsystem and its symmetrised counterpart. Distinct from the case of random unitary circuits, where symmetry restoration occurs abruptly for times proportional to the subsystem size, we find that symmetry here is restored smoothly and over timescales of the order of the subsystem size squared. We also find that the so-called `quantum Mpemba effect' is readily observed. Most importantly, we show that - in contrast to the case of continuous internal symmetries - this discrete symmetry restoration is not qualitatively described by a quasiparticle picture for $\Delta F_A$, and therefore goes beyond the hydrodynamic description. Our results can be directly extended to higher dimensions.</p>

In this work, we present a systematic study of next-to-leading order electroweak corrections to the angular coefficients characterizing this decay. While these coefficients are highly constrained at leading order, radiative corrections induce shifts of up to 5% to the existing terms and generate novel structures that vanish at leading order, breaking previous relations among coefficients. While higher-order effects influence the results, the two-qutrit quantum structure in the $h\to WW^*$ channel exhibits greater stability under such corrections than in the previously studied $h \to ZZ^*$ decay.</p>

            <p>Coherent quantum state transfer over macroscopic distances between non-neighboring elements in quantum circuits is a crucial component to increase connectivity and simplify quantum information processing. To facilitate such transfers, an efficient and easily controllable quantum pump would be highly beneficial. In this work, we demonstrate such a quantum pump based on a one-dimensional quasicrystal Fibonacci chain~(FC). In particular, we utilize the unique properties of quasicrystals to pump the edge-localized winding states between the two distant ends of the chain by only minimal manipulation of the FC at its end points. We establish the necessary conditions for successful state transfer within a fully time-dependent picture and also demonstrate robustness of the transfer protocol against disorder. We then couple external qubits to each end of the FC and establish highly adaptable functionality as a quantum bus with both on-demand switching of the qubit states and generation of maximally entangled Bell states between the qubits. Thanks to the minimal control parameters, the setup is well-suited for implementation across diverse experimental platforms, thus establishing quasicrystals as an efficient platform for versatile quantum information processing.</p>

            <p>Quantum programs today are written at a low level of abstraction - quantum circuits akin to assembly languages - and the unitary parts of even advanced quantum programming languages essentially function as circuit description languages. This state of affairs impedes scalability, clarity, and support for higher-level reasoning. More abstract and expressive quantum programming constructs are needed. To this end, we introduce a simple syntax for generating unitaries from "just a phase"; we combine a (global) phase operation that captures phase shifts with a quantum analogue of the "if let" construct that captures subspace selection via pattern matching. This minimal language lifts the focus from gates to eigendecomposition, conjugation, and controlled unitaries; common building blocks in quantum algorithm design. We demonstrate several aspects of the expressive power of our language in several ways. Firstly, we establish that our representation is universal by deriving a universal quantum gate set. Secondly, we show that important quantum algorithms can be expressed naturally and concisely, including Grover's search algorithm, Hamiltonian simulation, Quantum Fourier Transform, Quantum Signal Processing, and the Quantum Eigenvalue Transformation. Furthermore, we give clean denotational semantics grounded in categorical quantum mechanics. Finally, we implement a prototype compiler that efficiently translates terms of our language to quantum circuits, and prove that it is sound with respect to these semantics. Collectively, these contributions show that this construct offers a principled and practical step toward more abstract and structured quantum programming.</p>

We begin with a self-contained introduction to projective representations, highlighting the role of group cohomology, representation theory, and classification of irreducible projective representations. We then focus on a special subset of cohomology classes, known as the Bogomolov multiplier, which consists of cocycles that are symmetric on commuting pairs but remain nontrivial in group cohomology. Such cocycles have important physical implications: they characterize (1+1)D SPT phases that cannot be detected by string order parameters and give rise, upon gauging, to distinct gapped phases with completely broken non-invertible $\mathrm{Rep}(G)$ symmetry. We construct explicit lattice models for these phases and demonstrate how they are distinguished by the fusion rules of local order parameters. We show that a pair of completely broken $\mathrm{Rep}(G)$ SSB phases host nontrivial interface modes at their domain walls. As an example, we construct a lattice model where the ground state degeneracy on a ring increases from 32 without interfaces to 56 with interfaces.</p>

This is supported by good agreement between first-order perturbation theory and numerics, which capture scar dynamics despite chaotic spectra. Our results establish non-invertible dualities as both a generative mechanism and a diagnostic tool for quantum many- body scarring, offering a generalized symmetry-based route to weak ergodicity breaking.</p>

We show that the quantum state vector of the D$0$-brane is described by an on-shell superfield that collects the fields of the massive counterpart of the linearized type IIA supergravity supermultiplet which can be obtained as massive Kaluza-Klein mode of the dimensional reduction of the eleven dimensional supergravity down to ten dimensions. In conclusion, we briefly discuss a spinor helicity formalism for D$0$-brane which can be used as one of the basic elements for developing type IIA string theory amplitude calculus based on multiparticle generalizations of the on-shell superfields.</p>

            <h2>From Quantum Tsallis Entropy to Strange Metals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xian-Hui Ge</p>
            <p>We develop a unified framework connecting quantum Tsallis statistics to electronic transport in strongly interacting systems. Starting from Rényi and Tsallis entropies, we construct a quantum Tsallis distribution that reduces to the conventional Fermi--Dirac distribution when $q=1$. For $q$ slightly deviating from unity, the correction term in the occupation function can be mapped to a $q$-deformed Schwarzian action, corresponding to soft reparametrization modes. Coupling these soft modes to electrons via the Fermi Golden Rule yields a modified scattering rate, which reproduces conventional Fermi-liquid behavior at low temperatures and linear-in-temperature resistivity at high temperatures. Using the memory matrix formalism, we analyze magnetotransport, finding a linear-in-field magnetoresistance and a Hall angle consistent with Anderson's two-lifetime scenario. At sufficiently low temperatures, both magnetoresistance and Hall response smoothly recover Fermi-liquid quadratic behaviors. This approach provides a controlled interpolation between Fermi-liquid and non-Fermi-liquid regimes, quantitatively linking $q$-deformation, soft-mode dynamics, and experimentally measurable transport coefficients in strange metals.</p>

            <h2>Photonic Exceptional Points in Holography and QCD</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mahdis Ghodrati</p>
            <p>In this work, based on an analogy of holographic confining geometries and using complexified fields, we build the holographic toy model of third order photonic exceptional points (EPs) of ternary coupled microrings with gain and loss, which makes an open, non-Hermitian quantum system. In our model, we discuss the Ferrell-Glover-Tinkham sum rule for various combinations of gain and loss systems, and numerically find the behavior of spectra which matches with the experiments. We also discuss the inhomogeneous case of a holographic lattice for three-site photonic EPs. Additionally, in our holographic model, we numerically find the behavior of phase rigidity and the Petermann factor around EPs versus various parameters of the model. We also discuss the connections between recent developments in complexified, time-dependent entanglement entropy and EPs, and finally, we connect EPs and the $\theta$-vacuum of QCD through topological structures, partition functions, and winding numbers, and find a second-order EP in a perturbed $\theta$-vacuum model.</p>

For any reflection positive frustration-free Hamiltonian, We proved that the local topological quantum order (LTQO) condition of ground states on a disk holds if and only if the ground state on the sphere is non-degenerate.

            <h2>Suppression of quantized heat flow by the dielectric response of a compressible strip at the quantum Hall edge</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eugene V. Sukhorukov, Adrien Tomà</p>
            <p>We develop a unified perturbative framework for energy transport along a chiral quantum Hall edge coupled to a disordered, compressible strip. Treating the strip as a generic linear response environment characterized by its retarded susceptibility, we obtain leading corrections to both the heat flux carried by the edge plasmon and to its spectrum. Two generic regimes emerge: (i) a gapped, local dielectric response with finite-range coupling, producing a negative correction to the quantized heat flux that scales as T^4 at low temperatures together with a convex cubic shift of the plasmon dispersion; and (ii) a hydrodynamic (diffusive) response with relaxation, yielding a crossover from T^4 to T^{3/2} scaling and a change of sign in the correction. We further introduce a microscopic dipolar model in which the edge couples electrostatically to localized dipole moments inside a wide compressible strip. This long-range interaction amplifies the nonlocal dielectric back-action and generates new suppression laws, T^3 or even T^2 for smooth disorder profiles, together with a universal ratio connecting spectral curvature to thermal response. Across all regimes, the total heat flux remains quantized: the apparent deficit of the plasmon contribution reflects reversible heat drag into the compressible strip rather than a breakdown of quantization. The framework thus provides a coherent and quantitatively plausible explanation of the "missing heat flux" anomaly and unifies the thermal and spectral signatures of quantum Hall edge dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Quantum vortices in entanglement: a novel idea for large vortex filaments</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S.V. Talalov</p>
            <p>In this study, we propose a new approach to describing certain macroscopic objects that can arise in a quantum fluid. These objects are formed by means of quantum entanglement from the circular-shaped mesoscale and microscale vortices, and can be interpreted as a vortex filaments with any shape and size. The method is based on a quantization scheme for classical closed vortex filaments that was proposed by the author early \cite{Tal18,Tal22_1,Tal_Chaos25J}. The model we consider examines the instantaneous picture of the locations in space $\mathbb R_3$ of such filaments with a small, but non-zero, core diameter. Both energy and circulation of the studied filaments are calculated using the proposed approach. We demonstrate that the adopted concept leads to the emergence of secondary vortices around these investigated filament-like objects. We also study the specific mechanisms by which large vortex loops can disconnect and create the filament fragments . From our point of view, the proposed approach to describing vortex filaments within a vortex tangle can be seen as an important step toward understanding the appearance of quantum turbulence.</p>

            <h2>Exploring Replica Symmetry Breaking and Topological Collapse in Spin Glasses with Quantum Annealing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kumar Ghosh</p>
            <p>Replica symmetry breaking (RSB) underlies the complex organization of disordered systems, yet quantitative validation beyond $N \sim 100$ spins has remained computationally challenging. We use quantum annealing to access ground states of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model up to $N = 4000$ spins, enabling the most extensive test of Parisi's Nobel Prize-winning RSB solution to date. Five independent observables confirm RSB predictions: ground-state energies converge to Parisi's value with characteristic $N^{-2/3}$ corrections, energy fluctuations scale as $N^{-3/4}$ ($\gamma = 0.739 \pm 0.036$), the chaos exponent $\theta = 0.51 \pm 0.02$ ($R^2 = 0.989$) confirms mean-field universality, the overlap distribution exhibits hierarchical structure ($\sigma_q = 0.19$), and the complexity remains invariant under 36\% network dilution. Beyond a critical threshold $0.8 < D_c < 0.9$, the hierarchy collapses discontinuously through a cooperative avalanche that converts the entire system to vacancies within a narrow parameter window $\Delta D = 0.1$. These findings establish quantum computation as a tool for probing emergent many-body phenomena and uncover the topological foundations of complexity in disordered systems, with implications for neural networks, optimization, and materials science.</p>

            <h2>Thermalization of exact quantum many-body scars in spin-1 XY chain under perturbation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Himadri Halder</p>
            <p>Quantum many-body scars are special eigenstates that violate the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis while residing at finite energy density along with thermalizing eigenstates. The spin-1 XY model is known to host a family of such exceptional states originating from long-lived quasiparticle excitations that exhibit anomalously low entanglement entropy and long-time periodic revivals, resulting in weak ergodicity breaking. We study the stability of these scarred states against typical U(1) symmetry preserving perturbation in the XY chain. While perturbation theory can describe the deformed scar states at small system sizes, finite-size scaling of the perturbation matrix elements indicate that the scars ultimately thermalize in larger chains. Nonetheless, we demonstrate that the long-range order associated with the scars decays under the perturbation, and we estimate the relaxation timescale of oscillatory dynamics in certain local observables to be of order $\lambda^{-2}$, where $\lambda$ is the perturbation strength.</p>

            <p>We introduce a unified framework that relates orbital and heat magnetizations to experimentally accessible excitation spectra, through thermoelectric probes and generalized sum rules. By analyzing zero-temperature transport coefficients and applying Kramers-Kronig relations, we derive spectral representations of magnetization densities from thermoelectric correlation functions. Excitation rates under chiral thermoelectric drives then naturally emerge as direct probes of these Kubo-type correlators, placing orbital and heat magnetizations on equal footing with the topological Chern number. As a direct consequence of our formalism, we introduce a hierarchical construction that organizes orbital and heat magnetizations into distinct physical contributions accessible through sum rules, and also derive real-space markers of these magnetizations. From an experimental standpoint, we propose concrete implementations of thermoelectric dichroic measurements in quantum-engineered platforms based on modulated strain fields. These results establish thermoelectric dichroic measurements as a versatile route to access and disentangle fundamental ground-state properties.</p>

            <p>Entanglement does not always require one particle per party. It was predicted some thirty years ago that a single photon traversing a beam splitter could violate a Bell inequality. Although initially debated, single-photon nonlocality was eventually demonstrated via homodyne measurements. Here, we present an alternate realisation that avoids the complexity of homodyne measurements and potential loopholes in their implementation. We violate a Bell inequality by performing joint measurements on two copies of the same single-photon entangled state, where one photon acts as a phase reference for the other, making it self-referential. We observe CHSH parameters of $2.71\pm 0.09$ and $2.23\pm 0.07$, depending on the joint measurements implemented. This offers a new perspective on single-photon nonlocality and a more accessible experimental route, potentially applicable to general mode-entangled states in diverse platforms.</p>

            <p>Photons are promising candidates for quantum information technology due to their high robustness and long coherence time at room temperature. Inspired by the prosperous development of photonic computing techniques, recent research has turned attention to performing quantum machine learning on photonic platforms. Although photons possess a high-dimensional quantum feature space suitable for computation, a general understanding of how to harness it for learning tasks remains blank. Here, we establish both theoretically and experimentally a scalable advantage in quantum machine learning with multi-photon states. Firstly, we prove that the learning capacity of linear optical circuits scales polynomially with the photon number, enabling generalization from smaller training datasets and yielding lower test loss values. Moreover, we experimentally corroborate these findings through unitary learning and metric learning tasks, by performing online training on a fully programmable photonic integrated platform. Our work highlights the potential of photonic quantum machine learning and paves the way for achieving quantum enhancement in practical machine learning applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Josiah Cochran, Haley M. Cole, Hebah Goderya, Zhuoqun Hao, Yao-Chun Chang, Theo Shaw, Aikaterini Kargioti, Shyam Shankar</p>
            <p>Quantum error correction (QEC) requires ancilla qubits to extract error syndromes from data qubits which store quantum information. However, ancilla errors can propagate back to the data qubits, introducing additional errors and limiting fault-tolerance. In superconducting quantum circuits, Kerr-cat qubits (KCQs), which exhibit strongly biased noise, have been proposed as ancillas to suppress this back-action and enhance QEC performance. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a beamsplitter interaction between a KCQ and a transmon, realizing an effective $\sigma_z\sigma_x$ coupling that can be employed for parity measurements in QEC protocols. We characterize the interaction across a range of cat sizes and drive amplitudes, confirming the expected scaling of the interaction rate. These results establish a step towards hybrid architectures that combine transmons as data qubits with noise-biased bosonic ancillas, enabling hardware-efficient syndrome extraction and advancing the development of fault-tolerant quantum processors.</p>

Our method is independent of oscillator's initial state, amenable to sensing with high-temperature or logical error-corrected states. The protocol shows robustness to qubit Markovian noise and preserves its state-independence, underscoring its practicality for next-generation quantum metrology. We demonstrate application to force sensing beyond the SQL in longitudinally coupled systems, and to high-precision measurements of couplings and pulse calibration surpassing SQL in dispersively coupled circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) architectures.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite (2D-OIHP) quantum wells are emerging as promising light sources for quantum communication technologies, owing to their ability to generate polarization-encoded optical signals. In this work, we explore how nonlinear optical phenomena can be exploited for quantum information applications, demonstrating the versatility that arises from resonant coupling among excited states. By tracking changes in the ellipticities of signal photons on femtosecond timescales in four-wave-mixing experiments, we first establish a method for information encoding based on exciton spin dynamics and biexciton correlations. Using single-photon detection, we then implement the BB84 quantum key distribution protocol by mapping these polarization states onto binary sequences. While the polarizations of weak coherent pulses are typically manipulated with optical elements in traditional quantum key distribution approaches, the intrinsic electronic structure and spin relaxation processes within the 2D-OIHP system determine the characteristics of the signal photons in our method. As a demonstration, an ASCII message consisting of 56 bits is transmitted through the polarization states of photons emitted by 2D-OIHP quantum wells. These results show that the information transmission efficiency depends strongly on contributions from biexciton states, highlighting the potential of spin-dependent nonlinear optical processes for quantum communication.</p>

            <p>Magnonic systems present a compelling platform for quantum technology, owing to their strong capacity to form hybrid quantum systems via diverse couplings. To unlock the full potential of these systems, the engineering of flexible coupling between multiple magnon modes is essential. Here, we propose a method to realize switchable dissipative Ising coupling in magnon systems, leveraging the three-body coupling among photon, phonon, and magnon. This type of dissipative coupling is a critical component for constructing Ising machines designed to solve complex combinatorial optimization problems. By dynamically tuning the phase of a nonlinear mechanical pump, we demonstrate the realization of both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic dissipative interactions. The validity of the scheme is confirmed by numerical simulations, which also demonstrate its robustness against a strong uncontrollable part of dissipation. Our work provides a versatile tool that can facilitate the implementation of magnon-based quantum computing and the exploration of many-body magnon physics.</p>

            <p>The accurate treatment of electron correlation in extended molecular systems remains computationally challenging using classical electronic structure methods. Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms offer a potential route to overcome these limitations; however, their practical deployment on existing quantum computers requires strategies that both reduce problem size and mitigate hardware noise. In this work, we combine Density Matrix Embedding Theory (DMET) with Sample-based Quantum Diagonalization (SQD) to compute ground-state energies of a set of natural ligand-like molecules in the minimal Slater Type Orbital (STO-3G) basis set. DMET provides a systematic fragmentation of a molecule into embedded impurity subproblems, while SQD enables construction and classical diagonalization of reduced configuration spaces through quantum sampling enhanced by iterative configuration recovery. The resulting embedded Hamiltonians are solved on IBM's Eagle R3 superconducting quantum hardware (IBM Sherbrooke). The DMET-SQD energies obtained for all systems considered exhibit strong agreement with DMET-FCI benchmark values within chemical accuracy (1 kcal/mol). These results demonstrate that sample-based quantum methods, when integrated with a robust embedding framework, can reliably extend quantum computation towards simulation of chemically relevant molecular systems, showcasing potential applications in the field of drug discovery.</p>

Different physical implementations of quantum computing, however, employ interactions that permit direct conditional dynamics on multiple qubits in a single step. In this work, we leverage quantum optimal control techniques to design single continuous laser pulses that implement multi-qubit controlled-phase, -NOT and -swap (Fredkin) gates on Rydberg atom quantum processors. The identification of robust multi-qubit operations leads to reduced operation time and less decoherence, and the control field provides continuous protection of the atoms from environmental noise. Notably, we find that the controlled-swap (Fredkin) gate, implemented using this approach achieves 99.74\% fidelity while accounting for imperfections such as spontaneous emission, laser fluctuations, and Doppler dephasing.</p>

            <p>Continuous monitoring of open quantum-optical systems offers a promising route towards quantum-enhanced estimation precision. In such continuous-measurement-based sensing protocols, the ultimate precision limit is dictated, through the quantum Cramér-Rao bound, by the global quantum Fisher information associated with the joint system-environment state. Reaching this limit with established continuous measurement techniques in quantum optics remains an outstanding challenge. Here we present a sensing protocol tailored for open quantum-optical sensors that exhibit dissipative criticality, enabling them to significantly narrow the gap to the ultimate precision limit. Our protocol leverages a previously unexplored interplay between the quantum criticality and the quantum measurement backaction inherent in continuous general-dyne detection. We identify a performance sweet spot, near which the ultimate precision limit can be efficiently approached. Our protocol establishes a new pathway towards quantum-enhanced precision in open quantum-optical setups and can be extended to other sensor designs featuring similar dissipative criticality.</p>

In this work, we employ tensor-network methods to investigate its non-Markovian dynamics induced by finite time delays in photon exchange among the emitters. We find that the superradiant burst breaks into a structured train of correlated photons, each intensity peak corresponding to a specific photon number. We quantify the emitter-photon and emitter-emitter entanglement generated during this process and show that the latter emerges in the long-time limit, as part of the excitation becomes trapped within the emitters' singlet subspace. We finally consider the decay of the system's most radiant state, the symmetric Dicke state, and show that time delay can lead to decay rates exceeding those predicted by the Markovian approximation.</p>

            <p>Collective effects, such as superradiance and subradiance are central to emerging quantum technologies -- from sensing to energy storage -- and play an important role in light-harvesting. These effects enhance or suppress rates of dynamic processes (absorption, emission, and transfer) due to the formation of symmetric or antisymmetric collective states. However, collective effects in different contexts -- absorption, emission, and transfer -- have often been defined disparately, especially across different communities, leading to results that are not immediately transferable between different contexts. Here, we describe all three types of collective effects using a common Dicke framework that resolves the apparent discrepancies between different approaches. It allows us to generalise previously known collective effects involving spins into new ones involving aggregates of harmonic oscillators or other degrees of freedom. It also explains how collective effects can be engineered to be robust against both disorder and noise, paving the way for more resilient quantum devices.</p>

            <p>The basic element of circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) is a cavity resonator strongly coupled to a superconducting qubit. Since the inception of the field, the choice of the cavity frequency was, with a few exceptions, been limited to a narrow range around 7 GHz due to a variety of fundamental and practical considerations. Here we report the first cQED implementation, where the qubit remains a regular transmon at about 5 GHz frequency, but the cavity's fundamental mode raises to 21 GHz. We demonstrate that (i) the dispersive shift remains in the conventional MHz range despite the large qubit-cavity detuning, (ii) the quantum efficiency of the qubit readout reaches 8%, (iii) the qubit's energy relaxation quality factor exceeds $10^7$, (iv) the qubit coherence time reproducibly exceeds $100~\mu\rm{s}$ and can reach above $300~\mu\rm{s}$ with a single echoing $\pi$-pulse correction. The readout error is currently limited by an accidental resonant excitation of a non-computational state, the elimination of which requires minor adjustments to the device parameters. Nevertheless, we were able to initialize the qubit in a repeated measurement by post-selection with $2\times 10^{-3}$ error and achieve $4\times 10^{-3}$ state assignment error. These results encourage in-depth explorations of potentially transformative advantages of high-frequency cavities without compromising existing qubit functionality.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhe-Qi Yang, Si-Qi Lin, Zhi-Rong Zhong</p>
            <p>Ultrahigh nonreciprocal transmission has been achieved in a cavity-magnon system, which consists of two whispering gallery modes (WGMs) and a single magnon mode within a magnetic insulator yttrium iron garnet sphere. The nonreciprocal frequency shift induced by the Sagnac effect enables unidirectional transmission of an input field, while suppressing propagation in the opposite direction, thereby facilitating nonreciprocal optical transmission. Within experimentally accessible parameter regimes, the optical isolation ratio can exceed 40 dB, representing the highest isolation ratio reported to date. Furthermore, applying squeezing to the magnon mode further enhances this isolation performance. Additionally, the directionality of light isolation can be reversed simply by modifying the rotation of the WGM cavity. These findings offer promising prospects for developing high-performance, tunable, and compact optical nonreciprocal devices.</p>

            <p>Precise control of photon transport in waveguide quantum electrodynamics is fundamental to advancing quantum information processing. We investigate the manipulation of single-photon scattering via a driven $\Lambda$-type emitter coupled to a rectangular waveguide, examining both single- and multi-mode regimes. Using the Lippmann-Schwinger formalism, we derive the scattering matrix and identify two distinct control mechanisms: Fano resonances induce complete reflection, and electromagnetically induce transparency (EIT) induce perfect transmission. In the single-mode regime, the external drive parameters-the detuning and Rabi frequency-precisely tune the positions and number of reflection peaks, allowing dynamic spectral engineering. In the multi-mode regime, quantum interference between modes governs the scattering dynamics. When the input photon is prepared in a specific coherent superposition, multi-mode effects restore single-mode-like behavior, enabling Fano-mediated complete reflection. Conversely, a single-mode input prevents complete reflection even at the Fano resonance, while EIT-driven transmission persists. These results demonstrate a versatile toolbox for photonic quantum control in multi-mode waveguides, paving the way for applications such as broadband dual-frequency filters and multi-mode spectrometers.</p>

            <p>Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are becoming the primary computational primitive for next-generation quantum computers, particularly those embedded as resource-constrained accelerators in the emerging Quantum Internet of Things (QIoT). However, under such device-constrained execution conditions, the scalability of learning is severely limited by barren plateaus, where gradients collapse to zero and training stalls. This poses a practical challenge to delivering VQA-enabled intelligence on QIoT endpoints, which often have few qubits, constrained shot budgets, and strict latency requirements. In this paper, we present a novel approach for escaping barren plateaus by including negative learning rates into the optimization process in QIoT devices. Our method introduces controlled instability into model training by switching between positive and negative learning phases, allowing recovery of significant gradients and exploring flatter areas in the loss landscape. We theoretically evaluate the effect of negative learning on gradient variance and propose conditions under which it helps escape from barren zones. The experimental findings on typical VQA benchmarks show consistent improvements in both convergence and simulation results over traditional optimizers. By escaping barren plateaus, our approach leads to a novel pathway for robust optimization in quantum-classical hybrid models.</p>

            <p>Characterizing quantum phases-of-matter at finite-temperature is essential for understanding complex materials and large-scale thermodynamic phenomena. Here, we develop algorithmic protocols for simulating quantum thermodynamics on quantum hardware through quantum kernel function expansion (QKFE), producing the free energy as an analytic function of temperature with uniform convergence. These protocols are demonstrated by simulating transverse field Ising and XY models with superconducting qubits. In both analogue and digital implementations of the QKFE algorithms, we exhibit quantitative agreement of our quantum simulation experiments with the exact results. Our approach provides a general framework for computing thermodynamic potentials on programmable quantum devices, granting access to key thermodynamic properties such as entropy, heat capacity and criticality, with far-reaching implications for material design and drug development.</p>

            <h2>Evidence for unexpectedly low quasiparticle generation rates across Josephson junctions of driven superconducting qubits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Byoung-moo Ann, Sang-Jun Choi, Hee Chul Park, Sercan Deve, Robin Dekker, Gary A. Steele, Jaseung Ku, Seung-Bo Shim, Junho Suh</p>
            <p>Microwave drives applied to superconducting qubits (SCQs) are central to high-fidelity control and fast readout. However, recent studies find that even drives far below the superconducting gap frequency may cause drive-induced quasiparticle generation (QPG) across Josephson junctions (JJs), posing a serious concern for fault-tolerant superconducting quantum computing. Here, we find experimental evidence that the actual QPG rates in strongly driven SCQs are remarkably lower than expected. We apply intense drive fields through readout resonators, reaching effective qubit drive amplitudes up to 300 GHz. The nonlinear response of the resonators enables quantification of the energy loss from SCQs into their environments, including the contribution from QPG. Even when conservatively attributing all measured dissipation to QPG, the observed energy dissipation rates are far lower than expected from the ideal QPG model. Meanwhile, calculations incorporating high-frequency cutoffs (HFCs) near 17-20 GHz in the QPG conductance can explain the experiments. These HFCs yield QPG rates a few orders of magnitude smaller than those without HFCs, providing evidence that the QPG rates are lower than predicted by the ideal model. Our findings prevent overestimation of drive-induced QPG and provide crucial guidance for operating superconducting quantum processors. Identifying the microscopic origin of the discrepancy opens new material and device opportunities to further mitigate QPG.</p>

            <h2>Quantum relative entropy for unravelings of master equations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marcos Ruibal Ortigueira, Robert de Keijzer, Luke Visser, Oliver Tse, Servaas Kokkelmans</p>
            <p>This work explores connections between the quantum relative entropy of two faithful states $\rho,\sigma$ (i.e. full-rank density matrices) and the Kullback-Leibler divergences of classical measures $\mu,\nu$. Here, $\mu$ and $\nu$ are measures on the space of pure states, realizing $\rho$ and $\sigma$ respectively. The motivation for this result is to establish a notion of quantum relative entropy in the space of pure state distributions, which are the resulting objects of unravelings of the Lindblad equation, such as the stochastic Schrödinger equation. Our results show that the measures that achieve the minimal KL divergence are those supported on a (possibly non-orthogonal) common basis between $\rho$ and $\sigma$. Using the classical and quantum data-processing inequalities, our notion of quantum relative entropy is shown to be equivalent to the Belavkin-Staszewski entropy on states, revealing new insights on this quantity. Furthermore, the common basis is used to provide a novel proof of contraction of the relative entropy under Lindblad flow and offers insights into results from large deviation theory.</p>

            <p>Despite several approaches proposed to operationally characterize quantum states of light-those that cannot be sampled with a positive distribution over classical states-most existing formulations suffer from limited practicality or rely on convex optimization procedures that are computationally demanding. In this work, we develop a general convex resource-theoretic framework to quantify optical quantumness directly from the norms of linear functionals of quantum states, thereby avoiding any optimization. We further establish a no-go theorem demonstrating that no universal measure of quantumness can exist in the absence of optimization. Finally, we substantiate our theoretical result through explicit examples involving both Gaussian and non-Gaussian states.</p>

            <p>Subwavelength atomic arrays offer a powerful platform for engineering cooperative light-matter interactions and enabling quantum metasurfaces. We demonstrate that a two-dimensional array of three-level atoms operating under electromagnetically induced transparency can function as a tunable dual-band atomic mirror, where two independently controllable reflection bands emerge from the collective optical responses mediated by dipole-dipole interactions. These resonances yield dual reflection bands with asymmetric linewidths, whose spectral positions and bandwidths can be tuned through the control-field parameters, dipole orientation, incident geometry, and lattice constant. We further identify the conditions under which additional diffraction orders emerge, which delineate the operational and tunable range of the atomic mirror via its collective-mode structure. This scheme provides a fully tunable dual-band atomic mirror operating across broad frequency and angular ranges, offering a practical and experimentally accessible pathway toward reconfigurable photonic elements in atomic-array platforms at low energy levels.</p>

            <h2>Algebraic power scaling in a slowly-quenched bosonic quantum battery</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Donny Dwiputra, Ahmad R. T. Nugraha, Sasfan A. Wella, Freddy Permana Zen</p>
            <p>Bosonic modes provide a promising platform for quantum batteries as a result of their unbounded energy spectrum. However, the energy that can be stored during a coherent charging process is limited due to coherent oscillations between the charger and battery. In this Letter, we show that by introducing a slow quench in the interaction between a coherently driven quadratic oscillator battery and a charger system, the maximum battery power ($P_{B,m}$) scales algebraically with the quench duration ($\tau_Q$), i.e., $P_{B,m} \propto \tau_Q^\alpha$, where $0<\alpha\leq2$ is a function of the quench ramp exponent. This finding implies that, counterintuitively, slower quenches lead to faster charging. Such a quench suppresses coherent energy oscillations between the battery and the charger, allowing an unbounded increase in power. Furthermore, we discuss the effect of charger dissipation, which imposes a finite limit on the maximum power. We also show that the temporal extensive scaling occurs in a broader context by mapping the system to a coherently driven Tavis-Cummings battery.</p>

            <h2>Efficient Identification of Permutation Symmetries in Many-Body Hamiltonians via Graph Theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saumya Shah, Patrick Rebentrost</p>
            <p>The computational cost of simulating quantum many-body systems can often be reduced by taking advantage of physical symmetries. While methods exist for specific symmetry classes, a general algorithm to find the full permutation symmetry group of an arbitrary Pauli Hamiltonian is notably lacking. This paper introduces a new method that identifies this symmetry group by establishing an isomorphism between the Hamiltonian's permutation symmetry group and the automorphism group of a coloured bipartite graph constructed from the Hamiltonian. We formally prove this isomorphism and show that for physical Hamiltonians with bounded locality and interaction degree, the resulting graph has a bounded degree, reducing the computational problem of finding the automorphism group to polynomial time. The algorithm's validity is empirically confirmed on various physical models with known symmetries. We further show that the problem of deciding whether two Hamiltonians are permutation-equivalent is polynomial-time reducible to the graph isomorphism problem using our graph representation. This work provides a general, structurally exact tool for algorithmic symmetry finding, enabling the scalable application of these symmetries to Hamiltonian simulation problems.</p>

            <p>A precise physical description and understanding of the classical dual content of quantum theory is necessary in many disciplines today: from concepts and interpretation to quantum technologies and computation. In this paper we investigate Quantum Entanglement with the new approach APL Quantum 2, 016104 (2025) on dual Classicalization. Thus, the results of this paper are twofold: Entanglement and Classicalization and the relationship between them. Classicalization truly occurs only under the action of the Metaplectic group Mp(n) (Minimal Representation group, double covering of the Symplectic group). Some of the results of this paper involves the computation and analysis of the entanglement for different types of coherent (coset and non coset) states and topologies: in the circle and the cylinder. We project the entangled wave functions onto the even (+) and odd (-) irreducible Hilbert Mp(n) subspaces, and compute their square norms: Entanglement Probabilities P++, P--, P+-, (eg in the same or in the different subspaces), and the Total sum of them, and more. These theoretical and conceptual results can be of experimental and practical real-world interest.</p>

            <p>Topological data analysis (TDA) characterizes complex dynamics through global invariants, but classical computation becomes prohibitive for high-dimensional data. We reinterpret time-domain dynamics as the eigenvalue spectrum of a supersymmetric (SUSY) Hamiltonian and thereby estimate topological descriptors through quantum spectroscopy. While zero modes correspond to Betti numbers, we show that low-lying excited states quantify the stability of topological features. Using a Takens embedding of the Lorenz system together with a resource-efficient quantum phase estimation implemented on IBM quantum hardware, we observe that the spectral gap of the SUSY Laplacian tracks the persistence of homological structures. Notably, the minimum of this spectral gap coincides with the onset of chaos, whereas its reopening reflects the geometric maturation of the attractor. Validated on small complexes yet offering an exponential advantage over classical diagonalization (from $O(N^3)$ to $\mathrm{poly}(\log N)$), this framework suggests that quantum hardware can function as a spectrometer for data topologies beyond classical reach.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vincenzo Lipardi, Domenica Dibenedetto, Georgios Stamoulis, Evert van Nieuwenburg, Mark H.M. Winands</p>
            <p>This article proposes a Graph Neural Network (GNN) approach to estimate nonstabilizerness in quantum circuits, measured by the stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE). Nonstabilizerness is a fundamental resource for quantum advantage, and efficient SRE estimations are highly beneficial in practical applications. We address the nonstabilizerness estimation problem through three supervised learning formulations starting from easier classification tasks to the more challenging regression task. Experimental results show that the proposed GNN manages to capture meaningful features from the graph-based circuit representation, resulting in robust generalization performances achieved across diverse scenarios. In classification tasks, the GNN is trained on product states and generalizes on circuits evolved under Clifford operations, entangled states, and circuits with higher number of qubits. In the regression task, the GNN significantly improves the SRE estimation on out-of-distribution circuits with higher number of qubits and gate counts compared to previous work, for both random quantum circuits and structured circuits derived from the transverse-field Ising model. Moreover, the graph representation of quantum circuits naturally integrates hardware-specific information. Simulations on noisy quantum hardware highlight the potential of the proposed GNN to predict the SRE measured on quantum devices.</p>

            <h2>Identifying genuine entanglement of lossy noisy very large scale continuous variable Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state</h2>

            <p>Genuine entanglement identification of large scale systems is crucial for quantum computation, quantum communication and quantum learning advantage. In contrast to experiments, where noisy intermediate-scale programmable photonic quantum processors have been developed, theoretically very limited results have been achieved for detecting genuine entanglement of continuous variable multipartite systems. We propose a quite general and efficient entanglement detection framework for all kinds of multipartite entanglement of continuous variable systems based on uncertainty relations and the sign matrix technique. Matrix criteria are demonstrated and can be applied to various entanglement depth and k-separability problems of multimode systems. We illustrate the genuine entanglement conditions of continuous variable Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states of more than a hundred million modes in a photon loss and noise environment.</p>

            <p>White Rabbit (WR) technology provides a commercially-available off-the-shelf solution for time synchronisation with sub-nanosecond accuracy and picosecond-level precision over optical fibre links typically spanning tens of kilometres. Such high-performance time dissemination can support a variety of applications, including position, navigation and timing (PNT), financial transactions, metrology, as well as entanglement and quantum key distribution (QKD). Demonstrations of WR over significantly longer distances remain few and far between, particularly in scenarios where intermediate amplification is unavailable, such as stretches of long-haul underwater fibre. In this work, we report the longest unrepeated deployment of WR to date, achieving time synchronisation over a 300 km (51.34 dB) single-span optical fibre link, even in highly asymmetrical configurations, with 99.86% uptime, whilst maintaining picosecond-level precision and sub-nanosecond accuracy. This was achieved through careful selection and optimisation of the components deployed at the link's end points. By leveraging standard telecom fibre and off-the-shelf hardware, our results pave the way for a scalable and standardised timing backbone for large-scale quantum networks, offering a practical route toward time distribution in future heterogeneous quantum communication systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Florian Burger, Stephan Rinner, Andreas Gritsch, Kilian Sandholzer, Andreas Reiserer</p>
            <p>Quantum networks and the modular scaling of quantum computers require efficient spin-photon interfaces. This can be achieved with optical resonators that increase the local density of states, thereby enhancing the radiative decay of emitters on a specific transition. However, small mode volumes and high quality factors are required in this approach, which restricts the multiplexing capacity and necessitates precise tuning of the resonator frequency. Here, we demonstrate an alternative method that avoids these bottlenecks for up-scaling. Instead of strongly enhancing the emission on a selected transition, we suppress all other radiative decay channels by tailoring the photonic bandgap of a W1 silicon photonic crystal waveguide. In such a device, we can spectrally resolve and individually address tens of erbium dopants. We find that their emission is channeled to the desired transition, ensuring efficient collection. At the same time, their lifetimes are preserved or even extended compared to the bulk in a broad spectral range. Furthermore, the extended mode volume facilitates a low dopant concentration and thus a large spatial separation between the emitters, avoiding unwanted interactions that would limit their coherence. The demonstrated approach of inhibiting unwanted spontaneous emission can be combined with Purcell enhancement and applied to other leading spin-qubit platforms. It thus opens intriguing perspectives for photonic quantum technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yaoling Yang, Andrew Tanggara, Tobias Haug, Kishor Bharti</p>
            <p>Bosonic codes utilize the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space of harmonic oscillators to encode quantum information, offering a hardware-efficient approach to quantum error correction. Designing these codes requires precise geometric arrangements of quantum states in the phase space. Here, we introduce Quantum Cubature Codes (QCCs), a powerful and generalized framework for constructing bosonic codes based on superpositions of coherent states. This formalism utilizes cubature formulas from multivariate approximation theory, which connect the continuous geometry of the phase space to discrete, weighted point sets, ensuring the conditions for error correction are met. We demonstrate that this framework provides a unifying perspective, revealing that well-established codes, such as cat codes and the recently proposed quantum spherical codes (QSCs), are specific instances of QCCs corresponding to uniform weights on a single energy shell. The QCC formalism unlocks a vast new design space, encompassing non-uniform superpositions and multi-shell configurations. We leverage this framework to discover several new families of codes derived from Euclidean designs, allowing for greater geometric separation between logical states, which correlates with improved performance under photon loss. Numerical simulations under a pure-loss channel show that our multi-shell QCCs can outperform their single-shell counterparts by maximizing geometric separation with optimal energy at fixed pure-loss rate.</p>

            <p>Analog Quantum Simulators offer a route to exploring strongly correlated many-body dynamics beyond classical computation, but their predictive power remains limited by the absence of quantitative error estimation. Establishing rigorous uncertainty bounds is essential for elevating such devices from qualitative demonstrations to quantitative scientific tools. Here we introduce a general framework for bounded-error quantum simulation, which provides predictions for many-body observables with experimentally quantifiable uncertainties. The approach combines Hamiltonian and Lindbladian Learning--a statistically rigorous inference of the coherent and dissipative generators governing the dynamics--with the propagation of their uncertainties into the simulated observables, yielding confidence bounds directly derived from experimental data. We demonstrate this framework on trapped-ion quantum simulators implementing long-range Ising interactions with up to 51 ions, and validate it where classical comparison is possible. We analyze error bounds on two levels. First, we learn an open-system model from experimental data collected in an initial time window of quench dynamics, simulate the corresponding master equation, and quantitatively verify consistency between theoretical predictions and measured dynamics at long times. Second, we establish error bounds directly from experimental measurements alone, without relying on classical simulation--crucial for entering regimes of quantum advantage. The learned models reproduce the experimental evolution within the predicted bounds, demonstrating quantitative reliability and internal consistency. Bounded-error quantum simulation provides a scalable foundation for trusted analog quantum computation, bridging the gap between experimental platforms and predictive many-body physics. The techniques presented here directly extend to digital quantum simulation.</p>

            <p>We investigate the onset and mechanism of Hilbert space fragmentation (HSF) in a chain of strongly interacting Rydberg atoms subject to local dephasing. It is found that the emergence of multiple long-lived metastable states is fundamentally tied to HSF of the driven-dephasing Rydberg atom system. We demonstrate that the manifesting HSF is captured by a dephasing PXP model that supports multiple degenerate zero modes. These modes form disconnected, block-diagonal subspaces of maximally mixed states, which consist of many-body spin states sharing the same symmetry. A key result is the identification of the underlying symmetry in the HSF, where conserved quantities in each subspace are defined by the consecutive double excitation addressing operator. Moreover, we show explicitly that the number of the fragmented Hilbert space grows exponentially with the chain length, following a modified Fibonacci sequence. Our work provides insights into many-body dynamics under dynamical constraints and opens avenues for controlling and manipulating HSF in Rydberg atom systems.</p>

Using the system-path entanglement framework, analytical expressions for all three quantities are derived for two- and three-slit interferometric setups.

We find that amplitude damping redistributes coherence and population imbalance without violating complementarity, while phase damping reduces coherence but leaves predictability unchanged. These results demonstrate that the complementarity relation remains preserved even in open quantum systems, highlighting its robustness against decoherence and providing a unified analytical understanding of noisy quantum interferometry in low-dimensional systems.</p>

            <p>Modern precision measurements, such as interferometry for detecting gravitational waves, rely on the estimation of optical phases encoded in light fields. Here, we propose to exploit the collectively enhanced output field of a driven-dissipative many-body open quantum system as a light source in order to improve the precision of estimating optical phases. Pronounced temporal correlations of such output fields benefit the sensitivity of measurement protocols, which we show theoretically by employing a boundary time crystal as a light source. The fundamental bound on the precision of such estimation shows scaling with system size that surpasses the Heisenberg limit and obeys the standard quantum limit in the measurement time. This scaling can be partially harnessed by a protocol, in which the phase shifted light field is guided into an auxiliary replica system, which serves as a detector that is sensitive to non-trivial temporal correlations of the light.</p>

            <p>The limited number of qubits per chip remains a critical bottleneck in quantum computing, motivating the use of distributed architectures that interconnect multiple quantum processing units (QPUs). However, executing quantum algorithms across distributed systems requires careful co-design of algorithmic primitives and hardware architectures to manage circuit depth and entanglement overhead. We identify multivariate trace estimation as a key subroutine that is naturally suited for distribution, and broadly useful in tasks such as estimating Rényi entropies, virtual cooling and distillation, and certain applications of quantum signal processing. In this work, we introduce COMPAS, an architecture that realizes multivariate trace estimation across a multi-party network of interconnected modular and distributed QPUs by leveraging pre-shared entangled Bell pairs as resources. COMPAS adds only a constant depth overhead and consumes Bell pairs at a rate linear in circuit width, making it suitable for near-term hardware. Unlike other schemes, which must choose between asymptotic optimality in circuit depth or GHZ width, COMPAS achieves both at once. Additionally, we analyze network-level errors and simulate the effects of circuit-level noise on the architecture.</p>

            <p>Out-of-equilibrium dynamics of non-integrable Hamiltonian many-body quantum systems are characterized by highly entangled wave functions. Near-maximal entanglement arises in systems exhibiting thermalization or pre-thermalization, where the system converges to a steady state with a fixed energy density. Classical simulation of the time dependence of such wave functions requires exponential resources. However, typical computations aim to estimate expectation values of local operators and correlation functions to some expected precision. For thermalizing systems at sufficiently high energy densities, such computations do not require storing the full wave function. Nonetheless, constructing classical algorithms for intermediate energy densities has remained a challenge. In this paper, we propose a heuristic approach to accelerate the convergence of Matrix Product State (MPS) simulations of expectation values applicable in a broad range of energy densities. We estimate the desired observables by rescaling the MPS results at low bond dimensions with a factor that depends only on the fidelity of the MPS wave function. Using this technique, we simulated the dynamics of the two-dimensional Transverse-Field Ising Model (TFIM) on a $7\times8$ grid with periodic boundary conditions, using a maximum bond dimension of $\chi = 4096$ on a single A100 GPU. We compared our results to similar TFIM simulations on a digital quantum processor.</p>

Here we give a remarkably simple construction of this channel, making its known properties -- and several new ones -- immediately transparent. In particular, we show that the channel also purifies non-i.i.d. states: it transforms any permutationally symmetric state into a uniform convex combination of permutationally symmetric purifications, each differing only by a tensor-product unitary acting on the purifying system. We then apply the channel to give a one-line proof of (a stronger version of) the recently established Uhlmann's theorem for quantum divergences.</p>

            <h2>Spectral analysis of the Koopman operator recovers Hamiltonian parameters in open quantum systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jorge E. Pérez-García, Carlos Colchero, Julio C. Gutiérrez-Vega</p>
            <p>An accurate identification of Hamiltonian parameters is essential for modeling and control of open quantum systems. In this work, a novel data-driven method for inferring such parameters from first-moment dynamics is presented using an open 2D quantum harmonic oscillator as an example. The method relies on the discrete spectrum of the Koopman operator to obtain such parameters, which is obtained using the multichannel Hankel Alternative View of Koopman (mHAVOK) algorithm; a theoretical connection of such affirmation is presented. The method is tested on the expected value of noiseless quadratures, retrieving oscillation frequencies, damping rates, nonlinear Kerr shifts, qubit-photon coupling strengths of a Jaynes-Cummings interaction, and a modulated frequency of a time-dependent Hamiltonian. The majority of the recovered parameters remained within 5% of their true values. When compared to Fourier and matrix-pencil estimators, our approach yields lower errors for dynamics with strong dissipation. Overall, these findings suggest that Koopman operator theory provides a practical framework for studying quantum dynamical systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hassan ZivariFard, Rémi A. Chou, Xiaodong Wang</p>
            <p>We study covert communication and covert secret key generation with positive rates over quantum state-dependent channels. Specifically, we consider fully quantum state-dependent channels when the transmitter shares an entangled state with the channel. We study this problem setting under two security metrics. For the first security metric, the transmitter aims to communicate covertly with the receiver while simultaneously generating a covert secret key, and for the second security metric, the transmitter aims to transmit a secure message covertly and generate a covert secret key with the receiver simultaneously. Our main results include one-shot and asymptotic achievable positive covert-secret key rate pairs for both security metrics. Our results recover as a special case the best-known results for covert communication over state-dependent classical channels. To the best of our knowledge, our results are the first instance of achieving a positive rate for covert secret key generation and the first instance of achieving a positive covert rate over a quantum channel. Additionally, we show that our results are optimal when the channel is classical and the state is available non-causally at both the transmitter and the receiver.</p>

            <p>The rapid deployment of AI models necessitates robust, quantum-resistant security, particularly against adversarial threats. Here, we present a novel integration of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) and zero trust architecture (ZTA), formally grounded in category theory, to secure AI model access. Our framework uniquely models cryptographic workflows as morphisms and trust policies as functors, enabling fine-grained, adaptive trust and micro-segmentation for lattice-based PQC primitives. This approach offers enhanced protection against adversarial AI threats. We demonstrate its efficacy through a concrete ESP32-based implementation, validating a crypto-agile transition with quantifiable performance and security improvements, underpinned by categorical proofs for AI security. The implementation achieves significant memory efficiency on ESP32, with the agent utilizing 91.86% and the broker 97.88% of free heap after cryptographic operations, and successfully rejects 100% of unauthorized access attempts with sub-millisecond average latency.</p>

            <p>We argue that the presence of \emph{any} exact $U(1)$ higher-form symmetry, under mild assumptions, presents a fundamental obstruction to ergodicity under unitary dynamics in lattice systems with local interactions and finite on-site Hilbert space dimension. Focusing on the two-dimensional case, we show that such systems necessarily exhibit Hilbert space fragmentation and explicitly construct Krylov sectors whose number scales exponentially with system size. While these sectors cannot be distinguished by symmetry quantum numbers, we identify the emergent integrals of motion which characterize them. Our symmetry-based approach is insensitive to details of the Hamiltonian and the lattice, providing a systematic explanation for ergodicity-breaking in a range of systems, including quantum link models.</p>

The first is the exceptional point (EP), corresponding to a higher-order pole of the retarded Green's function. Such EPs lead to algebraic corrections in the decay of quasiparticle occupations and are observable through time-resolved angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (Tr-ARPES). The second is a spectral cusp, defined by the coalescence of three extrema in the real-frequency spectral function $A(\mathbf{k}, \omega)$. This cusp enforces the formation of Fermi arcs and induces a "threading" structure in the nearby band structure, both of which are directly observable in ARPES.</p>

            <h2>Zoo of Correlation Inequalities in Holography and Beyond</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kyan Louisia, Takato Mori, Herbie Warner</p>
            <p>We study information-theoretic inequalities for holographic correlation measures $J_W$ and $D_W$, establishing rigorous topological frameworks that prove monotonicity, monogamy, and strong superadditivity. While earlier work proposed bulk duals of classical correlation and quantum discord, their information-theoretic properties were unclear. We derive multiple inequalities involving entanglement wedge cross sections (EWCS) and show that monotonicity holds for both measured and unmeasured parties in $J_W$ and for the unmeasured party in $D_W$. Unlike their original counterparts, we find that $J_W$ is monogamous for both parties and obeys one-way strong superadditivity, whereas $D_W$ is polygamous for the unmeasured party in pure tripartite states. These results highlight distinctive features of holographic states and support a conjectured duality between $J_W$ and distillable entanglement. Motivated by the relation between EWCS and reflected entropy, we introduce boundary analogues $J_R$ and $D_R$, which serve as computable proxies for classical and quantum correlations without optimization. We analyze their inequalities, proving several and presenting counterexamples. Overall, we provide a systematic "zoo" of correlation inequalities in and beyond holography, clarifying connections among bulk geometry, discord-type correlations, and distillable entanglement.</p>

            <p>Escalating cyber threats and the high-dimensional complexity of IoT traffic have outpaced classical anomaly detection methods. While deep learning offers improvements, computational bottlenecks limit real-time deployment at scale.

Evaluated on three datasets, our approach achieves improved accuracy on ideal simulators and on the IBM Quantum hardware demonstrating practical quantum advantage on current NISQ devices. Crucially, moderate depolarizing noise acts as implicit regularization, stabilizing training and enhancing generalization.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shreyas Sadugol, Giuseppe Luca Celardo, Fausto Borgonovi, Lev Kaplan</p>
            <p>While for non-relativistic short-range interactions, the spread of information is local, remaining confined in an effective light cone, long-range interactions can generate either nonlocal (faster-than-ballistic) or local (ballistic) spread of correlations depending on the initial conditions. This makes long-range interactions a rich platform for controlling the spread of information. Here, we derive an effective Hamiltonian analytically and identify the specific interaction term that drives nonlocality in a wide class of long-range spin chains. This allows us to understand the conditions for the emergence of local behavior in the presence of nonlocal interactions and to identify a regime where the causal space-time landscape can be precisely designed. Indeed, we show that for large long-range interaction strength or large system size, initial conditions can be chosen in a way that allows a local perturbation to generate nonlocal signals at programmable distant positions, which then propagate within effective light cones. The possibility of engineering the emergence of nonlocal Lieb-Robinson-like light cones allows one to shape the causal landscape of long-range interacting systems, with direct applications to quantum information processing devices, quantum memories, error correction, and information transport in programmable quantum simulators.</p>

We show agreement in Poincaré AdS, for generic boundary points in global AdS, and also for the BTZ solution, in which the timelike segment probes behind the horizon.

            <p>We study the properties of a generalized Dicke-Ising model realized with an array of Rydberg atoms, driven by microwave electric fields and coupled to an optical cavity. As this platform allows for a precisely tunable anisotropy parameter, the model exhibits a rich landscape of phase transitions and critical phenomena, induced by the interplay of rotating-wave, counter-rotating-wave, and Ising interactions. We develop an improved quantum Monte Carlo algorithm based on the stochastic series expansion that explicitly tracks the Fock state of the quantum cavity. In the superradiant (SR) phase, this allows us to determine, through data collapse, the scaling laws of the photon number. We also demonstrate the vanishing of parity symmetry in finite-size simulations and show that the Rydberg blockade leads to a significant suppression of cavity occupation. Notably, stronger quantum fluctuations induced by the counter-rotating wave terms slightly favor the superradiant solid (SRS) phase over the Solid-1/2 state. Finally, we confirm that the SR phase transition and the transition from the Solid-1/2 to the SRS are second-order. In contrast, the transitions from the Solid-1/2 or SRS to the SR phase are both first-order for any value of the normalized anisotropy parameter.</p>

            <h2>Twisted (co)homology of non-orientable Weyl semimetals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thijs Douwes, Marcus Stålhammar</p>
            <p>The quasi-particle excitations in Weyl semimetals, known as Weyl fermions, are usually forced to emerge in charge-conjugate pairs by the Nielsen--Ninomiya theorem. When the Brillouin zone is non-orientable, this constraint is replaced by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ charge cancellation, as a result of the chirality becoming ill-defined on such manifolds; this results in configurations with seemingly non-zero total chirality. Here, we set out to explain this behaviour from a purely topological perspective, and provide a classification of non-orientable Weyl semimetal topology in terms of exact sequences of twisted (co)homology groups. This leads to several discoveries of direct physical importance: in particular, we recover the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ charge cancellation in a coordinate-independent way, allowing meaningful limits to be set on its physical interpretation. A detailed discussion is provided on a specific Klein bottle-like topology induced by a momentum-space glide symmetry, including a full review of the insulating and semimetallic invariants of the system and a classification of the surface states on the non-orientable boundary. Beyond this, we provide a complete survey of all possible non-orientable Brillouin zones and their associated invariants, and extend our formalism into the realm of non-Hermitian topological physics and inversion-symmetric Weyl semimetals. Our work exemplifies the vast potential of fundamental mathematical descriptions to not only aid the corresponding physical intuition, but also predict novel and hitherto overlooked phenomena of great relevance throughout the physics research forefront.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kinnari Dave, Louis Lemonnier, Romain Péchoux, Vladimir Zamdzhiev</p>
            <p>The two main notions of control in quantum programming languages are often referred to as "quantum" control and "classical" control. With the latter, the control flow is based on classical information, potentially resulting from a quantum measurement, and this paradigm is well-suited to mixed state quantum computation. Whereas with quantum control, we are primarily focused on pure quantum computation and there the "control" is based on superposition. The two paradigms have not mixed well traditionally and they are almost always treated separately. In this work, we show that the paradigms may be combined within the same system. The key ingredients for achieving this are: (1) syntactically: a modality for incorporating pure quantum types into a mixed state quantum type system; (2) operationally: an adaptation of the notion of "quantum configuration" from quantum lambda-calculi, where the quantum data is replaced with pure quantum primitives; (3) denotationally: suitable (sub)categories of Hilbert spaces, for pure computation and von Neumann algebras, for mixed state computation in the Heisenberg picture of quantum mechanics.</p>

            <p>The Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) successfully predicts the density of topological defects deposited by the phase transitions, but it is not clear why. Its key conjecture is that, near the critical point of the second-order phase transition, critical slowing down will result in a period when the system is too sluggish to follow the potential that is changing faster than its reaction time. The correlation length at the freeze-out instant $\hat t$ when the order parameter catches up with the post-transition broken symmetry configuration is then decisive, determining when the mosaic of broken symmetry domains locks in topological defects. To understand why the KZM works so well we analyze Landau-Ginzburg model and show why temporal evolution of the order parameter plays such a key role. The analytical solutions we obtain suggest novel, hitherto unexplored, experimentally accessible observables that can shed light on symmetry breaking dynamics while testing the conjecture on which the KZM is based.</p>

            <p>Infinite projected entangled-pair states (iPEPS) provide a powerful tensor network ansatz for two-dimensional quantum many-body systems in the thermodynamic limit. In this paper we introduce an approach to accurately compute the energy variance of an iPEPS, enabling systematic extrapolations of the ground-state energy to the exact zero-variance limit. It is based on the contraction of a large cell of tensors using the corner transfer matrix renormalization group (CTRMG) method, to evaluate the correlator between pairs of local Hamiltonian terms. We show that the accuracy of this approach is substantially higher than that of previous methods, and we demonstrate the usefulness of variance extrapolation for the Heisenberg model, for a free fermionic model, and for the Shastry-Sutherland model. Finally, we apply the approach to compute $\langle \langle \mathcal{L}^\dagger \mathcal{L} \rangle \rangle$ for an open quantum system described by the Liouvillian $\mathcal{L}$, in order to assess the quality of the steady-state solution and to locate first-order phase transitions, using the dissipative quantum Ising model as an example.</p>

            <p>Entangled photons are fundamental resources for quantum communication, computing, and networking. Among them, polarization-entangled photon pairs play an important role due to their straightforward state manipulation and direct use in quantum key distribution, teleportation, and network protocols. However, realizing compact, efficient, and scalable polarization-entangled sources that meet the requirements of practical deployment remains a major challenge. Here, we present a simple yet high-performance on-chip polarization-entangled photon-pair source on thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN). Our device employs dual quasi-phase matching (D-QPM) that sequentially supports type-0 and type-I spontaneous parametric down-conversion in a single nanophotonic waveguide, eliminating the need for interferometers, polarization rotators, or other complex circuits. The source directly produces high-fidelity Bell states with broad bandwidth, high brightness, and low noise. Using this integrated platform, we realize wavelength-multiplexed entanglement distribution in a four-user quantum network deployed over metropolitan fiber links up to 50 km.

The operations are interpreted as certain affine relations over finite fields. This offers a conceptually motivated and computationally-tractable alternative to the standard operator-algebraic semantics of quantum programs (whose time complexity grows exponentially as the state space increases in size). We demonstrate the power of the resulting semantics by describing a small, proof-of-concept assembly language for stabiliser programs with fully-abstract denotational semantics.</p>

            <p>While Kronecker coefficients $g(\lambda,\mu,\nu)$ with bounded rows are polynomial-time computable via lattice-point methods, no explicit closed-form formulas have been obtained for genuinely three-row cases in the 87 years since Murnaghan's foundational work. This paper provides such formulas for the first time and identifies a universal structural boundary at parameter value 5 where elementary combinatorial patterns collapse. We analyze two independent families of genuinely three-row coefficients and establish that for $k \leq 4$, the formulas exhibit elementary structure: oscillation bounds follow the triangular-Hogben pattern, and polynomial expressions factor completely over $\mathbb{Z}$. At the critical threshold $k=5$, this structure collapses: the triangular pattern fails, and algebraic obstructions -- irreducible quadratic factors with negative discriminant -- emerge. We develop integer forcing, a proof technique exploiting the tension between continuous asymptotics and discrete integrality. As concrete results, we prove that $g((n,n,1)^3) = 2 - (n \mod 2)$ for all $n \geq 3$ -- the first explicit formula for a genuinely three-row Kronecker coefficient -- derive five explicit polynomial formulas for staircase-hook coefficients, and verify Saxl's conjecture for 132 three-row partitions.</p>

            <p>We consider the three-spin Ising model to study the effect of three-spin interacting term on bi-partitie entanglement between adjacent spins. The three-dominated disordered region has tri-partite entanglement causing a vanishingly small concurrence, while it acquires maximum value around the critical points. Considering the above model as an environment, we construct a generalized central spin model where two central spins, initially in an unentangled pure state, are coupled locally to two distinct sites of the environmental spin chain. We study the generation of mixed state entanglement between the central spins when the transverse field of the environment is kept fixed, and suddenly quenched, referring to equilibrium and non-equilibrium dynamics of the central spins, respectively. For the critical environment in the equilibrium, the concurrence shows a dip-revival structure governed by quasi-particle movement. In the non-equilibrium study, we find an initial growth of concurrence followed by a two-stage fall for the inter-phase quench which is governed by dynamic decoherence channels. The central spins are maximally entangled for a quench in the vicinity of a multicritical point, which arises due to three-spin interaction only. The concurrence becomes long-lived for an intra-phase quench, and this sustainability depends on the strength of the three-spin interaction. Therefore, the three-spin interaction indeed helps in generating bi-partite entanglement in the central spins.</p>

Compared to superconducting platforms, spin qubits can operate at higher temperatures from tens of millikelvin up to a few kelvin. However, recent experiments show a non-trivial and often non-monotonic dependence of the spin qubit frequency on the temperature, featuring a region of decreased sensitivity to temperature fluctuations. In this work, we aim to gain insight into the physics behind such temperature shifts in the low-temperature limit. Investigating the spin qubits' interaction with phonon modes of the host material, we can explain some of the key features of the observed behavior and estimate the temperature sweet spot for the qubit frequency shift.</p>

            <p>The response of a MoRe-based superconducting resonator operating near 5 K to pulsed infrared irradiation is investigated, and the underlying physical mechanisms are analyzed. The device exhibits a pronounced nonlinear response dominated by nonequilibrium quasiparticle dynamics rather than uniform thermal heating. Infrared pulses produce strong distortions of the resonance curve and a transient decrease in the resonance frequency, consistent with increased kinetic inductance caused by quasiparticle generation. The frequency shift scales approximately linearly with absorbed power, whereas the dissipation response saturates at higher powers, indicating the formation of a nonequilibrium steady-state quasiparticle population. These observations demonstrate a transition from a linear pair-breaking regime to a saturated dissipation regime, likely associated with a quasiparticle relaxation bottleneck or partial suppression of the smaller superconducting gap in MoRe. The results highlight the relevance of nonequilibrium processes in MoRe and confirm its potential for microwave kinetic-inductance detector applications.</p>

            <p>The Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) was developed as a framework for understanding how the principles of statistical mechanics emerge in the long-time limit of isolated quantum many-body systems. Since then, ETH has shifted the attention towards the study of matrix elements of physical observables in the energy eigenbasis. In this work, we revisit recent developments leading to the formulation of full ETH, a generalization of the original ETH ansatz that accounts for multi-point correlation functions. Using tools from free probability, we explore the implications of local rotational invariance, a property that emerges from the statistical invariance of observables under random basis transformations induced by small perturbations of the Hamiltonian. This approach allows us to make quantitative predictions and derive an analytical characterization of subleading corrections to matrix-element correlations, thereby refining the ETH ansatz. Moreover, our analysis links the statistical properties of matrix elements under random basis changes to the empirical averages over energy windows that are usually considered when dealing with a single instance of the ensemble. We validate our analytical predictions through comparison with numerical simulations in non-integrable Floquet systems.</p>

In this letter, we propose an efficient dynamical scheme to discern such long-lived excitations. Employing a Floquet-Lindblad framework, we explore how periodic driving reshapes the key features of a paradigmatic topological model, namely a Creutz ladder. Our results bear testimony to a drive-induced unipolar-bipolar transition in the Liouvillian skin effect, which gets dynamically manifested as a chiral-helical damping crossover. Such a transition effectively rescales the bulk localization length, giving rise to a polarization drift that we identify as a new invariant for efficient diagnosis of the nontrivial phases. As the transition becomes more gradual via tuning drive-rescaled parameters, we uncover signatures of a scale-free localization where skin and extended modes co-exist with distinct decay rates. The emergent hierarchy of the decay rates yields two disparate timescales: a chiral wavefront that rapidly empties the bulk followed by a long-lived regime dominated by robust edge modes. Overall, our results provide convincing evidence that periodic driving serves as a powerful handle to manipulate dissipative topological phases and dynamically isolate the boundary modes.</p>

            <p>Non-classical states of light play a fundamental role in quantum technology. From photonic quantum computers and simulators, to quantum communication and sensing, quantum states of light enable performing tasks that may outperform their best classical counterparts. Semiconductor quantum dots embedded in photonic nanostructures offer the most advanced classes of quantum light sources. Importantly, the underlying physics processes determining device performance are today fully understood, and dedicated engineering projects are currently advancing these sources towards real-world quantum technology applications. We review the performance of deterministic single-photon sources based on quantum dots in photonic crystal waveguides, the approach with the highest performance specs since it intrinsically combines suppression of leaky modes and Purcell enhancement to slow-light waveguide mode. Furthermore, we present prototype data from sources that today are commercially available and with performance metrics approaching the ideal.</p>

            <p>We report the construction and characterization of an experimental setup for producing a cold gas of $^{40}$Ca atoms and excite them to high Rydberg states with a resonant three-photon-excitation scheme. The apparatus comprises four stages, each designed in-house. An oven heated to $\sim 500^\circ$C generates an atomic beam that is collimated by a capillary stack. The beam is sent into a passive, permanent-magnet-based Zeeman slower that reduces the atomic velocity to $30$ m/s. The slow atoms are captured in a magneto-optical trap (MOT) and cooled to $1.0(3)$ mK with a trapping time of $16(2)$ ms. Ground-state atoms in the cold gas are excited to high Rydberg states via resonant excitation through the intermediate $4s4p\, ^1P_1$ and $4s4d\, ^1D_2$ states. The MOT is operated at the center of an electrode stack, which serves to apply continuous and pulsed electric fields and field-ionize the Rydberg atoms for detection. We benchmark our MOT against previous implementations and find its performance consistent with state-of-the-art results in terms of temperature and trapping lifetime. Finally, we demonstrate Rydberg spectroscopy of calcium, confirming the system's suitability for ultracold Rydberg physics experiments.</p>

            <p>Pauli's exclusion principle forces fermions to occupy distinct quantum states, creating a filled region of momentum space at low temperature, the Fermi sea, whose topology governs the system's response to perturbations and the nature of its correlation functions. Recent theory predicts that for non-interacting fermions, the Euler characteristic of a $D$-dimensional Fermi sea -- the topological invariant that describes its shape -- is encoded in its ($D$+1)-point density correlations. Here we experimentally demonstrate this connection in a two-dimensional degenerate gas of neutral $^{6}$Li atoms using single-atom-resolved imaging. By measuring three- and four-point connected density correlations in real space, we directly extract topological invariants of the underlying Fermi sea, including the Euler characteristic. Our results are in remarkable agreement with ideal-gas predictions, despite the presence of sizeable interactions, and establish a new pathway for probing many-body topology through correlation measurements.</p>

            <p>We discuss some entanglement features associated with cubic non-Gaussian perturbations in single-field inflationary scenarios. We adopt standard momentum-space techniques to show how multipartite entanglement arises for inflationary perturbation modes, focusing on the dynamics of the comoving curvature perturbation. In particular, we quantify entanglement generation via the recently proposed Entanglement Distance, which introduces a geometric interpretation of quantum correlations in terms of the Fubini-Study metric. In the continuum limit, we show that the Entanglement Distance arising from displacement transformations is proportional to the total number of excitations in the quantum state for cubic perturbations, thus providing an upper bound on the von Neumann entanglement entropy of any reduced state compatible with such excitations. Within the interaction picture, we further observe that the quantum correlations arising from cubic gravitational interactions are typically much larger than the standard squeezing contribution, in agreement with previous studies focusing on von Neumann entropy generation across the Hubble horizon. We further show how the inflationary parameters affect the total amount of such correlations, highlighting in particular their dependence on the inflationary energy scales and the number of e-foldings during slow-roll.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Private Distributed Matrix Multiplication With Degree Tables</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohamed Nomeir, Alptug Aytekin, Lei Hu, Sennur Ulukus</p>
            <p>In this paper, we explore how quantum resources can be used to increase the rate of private distributed matrix multiplication (PDMM). In PDMM, a user who has two high-dimensional matrices, $A$ and $B$, and lacks the computational capabilities to apply matrix multiplication locally, divides the matrices $A$ and $B$ into $K$ and $L$ sub-blocks, respectively. Then, the user sends them to $N$ servers to apply the required multiplication privately from any $T$ servers. The goal is to reduce the number of servers needed to perform the required matrix multiplication. In the quantum setting, we allow the servers to share an entangled state and respond over quantum channels. Upon receiving the qudits, the user applies measurements to obtain the required multiplication. There are two main regimes in the PDMM literature: The high-privacy regime and the low-privacy regime where $T$ is less than $K$ and $L$. First, in the high-privacy regime, the state-of-the-art classical code is called the gap additive secure polynomial (GASP) code. We define a feasibility requirement in the quantum setting for the GASP code such that the highest performance is achieved when it is satisfied. When it is not satisfied, we address two main concerns. The first is to find a relation between the minimum privacy requirement and the dimensions of the two matrices needed for the feasibility condition to be satisfied. Second, we develop a new family of codes that can work in the quantum setting. Second, since GASP does not work efficiently in the low-privacy regimes compared to cyclic-addition degree tables (CAT) and discretely optimized GASP (DOG), we show that the feasibility condition developed for GASP can be adopted for both CAT and DOG codes as well. In addition, we propose another set of codes that can be used in the low privacy regime in the quantum setting when the feasibility requirement is not satisfied.</p>

            <h2>Arbitrary control of the temporal waveform of photons during spontaneous emission</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Carl Thomas, Rebecca Munk, Boris Blinov</p>
            <p>Control of the temporal waveform and Fock state statistics of photons produced during spontaneous emission from single quantum emitters provides a crucial tool in the establishment of hybrid quantum systems, optimal state transfer and interferometric stability of network architectures based on flying qubits. We describe a method to generate photons of any temporal waveform from emitters of any lifetime. Our broadly applicable approach has only two requirements for a candidate qudit: (1) control of the phase-parity and (2) modulation of the amplitude of a field coupling a ground state to an excited manifold which produces a photon during relaxation. We detail how to find optimal excitation pulse shapes, both numerically and experimentally, by employing variational algorithms to feedback on atomic populations. Additionally, we develop Quantum Monte Carlo based tools to determine emission statistics and establish techniques for optimal post-selection to ensure maximum fidelity of photon generation protocols. We situate our work in the context of other prior research on bespoke single photon sources and networking including post-emission pulse shaping, temporal gating and cavity-based methods. In comparison, our free-space process has greater flexibility in producing any waveform, requires less infrastructure and can be readily applied across a wide domain of emitters of any frequency or lifetime. We demonstrate temporal waveform shaping in $^{174}$Yb$^+$ trapped ions. Using feedforward validation of photon waveforms, we estimate an achievable process fidelity of at least $\approx$0.996.</p>

            <p>Optimization of constrained quantum control problems powers quantum technologies. This task becomes very difficult when these control problems are nonconvex and plagued with dense local extrema. For such problems current optimization methods must be repeated many times to find good solutions, each time requiring many simulations of the system. Here, we present quantum control via polynomial optimization (QCPOP), a method that eliminates this problem by directly finding globally optimal solutions. The resulting increase in speed, which can be a thousandfold or more, makes it possible to solve problems that were previously intractable. This remarkable advance is due to global optimization methods recently developed for polynomial functions. We demonstrate the power of this method by showing that it obtains an optimal solution in a single run for a problem in which local extrema are so dense that gradient methods require thousands of runs to reach a similar fidelity. Since QCPOP is able to find the global optimum for quantum control, we expect that it will not only enhance the utility of quantum control by making it much easier to find the necessary protocols, but also provide a key tool for understanding the precise limits of quantum technologies. Finally, we note that the ability to cast quantum control as polynomial optimization resolves an open question regarding the computability of exact solutions to quantum control problems.</p>

            <p>Parity compilation is the challenge of laying out the required constraints for the parity mapping in a local way. We present the first constructive compilation algorithm for the parity architecture using plaquettes for arbitrary higher-order optimization problems. This enables adiabatic protocols, where the plaquette layout can natively be implemented, as well as fully parallelized digital circuits. The algorithm builds a rectangular layout of plaquettes, where in each layer of the rectangle at least one constraint is added. The core idea is that each constraint, consisting of any qubits on the boundary of the rectangle and some new qubits, can be decomposed into plaquettes with a deterministic procedure using ancillas. We show how to pick a valid set of constraints and how this decomposition works. We further give ways to optimize the ancilla count and show how to implement optimization problems with additional constraints.</p>

The parity architecture can be understood as an LDPC code tailored specifically to obtain any desired logical connectivity from nearest-neighbor physical interactions. The code layout can be dynamically adjusted to algorithmic requirements on-the-fly. This allows for implementations with any desired code distance with a universal set of fault-tolerant gates. In addition to the previously explored tool-sets for concatenated cat codes, our approach features parallelizable interactions between arbitrary sets of qubits by directly addressing the parity qubits in the code. The proposed scheme enables codes with less physical qubit overhead compared to the repetition code with the same code distances, while requiring only weight-3 and weight-4 stabilizers and nearest-neighbor 2D square-lattice connectivity.</p>

            <p>We explore the potential of levitating solids embedded with non-permanent, optically controllable electron spins, which can be used to hyperpolarize their nuclear spin environment with exceptionally long lifetimes. For example, pentacene-doped naphthalene, which will also serve as our prime example, can achieve bulk polarization exceeding $80\,\%$ at cryogenic temperatures with polarization lifetimes extending over weeks. These materials make a compelling case for applications such as matter-wave interferometry and novel uses of established NMR techniques. In that spirit, we design a multi-spin Stern-Gerlach-type interferometry protocol which, thanks to the homogeneous spin distribution and the absence of a preferential nuclear-spin quantization axis in such materials, avoids many of the limitations associated with solid state crystals hosting electronic spin defects, such as nanodiamonds containing NV centers. We assess the potential of our interferometer to enhance existing bounds on the free parameters of objective collapse models. Beyond matter-wave interferometry, we analyze the prospects for implementing magic angle spinning at frequencies surpassing the current standard in NMR, capitalizing on the exceptional rotational capabilities offered by levitation. Additionally, we outline a novel protocol for measuring spin ensemble polarization via the position of the nanoparticle and conduct an analysis of dominant noise sources, benchmarking the required isolation levels for various applications.</p>

            <h2>Anti-Concentration for the Unitary Haar Measure and Applications to Random Quantum Circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bill Fefferman, Soumik Ghosh, Wei Zhan</p>
            <p>We prove a Carbery-Wright style anti-concentration inequality for the unitary Haar measure, by showing that the probability of a polynomial in the entries of a random unitary falling into an $\varepsilon$ range is at most a polynomial in $\varepsilon$. Using it, we show that the scrambling speed of a random quantum circuit is lower bounded: Namely, every input qubit has an influence that is at least inverse exponential in depth, on any output qubit touched by its lightcone. Our result on scrambling speed works with high probability over the choice of a circuit from an ensemble, as opposed to just working in expectation. As an application, we give the first polynomial-time algorithm for learning log-depth random quantum circuits with Haar random gates up to polynomially small diamond distance, given oracle access to the circuit. Other applications of this new scrambling speed lower bound include: $\bullet$ An optimal $\Omega(\log \varepsilon^{-1})$ depth lower bound for $\varepsilon$-approximate unitary designs on any circuit architecture; $\bullet$ A polynomial-time quantum algorithm that computes the depth of a bounded-depth circuit, given oracle access to the circuit. Our learning and depth-testing algorithms apply to architectures defined over any geometric dimension, and can be generalized to a wide class of architectures with good lightcone properties.</p>

            <p>As quantum processing units (QPUs) scale toward hundreds of qubits, diagnosing noise-induced correlations (crosstalk) becomes critical for reliable quantum computation. In this work, we introduce Zero-Entropy Classical Shadows (ZECS), a diagnostic tool that uses information of a rank-one quantum state tomography (QST) reconstruction from classical shadow (CS) information to make a crosstalk diagnosis. We use ZECS on trapped ion and superconductive QPUs, including ionq_forte (36 qubits), ibm_brisbane (127 qubits), and ibm_fez (156 qubits), using from 1,000 to 6,000 samples. With these samples, we use the ZECS to characterize crosstalk among disjoint qubit subsets across the full hardware. This information is then used to select low-crosstalk qubit subsets on ibm_fez for executing the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) on a 20-qubit problem. Compared to the best qubit selection via Qiskit transpilation, our method improves solution quality by 10% and increases algorithmic coherence by 33%. ZECS offers a scalable and measurement-efficient approach to diagnosing crosstalk in large-scale QPUs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xuanhua Wang, Jie Su, Jin Wang</p>
            <p>Anomalous thermalization, particularly the crossings of temperature trajectories from different initial states termed Mpemba crossings (MPCs), have intrigued scientists for decades. While recent studies in quantum systems suggest that initial conditions play a decisive role in its emergence, they offer limited insight into MPCs in complex, highly nonequilibrium systems. In this study, we investigate temperature dynamics in the strongly coupled, quantum chaotic Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, which is dual to the low-energy dynamics of 2D dilaton gravity. Our findings reveal a dynamically driven nonequilibrium mechanism underlying MPCs during rapid thermalization, with implications for gravitational systems. We explore quench dynamics in SYK systems under three conditions: coupling to a single SYK thermal bath, coupling to two thermal baths at different temperatures, and dissipative SYKs modeled by the Lindblad equation. We find that strong system-bath coupling induces oscillating effective temperatures and trajectory crossings in transient states due to nonequilibrium statistics, phenomena absent in quasi-static thermodynamics and Lindbladian SYKs. These MPCs highlight a unique feature of anomalous thermalization of strongly coupled quantum chaotic systems driven far from equilibrium. Besides, the results also provide qualitative insights into the nonequilibrium thermodynamics of black holes strongly interacting with their environment, such as primordial black holes in the early universe.</p>

A versatile tool for such a task is one that scales well with the size of the system and which can be both easily computed and measured. In this work we focus on graph states, that are promising platforms for quantum computation, simulation and metrology. We consider four topologies, namely the star graph states with edges, Turán graphs, $r$-ary tree graphs, and square grid cluster states, and provide a method to characterise their quantum content: the many-body Bell correlations, non-separability and entanglement depth for an arbitrary number of qubits. We also relate the strength of these many-body correlations to the usefulness of graph states for quantum sensing. Finally, we characterize many-body entanglement depth in graph states with up to $8$ qubits in $146$ classes non-equivalent under local transformations and graph isomorphisms. The technique presented is simple and does not make any assumptions about the multi-qubit state, so it could find applications wherever precise knowledge of many-body quantum correlations is required.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marco Erba, Paolo Perinotti</p>
            <p>Quantum theory provides a significant example of two intermingling hallmarks of science: the ability to consistently combine physical systems and study them compositely; and the power to extract predictions in the form of correlations. A striking consequence of this facet is the violation of Bell inequalities, which has been experimentally demonstrated via Bell tests, thus attesting a classical/quantum divide. The prediction of this phenomenon originates as quantum systems are prescribed to combine according to the composition postulate, i.e., the tensor-product rule. This rule has also an operationally salient formulation -- rather than just a purely mathematical one -- given in terms of discriminability of composite states via local measurements. Yet, both the theoretical and the empirical status of such a postulate have been constantly challenged over the decades: is it possible to deduce it from the remaining postulates? Here, this long-standing problem is solved by answering in the negative. A family of operational theories is presented, differing from standard quantum theory solely in their system-composition rule, while, at the same time, being indistinguishable from it via Bell-like or more general correlation experiments. Quantum theory is thus established to embody genuinely more than quantum correlations. As a result, foundational programmes based on single-system principles only, or on mere Bell-like correlations, are operationally incomplete. On the experimental side, ascertaining the independence of postulates is a fundamental step to adjudicate between quantum theory and alternative physical theories: hence, the composition postulate calls for experimental scrutiny independently of the other features of quantum theory.</p>

            <p>Recent advances in quantum computing have brought us closer to realizing the potential of this transformative technology. While significant strides have been made in quantum error correction, many challenges persist, particularly in the realm of noise and scalability. Analogue quantum computing schemes, such as Analogue Hamiltonian Simulation and Quantum Annealing, offer a promising approach to address these limitations. By operating at a higher level of abstraction, these schemes can simplify the development of large-scale quantum algorithms. To fully harness the power of quantum computers, they must be seamlessly integrated with traditional high-performance computing (HPC) systems. While substantial research has focused on the integration of circuit-based quantum computers with HPC, the integration of analogue quantum computers remains relatively unexplored. This paper aims to bridge this gap by contributing in the following way: Comprehensive Survey: We conduct a comprehensive survey of existing quantum software tools with analogue capabilities. Readiness Assessment: We introduce a classification and rating system to assess the readiness of these tools for HPC integration. Gap Identification and Recommendations: We identify critical gaps in the landscape of analogue quantum programming models and propose actionable recommendations for future research and development.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lucas A. Ostrowski, Travis J. Baker, Dominic W. Berry, Howard M. Wiseman</p>
            <p>Recent advances in laser theory have demonstrated that a quantum enhancement is possible for the production of coherence $\mathfrak{C}$ by a continuous-wave laser device. Curiously, natural families of laser models that achieve Heisenberg-limited scaling for coherence produce the most coherence when the beam exhibits sub-Poissonian photon statistics. In this work, we provide an analytical treatment of those novel families of laser models by specializing to a parameter regime that permits a linearization. We characterize the dynamics of each laser system, and find that some of the intuitions from standard laser theory may be applied here. Specifically, the intracavity number dynamics are well-described as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, while the intracavity phase dynamics are well-described in terms of a physically realizable ensemble of pure states, which evolve according to pure phase diffusion. Unlike a standard laser, however, we find that the pure states comprising the ensemble in the Heisenberg-limited lasers are substantially phase squeezed. From our dynamical analysis, we deduce various quantities of the beam for each laser family, including the first- and second-order Glauber coherence functions, intensity noise spectrum, Mandel-Q parameter and coherence $\mathfrak{C}$. In addition, inspired from these phase diffusion dynamics, we derive an upper bound on laser coherence $\mathfrak{C} \lesssim 1.1156 \mu^4$ -- which is tighter by a factor of $3/8$ when compared to that derived in [Baker et al., Nat. Phys. 17 179 (2021)] -- by making one of the assumptions of that paper slightly stronger.</p>

So far, DICKA protocols largely fall into two categories: those that rely on violating a joint Bell inequality using genuinely multi-partite entangled states, and those that concatenate many bipartite protocols. The question of whether a hybrid protocol exists, where a multi-partite Bell inequality can be violated using only bipartite entanglement, was asked by Grasselli et al. in [Quantum 7, 980, (2023)]. We answer this question affirmatively, by constructing an asymptotically secure DICKA protocol achieving the same rate as the concatenation of bipartite device-independent quantum key distribution, yet relying on a single joint Bell violation. Our results prompt further discussion on the benefits of multi-partite entanglement for DICKA over its bipartite alternative, and we give an overview of different arguments for near-term devices.</p>

            <h2>Sub-second spin and lifetime-limited optical coherences in $^{171}$Yb$^{3+}$:CaWO$_4$</h2>

            <p>Optically addressable solid-state spins have been extensively studied for quantum technologies, offering unique advantages for quantum computing, communication, and sensing. Advancing these applications is generally limited by finding materials that simultaneously provide lifetime-limited optical and long spin coherences. Here, we introduce $^{171}$Yb$^{3+}$ ions doped into a CaWO$_4$ crystal. We perform high-resolution spectroscopy of the excited state, and demonstrate all-optical coherent control of the electron-nuclear spin ensemble. We find narrow inhomogeneous broadening of the optical transitions of 185 MHz and radiative-lifetime-limited coherence time up to 0.75~ms. Next to this, we measure a spin-transition ensemble line width of 5 kHz and electron-nuclear spin coherence time reaching 0.15~seconds at zero magnetic field between 50~mK and 1~K temperatures. These results demonstrate the potential of $^{171}$Yb$^{3+}$:CaWO$_4$ as a low-noise platform for building quantum technologies with ensemble-based memories, microwave-to-optical transducers, and optically addressable single-ion spin qubits.</p>

            <h2>Topological response in open quantum systems with weak symmetries</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ze-Min Huang, Sebastian Diehl, Xiao-Qi Sun</p>
            <p>In open quantum systems, the interaction of the system with its environment gives rise to two types of symmetry: a strong one, where the system's symmetry charge is conserved exactly, and a weak one, where the system can exchange symmetry charge with the environment but still preserve symmetry at the ensemble level. While generic open quantum systems feature weak symmetries only, the symmetry protected topological response for bosonic/spin systems has only been considered in the stricter setup with additional strong symmetries. Here, we address the generic case and demonstrate that weak symmetries alone can protect topological responses that distinguish different phases of matter. For bosonic systems, focusing on one-dimensional mixed states described by locally purifiable density operators, we propose a quantized response characterizing qualitatively distinct phases. It is detectable via the decay behavior of different string order parameters. We illustrate our general results through a noisy Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki model. In particular, we show that the coupling to the environment can induce a phase transition to a state protected by weak symmetries, without a pure-state or strong-symmetry analog.</p>

            <h2>A Survey of Quantum Transformers: Architectures, Challenges and Outlooks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hui Zhang, Qinglin Zhao, Mengchu Zhou, Li Feng, Dusit Niyato, Shenggen Zheng, Lin Chen</p>
            <p>Quantum Transformers integrate the representational power of classical Transformers with the computational advantages of quantum computing. Since 2022, research in this area has rapidly expanded, giving rise to diverse technical paradigms and early applications. To address the growing need for consolidation, this paper presents the first comprehensive, systematic, and in-depth survey of quantum Transformer models. First, we delineate the research scope, focusing on improving Transformer parts with quantum methods, and introduce foundational concepts in classical Transformers and quantum machine learning. Then we organize existing studies into two main paradigms: PQC-based and QLA-based, with PQC-based paradigm further divided into QKV-only Quantum Mapping, Quantum Pairwise Attention, Quantum Holistic Attention. and Quantum-Assisted Optimization, analyzing their core mechanisms and architectural traits. We also summarize empirical results that demonstrate preliminary quantum advantages, especially on small-scale tasks or resource-constrained settings. Following this, we examine key technical challenges, such as complexity-resource trade-offs, scalability and generalization limitations, and trainability issues including barren plateaus, and provide potential solutions, including quantumizing classical transformer variants with lower complexity, hybrid designs, and improved optimization strategies. Finally, we propose several promising future directions, e.g., scaling quantum modules into large architectures, applying quantum Transformers to domains with inherently quantum data (e.g., physics, chemistry), and developing theory-driven designs grounded in quantum information science. This survey will help researchers and practitioners quickly grasp the overall landscape of current quantum Transformer research and promote future developments in this emerging field.</p>

            <h2>Native-oxide-passivated trilayer junctions for superconducting qubits</h2>

            <p>Superconducting qubits in today's quantum processing units are typically fabricated with angle-evaporated aluminum--aluminum-oxide--aluminum Josephson junctions. However, there is an urgent need to overcome the limited reproducibility of this approach when scaling up the number of qubits and junctions. Fabrication methods based on subtractive patterning of superconductor--insulator--superconductor trilayers, used for more classical large-scale Josephson junction circuits, could provide the solution but they in turn often suffer from lossy dielectrics incompatible with high qubit coherence. In this work, we utilize native aluminum oxide as a sidewall passivation layer for junctions based on aluminum--aluminum-oxide--niobium trilayers, and use such junctions in qubits. We design the fabrication process such that the few-nanometer-thin native oxide is not exposed to oxide removal steps that could increase its defect density or hinder its ability to prevent shorting between the leads of the junction. With these junctions, we design and fabricate transmon-like qubits and measure time-averaged coherence times up to 30 $\mu$s at a qubit frequency of 5 GHz, corresponding to a qubit quality factor of one million. Our process uses subtractive patterning and optical lithography on wafer scale, enabling high throughput in patterning. This approach provides a scalable path toward fabrication of superconducting qubits on industry-standard platforms.</p>

            <h2>Semi-classical geometric tensor in multiparameter quantum information</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Satoya Imai, Jing Yang, Luca Pezzè</p>
            <p>The discrepancy between quantum distinguishability in Hilbert space and classical distinguishability in probability space is expressed by the gap between the quantum and classical Fisher information matrices (QFIM and CFIM, respectively). This intrinsic quantum obstruction is generally not saturable and plays a central role in both fundamental insights and practical applications in modern quantum physics. Here, we develop a geometrical framework for this gap by introducing the notion of semi-classical geometric tensor (SCGT). We relate this quantity to the quantum geometric tensor (QGT), whose real part equals the QFIM. We prove the matrix inequality between QGT and SCGT, which sharpens the standard inequality between QFIM and CFIM and provides novel multiparameter information bounds: the real part of the SCGT reproduces the CFIM plus an additional nonnegative contribution capturing quantum obstruction. This further motivates a natural extension of the Berry phase to the semi-classical setting.</p>

            <h2>Laser-induced spectral diffusion and excited-state mixing of silicon T centres</h2>

            <p>To find practical application as photon sources for entangled optical resource states or as spin-photon interfaces in entangled networks, semiconductor emitters must produce indistinguishable photons with high efficiency and spectral stability. Nanophotonic cavity integration increases efficiency and bandwidth, but it also introduces environmental charge instability and spectral diffusion. Among various candidates, silicon colour centres have emerged as compelling platforms for integrated-emitter quantum technologies. Here we investigate the dynamics of spectral wandering in nanophotonics-coupled, individual silicon T centres using spectral correlation measurements. We observe that spectral fluctuations are driven predominantly by the near-infrared excitation laser, consistent with a power-dependent Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, and show that the spectrum is stable for up to 1.5 ms in the dark. We demonstrate a 35x narrowing of the emitter linewidth to 110 MHz using a resonance-check scheme and discuss the advantage for pairwise entanglement rates and optical resource state generators. Finally, we report laser-induced spin-mixing in the excited state and discuss potential mechanisms common to both phenomena. These effects must be considered in calibrating T centre devices for high-performance entanglement generation.</p>
